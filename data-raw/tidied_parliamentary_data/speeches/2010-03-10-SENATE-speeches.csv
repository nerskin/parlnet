"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2010-03-10,"—The Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009 is broadly supported by the coalition. It is a bill that will establish the board of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the position of chief executive officer of what will become known, no doubt, as ACRE. It creates a central body that is aimed at supporting the existing research, development and demonstration of low-emission and renewable energy technologies to improve their competitiveness. We are treating this bill as non-controversial and administrative in nature and we view this approach to coordinating the various renewable energy programs as appropriate and sensible.
The bill contains a number of provisions that relate to the role of the board in advising the minister on the best ways to promote the development, commercialisation and use of emerging renewable technologies. The functions of the board are contained in the bill and include advising the minister on improving existing program delivery, priority areas for government support and the provision of venture capital funding. The board will comprise a chair, the CEO as an ex-officio member of the board, and up to six other members appointed by the minister. The bill requires that the minister ensures that the proposed appointees to the board have knowledge of, or experience in, a field relevant to the functions of the board.
ACRE will consolidate a number of renewable energy programs including the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program and the Geothermal Drilling Program. The government states that ACRE will ‘complement’ the CPRS and the expanded renewable energy target by streamlining the current fragmented administration of renewable energy programs and support. So, while we agree the centre will support the coordination of renewable energy programs, a worthy aim—and it gives me more confidence that these are to be overseen by the Resources and Energy portfolio rather than other, unmentionable, departments—we do not support the tying of this bill in any way to Labor’s now twice failed CPRS, just as we did not support Labor’s attempts to tie their RET legislation to the passage of the CPRS.
In the context of the work that the Centre for Renewable Energy will oversee, an issue of concern for the opposition is the comparatively low level of government support for geothermal energy. While the government likes to talk up the great potential of this emerging energy source there is little evidence that it is prepared to provide the type of support the geothermal sector needs to realise that potential. The Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson MP, had this to say on opening the geothermal project in my home state, on the Limestone Coast, last week:
Geothermal energy is particularly important because of its potential to supply base-load electricity to the Australian grid from a zero-carbon renewable source.  In doing so, it meets our objectives to increase energy security by diversifying energy sources, reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and to supply 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity by 2020 from renewable sources.
I could not disagree with a word of that. The minister has also often repeated Geoscience Australia’s estimates, such as:
... that if we were able to extract just one per cent of Australia’s geothermal energy, it would be equivalent to 26,000 times Australia’s total annual energy consumption.
I think that appropriately demonstrates the potential of geothermal energy. But, considering that great potential and the minister’s preparedness to talk up geothermal, the relatively low level of funding support the government has thus far provided is perplexing.
Last year the government announced its $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative, yet just over $200 million of that funding has been allocated to assisting the geothermal sector. This has included just $50 million to support the all-important geothermal drilling projects and some $153 million to support the development of two geothermal energy plants. By comparison, $2.4 billion was allocated for carbon capture and storage and $1.5 billion for Solar Flagships. The industry advises that the major hurdle to getting geothermal projects off the ground is the all-important proof-of-concept stage. That first stage can cost in the order of $30 million to $40 million per well and, following the GFC, securing initial finance for geothermal drilling is proving extremely difficult. So the clear message to the government is: if it seriously believes in the potential of geothermal energy to provide clean baseload power, it simply has to provide greater levels of support. Without the emergence of major geothermal projects over the coming years the 20 per cent renewable energy target will not be reached.
The need for this government to direct more support towards geothermal is especially acute given Labor’s complete and utter refusal to countenance even a debate about nuclear power in Australia. Here we have the Labor Party proclaiming itself as ‘true believers’ in the theory of global warming and the need to curtail anthropogenic CO2 emissions, yet it is not taking seriously the only two current zero emission sources of baseload power, geothermal and nuclear. Its support for geothermal is relatively paltry and it will not even discuss nuclear power. From our perspective, Labor’s hypocrisy in this matter is truly breathtaking.
When in government, the coalition provided significant support for renewable energy with more than $1 billion of the coalition’s $3.5 billion climate change funding allocated to renewable energy initiatives, including through funding for solar hot water rebates, the Renewable Energy Development Initiative, the Photovoltaic Rebate Program, Solar Cities, the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund and the $25 million to develop renewable energy technology through the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. We established the world’s first mandatory renewable energy target, which stimulated some $3½ billion of investment in renewable energy technologies since its introduction in 2001.
Our climate action spokesman, Mr Greg Hunt MP, worked with the current government to improve the renewable energy target in 2009, including through a full decoupling of the RET from the proposed CPRS, securing appropriate protection for key energy-intensive trade-exposed industries such as aluminium, ensuring protection of existing investment and jobs in the coalmine waste methane power generation industry, providing scope for industries which may be affected by the RET such as food processing, to refer their treatment to the Productivity Commission and tightening of regulations relating to RET eligibility for heat pumps.
Despite the concessions won by the coalition in that matter, we argued then that the RET needed further amendment to ensure that all renewable energy sources could find their place in the renewable energy market. Regrettably, these warnings were ignored by the government and Labor’s mismanagement of the renewable energy target has resulted in market distortions which saw the price of renewable energy certificates collapsing from around $50 to around $30.
In what is now very clearly a short-sighted and cynical political move, the government chose to use renewable energy certificates as a way of offsetting its decision to abruptly end the coalition’s $8,000 solar panel rebate. That has been a major distortion to the market for the certificates. It helped undermine the value of the certificates, putting at risk major new investment in large-scale renewable energy projects, including wind farms. We are pleased that the government has responded to pressure from the coalition, the Greens and the renewable energy sector by proposing major changes to the RET in a bid to restore some balance to the scheme and to provide investment certainty.
For our part, we will closely examine the detail of the government’s proposal to break the RET into two parts—a small-scale renewable energy scheme and a large-scale renewable energy target. Following the debacle of the government’s insulation program, we will need to be satisfied that it has not simply cobbled together another quick fix which could result in further problems such as a significant spike in electricity bills for average Australians. The two-tiered system proposed by the government, from our perspective, has all the hallmarks of a catch-up exercise. It follows the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott MP, that a coalition government will create a band within the renewable energy target to be reserved for large energy renewable projects—the over-50-megawatt projects—or for emerging technologies such as solar fields, geothermal, or tidal and wave projects over 10 megawatts. Clearly, there is some comparison between what the government has proposed and what we had earlier flagged.
Also, as part of our direct action plan to tackle climate change, we announced that a coalition government would introduce a range of initiatives to boost renewable energy use in Australian homes and communities, taking advantage of our abundant natural resources, including through 125 mid-scale solar projects in schools and communities and 25 geothermal or tidal power ‘micro’ projects to be established at appropriate venues.
In conclusion, I confirm that the coalition will support this bill. We see the establishment of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy as a sensible move to provide more cohesion, under the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, for a range of renewable energy programs. But in relation to renewable energy we strongly urge the government to work closely with the coalition to address the current problems with the renewable energy target so that the scheme is sustainable and provides appropriate levels of incentives for investment in the full range of renewable energy sources.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-03-10,"—I rise today to support the establishment of a board for the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy; but, as the chamber is aware, amendments have been circulated and I would draw people’s attention to those. I will discuss those in the course of my speech in the second reading debate on this bill, the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. Renewable energy is something that the Greens are passionate about. It is very clear that we need to make a transformation to a low carbon and then zero carbon economy as quickly as possible. One of the main drivers for that will be not only reducing demand for energy through energy efficiency but also creating additional supply.
I am interested in the remarks from Senator Minchin with regard to the renewable energy target. I regret that all the problems that have subsequently occurred with the renewable energy target were flagged by me in this parliament when the legislation went through. I moved amendments to address them at the time, to move the certificates generated by solar hot water heat pumps and the multiplier on top of the target, but they were not supported by the coalition or the government. All of the problems that I foreshadowed have occurred. Whilst I do support the government finally acting to improve the renewable energy target, I am concerned. I do not support a banding approach because it is essentially a restrictive approach. It will restrict the technologies, the large-scale new technologies, especially if they do not come on stream in time. It will restrict the whole process.
The Greens have argued that we need a gross feed-in tariff on top of a renewable energy target so that there is support for geothermal, for wave energy, for large-scale solar and so on. We need all of those things. We need a renewable energy target which will support wind and we need to have an energy efficiency target so that we can take out all the energy efficiency technologies and put those in a parallel scheme. But we also need a targeted gross national feed-in tariff with separate tariff ranges for all the new and emerging technologies—in particular solar, thermal, geothermal and wave power.
I would agree with Senator Minchin’s remarks in relation to geothermal. These large-scale new technologies which are more expensive than wind are not supported, and they will not be supported under the current regimes as far as I can see. I will be watching that very closely. I would urge the coalition to think again about supporting the Greens’ gross national feed-in tariff regime so that we can bring on some of these new technologies. They are more expensive than wind; I acknowledge that. But we are not going to bring them on unless we organise a regime that supports them and gives certainty to investors in those fields over a long period of time, and that certainty will come from a feed-in tariff because it is not going to be reliant on ad hoc government subsidies which can stop and start and be turned on and off like a tap.
I come to the issue of the board for the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. The key issue is that there is a bias and a hostility across the energy sector to renewable energy, particularly intermittent supply. There is hostility and has been for a long time. When you get together people who have been involved in the traditional energy sector, they will all stand up and go on and on saying: ‘You have to have coal. You have to have nuclear as baseload supply.’ They have no notional view about distributed energy, about intelligent grids or about managing a whole range of renewables. When I think about what is going on in Europe at the moment with the establishment of a renewable energy grid across nine countries, I just think it is light years ahead of where we are here in Australia. We are not going to get that kind of forward thinking unless we get people who are supportive of renewable energy on the board of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy.
We are not going to get that unless that board is independent of the government. The minister, Martin Ferguson, does not believe in renewable energy. It is very clear that the remarks he makes are gestures in the field. There is no commitment from the government or from the minister. In fact, he is far more enthusiastic about the expansion of Olympic Dam and the uranium mining there. He is far more excited about liquefying coal as a transport fuel, and carbon capture and storage, which everybody knows is a pipe dream. He is much more enthusiastic about those than he has ever been about renewable energy, and that is reflected in the amount of money that is spent by this government in carbon capture and storage, and supporting oil and gas exploration, the old forms of energy, rather than looking at systemic whole-of-government coordinated approaches to the rollout of energy efficiency and renewables.
It is not well known in the Australian community that there is currently an interim board for the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. Why am I concerned? I will tell you why: because of the current make-up of this interim board, because as I understand it the interim board is going to be the board once this legislation is passed. I would like Minister Carr, in responding, to confirm whether or not it is the case that the current interim board will become the permanent board. Or, what will be the process for selection? The interim board currently consists of Graeme Hunt, who is the chair. He is a minerals and energy consultant and he formerly headed up BHP-Billiton’s operations in South Australia and was in charge of the expansion of Olympic Dam. Isn’t that great! We have someone who is a competitor to renewable energy—that is, the uranium sector, the whole nuclear sector—on the interim board of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. Why would I have any confidence at all that we would have a board enthusiastic about going to distributed systems, about managing intermittent supply and so on, when we have someone there at the moment who was in charge of the expansion of Olympic Dam?
Then we go to a few of the others on the board. Let me talk about Ms Emma Stein, who is on that interim board. She works as a non-executive board director, mainly in the energy, oil and gas utilities and infrastructure sector. So she is a traditional energy person. I have absolutely no doubt that she has very fine skills in that regard. But this is a board overseeing renewable energy. What expertise does she have in that particular field? There is Mr Errol Talbot, as well. Let me talk about Mr John Ryan for a moment. He is currently a member of the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program investment assessment panel as well as being a member of the Renewable Energy Development Program fund committee. But he received his Public Service Medal for his work on the Prime Minister’s task force into the development of uranium mining and nuclear energy in Australia—another one from the nuclear sector on the interim board for the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy.
There are others, of course. I would have to acknowledge Dr John Wright, who is on the interim board. He has got expertise in this field. According to several of his recent speeches he at least has some expertise in the matter. I look at Professor Mary O’Kane. Again, she has laudable skills. She is a former Vice-Chancellor at the University of Adelaide and so on. She has been a board director. I absolutely do not question her skills in that regard, but I do in terms of her expertise on renewable energy.
Why do I say that is so important for people on the board of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy? Because they are charged to oversee the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, which looks at the technical and economic viability of renewable energy technologies for power generation through large-scale installations, support for the development of a range of renewable energy technologies for power generation, en-hance-ment of Australia’s international leader-ship in renewable energy technology for power generation and attraction of private sector investment in renewable energy power generation. These are the people who are going to make decisions about applications for the money that is being distributed under this scheme. People who have no expertise in these technologies are going to be put in charge of overseeing the disbursement of funds for those project applications. That is unacceptable. It is why we have had failure after failure across the renewable energy sector in getting projects up. Consistently, the people who are appointed to government boards by governments effectively do not have expertise in the technologies they are set to oversee or, worse still, are actually hostile to or competitors of those technologies.
Why do I say that? Let me get to some of the other boards we have had in recent times, such as that of the Solar Flagships program. Martin Ferguson, the Minister for Resources and Energy, announced the seven-member Solar Flagships Council to assess the Solar Flagships program in February 2010. Dr Jenny Purdie, who joined Rio Tinto Alcan, is the General Manager of its business improvement technology for the Pacific. She is the Smelter Operations Manager at Comalco. There is also Kathy Hirschfeld, who is Managing Director and Refinery Manager of BP’s Bulwer Island refinery, and so on. And there are people like Mark Twidell who have expertise in the solar industry and Antony Cohen, who is the Chief Financial Officer of Better Place, which has a distributed notional view on transport but has nothing to do with large-scale solar power—but at least it is in the fields of understanding innovation in the sector. The rest are traditional energy people, including Mike Vertigan, who oversaw Basslink.
I do not dispute that these people have expertise in energy, but we are talking about the development of a new field. We are talking about investment in Australia and a vision for renewable energy, for distributed energy. We are talking about a vision for large-scale renewables, which will require intelligent grids to link up intermittent supply. These people have no expertise in that field, and they are the ones who are going to be making the decisions over Solar Flagships. Exactly the same thing happened with the energy white paper. You would think that if an energy white paper was under development it might include expertise in renewables if the future is in a low carbon or zero carbon economy. But, when I go to the committee looking at developing the white paper, who do I find on it? Representatives from Shell, BHP’s uranium division, Santos, Woodside, Rio Tinto, Origin, AGL, Xstrata, the Energy Supply Association of Australia and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. Of the non-fossil-fuel representatives, there are the Australian Energy Market Operator; the Chair and Deputy Secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, Drew Clarke; the Secretary of the Victorian Department of Primary Industries; the PM’s National Security Adviser; and the CSIRO’s CEO, Megan Clark.
The point I make here is: where, apart from government appointees—people directly under government control in ministerial offices of an energy market operator—are the experts in the field of renewables, particularly large-scale renewables and new technologies? Where are they in the development of the white paper? People afterwards will ask, ‘What is the rationale for decisions that are being made under an energy white paper? What is the rationale for decisions about where the money is going to be disbursed under the Solar Flagships program?’ People equally are going to ask, ‘What is the rationale for the disbursement of funds under the programs that this Australian Centre for Renewable Energy is going to oversee?’ That is my point and that is why I, on behalf of the Greens, am moving two amendments, one of which says that the advice that the board provides to the minister must be tabled in the parliament so that we get to see what this board is recommending to the minister. That is fair given that this board is supposedly independent. The explanatory memorandum says that this board will be independent. If it is independent, what is it doing having the secretary of the department appoint the CEO, having the minister then appoint the members of the board and having the board served by staff who will be employees of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism?
Here we have a supposedly independent body under the Minister for Resources and Energy with a CEO who is an ex-officio member and up to six other members who are appointed by the minister based on their knowledge or experience in fields relevant to the ACRE board functions. Please, let us have some people on the board who have skills relevant to this field; otherwise, we will have the mess we have had across the sectors, with the industry asking, ‘Why weren’t we consulted? Why doesn’t the government actually understand what the industry needs?’ This has been a problem with the Solar Flagships program throughout. ‘When is the department going to talk to us? When are people going to listen?’ The same has happened with the renewable energy target. Industry has been saying from the start that these problems would occur, and the government would not listen, and now they are expecting the Australian people to believe that a minister with a track record of totally and absolutely slavishly adhering to and promoting a fossil fuel economy is going to appoint to this board people who are genuinely expert in the field when we have an interim board made up of people who do not have expertise in the field and in some cases have expertise in a competitive field or are hostile to the technologies they are meant to be overseeing. You could almost say that it was designed to fail.
That is why the Greens will be proposing a second amendment. The first will provide that the advice of the board be tabled so that people know what the board is advising the minister and then what the minister does will be transparent—it will be apparent if the advice of the board is changed or ignored. At least we will know what advice the board has given and the rationale for it.
The second thing the Greens are suggesting is that it is completely inappropriate for this to be described as an independent board when we have the secretary of the department appointing the CEO from the department and the minister appointing the board. That is not independent. We want this to be a statutory authority; we want it to be independent. We say that, as is the case now, if you have a statutory authority the appointment of the CEO should be made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the minister. At least there would be a genuine separation of powers going on. All we have here is Martin Ferguson and the government establishing very clear lines of contacts through the CEO and the appointment of the board to make sure that the pet projects of those board members and/or the government get up. There will be no independence and no capacity to scrutinise what is happening on that board.
This is a very serious issue because it is a crucial point in the development of renewable energy in Australia. I will be very disappointed if the coalition does not support these amendments, because they are designed for transparency. They are designed to make sure that we have an independent authority, as the government says it is supposed to be. It is also important that the people involved in the development of new technologies—those involved in putting in project applications for government funding—have some assurance that the people who are overseeing the process actually (a) are interested in the technology, (b) are not hostile to it and (c) may even have some expertise in the field over which they are making decisions about disbursement of funds. How absolutely disheartening for people with expertise, innovation and exciting ideas to put their projects forward and be judged by somebody with no expertise in the field and, furthermore, an interest in nuclear or old fossil fuel style technology who is determined that the new field will not work. I urge the Senate to support the amendments that I will be moving.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2010-03-10,"—I rise to offer some brief remarks on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. It is becoming increasingly clear that a combination of technologies is required to ensure Australia’s energy security, and that is what the bill before us today aims to achieve. The partnering of renewable energy with clean coal and gas technologies is a key to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. This strategy has clear added benefits for the national electricity market, industry development and community access.
On the issue of human induced climate change, those opposite agree it exists when convenient but deny its ramifications when politically expedient. They would have us believe that the scientific consensus is wrong. Indeed, Senator Minchin has linked climate change to some sort of sinister plot. On Four Corners recently he said that climate change:
For the extreme left … provides the opportunity to do what they’ve always wanted to do, to sort of de-industrialise the western world. You know the collapse of communism was a disaster for the left … and really they embraced environmentalism as their new religion.
This attitude is an attempt to hoodwink the electorate—to incite fear by pressing the old fear button. But I put it to you that the electorate knows better. The fostering and promotion of renewable energy strategies will not de-industrialise the Western world. The Rudd government intends to enable the harnessing of solar, wind and geothermal energy, of which we clearly have in abundance, for the benefit of the environment, the economy and the community. It is that simple.
In my own state of South Australia, we know that renewable energy is the way forward. We have proactively fostered working initiatives such as hot fractured rock geothermal exploration, solar energy in schools and other public buildings, including Parliament House, wind technology, tree planting, the plastic bag ban, feed-in tariff mechanisms and a highly successful refund-of-deposit plan for plastic bottles and aluminium cans.
The South Australian government’s geothermal regulatory and approvals framework, pursuant to the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act, proclaimed in 2000, has been extraordinary in its outcomes to date. South Australia has attracted more than 58 per cent of geothermal investment in Australia for the period 2002 to 2013. Because these projects cover diverse geological provinces, testing is occurring over a range of potential sources of energy. Major petroleum exploration and production companies are involved, and the share market shows strong support. The implications are clear. This technology will enable us to reduce emissions, better adapt to the changing climate and deal with the changes that the future will undoubtedly bring in terms of carbon constrained economic settings.
On a more local level, our fiercely hot and dry environment has seen a revival of the backyard rainwater tanks so much a feature of South Australian homes in the past. Many feed into laundries and bathrooms, conserving precious drinking water; some serve the water needs of whole households. Meanwhile, greywater keeps gardens green.
All these initiatives and projects, from major corporate and government investment in geothermal exploration in the Cooper Basin and elsewhere to the commitment of individual householders to water conservation and reuse, help to husband our resources and maintain our increasingly fragile environment. The rationale for these initiatives, big and small, is as clear as it is urgent. Renewable energies are far from the margins of power generation technologies, as Professor Ian Lowe AO, Emeritus Professor of Science, Technology and Society at Griffith University in Brisbane and adjunct professor at Adelaide’s own Flinders University and the Sunshine Coast has noted. According to Professor Lowe, three-quarters of Iceland’s, half of Norway’s and a quarter of the installed energy capacity of California are powered by renewable energy. Worldwide, related industries employ almost two million people, while grid-connected solar energy is growing by 60 per cent every year. Just imagine the impact on employment potentialities in our cities and more particularly in our regions, not to mention more competitive prices for cleaner power in those cities and regional areas.
As we speak, America and Spain are developing solar thermal power plants to generate electricity. Japan and Germany, which also invests in significant wind energy technology, have made great strides with solar technology, too. In Israel, solar hot water is mandatory. In Denmark, which is smaller than Tasmania, 5,000 wind turbines have been erected. Australia, the hottest and the driest continent on earth, with its astonishing scope of solar, wind, water and geothermal resources, has been left behind. In Australia, only eight per cent of electricity is presently sourced from renewable energy—less than the 10 per cent so sourced in 1997—due to the manifest indifference of the Howard government and the interests it represented. But while those opposite flail around, take the course of greatest expediency and bicker among themselves about the existence of human-induced climate change, we in South Australia are right behind the federal Labor government in its determination to get on with the job right across the country. The benefits are evident, and it is the generations to come who will reap those benefits if we act now.
The establishment of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, known as ACRE, is a crucial element in achieving our aim. As my colleague Senator Stephens said in this place late last year:
It is clear that there needs to be a more coordinated focus on renewable energy technology support. That is why the Government is establishing ACRE.
She went on to say that its:
… objectives will be to promote the development, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy and enabling technologies and to improve their competitiveness.
With these objectives in mind, I now turn specifically to theAustralian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. The bill defines renewable energy technologies as ‘technologies where the energy is generated from natural resources and which can be constantly replenished.’ Renewable energy technologies include ‘enabling technologies’. Which are ‘those technologies that enable renewable energy technologies to function more effectively within an electricity grid.’ The bill establishes the board of ACRE and the position of its chief executive officer. The board will comprise a range of experts in research, intellectual property, venture capital, science and engineering, commercialisation and other areas whose tasks will be to advise the government about how to support key energy and enabling technologies right down the innovation continuum.
The board’s functions will also include devising and implementing strategies to promote and fund renewable energy technologies; the funding of selected projects and measures; the improvement of current program delivery and the management of new programs; venture capital funding; the targeting of priority areas for government support; and other functions as the minister directs in writing. Not only will the board assess projects and measures referred to it by the government for consideration it will also foster existing links with state and territory government agencies and the private sector and establish fresh links with these with the intention of devising new ways to stimulate investment in the area. A statutory advisory board, ACRE will provide independent advice and adhere to the standards of probity, ethics and governance which are so much a hallmark of the Rudd Labor government.
As I have said, the bill establishes the position of ACRE’s chief executive officer. This position will recruit the leadership team for the organisation. The chief executive officer will be a senior executive officer of the Department of Resources and Energy. The bill also covers matters including ACRE’s constitution, the appointment of board members, remuneration, declarations of conflict of interest, the term and termination of appointments and so forth as well as voting, the conduct of meetings and related matters. The attributes, structures and functions of the board will be capable of amendment or abolition only by the parliament, and ACRE will report annually to the minister.
In closing, I stress that is the Rudd Labor government that has demonstrated the vision our country needs right now to take advantage of our unparalleled renewable natural resources; the Rudd government that has established the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative; the Rudd government that has enacted the renewable energy target legislation; and the Rudd government that will establish ACRE and through that body lead a more effective application of policy and foster the development of innovative renewable energy, with its enabling technologies, for the benefit of the environment, the economy and the community. For the future wellbeing of all Australians, I commend the bill and wish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy every success.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-03-10,"—I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to the discussion on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009, which establishes the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy as a key national body responsible for the delivery of renewable energy technology support. I acknowledge the bipartisan approach that the coalition has taken in respect of this bill. However, I would like to respond to Senator Minchin’s comments with regard to government support for the geothermal industry. I am advised that this government has provided the geothermal industry with direct support in excess of $200 million to accelerate the development and deployment in Australia of geothermal technologies. This funding contributes to a total investment in the sector of now in excess of $720 million. The support has been provided in a manner to give the industry the opportunity to prove its technological viability on a commercial scale. I believe this to be a major contribution to the diversity of energy supplies in this country.
As for Senator Milne’s comments in regard to the approach that the government is taking on the establishment of this new national body, I indicate it is a disappointment to the government that Senator Milne chose to delay the passage of this bill by refusing to grant non-controversial status to the legislation last year. It is a disappointment to the government that the Greens take a position of seeking to block government legislation that would actually improve the capacity of this country to deal with environmental challenges. We have seen that in regard to the CPRS legislation, where effectively the Greens have voted with the coalition to block that legislation. It is a disappointment to me that, in regard to these particular measures before us, the Greens are seeking to argue a tendentious political point, on the one hand saying they support renewable energy deployment while on the other seeking to place obstacles in the way of the government as it tries to see that that actually happens. I would like to deal with the specifics of Senator Milne’s amendments in the committee stage of the bill. I indicate to the Senate that the government will not be supporting those amendments. I understand that Senator Milne will be seeking to move them together to allow us to debate them in a cognate manner. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2010-03-10,"—In relation to the second reading debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009, pursuant to a contingent notice standing in my name, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving that further consideration of the bill be made an order of the day for five sitting days after the government response to the National Broadband Network Implementation Study is laid on the table.
In speaking to that motion I note that the government has had significant notice of this matter. In seeking the suspension of standing orders we are asking that the Senate be allowed to consider the urgency of this bill before the second reading debate commences. In our view this will allow full and detailed debate about the urgency of this bill and more detailed consideration of the government’s claims that this bill should be considered before its response to the NBN implementation study.
It is the coalition’s view that this bill is entirely related to the NBN. The NBN is mentioned some 150 times in the explanatory memorandum and in the second reading speech. Therefore, we do not believe that this bill should be considered in advance of the NBN implementation study. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, whom we make welcome in the chamber, has, frankly, used the guise of the NBN study to avoid providing the Senate with any detail whatsoever about his proposed broadband network. According to the minister, the implementation study will determine how much consumers will pay for services, which areas will be covered by fibre, the share structure of the company that operates the NBN, the total taxpayer contribution, when the rollout will commence and how long it is going to take. He refuses to provide any detail on these aspects in advance of the implementation study, but he now expects the Senate to support a bill—a quite radical and far-reaching bill—that is intrinsically connected to the NBN and, frankly, would not be here in the absence of the NBN and the conclusions of the implementation study, which is costing taxpayers some $25 million. We were told that that study would be delivered to us last month. The implementation study in and of itself will no doubt make recommendations about other legislative amendments to support the rollout of this NBN.
As we have said consistently throughout this debate, the bill is intrinsically linked to the NBN. It is, frankly, about blackmailing Telstra to cooperate with the NBN. As we know, the only way the NBN will ever be viable is through this avenue. It is evident throughout the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech and is consistent with everything that the minister has been saying since this bill was introduced. It has only been since the minister realised that the Senate’s return to order for the production of documents could have an impact on his plans to force Telstra’s breakup that he has all of a sudden changed his tune and tried to claim that this bill has absolutely nothing to do with the NBN, which only he would believe. He should have thought of that before he crafted a bill which is based on a discussion paper about the NBN and before he framed the entire debate about this bill in the context of the NBN.
As David Forman, no great friend of the coalition but CEO of the Competitive Carriers’ Coalition, told the Senate inquiry into the legislation:
If you suggested to me that the NBN was likely to succeed in the absence of this legislation, I would suggest that that is a pretty big bet.
Those are very accurate words.
Labor’s attack on Telstra is a form of legislative blackmail that we believe can only be seen as an admission that its new NBN policy cannot be implemented without effectively renationalising Telstra’s fixed line network. Labor cannot afford to have its NBN compete with Telstra. It wants its NBN to be a majority government owned monopoly and this legislation is aimed at forcing Telstra to participate, even though it has indicated it is in good-faith negotiations with the government. I would urge the Senate to support the suspension so that a thorough debate about the urgency of this bill can occur before we commence the second reading debate. Nothing in this bill is urgent. The consumer measures do not commence until 1 July 2010, so this bill can be dealt with in the next session of the parliament. The appropriate time for the Senate to consider these matters is when we have some more certainty about the NBN rollout and after the government has tabled its response to the $25 million NBN implementation study. Until that study is completed and the government response is tabled, we in the Senate should not be asked to consider the structure of the telecommunications sector going forward, which is what this bill is all about when the government states that the structure will be altered by the decisions relating to the NBN. So I do urge the Senate to support this suspension so a full debate can proceed about the timing for the consideration of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-03-10,"—The government does not support Senator Minchin’s proposal to suspend standing orders. How many bites of the cherry can you have? The Senate has already voted to allow this bill to proceed. But this is nothing new. After 11½ years of doing nothing and 18 failed broadband plans, those opposite have spent the last 2½ years avoiding having a policy in this sector. There is a good reason why they have been avoiding having a policy; it is because they have not got one. We had Senator Minchin in charge of this portfolio for nearly 18 months. There were 180 press releases and not a policy in sight because he has not moved from his sycophantic position of doing whatever Telstra asks. That is what the previous government’s position was and that is what the position of the current opposition is—‘Whatever Telstra and Sol Trujillo tell me to do, that is what I will do.’ Nothing has changed.
This country has suffered. This country has fallen behind the rest of the world. This country has fallen behind our near neigh-bours. Our children are getting a worse education. Our health sector could be massively improved if we had decent broadband infrastructure in this country. This opposition has sought to delay at every stage. They are exposed as being a pack of frauds when it comes to wanting to deliver a broadband policy. They do not have one and we are seeing yet again an attempt to delay, obfuscate and obstruct. This is an opposition that blocked 41 bills last year, which is the record. There have been 110 years of this parliament and they set the record for blocking bills last year.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—We have certainly pulled at a scab there. They are trying to pretend that they have accepted in some way the result of the last election. Get over it. You lost the last election and you are not in government. Let this government govern. Scrutinise and suggest amendments; that is fair. But you have opposed 41 bills, which is a record. Senator Minchin says it is not urgent, but that is what he said six months ago and what he said three months ago. With this bill due to be enacted on 1 July this year he is still suggesting that it should be held over because he believes that the implementation study is relevant to this bill. The implementation study is about the ongoing business plan for NBN Co.
—What business plan?
—You will be wiping the egg off your face soon enough, Senator Back. This bill is about the structure of the telecommunications sector. Many of those opposite privately support the structural separation of Telstra, but they are led by the dinosaur Luddite at the front table who is just clinging to his legacy where he helped to introduce a privatised monopoly, the world’s most vertically integrated monopoly, with almost no regulation just so he could fool a few shareholders by pumping up the dividend stream and look after the sale of Telstra. He had no policy about the future of the telecommunications sector and no policies about what was best for consumers. It was simply about what Senator Minchin could hang on his wall and say, ‘I flogged off Telstra; look how much I got for it.’ That is all he is defending. He has no policy position on the future structure of the telecommunications sector. Put aside that Senator Minchin’s own bill said, ‘Let’s have a review two years after privatisation.’ Guess what? It is two years hence. The government has decided that we believe this is the best structure for the future benefit of Australians and for the future benefit of all telecommunications consumers. Those opposite should be exposed as the frauds and charlatans they are. They have not had a broadband policy for 13 years and they are standing here as the emperor with no clothes. Their sole achievement was to flog off Telstra for as much as they could get for it.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Before we go to you, Senator Ludlam, I would remind senators that all interjections are disorderly but, if you are going to be disorderly, you have got to go back to your own seat.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-03-10,"—This is quite clearly a rerun of the debate that we had late last year when we were discussing whether or not the government would hand over the documents that were produced in the course of the original RFP going back nearly two years now. There was a debate and a lot of argy-bargy at the time about whether those bills were relevant to the Telstra debates or not, or whether they were more strictly relevant to the NBN debate when we finally get to that at some stage.
I remind the chamber that at that time the government eventually established a Senate inquiry into these kinds of deadlocks—when the Senate orders production of documents and the executive says, ‘No, you can’t have them; you’ll just have to trust that we’re withholding them in the public interest.’ The government came back with an incredibly unsatisfactory position on that, joining with the opposition. At no stage since then have we seen the original RFP documents that were produced in the course of the government assessing whether or not it would proceed with its original intentions or go with an NBN project 10 times the scale.
At the time, however, the Senate agreed that the Telstra debate could proceed. That debate was originally scheduled for October and now, in early March, the debate still has not gone ahead. The government is negotiating with Telstra behind the scenes, with no checks and balances whatsoever, no role for any other party and no public scrutiny. I and many people in the industry believe that at some point we are going to be presented with a fait accompli. The debate on the Telstra bill may become redundant if it is delayed for too much longer.
Senator Minchin, who moved the procedural motion today which would effectively block any further debate on the Telstra bill until the implementation study is handed over, has a very strong point. The government last year, in many comments during Senate estimates hearings and at other times, answered any questions relating to the NBN, or indeed this debate, with, ‘Wait till you see the implementation study; all the answers will be in there.’ We were informed last year, and again a couple of weeks ago, that the minister alone will decide whether or not that implementation is ever made public. My understanding is that they have received it, they are reading it and they are making their minds up as to whether or not it will be provided to the parliament. Of course they should provide it to the parliament—it should have been provided to the parliament at the same time it was provided to the government—if they are expecting us to assess a public commitment to the NBN of upwards of $20 billion.
We do not support this further attempt to block debate of the Telstra bill. I believe that this is all a delaying tactic. The implementation study should absolutely be tabled. We will be moving an order for the production of documents this afternoon to ensure that the study is tabled in full and that that information is provided to the public and the rest of the industry so that we can get an idea of what we are actually assessing and what we are going to be expected to debate when we get to the NBN bills.
However, I am not persuaded that the implementation study is essential to proceed with the Telstra debate. We have been ready to proceed with this debate since last October. We will not be supporting this motion. We will, however, be looking forward to coalition support for an order for the production of documents so that the implementation study is provided and put in the public domain, where it firmly belongs. But I do not support that should being used as a delaying tactic to continue to put off the debate on Telstra, which I believe we should have had—whatever you believe about the merits of the bill itself—late last year, not in March.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-03-10,"—I rise in support of Senator Minchin’s motion. It is incredible to expect that the Senate is going to consider quite an important structural issue for Telstra without the key ingredient, the study. The study needs to be tabled for us to consider properly the implications of the legislation that Senator Conroy insists he wants to discuss. Senator Conroy has had the opportunity on a lot of earlier occasions to introduce this legislation and he has failed to do so. It is typical of the mismanagement of the agenda by the government throughout this entire term of parliament.
It would be no surprise to those listening and those who read Hansard that the mismanagement of the program has been raised by us, by the minor parties and by the Independents on numerous occasions. It highlights the inadequacy of the number of sitting weeks that this chamber has been forced to again this year, after we have indicated to the Senate on countless occasions that the government needs to set a sitting agenda well in advance. We are on the record for the past two years saying: ‘Set the calendar early. Have a sufficient number of sitting weeks, not the minimal number we have this year and also had last year.’ Last year and this year we have the lowest number of sitting weeks outside an election period since the Second World War. It is atrocious. The legislation keeps building up. Senator Conroy wants his legislation through the Senate. He wants it discussed in a timely manner, yet he cannot organise the program. He cannot convince his colleagues to have sufficient sitting weeks in the year to consider these matters.
Worst of all is that Senator Conroy will not let us see a report which millions of dollars have been spent on and which is really at the core of this issue. It is a simple request. I think when members of the public look at this they will wonder why a government has decided to introduce legislation which has a major implementation study and not to table that study. Does the government have something to hide? Has the government realised that this implementation study might not necessarily have supporting comments for the government? All we need is simply to see that implementation study. That will assist the Senate with its deliberations.
For those reasons, for the reasons articulated by Senator Minchin and for some of the reasons that Senator Ludlam and the Greens have articulated—I am surprised we do not have more concrete support for this motion—it is important that we do not consider this bill until such time as the study has been presented and tabled. It is just logical. Why have a study at all if it is not going to be used in the deliberation about the legislation? That does not make sense.
—You’re a hypocrite. You’ve announced you’re voting against the bill; it doesn’t matter what’s in the study.
—Senator Conroy needs to table the study. Once the study is tabled, we can have due consideration of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-03-10,"—I also rise in support of the motion moved by our leader, Senator Minchin. This is an extraordinarily secretive government. This is a government that was elected on the promise of increased accountability and transparency. Everything was going to change on the election of the Rudd Labor government. Instead what we have experienced again and again is secretive government. I have experienced it myself as the chair of the Select Committee on Fuel and Energy. You would know very well, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, how for months and months we were trying to get hold of a copy of modelling that had been commissioned by the government and was held by the Treasury. We were wanting to get access to some information that was critically important for us to scrutinise the government’s flawed emissions trading scheme.
Now here is yet another example. Here is Minister Conroy completely mismanaging his portfolio. In fact, if I were Minister Conroy I would start worrying about the shadow of Greg Combet coming in from behind. Look at the track record of this government in the communications portfolio. The shadow of Greg Combet I can see is starting to worry the minister. Look at him.
—You should worry about your tie.
—Here we have got a $43 billion plan for the National Broadband Network, and when I say plan I am being very generous, because all we had was a couple of dot points on the back of a beer coaster. As the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Senator Conroy were supping in the Air Force jet flying somewhere between Washington and Perth perhaps—no, the Prime Minister does not spend much time in Perth. Perth is a place that the Prime Minister has not really discovered on his map yet. But here was Minister Conroy supping with the Prime Minister and he only had a beer coaster to write up a few dot points on how they would roll out this $43 billion plan for the National Broadband Network.
It is critically important, as the minister has said, that we properly scrutinise this legislation. The National Broadband Network implementation study is a key ingredient for us to do our job in this Senate. Of course we should delay further consideration of this legislation until the government has finally come clean with the report that the minister clearly is desperate to keep secret. What has the minister got to hide, I would ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President? If the minister was so keen to get this legislation progressed, if he was genuinely interested in getting this legislation progressed, he would have by now complied with the request that has been put forward by the Senate on a number of occasions. Maybe it is part of the minister’s secret plan to actually delay this legislation further. Maybe he is sitting on this implementation study because it suits his purposes to slow the continuation of this legislation through the Senate. Who knows what the minister’s true intentions are.
What I want to place on record is that this is an incredibly secretive government and the Australian people should be very concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability that again and again is demonstrated by this government. We have seen it when they kept secret the studies and the underlying information to the economic modelling on Labor’s flawed ETS and we see it again here. Labor expect the Senate and the Australian people to take them on trust even though again and again they have demonstrated that we cannot take them on trust. We are quite right and we urge the Senate to follow our recommendation that this legislation should not be further considered.
—Pull your socks up, Stephen.
—His tie is in his socks.
—The minister can sit there and laugh and not take it seriously. Matters of accountability and transparency are obviously not very important for Minister Conroy. I can see that he is very amused by this debate going on at present. But I say it again, as I said before: this government was elected on a promise of increased accountability and increased transparency. We think that the government should actually start to follow their words with action. This government is all talk and no action. If this government was serious about increasing accountability and transparency in government, if it was serious about open government, it would support the call that has been made again and again by the Senate and table the National Broadband Network implementation study.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-03-10,"—The mockery, derision and jokes from the other side of the chamber really underline their approach to an issue that is going to affect 1.4 million Telstra shareholders and 22 million Australians. It goes to the very heart of the competence of this minister. If you look at his management track record, he is meant to be a right-wing factional boss from Victoria and he was so incompetent that he had to merge it with the hard extreme Socialist left faction in Victoria and now plays second fiddle to his mentor, Kim Carr. You are a second-fiddle minister. There is no doubt about that and we know it, because your handling of this affair has been appalling and abominable. Whilst we are talking about this and sticking up for the people of Australia, you are there making jokes and laughing about people’s ties. You need to pull your socks up because you have failed at the most basic level of supplying the appropriate information so that this Senate can decide and discuss and debate this very important legislation. That, might I say, was cobbled together on the back of an envelope to spend $43 billion. You and your mentor, Kim Carr—no, he was not there, it was your other uber-boss, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd—between complaining about air dryers and sandwiches, you and he came up with a plan for a $43 billion tax spend that you have not even got prepared. You are not even prepared to table the implementation study.
At any level, putting aside your disgraceful partisan politics in this, you can only consider the Australian people would turn more from their government when they are going to spend $43 billion of taxpayer funds. They are going to try and offload half of that commitment to an unsuspecting telecommunications industry, and they have not even got the gumption to tell us who is going to miss out, where it is going to start and who is going to be included in this timeframe. They want us to decide on this important legislation without the adequate consideration of the documents and the information that the government has brought to their attention. The question can only be why. What are they trying to hide? Are they trying to cover something up? It is a reasonable series of questions the Australian people deserve to know the answers to. And when those questions are put to the minister, what do we get? More derision, more guffawing at the impertinence of those on the other side to question the very fabric of this minister’s intentions.
I have a concern: after wasting $30 million on their first tender process, which failed, and now spending a further $25 million dollars on an implementation study, which they are not prepared to share with the Australian people or the opposition parties, who are expected to hold a government to account, this government is trying to hide from the light of scrutiny. They are like cockroaches under a fridge—when you move the fridge, the cockroaches scurry everywhere. There is one master cockroach and we all know who that is, and there are junior cockroaches. We have an example of one in Minister Conroy. I do not like to cast aspersions but he is scurrying from the light of day, he is scurrying from scrutiny and transparency. He knows that his policies are deeply and desperately unpopular, not just with the Australian people but on his own side as well. We know that because this man wants to spend billions and billions of taxpayer funds on a broadband system but he will not tell us where it is going to start, where it is going to finish, who is going to miss out and how it is going to work. He is not prepared to tell us that and he is going to spend tens of millions of dollars trying to slow the internet down by filtering, which I know is deeply unpopular. He is facing a lot of grief from Senator Lundy and others who are rebelling against him. We will see how this goes.
It is an extraordinary minister who is so unconfident in his own ministerial portfolio that he is not prepared to put forward the documents which are necessary for a reasonable and rational decision to be made. If we cannot examine the documents, if we cannot make a reasonable assessment on behalf of the Australian people, we have to say no. That is what Senator Minchin’s motion is about—suspending standing orders so that full scrutiny can be applied. (Time expired)

World Kidney Day is a global health awareness campaign focusing on the importance of our kidneys, and on reducing the frequency and impact of kidney disease and its associated health problems worldwide, and
the focus of World Kidney Day is diabetes which, along with high blood pressure are the key risk factors in chronic kidney disease;
recognises the early detection of kidney disease can reduce the risk of complications and thereby dramatically reduce the growing burden of disability and death from chronic renal disease;
acknowledges that Type 2 diabetes is the fastest growing chronic disease in Australia, with on average 1 500 new cases identified every week and nearly one in four Australians having either impaired glucose metabolism or diabetes;
calls attention to the alarmingly high rates of diabetes, high blood pressure and renal disease within Aboriginal Australians, noting:
Aboriginal people are 3.4 times more likely than non-Aboriginal people to have diabetes or pre-diabetes,
the Kimberly population has the 4th highest prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the world,
gestational diabetes is up to 20 per cent higher in the Aboriginal population compared with the non‑Aboriginal population, and
kidney disease is 10 times more likely to occur in Aboriginal people when compared with non-Aboriginal people;
notes the special ecumenical service for renal sufferers being held on 11 March 2010 in Alice Springs in recognition of the anguish experienced by Nura Ward and others like her who must leave their homelands forever to receive dialysis in a city far from their family and culture; and
calls:

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-03-10,"—by leave—I thank the Senate. As the Senate would be aware, some two days ago I was sworn in as the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, adding energy efficiency to my existing portfolio responsibilities. This change recognises the inextricable link between the challenge of becoming more energy efficient and the challenge of tackling climate change. The change also means that the energy efficiency programs previously administered by the Depart-ment of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will now be delivered by the new Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.
One such program for which I am now responsible is the Green Loans Program. This program recognises the public benefit in helping households identify how they can improve their efficiency and reduce their impact on the climate and the environment. There has been strong demand for this. Australians want to do their bit. We should be finding ways to help them. Nevertheless, there have been problems with this program. Given that reality, I have asked my new department for a frank assessment of the program’s status and design. In the meantime, I am conscious of the concerns that have been raised by the community, and by members and senators. I therefore believe it is appropriate to update the Senate on the current situation with the Green Loans Program.
When the Green Loans Program was launched in July 2009, it was intended to have three components aimed at assisting Australian households to improve their energy and water efficiency. The first was a free home sustainability assessment. A trained assessor visits the home and talks with householders about the sustainability of the home and their current practices. The assessor then compiles an assessment report indicating what the householder might do to save energy and water, and to improve their sustainability. The second was a $50 Green Rewards Card for households who had participated in a home sustainability assessment. This was for the purchase of small items to improve efficiency—for example, energy efficient light globes and the like. The third was access to an interest free green loan, for amounts of up to $10,000 over a maximum period of four years.
The experience of the first six months of the Green Loans Program led the government to announce significant changes to the program on 19 February 2010. These were:
An additional 600,000 assessments, on top of the 360,000 assessments already available under the program;
A cap of 5,000 on the number of assessors who would be contracted to deliver household sustainability assessments under the program;
A weekly cap of 15,000 assessment bookings and a daily and weekly cap per assessor of three and five assessments respectively;
Changed booking arrangements such that each booking call to the call centre can only be made by or on behalf of individual assessors; and
Discontinuation of the loans component of the program.
The government began implementing these changes from 19 February 2010. In line with agreements between the government and relevant financial institutions, loans under the program will be discontinued from 22 March 2010.
As I said, there have been a number of problems with this program. It is apparent that the program had a number of design flaws, and that aspects of the program have not been administered to the standard that the government and community expect. Since assuming responsibility for this program, I have put in place an immediate process to fully identify and get to the bottom of these problems. My priority in the coming weeks and months is to deliver on the fundamental policy objective: to provide high-quality, timely and useful sustainability assessments to Australian households. In order to do that, it is important to address the issues with the program—issues that have become evident to me over the past week through the complaints I have heard from households and green loans assessors. I will deal with each of these issues in turn.
Household sustainability assessment reports
First, to the issue of household sustainability assessment reports. As at 28 February 2010, 305,327 home sustainability assessments had been booked and, of these, 210,864 had been completed. This is clearly a very popular element of the program. However, only around 84,000 reports produced as a result of those home sustainability assessments had been sent out to households as at 28 February 2010. There are currently around 100,000 reports that have been submitted to the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts but which had not yet been sent out to households at the time responsibility moved to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. The remaining reports have not yet been submitted to the department by assessors following completion of the home sustainability assessment. The delay in sending reports is unacceptable. Performance, in terms of the time it takes for households to receive their report after having an assessment completed, must be significantly improved. I have asked my department for further advice on what actions can be taken to improve performance in this area.
Number of assessors
Second, to the number of assessors. Currently, there are around 4,000 assessors contracted to the department to conduct home sustainability assessments under the Green Loans Program. The government’s changes to the program on 19 February indicated that the number of assessors to be contracted under the program would be capped at 5,000. For an assessor to be contracted under the program, they must first complete a set training course and seek accreditation through the Association of Building Sustainability Assessors, or ABSA. They can then apply to the department to be contracted to take part in the Green Loans Program.
I am advised that ABSA’s figures indicate that there are approximately 7,500 people, including those already contracted, who have completed assessor training and been accredited with ABSA. I understand ABSA figures estimate approximately a further 1,800 people have completed training but have not been accredited. Clearly, this is a very difficult situation, with more accredited assessors than available contracts. It is a hard fact that there are going to be people who are accredited who will not be contracted under the program.
Payment of assessors
Third, the prompt payment of invoices is another area that has attracted criticism. I understand there are more than 1,500 invoices currently in hand and that work is underway to process those quickly. In line with government requirements, my department will be working toward having all correctly submitted invoices paid within 30 days. I am advised that only a very small percentage of correct invoices received to date from assessors—that is, less than four per cent—have been paid outside the 30-day period. However, it is apparent that many assessors are experiencing delays in payment. It is also clear that part of the problem appears to lie in ensuring that each invoice contains the correct information so it can be processed.
Around 50 per cent of invoices received by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts have been incorrect or incomplete when first submitted, creating delays in payment. This figure, while still too high, is an improvement on earlier figures indicating that around 70 per cent of invoices were incorrect or incomplete when first submitted. The 30-day timeframe for payment applies from the date at which a complete and correct invoice is received.
To address the problems with invoicing, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts developed a template for assessors to use, along with a step-by-step guide to filling in the template. Departmental staff have also been contacting assessors directly if they have submitted an incorrect invoice to explain what needs to be fixed. These practices will continue under my new department. Given the large number of invoices currently on hand and expected in coming weeks, I have asked my department to provide additional resources to ensure that correct invoices are paid within the required timeframes. I have also asked my department to hold discussions with ABSA about how it can assist its members to submit correct invoices.
Green Rewards Cards
Fourth, when the Green Loans Program was rolled out in July 2009, households receiving a home sustainability assessment were eligible for a $50 Green Rewards Card. However, no Green Rewards Cards have been distributed to households to date. I have asked my department to provide further detail on how this might be addressed quickly, and will consider this matter further when I receive that advice.
Applications for green loans
Fifth, there is the issue of the loans themselves. In the first six months of the program there was a low uptake of loans. This was due to a number of factors, including the slowness with which assessment reports were made available to households and a potentially lower appetite to enter into debt in the latter half of last year given the global financial crisis. As at 28 February 2010, participating financial institutions advised that they had received 2,864 applications for green loans and had approved 1,705.
DEWHA has been working, and my department will continue to work, with the financial institutions to assist in processing applications before 22 March 2010, which is the cut-off date for loans to have been approved and contracts signed, in line with the government’s announcement on the discontinuation of this component of the program. I am aware that a number of financial institutions have stopped taking new applications for green loans, instead choosing to focus on processing the loan applications they already have to hand ahead of the 22 March 2010 deadline. As at 28 February, I am advised that all correct invoices received from the financial institutions had been paid.
Hotlines
Sixth, the government understands that there are many households and assessors seeking information on the Green Loans Program at the moment. There are currently two call centres operating for the program. The booking hotline receives bookings for assessments from assessors and households, and provides advice to financial institutions. As at 3 March 2010, the average wait time for the booking centre was less than 10 seconds for all categories of callers, and the maximum wait time was less than two minutes.
A second hotline was established on 20 February to provide information on the changes to the program. On 20 and 21 February, the call centre performed outbound calls to inform assessors of the changes to the program. Since 22 February, the call centre has been receiving inbound calls. The demand for information through the information hotline has been considerable. I understand that the average wait time for callers is down to less than three minutes at this point in time.
The department has also set up a centralised process for dealing with written enquiries, via the ‘contact us’ tab on the green loans website. Unfortunately, due to the volume of written enquiries received, particularly since the program changes were announced, the time taken to respond to these enquiries has been considerable. To give the Senate some sense of the scale of this, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts received more than 7,500 written enquiries over the period 25 February to 9 March 2010—that is significantly more enquiries than were received over the course of several months previously.
I understand that people may be frustrated about the timeliness of responses to email and online queries. I have asked the secretary of my department to consider the need for additional resources in this area to ensure enquiries are responded to within reasonable time frames. I would ask households and assessors to bear with the government as we work through the many outstanding inquiries. The government will endeavour to make information on the program available via the internet, the information line, and via direct communications with assessors as we work through the implementation issues associated with this program.
Household assessments
Seventh, it is important that this program has a stronger compliance and audit component to ensure that assessments have been properly completed. I have asked the secretary to ensure that existing compliance and audit activity for this program is expanded and fast-tracked and that further advice be provided to me on this issue as soon as possible. We have an obligation to ensure that public funds are being used responsibly, and for the intended purpose.
Training standards of assessors
Eighth, there has also been some criticism of the quality of training provided to assessors by training organisations. This is of particular concern to me because it goes to the public confidence in the quality of the assessment reports which households are receiving, and in the program itself. The compliance regime which I have directed the department to expand will be focusing on the quality of assessment reports provided by assessors. This will be important information to help us identify the risk of assessors not meeting their obligations under their contract.
I have also asked my department to provide me with options to assure and improve the professional standard of assessors contracted to the program. Work is already in train to put in place a nationally accredited training module for assessors. The timing of this is subject to Commonwealth and state and territory processes in the training sphere and is likely to be some months away. Because this accredited training module is still some time away, I intend to explore interim mechanisms to improve confidence in assessors’ professional standards as soon as possible.
Next steps
It is obvious, from the information I have provided to the Senate today, that the challenges for the Green Loans Program are many. The government acknowledges these challenges. The problems which exist are not acceptable and that is why I am taking steps to address them. As I have indicated, I have asked my department to provide significant additional resources to:
address the backlog of assessment reports not yet provided to households;
reduce any delay in payment of correct invoices from assessors, and ensure assessors are informed of correct invoicing techniques;
expand and fast-track the compliance regime for the program to ensure quality assessments are being provided;
provide me with advice on interim steps to assure and improve the professional standards of assessors;
provide me with advice regarding the Green Rewards Card; and
further improve customer service standards by ensuring the wait times on telephone hotlines remain as low as possible, and that there is significant improvement in the time taken to respond to email and online enquiries.
These are significant problems to overcome, and they may take some time to address. However, I have made it clear that these problems should be rectified as soon as possible. Addressing these issues is only the beginning of a process of improvement in this area. There are a number of reviews currently underway which will provide additional information to the government on what further action, if any, ought to be taken.
Stakeholder consultation
I will shortly be meeting with representatives from the assessor industry body, ABSA, for the first time to discuss this program. I will also be meeting with assessors to discuss their concerns. I want to signal now that the way in which I intend to address the many problems with this program is to engage fully with its stakeholders. I want to work with them to help resolve these problems.
Reviews underway
I want to turn now, in closing, to a number of reviews which are currently underway in relation to this program. Prior to the Green Loans Program moving into my portfolio, Minister Garrett had instructed the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to immediately implement an independent external process of inquiry in relation to all contractual agreements and procurement processes entered into during the final design and implementation of the Green Loans Program. This inquiry is underway and will report in April 2010.
Minister Garrett also initiated an audit of the assessor accreditation process and adherence to the terms of the Protocol for Assessor Accrediting Organisations between the department and ABSA as the accrediting organisation. This is being conducted by external audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. This audit is due to conclude shortly. Further, the Australian National Audit Office has started a performance audit of the Green Loans Program. The Auditor-General currently expects to complete this audit in the second half of the year.
Management of this program in the short term needs to have regard to both the timelines of these reviews and the issues these reviews have been set up to consider. Approximately 4,000 assessors are presently contracted to take part in the program. As I have outlined, the government is reviewing the relevant contracts and processes to ensure assessors currently contracted to conduct assessments are meeting all of the program requirements, and will take further action as is necessary. I also intend to take the opportunity to consider the findings of the reviews into contractual arrangements and procurement under this program, and into accreditation processes, before proceeding to finalise additional assessor contracts. This will enable the outcomes of the reviews to inform both subsequent and current contracting arrangements. In the meantime, new bookings will continue to be accepted, existing assessors contracted under the program can continue to complete assessments in line with the cap of five assessments per week and three assessments per day, and households that have booked assessments will continue to receive their assessments.
In closing, I make clear again that the government is committed to delivering programs that are effective and deliver value for money. In regard to the Green Loans Program, I will be working quickly to achieve these objectives. I thank the Senate for the courtesy of allowing me to make this statement.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Green Loans Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,18,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-03-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
At the outset, I thank the minister for the courtesy of providing a copy of the statement shortly before making her remarks. This is clearly ‘air the dirty laundry’ day for the government. The visit by President Yudhoyono and the media attention that goes with that visit have seen not only this minister come in here and make a statement on the Green Loans Program but, as I understand it, Minister Combet make a similar statement, on the Home Insulation Program, in the other place. These two poor, unfortunate government ministers have had to pick up the mess left by Minister Garrett in his portfolio. They have come out today to air the dirty laundry and reveal what a comprehensive mess and disaster he made of his portfolio.
It is safe to say that in the Green Loans Program there has been mismanagement of monumental proportions. The only reason the Green Loans Program has not consistently been on the front pages over the last couple of weeks, as the failure upon failure of it has been realised, is that it has had to compete with the human tragedy of the Home Insulation Program for disgraceful management and poor policymaking by this government. It has had to compete with another program equally mismanaged by Minister Garrett. The fact that Minister Garrett continues to occupy a seat around the cabinet table, despite his failures in the Home Insulation Program and his failures in the Green Loans Program—which Minister Wong has just so comprehensively outlined—is an indictment of the government’s and the Prime Minister’s standards of ministerial conduct.
Today the minister has outlined all of the dirty linen in green loans. She has made, in many ways, a full confessional. In making that full confessional, there has been talk of reviews and lots of nice attempts at comfort but no changes and no actions to address the problems that have been encountered in this program. In fairness, the minister has had just two days in the portfolio and it has been a little under two weeks since the Prime Minister announced the changes. But, frankly, this government should not just be saying, ‘We’ve got a massive problem’; they should be saying, ‘We’ve got a massive problem and we have a plan to fix it.’ It is the plan to fix it that is so sorely lacking.
The problems in this program have been evident not just over the last couple of weeks but from day one. This was originally an election policy the government took to the election. In the election 2007 policy document Solar schools—solar homes the promise was to:
Offer low interest Green Loans of up to $10,000 each to make 200,000 existing homes more energy and water efficient, with subsidised environmental audits and free Green Renovations packs.
The government funded its policy in the 2008 budget, the first budget of the Rudd government. We started asking questions in the budget estimates in May 2008 and we were aghast—I know that Senator Milne was there as well—to see just how poorly planned this program was. We were so aghast that, in the press release I put out after those budget estimates, on 29 May 2008, I said:
His own program now appears too hard for Mr Garrett to actually deliver.
Those words, sadly, seem a little prophetic today. Minister Garrett was two weeks ago stripped of responsibility because he could not deliver on this program. He could not deliver because, as was evident, his departmental officials had no idea what they were doing.
At that time, alarm bells should have been ringing inside government about the Green Loans Program. Instead, they charged ahead. Just like with the Home Insulation Program, they failed to listen to the warnings, they failed to acknowledge that the department did not have the skills or the capacity to deliver and they simply charged ahead blindly into the future, hoping it would all work out for the best.
On this program, they did not even have the excuse that it was part of the stimulus package. That is the excuse that gets wheeled out for the Home Insulation Program—that it was part of the stimulus package and therefore needed to be done quickly. This one was not even part of the stimulus package. Then, they scaled back the program before it even started. By the time it became operational, in July 2009, they had wound back the promise of 200,000 green loans to 75,000 green loans. Yet they still could not get it right in the implementation.
Let us go through some of the issues that the minister highlighted in her ministerial statement. She acknowledged that 210,864 home sustainability assessments have been completed. Of those, around 84,000 reports have been returned from the department to households. Around 100,000 reports that have been submitted to the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts have not yet been sent out to households. Well over half of the reports completed in this program, which has been operating since July last year, a hundred thousand of them, are languishing in the department of environment somewhere not getting back to households. It is abject failure of process to return reports that have been completed on people’s homes, completed by homeowners who acted in good faith in getting a home sustainability assessment undertaken by assessors who acted in good faith in going in there and completing that assessment and returning it to the department of environment, and 100,000 of them, more than half, have languished in the department ever since then.
The minister highlighted the number of assessors. She said there are around 4,000 assessors contracted to the department. Those 4,000 assessors and the approximately 7,500 people who have actually been accredited with ABSA or the further 1,800 people who have completed training—so 9,300 trained assessors all up—wonder why there is not enough work to go around, why they have not been able to get through to the booking service, what has gone wrong. Most of all they wonder why there are so many of them. Why are there more than 9,000 trained assessors out there and why are there 4,000 contracted to the department? Assessors made their decision to get involved based on statements such as Minister Garrett’s press release of 8 May 2009, when he said there would be 1,000 home sustainability assessors, or the statement of Ms Robyn Kruk, the secretary of the department, to the Australian Economic Forum on 20 August 2009 when she said the program would be delivered through training 1,000 home sustainability assessors. So the government went out there and told people, ‘You might like to become a home sustainability assessor and we will accredit 1,000 of you,’ and somehow accidentally ended up with 4,000 of them.
How on earth does this happen? How does this government consider itself to be remotely capable in the management of this program when it ends up with four times the number of assessors trained to what it said it would have? It is a remarkable failure. Of course, these people have paid money to become assessors, have taken time out of their lives to become assessors, have set up business plans on the premise of becoming assessors, have set their lives up on this premise, only to discover that the government did not live up to its word, did not deliver on the promises it made and has failed them miserably as a result. It has failed to pay them as well. There are 1,500 invoices currently waiting in the department of environment to pay assessors. Indeed, it has failed to obviously put in place a clear process for how those invoices should be submitted, because around 50 per cent of invoices received by the department of environment have been incorrect or incomplete when first submitted. I find it hard to believe that 50 per cent of assessors are getting it wrong. The department must have put in place a totally flawed framework, and indeed the previous minister’s statement indicates that it was previously as high as 70 per cent of invoices being incorrect.
The minister said that there were three key pillars to this program, one being the home assessment, another being the green loan, and the third being the Green Rewards Card. This program was started in July 2009 and people who got an assessment were meant to be getting a $50 Green Rewards Card. What did the minister tell us today? No Green Rewards Cards have been distributed to households to date. When questioned at estimates just a few weeks ago, the department had no idea how they were going to provide them to households. So they have had since July last year when the program started, let alone more than a year before that when the budget funding was first announced, to work out how to send $50 cards to people—and they could not even send one of them out, for the more than 300,000 assessments that have been undertaken. It is an absolute outrage and a complete failure in the department, and indeed of the minister for not asking and finding out what on earth was going wrong. Why wasn’t the minister bringing the departmental officials in and saying, ‘How can you be getting every single aspect of this program so fundamentally wrong?’
We look at the applications for green loans and at Minister Garrett when he announced changes to the Green Loans Program on 19 February. He said they were going to discontinue the loans component of green loans. It sounds like something out of The Hollowmen that the government now has a Green Loans Program that does not have any loans. But that strange fact aside, he said that they were doing so because it had proven to be less popular. We now know it had proven to be less popular because more than half the assessments undertaken never made it back to households, because 100,000 of them were languishing in the department or even more probably at that time failing to get back to households. But they said they would give people until 22 March to apply. We know that there are still 100,000 assessments languishing there, therefore those homeowners cannot apply for a green loan. They do not have any chance to do so.
The minister today said that she was aware that a number of financial institutions have stopped taking new applications. Let us look at that number. Back on 14 February, before the loans component was suspended, there were 16 participating financial institutions and eight which were developing a product to offer. Today what does the green loans website say? It says that only three of them are left. So ‘a number’ is basically all of them. I understand that when contacted today the Berrima District Credit Union said that it is not offering green loans anymore, and the Community First Credit Union said that it had pulled out as well. So there is only one left, and that is the AWA Credit Union, available to Alcoa employees, contractors and their families. So the only people up until the 22 March deadline that the government has put in place for people to apply for a green loan who can still actually put an application in are employees of Alcoa—the only people in Australia are employees of Alcoa. The minister says a number of financial institutions have stopped taking new applications; they all have. Australians can no longer take out a green loan despite the government’s assurances that they had until 22 March.
The minister indicated that DEWHA is struggling to keep up with the more than 7,500 written inquiries and complaints it received over the period 25 February to 9 March. I am sure Senator Milne would agree that our offices have received a fair number of written inquiries and complaints over that period too, that we have all heard from people screaming and complaining, wanting to know what the government is going to do to fix this mess. The minister promised that work was already in train to put in place a nationally accredited training module for assessors—some would say a little too late because 300,000 of the 900,000-odd assessments have already been concluded. There will probably be more than that by the time this training module is put into place. So the government now is questioning whether the training was appropriate for the assessors it has had in the field for so long. The government employed more than four times the number than it intended at the start and is now trying to work through a training program to fix things. Well the horse has well and truly bolted. It is a little late in many ways to be closing the gate but better to get things right now than never, I guess.
The minister said that she will soon meet for the first time with representatives from the assessor body, ABSA. Again, I acknowledge she has been the minister for only two days but in the two weeks since the Prime Minister made this announcement I would have thought the association representing the assessors would have been one of the first groups the minister would have met. I suggest to the minister that, as ABSA officials are in the building at present—I know because I was meant to be meeting with them right now—perhaps she could meet with them today to discuss the many concerns of the thousands of registered assessors. The minister indicated that a lot of reviews are under way. That, of course, is the process of the Rudd government—if in doubt, review; if in doubt, set up another inquiry. That is the way they promise that things will be fixed.
There is an independent, external process being put in place for reviewing within the department of the environment. I trust that will shift across to the new department. There is an audit and report under way which will be completed by April. An audit of assessor accreditation processes is being undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The commitment I would like to hear from the minister, which she has not made, is that all of these reviews and all of these audits will be released publicly, so that we can see just how wrong the government got it and, more importantly, the recommendations, so that we can hold the government to account to fix this debacle. The minister should today commit to publicly releasing these audits, these reviews, as soon as they are completed. The government has poorly managed this program and should be held to account for how it will be administered in the future.
There are a litany of flaws and failings in the minister’s statement today, but they are cold, hard words and little else for the people affected by this program—the assessors and homeowners who have acted in good faith, the small business people and people concerned about the environment who acted in good faith to do their best to improve their homes, only to be so severely let down by the government. The minister’s statement is full of cold words but has little on action, little that will explain to people out there, to the assessors, how the thousands of assessors, who are now effectively unemployed because of the government, will manage to find work.
The government put in place a cap of 5,000, yet there are around 9,600 assessors. How is the government going to support all of those assessors? With the cap on assessments that can be put in place by the government, will there be enough work even for the lucky 5,000? Having accredited 4,000, how will the government choose the other 1,000? What will be the merit process be? The government has not outlined any of those points. What of the homeowners who invited assessors into their homes to conduct an assessment in the belief that they could apply for a green loan? What is the government going to do for those who have had assessments, some as far back as October of last year, who at least know that there are no longer green loans available, those 100,000 who are still waiting to get their report back? What is the government going to do for them?
What is fundamentally missing from the minister’s statement today is any sense of how the government is going to evaluate the success of undertaking nearly one million home sustainability assessments across Australia. At least under its original model there was the green loans component. We could see how many people took out a loan and could measure what they did with that loan. Now people will get an audit undertaken and that audit will be returned to them, we hope, a little more speedily than has been the case to date, but the government will have no idea what people do in response to that audit. There is no evaluation process in place, there are no evaluation mechanisms and the government should be saying how it is going to measure the benefit from a program spending $150 million-plus of taxpayers’ money. We know there will be lots of paper flying around but what will be the environmental benefit; what will be the energy efficiency benefit; what will be the water savings? These are the things the government needs to spell out and needs to ensure are quite clearly measured.
Lastly, we had a burst of honesty last Friday from Dr Parkinson, the head of the Department of Climate Change. When briefing staff, he acknowledged that his department has no more skills in program delivery than the department of environment, which has just been stripped of this program. I am pleased to hear the minister say that she has instructed the department to commit extra staff resources. Lord knows they have plenty to go around—staff who have been hired to work on the ETS who have nothing to do at present. I am pleased to know that she is reallocating those staff to work on this program and presumably on the home insulation debacle as well, but she needs to ensure that they know about program delivery not just about policy development. Otherwise, we will see the same tragic mistakes, mistakes which result in a waste of money, loss of opportunity, loss of jobs and a disaster for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Green Loans Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,18,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-03-10,"—I rise to comment on and to note the statement of the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water on the Green Loans Program. This is a tragedy. It is a tragedy for the environment and the economy and it is a great human tragedy as well. It is one that should never have occurred. This was a great idea: retro-fitting Australia’s houses to be energy efficient is something that the Greens have been advocating for a long time. It was a way of creating jobs and building critical mass for the technologies involved. It was part of a transition to a low-carbon economy. It was about cutting power bills for people by making their houses more energy-efficient and therefore cutting their demand. It was all the things you would want: it was a new direction in education and training, it was the right direction for the economy and it was about saving energy and cutting people’s cost of living. It had all of those elements going for it and yet it was mismanaged in the most appalling way by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and by Minister Garrett’s oversight of that department.
To begin with, I will comment on the complete lack of recognition in this statement of the human tragedy that has been the green loans scheme. First of all, it is a human tragedy for the assessors. We have in front of us lists of numbers. I was the first person to point out in this place that Minister Garrett had said this would be limited to between 1,000 and 2,000 assessors. I raised with the minister some months ago the fact that ABSA had pointed out, and they were warned a long time ago, that they were going to exceed that number and there were going to be a whole lot more assessors who were trained and accredited. But the government did nothing. It was denied by the department. It has been denied in estimates—it has been denied and denied. If I had the time I would go back through all the department’s answers in estimates and see who misled the Senate over that time. But I do not have time for that because I actually want to address what has gone on here.
Let me explain about this human tragedy, Madam Acting Deputy President. I have received hundreds of emails from assessors and the stories are incredibly similar. People have left good jobs in many cases to retrain as a home sustainability assessor. People trying to get back into the workforce saw this as worthwhile, purposeful work for the future in a growth industry. Companies took on additional people in order to do this work. And what was the cost to them? The costs were manyfold but on average people paid around $3,000 for training and they had to pay for insurance and accreditation. Many of these people did not have that money and some of them had to borrow money or to sell things. Some of them used their credit cards—maxed out their credit cards—in order to be able to do this. In fact, there is one story online today from someone who says:
... I left my comfortable desk job last year, set up my own business, and trained to become a government-licensed Home Sustainability Assessor.
Three months later, I still haven’t done a damn thing for the environment. I don’t even have a licence. My family is surviving on credit cards, and I am edging dangerously closer to bankruptcy every day. So how did it come to this?
That is a story I am being told by a lot of people. Today there are about 10,000 people across Australia who have outlaid money in good faith and who are now being told, ‘Sorry, that’s it. The government got it wrong, so we have transferred responsibility to another minister. We’re not looking back, we’re looking forward. We’re working out how we’re going to address this into the future.’ I can appreciate Minister Wong’s point of view: that is what she has been charged with and that is what she must do. But the community expects a few answers here. Who is going to be held responsible for the fact that many people are now in financial difficulties? Many people’s hopes are dashed. Who is actually responsible for this? The community wants accountability and I have been asking this government about accountability for the green loans scheme from day one.
The thing that goes with accountability is compensation. The Prime Minister took personal responsibility for the insulation debacle. He said, ‘Insulation companies lost money because of the government’s mismanagement and we are going to pay compensation.’ Something has to be done here too. Something has to be done for these people. We have people trained, accredited and registered as assessors. We have others trained and accredited, and others trained but not yet accredited. The government says that at the end of this process the number of assessors is going to be capped at 5,000. The point is: some of the people who are trained, accredited and registered have appalling training; some have excellent training and some who have been trained recently but are not yet accredited have excellent training. So we have a complete hotchpotch of quality in the training that is being provided to people even though they have had to pay a relatively similar amount for that training. I would like to know from the minister what she is going to do.
I would also like to alert the minister that in that department Stephen Berry led people to believe that the government, at government expense, would train people to upgrade their qualifications to certificate IV. I told the government that in estimates and have provided evidence of that to the government. Therefore, I want to know from the government: is it going to pay to allow those assessors who want to stay in the business to upgrade their qualifications, so they have a good level of training, at government expense? And, given that they were misled about the nature of the scheme, is there going to be compensation for people who decide they are not going to proceed with trying to get accreditation or registration? One issue that the government has not mentioned here is compensation—it clearly needs to be looked at and paid. It is a question of fairness.
The other human tragedy is the consumers. People in good faith had booked a home sustainability assessment. In some cases, people turned up at the door and said: ‘I am not even going to bother to come inside. I don’t need to come inside. Tick and flick—have you got this, have you got that? Tick the box—okay, here’s your assessment money from the government and off I go.’ So there were sharks and cowboys all over the place in this program. Other people spent two or three hours going right through the house, explaining to people what was going on and how they could be helped, and so on and so forth. But, when these reports came back from the government to those 84,000 or so consumers who received one, the reports will be of incredibly uneven value because of the way in which they were done.
Another matter which the minister did not mention but which I wanted to look at was that RMIT worked on the tool that underpinned the software for this program. That tool was changed at various times through the program so that what was emphasised as being important changed in how the reports came out, in many cases making fools of the assessors who had said to the householder, ‘Well, the best value for money would be X and the report coming out says no, it would be Y.’ That issue of the usefulness or otherwise of the tool is important.
The quality of these assessments for the householder is even more critical now because, since they are not going to get a green loan, they are probably going to be thinking that on this list of things that probably could be done there is something they might save up to do. If the report is wrong, worthless or skewed in the wrong direction, then they are going to be working in their home for something that is not going to deliver them energy efficiency benefits. There needs to be an audit which goes back and looks at what the house was, what the report was and the accuracy of that report and the weighting of this tool. For example, air leaks in houses should be one of the basic things that should be done, yet in some of these reports that is not weighted as a basic thing that you would do for energy efficiency.
Let me go to the part played by the banks. Now that there are no loans, people are going to finally be very angry—because there are only 84,000 reports out there at the moment. So, out of 210,864 people who have had their assessments done, 126,864 households are not now able to apply for a green loan. They cannot apply for one without the report and even if the report comes it is too late—the banks are not offering. Why aren’t they? The government was meant to have a contractual arrangement with financial institutions. The government says the loans are meant to be available until 22 March, so how can they just all pull out of it and say they are not offering these any more?
We have heard reports of people who got the $10,000 and offset their mortgage with it. They have not spent it on any of the technology that they supposedly got the loans for because the banks do not care. As long as the government pays the interest subsidy on the loan, the banks are not going to go out to check whether the householder has actually bought anything with it or whether they are just using it as an offset on their mortgage. All kinds of problems are associated with this.
On the human level for the assessors, whilst it might sound reasonable for the government to cap the number of assessments to five per week, it has now condemned people in this program to a very small amount of part-time work. So a lot of assessors who went into this thinking it would be a full-time career now will have to abandon it altogether because they will get only two days work when they want full-time work. We are going to lose a lot of the good, well-trained assessors from the program because the government has now declared it to be simply a part-time program. The other thing that the government did not address in this statement is how five companies got to have special arrangements with the government when individual self-employed assessors and small business did not. How did that happen? We still have not heard why Fieldforce had a special arrangement with the government whereby they could bypass the booking system. The minister did not talk about why the government failed to deliver the online booking service that was promised and why we continue to end up with the call centre and the chaos that has gone on with the call centre ever since.
There are so many issues here that really need to be looked at. Frankly, this has been very badly designed. It is not like a lot of other programs where if one thing goes wrong there is a domino effect and the whole thing falls over. This was flawed in its design and flawed in its implementation. Every aspect of the design was wrong. For example, an audit program was built into the pilot phase of the Green Loans Program. It was never implemented. There was no audit function in this program. Who is responsible for that? Is it the minister? Is it the department? Is it the secretary? Apparently, it is nobody now because we are looking to the future; we are not looking to the past. The fact that there are people around Australia who have been ruined financially because they took the government at its word does not seem to matter now because we are moving forward; we are not looking back. The Greens are looking back and forward at the same time. I wrote a letter to the Auditor-General and said that this program was a complete mess. I do not write to the Auditor-General lightly. I said, ‘You really need to look at this use of taxpayers’ money, the management of the department, because the minister has carefully made sure that the internal audits that were being done were looking not internally at the department’s workings but at the department’s association with ABSA and the department’s association with other people.’
I am very pleased that, as a result of my letter to him, the Auditor-General has agreed to do a full audit of the department and how all this debacle occurred. But that is not going to take us forward on the key questions that I think the government has to address. The first is that it needs to reinstate some green loans. You have to be able to borrow some money when you get your report; otherwise, what is the point? You will have a report in your hand but to no end. Where are you going to get the money from to actually implement the report? Secondly, the government needs to look to the quality of the reports that have already been done and conduct a reality check on the ground in those houses to make sure that the reports are reasonable.
Third, there will have to be an audit of the nature of the training that all the auditors did and some fair process, because it simply would not be fair to keep the 4,000-odd people who are registered with the government at the moment and to keep out other people who have been trained and accredited when there is such uneven quality. That means offering people the opportunity to upgrade their training at Commonwealth expense or, alternatively, offering for them to be compensated and to be able to withdraw from the scheme. We have got to have some way of doing this fairly, and it is no use saying: ‘I’m sorry. This is a hard decision. Some people are going to miss out.’ They are going to miss out because the government made such a mess of this in the first place. It is absolutely imperative that the government recognise, as they did with the insulation scheme, that there needs to be compensation. They need to sort this out now in a fair and just way and make sure that there is some compensation and that people are allowed to leave. I particularly want to hold the government to account for Stephen Berry’s promise that the government would fund upgrading to certificate IV, and for saying there was no training program in place in the first place. Yes, that is true, but there was a training program in Victoria that could have been used as an interim measure. Perhaps the minister will see that as an interim measure.
How can it be that the department embraces and launches a program and they do not even have a template of how you invoice for this particular program? They do not even have software that works. They do not even have their online booking service that they promised from day one. They do not even have their audit function. They have not got anything in place when it is launched. Then this debacle ensues over months and months. When people bring it to the parliament, the government says: ‘No, everything’s fine. We’ve fixed the software.’ Wrong. The software has never worked properly in terms of this program. ‘Oh, we’ve got the online booking system ready but we’re just not switching it on because if we do there’ll be this whole rush at the green loans.’ Well, the booking system was promised from day one. So I want to know: who is responsible to make sure we never have this debacle in project delivery again?
I want to make sure that we have a green loans program moving into the future that has green loans at the end of it and that has high-quality assessment reports on households that people can have confidence in and know are an accurate assessment of the energy efficiency of their home and the improvements that could be made. But I want to make sure that there is a fair and just way for some of the people who have in good faith entered this program to now be able to leave it, in terms of their training. It is a disgrace that you have people out there, as this person says—and he is not the only one—surviving on credit cards, edging dangerously closer to bankruptcy every day. Several people have had to sell their car, for example. There are all sorts of human tragedies here. It must be addressed.
The Prime Minister cannot take responsibility for insulation just because the community is so outraged about the fact that people have died as a result of that program. The community had every right to be outraged about that, and the Prime Minister was right to start looking at taking personal responsibility and at compensation. But on this one he has to do the same, and even more so, because this was not rushed through in the stimulus package. This was an election promise in 2007. It was in the 2008 budget and it began on 1 July 2009. It was a supposedly well thought through election promise, a budget responsibility. It had a lead time since the government came into it. And it was an utter and complete debacle. How can that be? How can it be that a Rudd government promise with all that lead time ends up with every single aspect of the program being mismanaged, to the tragedy of families around Australia, to loss for the environment, and to loss of consumer confidence in the transformative nature of these programs to the low-carbon economy? That is something that the government will be held to account for by the community as we approach the federal election.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-10,"—The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005, which will be debated tonight and through this week, is one of the most draconian and un-Australian pieces of legislation that this parliament has ever seen. This bill will effectively appropriate property belonging to a private company without any compensation whatsoever. For that reason, the coalition will be opposing that part of the bill that effectively causes confiscation of property without compensation.
The bill does a number of things: it makes changes to the telecommunications access regime, it removes technical impediments to the operation of the anticompetitive conduct regime, it makes the universal service obligation and customer service guarantee clearer and therefore more enforceable, it extends the obligation to provide priority assistance to those with life-threatening conditions to service providers other than Telstra and it enables breaches of civil penalty provisions to be dealt with more quickly.
There are parts of this bill to which the opposition has no objection—in fact, there are some parts which the opposition would be in favour of supporting. But as long as this bill contains the provision of appropriation of property without compensation the opposition will not be supporting it. The provision to structurally and functionally separate Telstra at the pain of great penalties is a step too far and it is one that the opposition, for reasons that the Senate will hear during this debate, will not be supporting.
We hope that the government will see sense—that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, will get off his high horse and realise that this Senate is elected by the people of Australia and that it has a function to play in this parliament. We have seen all of the media commentary by five under-pressure ministers today—a pretty amateur approach today—to put across a message that the Senate is being uncooperative, which is quite incorrect. But for all the government spin that we have come to accept as normal from Mr Rudd and his government this Senate actually comprises elected people who are here to perform their duties in looking after the interests of all Australians. They have a duty to make sure that the rights of all Australians—and they have obligations as well as rights—cannot be taken away by a government in the capricious way in which this legislation attempts to do it.
This bill seeks to prevent Telstra from acquiring specified bands of spectrum which could be used for advanced wireless broadcast service unless it structurally separates and divests its hybrid coaxial cable network and its interests in Foxtel. In fact, the bill gives Telstra the opportunity to give three binding undertakings: an undertaking to structurally separate its retail operation from all or some of its networks, an undertaking to divest itself of its interest in Foxtel and an undertaking to divest itself of the pay-TV cable network that it owns in Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.
If it does not do that, then this bill will provide that Telstra will not be allocated and will not be able to use the designated spectrum that it is assumed is vitally essential to its mobile broadband business. What this really means is that the government and the minister are holding a gun to the heads of the millions of Telstra shareholders to fall in with the government and give away their current network at practically no cost—otherwise they will pay the consequences.
I am pleased that Minister Conroy has come into the chamber, because he will know better than I that, when Telstra was having a little tiff with the former coalition government a few years ago, Senator Conroy became very palsy-walsy with Telstra. He went to them and said, ‘I’ve got no idea of what a communications policy should involve. I have no staff; I have no ability. So you tell me what you would want.’ Telstra gave him some advice and mentioned a figure of $4.7 billion—and, lo and behold, that became the Labor Party policy. When Labor won government, Minister Conroy suddenly found that it was not quite that simple. He first of all destroyed the OPEL network, which was up and running and which, by now, would have been providing high-speed broadband to most of Australia. Senator Conroy, capriciously again, simply cancelled that contract and threatened those involved that, if they wanted to have an interest in telecommunications in Australia in the future, they had better forget about any High Court action against the government.
Then we went through an expensive farce involving the offer to tender process, which cost the Australian taxpayer $20 million. At the end of that, Senator Conroy realised again that his policy and that of his government was up in the air, all over the ship and going nowhere. Then he had this brilliant idea that he would put in $43 billion worth of someone’s money. Because we have not seen the implementation study we are not sure whose money it was going to be, but we were all led to believe that 51 per cent of that money would be Commonwealth investment and 49 per cent would somehow be private investment. With the $43 billion, Senator Conroy was going to build this National Broadband Network, which would effectively take over the trunk lines, if I can call them that, of Telstra, Optus and anyone else who might have them. And the government would not brook any competition from Telstra or Optus because the figures, if you look at them, mean that for $43 billion this NBN network simply cannot operate. It is a commercial lemon. There is no way in the world it could make a profit or even hold its own in competition with Telstra, who effectively have a similar sort of network amongst the high-using parts of our country.
What did Senator Conroy then work out? If he went into competition with Telstra, with the $43 billion and the amount that he would have to charge customers to get the network to even remotely look like paying, he would be out on his commercial ear, one might say. Quite clearly, Telstra with its existing network, and Optus and the other carriers, would be able to provide a service at about the cost they are providing it now. The NBN, on even the simplest back-of-the-envelope figures, would have to double or triple the monthly payment for those people wanting to use the NBN service. Who would go to the NBN service when they could get a service from Telstra or Optus or Vodafone for about one-third of the cost? Nobody. Competition is not what Senator Conroy wants, because NBN would fall flat on its face commercially.
So what did he do? He then came along with the bullyboy tactics and said to Telstra, ‘We want you to give us your network and for you to get out of the wholesale area so that we won’t have any competition in that area and we might—just might—be able to make ends meet.’ This bill actually puts into legislative form that confiscation of property to ensure that Telstra is not there to compete with this NBN, because, if it did, the NBN would have no chance of being commercially successful. Even as it is, it will not have much of a chance of being profitable.
This comes from a government that cannot even run a giveaway insulation program. Surely, if you are giving away insulation, you could devise a program that would work. It is not rocket science; in fact, anyone could do it—anyone, that is, except Mr Garrett and the Rudd government. They have made such a mess of that simple piece of policy implementation; how on earth could they possibly run this National Broadband Network?
What they have done with the network, of course, is fill it up with old mates. We all know of Senator Conroy’s action in ensuring that Mike Kaiser, a defrocked, I might say, member of the Queensland parliament who had to resign from the Queensland parliament for electoral fraud, is now on board with the NBN company. Why? Because of his expertise? Or did he win his $450,000 job in competition with many other people who have expertise in the government relations area? No, he got it non-competitively, because the minister came along and said to the boss of NBN Co., ‘I’ve appointed you to NBN Co. It’s not a bad job and you’re not a bad fellow, but you’re there because I appointed you. I’ve got a mate up in Queensland—part of my faction. He’s looking for a $450,000 job. I think he’d be very suitable for this appointment.’
This is the sort of situation you had with the NBN Co. as it commenced. If that is how it commenced its operations, heaven knows how it will finish up. We might wonder how many of the other NBN Co. appointments were non-competitive. I think someone said that about 40 per cent of them—perhaps Senator Conroy would confirm that—were made without competition, and one wonders how many of them are card-carrying members of the Labor Party and, perhaps more importantly, of the faction in which Senator Conroy is closely involved.
This is the body that the Rudd government wants to give a monopoly to in Australia. To do that, it is going to confiscate from an existing private company certain property by threatening the company with the fact that if they do not give it up the government will make their business life untenable in Australia. This is a draconian and very un-Australian part of the legislation. That part should be defeated and hopefully will be defeated. I call on Senator Conroy again to split this bill so that the consumer elements of this legislation are divided from the rest of the bill and dealt with by the Senate. As I say, generally speaking, that would get the support of the coalition. It is a simple way to get through that legislation. But, no, the Labor Party is playing its old tricks: have some good legislation which everyone agrees with but hook it into something that is draconian and un-Australian and would not get support anywhere. I again ask Senator Conroy to split the bill so that the consumer provisions can be dealt with.
We had a debate earlier today about the implementation study. According to Senate procedure, we were not supposed to be dealing with this bill until the implementation study was tabled. At many an estimates committee meeting, we inquired of Senator Conroy and his department how this would be funded. We asked whether private business interests would be in there, whether it would be done by a government bond, what the interest rate would be and who would pay any losses in this company—all those sorts of things—and from Senator Conroy and his department we continually got the answer, ‘That’ll all been made clear in the implementation study.’ We all expected, as reasonable people, that the implementation study would be released by the end of February. In fact, Senator Conroy implied that. I concede to Senator Conroy that in a recent estimates hearing he said that it might not be released by the end of February 2010. I concede that, Senator Conroy. But your action and the action of your department was that, every time a question was asked, the answer came back: ‘Don’t you worry about that. We can’t answer this now, but when you see the implementation study all will be revealed.’ But, of course, all has not been revealed.
Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I ask you to do some sums on the back of an envelope. Work out how many subscribers there are in Australia at the moment. How many are there? There are about seven million households in Australia. Divide that into the income that the NBN Co. will need to earn in order to see what it is going to cost people to hook into the NBN. If you look at average prices now of about $50 to $60 a month for an ordinary person using similar services and then multiply that—anyone can do these figures; you can do them on the back of an envelope—you will see that you simply cannot make money out of this NBN. Senator Conroy said to us: ‘You will see it. All will be revealed when the implementation study is tabled.’ But where is the implementation study? Where is this document that was going to tell us all what needs to be done?’ Senator Conroy, for reasons that only he knows about—I was not in the debate this morning, but I understand that in his 20-minute rant he did not even indicate—

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—It was only five minutes of ranting? Your rantings have been concise, Senator Conroy! I understand that you did not even indicate why you would not be releasing the implementation study. I will give you a reason: I suspect that the implementation study says that this is a lemon—that this will not work. You simply cannot raise the sort of income you will need from the NBN Co. while making it affordable to Australians who might have to hook up to it. The whole thing is an absolute shambles, Senator Conroy, and you know it. How many backflips have you done so far? Remember we were told that the request for tender process ‘affects everything; we’re going to get good responses here and there will be people lining up to do it.’ What did you do? You made the mistake of having a bit of a fight with Telstra, so you excluded them from it without thinking, and then, having excluded them, you realised that you could not do it without them. This is a shambles to the nth degree, and it will continue to be a shambles whilst this government is in charge of it. I again plead with Senator Conroy, if he is interested in getting the consumer bits through, to split the bill, because the opposition will certainly not be supporting this draconian confiscation of property without compensation.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2010-03-10,"—I am very pleased to contribute to the debate this evening on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009. The Rudd Labor government is determined to have the best possible infrastructure in place to underpin Australia’s economic future and economic prosperity and to ensure that all Australians can enjoy that prosperity. We are committed to building the best possible broadband and telecommunications system, the best transport corridors, the best schools and the best health facilities. Despite the continued obstruction of those opposite, we are determined to honour those commitments to the Australian people.
I note that the government recently released its exposure draft of the legislation intended to establish the regulatory framework for the National Broadband Network company, NBN Co. That was another significant step in the massive reform of the Australian telecommunications sector that the government has embarked upon. As is appropriate, that exposure draft is available for consultation with stakeholders and the government has, as the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has said, an open mind on any amendments that can improve the bill before us today.
The government is always mindful of the necessity to consult widely about the transformation of Australia’s telecommunications infrastructure and systems; however, the opposition does not participate meaningfully in this debate at all. It just opposes everything we do. While failing to come up with any coherent plan of its own, there have been numerous press releases—currently more than 100—and at least 18 different failed broadband plans. There is no coherent plan and no vision for the future from the coalition. Given the coalition’s recent complete conversion to a party full of extremists, wackos and conspiracy theorists, we can only anticipate that their next pronouncement on telecommunications will be to either institute a national smoke signal system or bring back carrier pigeons.
The amendments proposed in the bill we are debating come after telecommunications companies, industry experts and the regulator have been calling for years for fundamental reforms in telecommunications. The government has listened to those calls and, with this bill, will deliver historical reforms in Australia’s long-term national interests. The legislation before us will address Telstra’s high level of integration to promote greater competition and consumer benefits; it will streamline and simplify the competition regime to provide more certain and faster outcomes for telecommunications companies; it will strengthen consumer safeguards to ensure service standards are maintained at a high level; and it will remove red tape affecting productivity and innovation.
The Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee inquired into this bill last year. As the committee’s report noted:
The bill seeks to introduce a series of regulatory reforms intended to enhance competitive outcomes in the Australian telecommunications industry and strengthen consumer safeguards. It seeks to ‘promote an open, competitive telecommunications market to provide Australian consumers with access to innovative and affordable services’.
That was a laudable conclusion for the committee to come to. It is a pity that the coalition senators could not support it.
The amendments proposed in this bill will assist us to modernise our telecommunications industry and benefit all 22 million Australians. At the moment, Australia sits in the bottom half of OECD countries in terms of broadband take-up. Australia has slower and more expensive broadband compared to many other countries in the OECD. In fact, the OECD ranks Australia 16th in terms of broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants. We also rank fourth, fifth and ninth for the most expensive low-speed, medium-speed and high-speed average monthly subscription broadband prices respectively. That poor standing of ours on the international scale is largely due to the lack of competition in the telecommunications market.
The bill before us is designed to restructure the regulation in place in the sector in the interests of consumers, business and the economy as a whole. Additionally, it is designed to position the telecommunications sector to make the smooth transition to the NBN environment as the new network is rolled out and implemented across the country. The measures incorporated in the bill will provide flexibility for Telstra to choose its future path and to streamline the regulatory framework.
The bill is split into four elements of reform, which I will now outline in a bit more detail. The first is vertical and horizontal separation. Unlike many other countries, the Australian telecommunications sector is dominated by one company, which owns Australia’s only fixed-line copper network, the largest cable network, half of the largest pay TV provider and the largest mobile phone network in the country. That high level of integration that Telstra has over the telecommunications market is highly unusual when compared to most other countries. Integration to that extent is anticompetitive. To avoid the detriment caused by an anticompetitive framework, many countries have already implemented restrictions to ensure that the total monopolisation of the telecommunications sector does not occur.
The bulk of the current telecommunications regulatory regime has been in place since its introduction in the 1990s. It is the government’s view that, even after more than 10 years of open competition, Telstra’s high level of integration across the telecommunications sector is hampering the development of effective competition. In owning the fixed-line copper network as well as the largest cable network and holding a majority share of the nation’s mobile phone network, the government believes Telstra has disproportionately high levels of ownership and that has contributed to Australia continually lagging behind other developed countries on the availability, price and quality of telecommunications services.
The first element of reform in this bill will focus on the current structure of the telecommunications sector, implementing vertical and horizontal separation and aiming to correct the mistakes of the past. While significant structural reform has occurred in other key infrastructure industries, previous governments from both sides have failed to undertake the necessary structural and microeconomic reform in the telecommunications industry. The government has devised a plan for the functional separation of Telstra, unless of course Telstra decides to voluntarily structurally separate in a way acceptable to the ACCC. Of course, the best outcome for the transition period to the NBN is for Telstra to voluntarily structurally separate in line with NBN arrangements. If the company chooses to voluntarily separate, the minister will provide guidance to the ACCC on the matters it would need to take into account when considering whether to accept a separation undertaking. If Telstra chooses to not voluntarily structurally separate, this legislation provides for the government to impose a strong functional separation framework on the company.
The bill also includes provisions to address the horizontal integration of Telstra across copper, cable and mobile platforms. Telstra will be prevented from acquiring additional spectrum for advanced wireless broadband while it remains vertically integrated; while it owns a hybrid fibre coaxial cable network; and while interests in pay TV channel Foxtel are maintained at the levels they are now. The legislation provides scope for the minister to remove either or both of the second and third requirements in the event that Telstra submits an acceptable voluntary structural separation to the ACCC. I note that functional separation has been used as a regulatory tool successfully in other countries, including the United Kingdom and, more recently, New Zealand. It is also being considered currently by the European Commission. In a range of countries a fixed-line incumbent does not also own the largest mobile carrier, as is the case here in Australia. The government, through this legislation, intends to rectify the deficiencies in our unique and highly integrated telecommunications market with the aim of promoting competition across different delivery platforms while still allowing Telstra to choose its own future path.
I will now go to parts XIC and XIB of the Trade Practices Act. The second element of this bill addresses the competition framework. It seeks to reform the telecommunications access regime and the way in which anticompetitive conduct is handled by the regulator. The existing telecommunications anticompetitive conduct and access regimes in the Trade Practices Act have been widely criticised as being cumbersome, open to gaming and providing insufficient certainty for investment. The government, rightly, wants to change that and to improve the conditions of the current regulatory framework.
As evidence that things are not working well in terms of that regulatory framework, I note that in the period from 1997 until mid-2009 there were 157 telecommunications access disputes lodged with the ACCC. In comparison, other regulated sectors, including the energy and aviation sectors, only saw three access disputes lodged in the same period. It is clear also that access seekers have been frustrated and unhappy with the constant delays and disputes in the industry, a fact that was reiterated during the Senate committee inquiry, where many of the submissions were strongly in favour of improving the process. A reform of the telecommunications access regime is most definitely needed to ensure it is a more effective and therefore a more acceptable regime for access users.
The proposed changes outlined by this bill will also reform the Trade Practices Act to streamline the arrangements through which telephone companies access wholesale services so that, firstly, the ACCC will determine upfront terms and conditions for a three- to five-year period; secondly, the ACCC can determine principles to apply for longer periods; and, thirdly, the ACCC can make binding rules to immediately address problems with the supply of regulated wholesale services.
The bill also reforms the arrangements in part XIB of the TPA so that the ACCC can address breaches of competition law and conduct damaging to the market. These reforms will provide more timely outcomes and greater regulatory certainty for both access providers and access seekers. Providers and seekers will be able to invest in infrastructure and expand their service offerings. Competition in the telecommunications industry will be far improved, and, of course, consumers and businesses will benefit from lower prices, better services and greater product innovation.
Also in this bill there are matters dealing with consumer protection measures. The platform of reforms that we are debating today in this bill takes into consideration the implementation of the National Broadband Network. During the period of transition to the NBN environment the existing telecommunications regulatory regime will remain important for delivering services to Australian consumers and businesses. The government is committed to ensuring that consumers are protected during this phase and that service standards are maintained at an affordable and high-quality level. The reforms proposed strengthen the regulator’s ability to enforce existing consumer safeguards that are in place and will not remove any of the existing protections that are currently in place for consumers. With this bill the government will ensure that Telstra does not reduce the quality and reliability of services on its copper network during the transition to the NBN. In fact, this bill aims to make sure that existing protections are better enforced in order to provide higher quality services and a greater responsiveness to faults.
The government is particularly concerned about access to modern telecommunications. The reforms that this bill presents will be good for all Australian consumers and businesses no matter whereabouts in the country they are located. Rural and regional Australia has suffered disproportionately from the inadequacies of the existing regulatory framework. For example, only 59 per cent of payphones in remote areas provided under the universal service obligation were repaired within the three-day period specified in Telstra’s Standard Marketing Plan—a stark contrast to the 82 per cent repaired within two days in rural areas, and 91 per cent of phones repaired within one day in urban areas. In the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee report released in September 2008, the universal service obligation arrangements were highlighted as being very vague and too difficult to enforce. The government have recognised that the universal service obligation is the key to the ongoing protection of consumers’ rights, although we have also recognised the need to improve quality and service benchmarks.
The measures outlined in the bill reflect the decision to retain the existing USO for voice telephony and payphones, but we require a marked lift in the service benchmarks to increase consumer satisfaction. Improvements to service quality will be made in order to meet the customer service guarantee. New service arrangements will make clear to both consumers and Telstra the services Telstra must supply in fulfilment of the universal service obligation, including reliability and repair requirements, rather than the decisions being left to Telstra’s discretion. The government will consider the broader range of issues associated with the delivery of universal access in the NBN environment once the detailed operating arrangements for our fabulous 21st-century broadband network are finalised.
The fourth plank of the reforms proposed in the legislation before us today is to do with the removal of red tape. The Rudd government have consistently been dedicated to modernising infrastructure and maximising productivity and growth. We have made large commitments to address any impediments that stand in the way of Australia’s long-term productivity growth. The final element of this bill is intended to remove regulation red tape, specifically in areas where it is no longer needed, and, more specifically, in areas where the need for regulation no longer exists. There are a number of these red-tape removal proposals, including exempting all carriers from paying the annual carrier licence charge if their annual revenue is under $25 million per annum; reducing the reporting requirements under the customer service guarantee, priority assistance and network reliability frameworks so long as performance benchmarks are being met; repealing any unnecessary accounting and operational separation requirements once functional separation is in place or Telstra has submitted an enforceable undertaking to structurally separate that is acceptable to the ACCC; and, finally, abolishing the Telstra licence condition that requires Telstra to provide technical assistance to enable customers to achieve 19.2 kilobits per second internet services.
As I have said, the object of the bill, with the splitting of Telstra, is to promote innovation and increase competition and responsiveness within the telecommunications sector. The reforms proposed in the bill are well-timed to benefit both telecommunications providers and consumers. The government wants to create a more efficient telecommunications market with more competitive services for the benefit of all Australian consumers, including businesses and households. Although we have seen attempts from the opposition again today to frustrate the passage of this bill, it is hoped that these benefits will be seen relatively soon so that we can carry them through for the long-term benefit of the country.
The government is determined to act in the best interests of industry, but the coalition, with their activities today, are clearly opposed to doing that. The action the coalition took today to delay debate on this bill fits in with their long track record of failure in the area of telecommunications regulations. After all, the coalition presided over a regulatory system which has failed telecommunications companies, consumers and businesses. They privatised Telstra without ever properly resolving the conflict of Telstra being the network owner while also competing against its customers in retail markets. The opposition are again trying to delay these reforms and they are again failing Australian businesses and consumers.
The reforms in this bill are critical. Every day that these reforms are delayed, Australian consumers and businesses will continue to pay higher prices and have less choice and see less innovation in telecommunications services. In case we were in any doubt about the importance of these reforms, I should point out that many in the industry and stakeholders support them. On Lateline Business last year, ACCC Chairman Graeme Samuel said:
The view of the ACCC for many years is that the reforms proposed in the legislation that’s been tabled by the Government are long overdue, are necessary, are reforms that infuse the whole concept of competition into the telecommunications sector, an infusion that itself is long overdue since about 1992.
I commend this excellent legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-03-10,"—The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009 is a gun to the head of Telstra Corporation; it is a gun to the head of a major Australian company. The minister pretends that the legislation is all about choice. But it is a Clayton’s choice. It is a choice between ‘cut out’ or ‘get cut out’. It is a choice between ‘volunteer to structurally separate’ or ‘be cut out of future licensing operations’. It is a choice between ‘bear the cost of separation’ or ‘stand fast and bear the cost of being cut out of the market’. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009 was not Labor policy until the minister announced it as such in September 2009. Labor did not take this policy to the election because they knew it would hurt millions of Australians, millions of mums and dads, Telstra shareholders and thousands of workers.
Asked about separation at budget estimates last year, Minister Conroy said, ‘I’m not advocating it; I’ve never advocated it.’ Separation was never Labor policy—until the minister announced it in 2009. There is no case for this bill. Minister Conroy has failed to demonstrate any case for this bill since he forecast changed policy in September 2009.
Rudd Labor is proposing to solve a supposed problem without any data to quantify its proposed solution. Why should we be surprised about that, from a government that was elected on the basis of ‘let’s do evidence based policy’ and has spectacularly failed to do exactly that? Indeed, its record is exemplified by its very failure to do that. So why should we be surprised? The minister’s second reading speech on this bill says simply:
Telstra is one of the most highly integrated telecommunications companies in the world—
as if the statement of the fact that Telstra is highly integrated is proof of the fact that it should be unintegrated—and I use that word, if it be one, in preference to ‘disintegrated’, but that may well be a consequence. Let us hope it not be intended by the minister.
A recent Senate inquiry heard from Foxtel, who said the draft bill ‘proposed dramatic changes to the regulatory regime despite the government not having undertaken a rigorous analysis or inquiry into whether there has been significant market failure justifying any changes’. Should we be surprised about that? Why should we be surprised about the government persisting with a bill for which there is no case when that bill is bad for mums and dads and shareholders of Telstra? There are 1.4 million shareholders, nine million customers and some 30,000 workers. What about the workers, Minister Conroy? What about the workers?
Institutional investors are clearly opposed to the erosion of the value in Telstra’s shareholding. Worse, as Maple-Brown Abbott’s submission to the Senate inquiry pointed out:
The bill … runs the risk of damaging Australia’s sovereign risk rating as well as stifling investment and innovation in the telecommunications sector.
It is an extreme and unacceptable way of forcing a company to bargain with the government. Why should we be surprised about that from Rudd Labor? The Australian Foundation Investment Company’s submission warned:
If the Parliament passes this legislation we think Australia’s investment standing could be significantly diminished. Investors, particularly international investors, will perceive substantially heightened sovereign risk if the Australian Government can act arbitrarily in this way.
Synstrat Management’s submission said they considered the bill to be ‘legal trickery’ and an ‘unethical way for the government to conduct its business’. Should we be surprised that Minister Conroy and Rudd Labor persist with a bill for which there is no case when that bill is simply bad for rural and regional customers?
In many parts of rural and regional Australia Telstra is, like it or not, the only service provider. It offers competitive, metropolitan comparable pricing to much of rural Australia and recently reduced pricing on Next G wireless broadband services, bringing Next G into the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy’s definition of metro-comparable broadband. But if Telstra is separated, will there continue to be some cross-subsidy of the services currently provided to rural and regional Australia? If Telstra misses out on 4G wireless spectrum—and there is a clear prospect under the bill that it may—how long will rural and regional Australians be forced to wait for a new market entrant? What proof or what confidence does the government have that there will be a new market entrant capable of delivering to rural and regional Australia? And what of the universal service obligation? If Telstra is separated, is the government proposing to guarantee that rural and regional Australians will have access to quality and affordable telecommunications services somewhat like those guaranteed under the current universal service obligation? That is yet another question that remains unanswered.
Why should we be surprised about the government persisting with a bill for which there is no case, arguing that it is necessary for competition when there is already significant competition in the marketplace? Data from ACMA and the ACCC indicate the level of competition. ACMA’s Communications report 2008-09 released in January showed that, as of June 2009, there were 175 licensed telecommunications carriers, three mobile carriers offering six networks covering some 96 to 99 per cent of the population, more than 600 internet service providers and almost 400 fixed-line voice service providers in Australia. An Optus submission to the current ACCC review of price controls on Telstra says that prices in retail telephony markets have been falling due to the amount of competition in the market—that is, a large number of retail providers competing vigorously for market share. An ACCC submission to the government’s regulatory reform paper of June 2009 said no specific legislative changes are required to address competition concerns in relation to the allocation of spectrum. Should we be surprised about Minister Conroy persisting with a bill for which there is no case?
Really, the only case for the bill is to save the National Broadband Network and to save the minister’s ministerial face. It is all about the NBN, stupid. Contrary to the government’s claims that the bill is about enhancing competition and delivering better and more affordable services to consumers, several of the witnesses to the recent Senate inquiry, for example, are in little doubt about the purpose of the legislation. Again, Maple-Brown Abbott say this bill is ‘a high-risk strategy to deliver the NBN’. It is simply a stalking horse for the National Broadband Network. This bill is all about the NBN, stupid. It is a cover for the lack of action thus far on the National Broadband Network. What have we got so far on the National Broadband Network? If there is an implementation study, we have not seen it. Indeed, we are not even sure that we will see it at all. No, there is no implementation study that we know about, Minister, but there is some sort of study by NBN Co. itself. Senator Conroy previously told us that the implementation study would ‘work through the detailed network design and rollout schedule for the NBN’ and ‘the extent of coverage that will be achieved’. So the key issues include network design, rollout schedule and the extent of coverage that will be achieved, amongst other things. Interesting. Presumably NBN Co. got sick of waiting for your implementation study, Minister, because NBN Co.’s Mike Quigley says NBN Co. is seeking its own answers. He said last week:
We’re looking at the engineering tasks: how do you get this built, how do you define the product, how do you do the network architecture?
That is sounding like some of the things that Minister Conroy—good on you!—has shot home to the implementation study. It sounds suspiciously like, if nothing else, the minister’s promise that the implementation study will work through the detailed network design for the NBN. Mike Quigley of NBN Co. says the NBN Co. study will look at:
... how do you get this built ... how do you do the network architecture?
Why are Australian taxpayers—Australian mums and dads—presumably paying twice for the same thing? They are paying once through an implementation study that they might not even see and paying a second time through a study being done by NBN Co. We have not got an implementation study, yet we have got a trial rollout in places across the country and we have got the National Broadband Network rollout in Tasmania well advanced before any of these critical questions have been answered.
Trial NBN Co. rollouts to five locations across Australia might seem like action, but it is a cover over the lack of action on the NBN more broadly and proceeding before the minister has critical advice on how the NBN should take shape. The Adam Max wireless broadband project in Adelaide sounds like a great idea. It is covering black spots, it is co-sponsored by the South Australian government, but it is papering over the lack of services that should be delivered by the NBN, if it delivers anything at all.
We have not got an implementation study. What have we got? We have got lots of megabucks being paid to NBN Co. CEO, Mike Quigley, and the minister’s mate, Mike Kaiser. There have been many megabucks and not one new megabit. What else have we got? We have no implementation study but plenty of questions from the government’s own experts. Watch those experts, Minister, because they can turn on you if you do not heed their advice. Reg Coutts was a member of the government’s expert panel. You know that report, Minister, the one that you have not shown us yet either. Professor Coutts said in the media recently:
There has been worryingly little discussion of how the 10 per cent of the population not covered by the fibre network will get their broadband.
Professor Coutts went on to say:
I and many of the community are frustrated at the lack of progress in planning services for the 10 per cent who are beyond the NBN footprint. I do not understand why it has generated so little discussion, either in industry or in the community.
Be careful, Minister, who you pick because they can turn if you fail to heed their advice. The minister has repeatedly shoved aside critical answers to critical questions in his now all but infamous implementation study. In Senate estimates, when asked when and how the government will respond to the implementation study, the minister said:
As I have said, we are due to receive it by the end of February and then we will consider it.
Minister, February has come, February has gone and March is on the march. Where is your implementation study?
—I’ve got it.
—What about giving us time to look at it, Minister? If you have got it, Minister, how about giving the parliament and the Australian community time to look at the implementation study. This is an implementation study that you have spent, Minister, some nine months gestating. Will you give us nine minutes to look at it? Look at it another way: it took some $25 million of Australian taxpayers money to get it; will you give us 25 minutes to look at it? Give us a minute per million dollars. Give Australian taxpayers a minute per million dollars to look at it, Minister.
Minister, who is going to answer the ‘Who is going to get what’ under your $43 billion National Broadband Network plan? When are they going to get it? How are they going to get it? And how much will it cost them to get it? At the moment, there remain way more questions than answers. There are so many more questions than answers. The National Broadband Network—the NBN—is starting to sound more and more like ‘No body (k)nows’. Forget NBN aka National Broadband Network because it is looking like NBN aka ‘No body (k)nows’, least of all Minister Conroy; NBN aka ‘No body (k)nows’, least of all Rudd Labor. Yet, for that pleasure, Australian taxpayers are going to foot some $43 billion.
The opposition cannot support this bill, particularly if the provisions in part 1 of the bill are retained where a gun is held to Telstra’s head. Minister Conroy well knows that the Australian people, in a battle of David versus Goliath, will happily back David. Rudd Labor is punting on that, but what Rudd Labor is forgetting in that punt is that the Australian people also believe in fairness. In fact, they vehemently dislike unfairness and they are not going to like a gun to the head.
There is no case for the bill. That is a part of why Labor did not take the bill to the election. It is bad for shareholders, it is bad for rural and regional Australia and it is all about the National Broadband Network. And it is premature. The consumer measures in the bill are not scheduled to hit the deck, the consumer rubber will not hit the road, until July 2010. What is the hurry, Minister? In particular, what is the hurry, Minister, when you are sitting on the $25 million taxpayer funded implementation study?
What is the hurry, Minister? What is the hurry, Minister, and why this bill now, when at the same time the government has released an exposure draft of the NBN Co. bill that suggests that the minister will have the discretion to allow this taxpayer funded company—this government company—to go both wholesale and retail? That is new legislation that will allow the NBN Co. to do exactly that which Telstra is being told it cannot do. It is being told, ‘Cut out or get cut out,’ at the same time as the government is proposing to seek licence to give the government-sponsored company the right to be bought in, if you like, and to stay in. I think the Australian people will work out pretty quickly, Minister, that that ain’t fair. There is no need to consider this bill before we see the taxpayer funded implementation study. There is no need to consider this bill now, given it will be quite some time before the proposed consumer measures start operating. There is no need to consider this bill before we see the implementation study and there is no need to consider this bill until you, Minister, can convince the Australian taxpayers that ‘NBN’ stands for something other than ‘no body (k)nows’—least of all Rudd Labor and least of all you, Minister.
—You’re going to have to work hard to beat that one, Wacka!",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-03-10,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009. It looks like we have got it in stereo, with Minister Conroy already interjecting—


Senator Conroy interjecting—

—having his say from his seat over there. And it is Senator Wacka, by the way, Minister! I look back on telecommunications over my lifetime and I think back to the days in Jamestown in South Australia when we had the manual exchange and then we went to automatic—what a great update that was. When I moved to Inverell in 1979, to a farm near Bukkulla, three or four miles down the road, we went back to a manual exchange. If you wanted to ring some-one at lunchtime, between one and two, you turned the handle to dial and you would hear, ‘Are you calling Bukkulla? The exchange is closed for lunch.’ As time went on we too went to automatic, which was good. On many occasions I would ring my father to say hello and three minutes into the conversation there would be an interruption: ‘Three minutes has expired. Are you extending?’ Well, you never extended; you could never afford to extend. It had already cost you $3 for three minutes or something to call South Australia. Thank goodness, as time progressed, calls got much cheaper and the service much, much better.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Labor’s history of telecommunications in regional Australia is not a good history. I can recall when we had the analog phone system, the first of the mobile phone systems in Australia. What a good system it was. The clarity was magnificent and it worked very well. But of course the Keating government did away with the analog system and brought in a digital system, GSM.
—CDMA. That was in between.
—That was all very good if you were standing underneath a tower; then you might have reception. But once you got out of town a bit—

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—you might as well have lit a fire and got a smoke signal going, because the GSM was absolutely hopeless in regional Australia. Senator Conroy, with all his interjections, is probably not very proud of Labor’s history when it comes to the mobile telephone network.
Thank goodness that in 1996 we had a change of government. The coalition, driven by the National Party, introduced CDMA, and many towers were put up. CDMA was a good system. The coverage was much better over distances. With a car kit and a broomstick aerial on your car, you could pick up reception 30, 40 and 50 kilometres away from a tower.
Then we went on to take the next step, to Next G. Despite criticism by many, such as Tony Windsor and others, I find the Next G system also very good. In my car, with, as I said, the car kit and the broomstick aerial, I can actually drive from Inverell to Adelaide, 1,800 kilometres, and not be without a signal for longer than one minute on that trip. In fact, driving around much of the state, as I often do, it is very rare that I cannot get a signal. Thank you to the previous government for building those towers.
The point I want to make is that many of those country towns have only Telstra. I do believe that when something is a monopoly it should be retained by the government. I had reservations about the full privatisation of Telstra—I am being perfectly honest here, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop.
We now have the NBN plan being put forward by Senator Conroy and the Rudd government. At the last election, I think it was a $4½ billion plan for fast broadband with downloads of 12 megabits per second, to cover 98 per cent of Australians. Now we have 98 per cent getting fibre to the home and a budget blow-out from $4½ billion to a massive $43 billion. It will be interesting to see whether the $21 billion that is expected from the private sector will be forthcoming. The first thing they will want to know is how much of a return they are going to get on their investment—so they will be keen to see the business plan that none of us have seen as yet—to encourage them to put the money in.
—Why did you sell Telstra?
—I was not in the chamber at the time! The coalition financed and supported the construction of mobile towers over much of Australia.
There are a lot of towns in my area in northern New South Wales that have Telstra only—towns like Manilla, Barraba, Bingara, Ashford and Bundarra. All those little towns and communities have Telstra only. So my question is: as time goes on and we wish to upgrade to 4G spectrum, what is going to happen if Telstra is cut out of the bid for the spectrum network? What is going to happen to that network? What is going to happen in those small towns? If Vodafone and Optus do all the bidding and purchase the spectrum rights, I suppose we could expect those companies to set up mobile networks in these small towns of 400 and 500 people? I do not think so. They are private companies and they are not going to invest money to lose money. It is these small communities that are the ones that will miss out. They will be excluded from the upgrade. Those private companies will not be able to provide the better wireless broadband services to the people living in those communities and the surrounding areas. People in small regional communities will be excluded from it, and once again they will be the losers. But that is typical. That happened when Mr Keating wiped out the analog system and brought in the GSM digital network. Forget the bush; don’t worry about having a signal over any distance! As I said, stand under the tower and you might be able to make a call; move away from the tower and you might as well turn your phone off.
So tradition has not changed with the Labor Party. If Telstra is going to be excluded from the bid, that will be simply unfair to these smaller communities. Those are the communities that will miss out. Now the minister wants to take the big stick to Telstra. He wants to take the big stick and say, ‘You will separate or else I will belt you with the big stick.’ The big stick will be: ‘Telstra, you will not bid for the spectrum rights. You will be excluded.’ And those smaller country towns—and I have just mentioned a few, and there are hundreds of them—will be excluded from upgrading their services, their capabilities and their networks. Those in the small country towns will miss out again. That is what this is about. But it gets worse. As well as saying to Telstra, ‘You’re not going to bid for spectrum,’ the government is going make them sell their shares and make them get out of Foxtel and get out of pay TV. I thought we lived in a democracy, not a dictatorship. Senator Conroy is obviously turning that around. He is going to take the big stick and say, ‘You will do this, you will do that and you will do as I say or you’ll be out of the game.’
I support a one-network system to wholesale around Australia. That is fair and will give even and fair competition. That would be good. What is more: being a monopoly and an essential service, it should be retained by government. That is my opinion. I have thought that since my studies of economics back in 1972. If something is a monopoly and that thing is also an essential service, it should be retained by government. That is the attitude I have. Here we have a situation where the government says it is going to establish the National Broadband Network and set up the wholesale. I do not think it is not going to go into retail; although there are signs it is going to go into retail as well. Then it is going to cash in the monopoly. Why cash it in? I have just done some figures on the NBN, and the minister might be able to give me a reply. With $43 billion, we would be looking at a $5 billion a year gross return, so we would be looking at 12 per cent. We would need five million people to take up the system at $1,000 a year. That is a wholesale of $1,000 and perhaps a retail of $1,400 or $1,500 a year for the household.
What will happen if five million households and businesses in Australia do not take up the NBN? The income will be less, so the price per household will be more. I think the minister would agree with that. It would be interesting to see the planning on this and the expected return. I would be very interested to see what companies will come forward to put in this $21 billion. Or are taxpayers going to put it in? Who is going to fill the hole? If private industry does not come forward with $21 billion, who is going to fill the hole for that money? No doubt the government will have to fill the hole. Is that right, Minister? I ask as you depart the chamber, with a smile on your face. This is a serious problem I have. It would be wonderful to have a fast broadband network right around Australia. It would be great for medical reasons. You can imagine that a nurse in a small country town could set up the facility to have information on a patient go to a doctor in the city to inspect. As far as medical procedures go, it would be great. It would be wonderful. Of course, many in business would enjoy the 100 megabytes download to get on with their job more quickly. There is no doubt about that. But when we look at the cost, I have some reservations about this whole plan.
I will get back to this legislation and the big stick approach of the government—that is, ‘You will separate, Telstra, or else.’ That is what this legislation says. It says, ‘You will separate or else.’ The ‘or else’ means: ‘We will exclude you from the spectrum bid. You will not be able to bid for it.’ So those smaller country towns I mentioned will not be able to have an upgrade to their service. They will not be able to go to faster wireless broadband, for example. It is so common these days for people, instead of having a desktop computer at home, to choose to buy a laptop so they can move it around. In the smaller country towns, they will be excluded. That is simply unfair. Life is about fairness. This proposal for a big stick approach to Telstra is simply unfair. As a National Party senator, I cannot support something that is going to be unfair to those smaller regional communities. It is as simple as that. As for the big stick approach of saying to Telstra, ‘You will separate or you will sell off your interests in pay TV,’ as I said, do we live in a democracy or a dictatorship? That is wrong on all principles. No matter what side of this chamber people may sit on, that is wrong. It is wrong on all principles to say to a company, ‘You will do as we want you to do or else.’ That is what this legislation says.
As I said, telecommunications have come a long way in my lifetime—from the manual exchange of 1979 to the automatic phone to the mobile phone, from the analog system to the GSM digital system, to the CDMA and now to Next G and 3G. It would be good, as time goes on, to progress further. Some small country towns have Telstra only—no Optus, no Vodafone and none of those other carriers—and the customer base in those communities is too small for those other companies I mentioned to invest in mobile phone towers. Those companies will not do that. The cost would be too great and the return would be too little. So those towns that rely wholly and solely on Telstra will be the ones that will suffer the most. We cannot simply sit back and allow that to happen.
As I said, I support a wholesale, across-the-nation system delivering fast broadband and competition even. I know what wholesale and retail are about. When I was importing bolts out of Thailand, I was a wholesaler and a retailer. I know what it is like to compete against the retailers when you have that distinct advantage: you buy cheaper so you can sell cheaper and still cream off a pretty decent profit. That is what it is about when you own the wholesale and a retail network. You have a competitive edge. You can sell cheaper than your competitors. You can drive your competitors out of the market. The negotiations on this legislation to separate Telstra have been going on for months and months. I do not know where they are up to. When Minister Conroy let the cat out of the bag accidentally, I think the government was offering $8 billion and Telstra wanted $30 billion. There is a long way between $8 billion and $30 billion. I do not know where the negotiations have progressed to since then.
We hope that the separation does happen and that we do get a level playing field for all telecommunications carries in Australia. But to have this big stick approach is, I think, simply wrong. I cannot support the bill on those grounds. Many country communities, the smaller regional communities, throughout Australia have Telstra only. You can go out into the sticks, you can go to Cobar, you can go to Wilcannia, you can go where you like and you will find that all the people in those communities rely on Telstra. To have those people excluded because this bill says that Telstra will be forbidden to bid for the spectrum is, I think, simply wrong. It is also simply wrong by those smaller communities. As I said, as far as the other big stick approach goes, to force a company to sell their private interests raises some questions: ‘What are we up to? Where are we going?’ The government has this wrong. They need to negotiate with Telstra. They need to work it out with them and not expect this Senate to just hand a great big baseball bat to Minister Conroy so that he can put the heavies on Telstra and force it to separate. I oppose this legislation for those reasons.
I do hope that one day we have a national broadband network that operates on a level playing field and where there is consistent service, consistent cost and consistent delivery right across Australia. I have my doubts as to whether such a plan would be financially viable or whether it would provide a return. I am in two thoughts about the whole plan. As I said, for the government to want to sell it off later is to return a monopoly back to a private enterprise. My personal opinion is that there are a lot of questions to be asked about the whole program. As far as this legislation goes, it is wrong, it is unfair and I certainly could not support it.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-03-10,"—I rise this evening to comment on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009, which is a long way of saying ‘a bill for the structural separation of Telstra’. I place on record, in response to a question asked earlier by a senator from across the chamber, that when Labor came to government I took the wise decision of selling the Telstra shares that were under my control. Since I have been in this place, the evidence I have seen has served only to reinforce the wisdom of that particular decision.
When I came into this place I watched very carefully and was most interested to hear the comments of Minister Conroy. When asked about a business plan for the new NBN, he very proudly said to us, ‘There is no business plan.’ Coming from a business background and also a government executive background, I was somewhat dumbfounded and I thought perhaps he was joking. But, in fact, he was not joking. He was very pleased and very proud of the fact that he was going to commit $43 billion of borrowed money—borrowed taxpayers’ money; not money that he had in the bank or money that was left over from the coalition government, because by then it had already gone. He was quite happy to commit 43 thousand million dollars of borrowed money, upon which debt and interest would have to be paid for this ridiculous concept. When I thought about this, I thought to myself that maybe the minister in his arrogance, his ignorance and his inexperience did not commission a business plan because he did not know what they were all about. So, in responding to the bill this evening, I thought I would ruminate for a few moments on a business plan.
Business plans start with a vision. I went through all the documentation and I said to myself, ‘What most appropriately meets a vision statement for an NBN?’ and the best I could come up with was ‘a government owned and controlled enduring telecommunications monopoly’. I have not as yet been able to put that to the test, but it does seem from the documentation that I have read to be a fairly reasonable vision for an NBN and for the minister, had he bothered to commission a business plan. I then said to myself, ‘Well, if there was a vision, what might be the mission and the objectives of this particular exercise?’ As far as I can see from the studies I have done, the main objective of a business plan, if one had been done, would be to achieve the structural separation of Telstra. I will come back to that in some more detail later on.
Having addressed the objectives, one then turns around and says, ‘What are the targets for this new business?’ It seems to me that, in the main, the targets are Australian taxpayers and the shareholders, the customers and the employees of that company—that is, the publicly listed company, not the government owned monopoly called Telstra. I also would have hoped, as a person representing rural and regional constituents in my state of Western Australia, that this NBN Co. would be able to include in its targets improvements in services to the people in those areas. Regrettably, I do not see any evidence of that. Certainly Western Australian senators would say—and I am sure my colleague Senator Sterle would confirm this as he drives around Western Australia—
—And me.
—Senator Adams, thank you very much, as one who also comes from rural WA and spends a lot of the time there—that it is an absolute disgrace how short a distance one travels out of major centres, cities and towns in our state before one finds that there is no phone coverage of any sort at all. Talk about, as Senator Williams was earlier, some of the problems of the past! I think it would be very nice to be able to communicate in any way at all. It is great from a convenience point of view! When it comes to emergencies such as fires and floods and other sorts of emergencies, we rely on telecommunications to activate volunteers, and so we come to yet another problem.
But I will return to the business plan. After having looked at the vision and having dealt with objectives and what the targets might be, I think the next phase of the plan is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Regrettably, this government has decided that it does not need cost-benefit analyses. I will quote from an article written last year:
The most rational person in the government, finance minister Lindsay Tanner, says that there’s no point doing any cost-benefit analysis. We’ll just spend the money and we know ... they will come.
Presumably ‘they’ are customers in the future. So that was apparently the value of the cost-benefit analysis, or to further summarise:
In short, we are mounting a $43 billion assault on, and confiscating the assets of, Telstra for being a monopoly bloodsucker.
To replace it either with a sharing-caring, inevitably hopelessly inefficient government monopoly bloodsucker. Or a shared government-private bloodsucker.
Either which way having to suck much more blood to pay for the extra $43 billion.
In a properly structured organisation and a properly developed business plan, what do we get out of a cost-benefit analysis? The first thing we start to do is have a look at what revenues we might expect, but we cannot get any figures out of the government as to what they see the revenues will be. The second thing we look at in our modelling are alternatives and options for expenditures. Only then do we learn that this marvellous plan is being rolled out to the most magnificent places. I was delighted to hear the other day that Midway Point in Tasmania is one of the three targets, which is fantastic. I remember travelling through Midway Point often when I lived in Tasmania, and you did not have to spend long doing it. So I hope they are not expending too much money on Midway Point as one of the trial sites. When you come back to the question of expenditure, you learn that in fact the costings for this enormous rollout of wired technology have apparently not included connections to households. Therefore, we do not know yet what it will cost households to actually link into this technology. We heard from Senator Williams earlier. He quite rightly said that for every one or 10 or a thousand residents who do not link up to it, it is only going to cost the others more.
Interestingly enough—and if the minister were here he could get this one down—within a cost-benefit analysis a very important milestone is a thing called GMROII, gross margin return on inventory investment. That is the very thing that drives retail business day to day, the very matter that drives your intention in terms of how much you will invest in inventory, and unfortunately we cannot get any sort of figures because, in the words of Minister Tanner, a cost-benefit analysis is a complete and utter waste of time. Therefore, I simply ask this question from a cost-benefit analysis point of view: how can anybody on this side be asked to vote, to consider or to look at anything associated with this legislation if the most basic building blocks are not being delivered to us?
In our business plan we come next to competition, and what an amazing thing it is. But at this point in time I must seek leave to continue my remarks as I understand there is some administrative business to be completed before we go to adjournment. So I will act on your direction, Madam Acting Deputy President, as to whether I can get started on competition or we revert to administrative business.
 (Senator Crossin)—Thank you, Senator Back. You are actually a minute early, but as you have offered up your time we will move on. We will proceed to the next item of business.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-03-10,"—Tonight I want to talk about a subject which is dear to my heart—that is, the defence of Australia. I was alarmed to see in the Age this morning an article quoting Professor Peter Leahy of the Australian National University, in which he was quoted as calling for cuts to our defence budget so that more can be spent on diplomacy and aid programs. Professor Leahy is a retired Lieutenant General and was Chief of the Australian Army from 2002 to 2008. His views must be treated with respect, but I must disagree with his reported comments. I do not think our national interest would be served at this time by cutting our defence budget.
We live in an increasingly dangerous part of the world. Professor Leahy correctly identified some of the threats to regional security, including climate change, mass migration and pandemics. But there are others—terrorism, maritime piracy, rogue states, failed states and the rivalry between emerging regional powers—and these threats can only be met by defence preparedness. It is a fact of life that Australia has had to spend more on defence, and that is not going to change. Our region is becoming the cockpit of rivalry between the US, China, India, Japan and others. We have territorial disputes in the oil-rich islands of the South China Sea. We have seen crises in our region in East Timor and the Solomon Islands that have required our intervention. We have piracy in the waters to our north and in the Indian Ocean. We have the operations of people smugglers on our maritime borders and we have ongoing military operations in Afghanistan.
These many and varied problems present a challenge in terms of defence procurement. Modern defence assets such as ships and aircraft have very long lead times. They must be ordered 10 or even 20 years before they actually become available. It is a very difficult thing to predict the defence environment which will exist at the time we take delivery of these assets. We saw this with the F111 fighter-bomber. The Menzies government ordered the F111 in 1963, during the time of President Sukarno’s anti-Western confrontation policy. By the time these planes became operational with the RAAF in 1973, some 10 years later, President Sukarno was dead and Indonesia was our friend and ally. The F111s are still flying 37 years later, and as far as I am aware they have never fired a shot in anger. But who in 1963 could have predicted Australia’s strategic environment in 2010? Clearly no-one could have. We did need to be prepared for various possible long-term contingencies, up to and including an attack on Australia or the threat of it. That is why the F111s were a sound investment, despite the criticism incurred at the time through delays and cost overruns.
The same considerations apply to the Lockheed Martin F35 Joint Strike Fighter. We ordered these aircraft in 2002, with an initial purchase of 14 and longer term options for up to 100. They are expected to be in service by 2018. If they are operational for as long as the F111s were, we could still be flying them in 2050, although their current predicted retirement date is between 2030 and 2040. Some critics have suggested we do not need a fighter aircraft of this level of sophistication, and indeed at something like $100 million each they are an expensive purchase. The F111s, as I recall, cost $5 million each. That reflects the radically increased cost of modern defence technology. But I repeat that we cannot know what our strategic environment will be in 10, 20 or 30 years—certainly not in any forensic way.
Maybe these aircraft will never be used. But we cannot plan on the basis of ‘maybe’. Who could have predicted in 1922 that in 1942 Singapore would fall to the Japanese and Australia would be facing the threat of invasion? Fortunately, in those days it did not take 20 years to develop and build a fighter aircraft. But today it does. We have to plan on the basis that there may be long-term threats to Australia’s security. I am strongly of the view that the F35 is the right aircraft for Australia’s future defence needs, whatever contingencies may emerge. As a stealth multirole fighter, it can perform close air support, tactical bombing and air defence missions. It is therefore sufficiently flexible to be adaptable to the wide variety of security threats that we may have to face over the next 30 years.
The F35 features some of the most advanced defence technology in the world, particularly in its radar and communications systems. It includes many of the features of the Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS. It generates signals over a wide range of frequencies in an unpredictable fashion to ensure a low probability of being detected—allowing it to see but not be seen. As early participants in the Joint Strike Fighter development project and as part funders of it, we will have privileged access to this technology. Only the UK, Canada and the Netherlands will have similar access. This is an important point. These will be the most modern fighters in existence. The fact that so few countries will have access to that technology greatly enhances the attractiveness of this purchase to Australia.
It is true that there have been recent setbacks to the F35 in the US, with the expected operational date for the aircraft being pushed back from 2013 to 2015. But that does not affect Australia, because we allowed for such delays in our planning. We expect to receive our first F35 for training and test flights in 2014 and our first squadron for operational use in 2018. In the meantime, we have bought 24 FA18 Super Hornets to tide us over in the period between the retirement of the F111s and the arrival of the F35s.
I commend the Rudd Labor government for its determination to see that Australia’s defence needs are provided for by remaining firmly committed to the purchase of the F35. I think those who argue against defence capabilities of this type are seriously misreading our defence environment. Support for this purchase and this program has been, and I hope will continue to be, bipartisan in nature. Of course, we need to pay attention to diplomacy, to aid programs, to intelligence and to nation building in our region. These continue to be very important priorities for our diplomats and government. But we must not shy away from the fact that the foundation of national defence is the ability, in the last resort, to deploy firepower—an unpalatable but eternal truth. It is the credibility of a nation’s deterrent force that makes the need actually to use that firepower less likely. The F35 will provide Australia with a powerful deterrent force for decades to come and will thus help to preserve the peace.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Defence Procurement</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
