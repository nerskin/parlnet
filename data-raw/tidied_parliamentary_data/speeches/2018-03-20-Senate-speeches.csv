Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (12:01):  In accordance with the order of the Senate of 14 February 2018, I rise to ask for an explanation from the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, regarding the failure to engage in detailed consultations with the states and territories on remote housing.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Indigenous Housing</title>,DOCUMENTS,2,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-03-20,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:02):  I thank Senator Dodson for that question and for the opportunity to respond—as I have done in much detail, through the 52 documents we provided as part of this order for the production of documents. As the order demonstrated, I am clearly in negotiations with state and territory governments, and I refer you to the documents, particularly documents 1 to 6—reference to my letters to my state and territory counterparts. As this order for the production of documents shows, my officials have been in discussions with their state and territory counterparts since 2017, and that would be standard, for discussions to commence after the MYEFO, before a national partnership agreement expires. The order to produce documents also shows that I have written to the states and the Northern Territory government with an unequivocal commitment to future Commonwealth investment in remote housing.


But I asked the states and the Northern Territory to provide advice on any investment they have made in remote public housing, given public housing is a state and territory responsibility. I also asked for any future funding commitments states and territories are willing to make. I'm strongly of the view that state and territory governments should make a contribution and not treat the residents of remote communities differently from communities in any other part of their state or territory jurisdiction. Why should the residents of Bamaga, Palm Island, Mimili or Jigalong be treated any differently by their state governments? I welcome the response from the Northern Territory government in my negotiations and its commitment to $110 million a year, which I look forward to investing not only in partnership with the Northern Territory but in partnership with Aboriginal leadership and with Aboriginal control for the first time.


I'll obviously have to give some grace to the South Australian government, given it has been in caretaker mode through this process. But I have to say, Senator, I won't be as gracious with your counterparts in Western Australia and Queensland. To date, Queensland and Western Australia have not put a single dollar on the table when it comes to remote housing in either of those states. I will just repeat that: they haven't put a single dollar on the table when it comes to remote housing. So you should be asking Mick de Brenni and Peter Tinley, the housing ministers for Queensland and Western Australia, why no commitment has in fact been made. But I'm here and willing to stand up for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians living in remote Australia, despite your defence of Western Australia's and Queensland's lack of commitment in this important area.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (12:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I thank the minister for complying with the order to produce documents and also for providing me with advance copies of his ministerial letters on the issue. His cooperation with the Senate order is noted and appreciated. Nevertheless, the issue which gives rise to the order remains. As we've just heard, he's obviously got problems with my minister in Western Australia and the minister in Queensland.


The documents confirm the fact that this government has abruptly and unilaterally closed the door on a decade of commitment to remote housing, primarily for First Nations families. Since 2008 the Commonwealth government has cooperated with state and territory governments to address the urgent needs that have been unmet of First Nations communities in remote Australia. These governments—Labor, Liberal and Liberal National Party; all political persuasions—combined to work together for a decade to improve health and wellbeing outcomes in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through better housing outcomes. The thinking behind this cooperative approach is clear, agreed and a strong consensus view.


In 2008 COAG agreed to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement, which sets out a joint commitment to the National Integrated Strategy for Closing the Gap in Indigenous Disadvantage. A key building block of that agreement was healthy housing:


A healthy home is a fundamental precondition of a healthy population. Important contributors to the current unsatisfactory living conditions include inadequate water and sewerage systems, waste collection, electricity and housing infrastructure (design, stock and maintenance). Children need to live in accommodation with adequate infrastructure conducive to good hygiene and study and free of overcrowding.


To support this building block, the strategy was agreed between the Commonwealth and all jurisdictions, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. The main aim of the agreement was to decrease overcrowding and increase housing amenities. The Commonwealth committed $5.4 billion through the strategy from 2008 to 2018. The aims were to build and refurbish houses in remote Indigenous communities and, where appropriate, town camps, including delivery of housing related infrastructure; implement robust and standardised property and tenancy management of all remote Indigenous housing; and increase employment opportunities for local residents in remote Indigenous communities.


By 2018 the strategy will have delivered over 11,500 more-liveable homes in remote Australia—around 4,000 new homes and 7,500 refurbishments. It is estimated that over 2,000 jobs have been created, most of them in remote communities where a steady, secure job is as rare as a win in TattsLotto. This increase in supply is estimated to have led to a significant decrease in the proportion of overcrowded households in remote and very remote areas, falling from 52.1 per cent in 2008 to 41.3 per cent in 2014-15, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The government's own independent review panel projects that this will fall further to 37.4 per cent by 2018.


These are real achievements made by the program. Real jobs have been created, safety has improved and health preconditions have improved. If there were real leadership from the Commonwealth, this government would have built on these achievements and looked ahead to the maintenance of a joint effort. Getting in and keeping the work going: that's what we needed. The government's independent panel recommended that, after accounting for population growth, an additional 5,500 homes were required by 2028 to reduce the levels of overcrowding in remote areas to acceptable levels. It may well be beyond that figure, but that's the figure we were told. The remote panel recommended the key matters were: a recurring program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets; investment for an additional 5,500 houses by 2028 is needed to continue the efforts on closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage; the cost of a remote Indigenous housing program should be equally shared—and I take the minister's point: it should be equally shared, not given up on because someone won't talk to you—between the Commonwealth and the other jurisdictions; and a regional governance structure should be established to facilitate better administration of the program.


It is clear that these are worthwhile recommendations that should be considered and carefully implemented. The documents produced by the minister—we have been pushing for them for some time, since last year—show that these recommendations have been followed through in part, but in a remarkably idiosyncratic way. Rather than considered negotiations, given the sensitivities and importance of this issue and its bipartisan basis, the minister has abruptly chosen this ill-conceived approach. Most of the documents provided—45 out of the 52—relate to correspondence between state and territory officials and Commonwealth officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Most of them relate to the organising of meetings with joint steering committees of officials between the Commonwealth and the states.


It is appreciated that, in supplying these documents, there needs to be some redactions to avoid providing information that may be commercial-in-confidence, or could damage Commonwealth-state relations and would infringe the privacy of individuals. We accept and understand that fact, but for the life of me I cannot understand which of these provisions is applied to annexure 19. The cover page is of an email indicating the content is a draft letter to the minister from the Norther Territory jurisdiction. Dated 5 December 2017, it's just highlighted with blanks. I'm not sure how to read this; I have no capacity to understand what it says. That's annexure 19. The attachments, some 22 pages, are completely redacted—black page after black page—except a few where the Northern Territory coat of arms is not redacted. That's the only reason I understood it.


I've looked closely at the correspondence between officials. It would seem to me that the release of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December 2017 was the catalyst for a range of meetings between officials. This was when the states and territories were informed, directly or indirectly, that the existing arrangements for remote housing were not likely to continue past June 2018. This was the first indication that a decade of Commonwealth-state cooperation was coming to an abrupt end. Most of the papers, however, go to wrapping up the reporting to the Commonwealth on expenditure of the current financial year. There is little in the way of any negotiations with the states on any ongoing contribution to a bilateral partnership to continue the work. This is where the correspondence between ministers is critical to an understanding of how this was playing out. There is no indication of that.


For my own state of Western Australia—and I'm glad the minister is meeting with my ministers this week, and I hope something more productive than this exchange takes place—the first letter on the issue was dated 11 December. In that letter he indicated that his department had commenced discussions with states about 'the future of remote Indigenous housing and how a new housing program might look'. It seems from the documents provided that such a meeting was not scheduled until 22 February, just last month, at the regular meetings of the joint steering committee.


Minister, it is evident that there were no formal intergovernment communications on the issues of intergovernmental agreements on the future of the program. It is evident that there was no high-level dialogue aimed at ensuring that the states and territories were willing to contribute in a bipartisan way to the future of the program. There was no sustained effort to redesign the program to meet the recommendations of the independent review and to build on the successes of the program.


Minister, it seems evident that you got rolled in the ERC, the Expenditure Review Committee, that the cabinet of this government decided to pull up the drawbridge on a decade of collaboration, and that there was no effort on the part of you as a minister, or your officials, to enter into serious, respectful and transparent negotiations on remote housing. You did not pick up the phone, it seems to me, to commence negotiations or invite the participation of the states and territories into an ongoing program. Instead, there have been a series of statements from the Prime Minister, Minister Wyatt and Minister Scullion.


The Prime Minister responded to two questions without notice in the House on Thursday, 8 February, saying:


I just confirm that we are negotiating a new agreement for remote housing with the jurisdictions who remain part of the terminating program. 


We can now ask if that statement was accurate at the time, given the correspondence shows that the ministers of South Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia were not signed until that day. On the same day, 8 February, Minister Wyatt told the House:


The negotiations that we will continue to have with state and territory governments on this are important …


Minister Wyatt had earlier said:


The funding has not been cut. It has not been reduced. Senator Scullion is in ongoing negotiations with the relevant ministers.


We now question whether Minister Wyatt's statement was correct. On 12 February, Minister Scullion told the Senate in answer to my question:



A national partnership involves every state and territory. It is self-evident that New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria are no longer in it. So now we're moving to a bipartisan approach. We've made the announcement with the Northern Territory and we're still in discussions with the other states and territories.


Minister, a couple of letters rushed out of your office to back up the statements in the House and a planned officials meeting in a couple of months time are not at all the grounding for solid bipartisan negotiations.


Regrettably, the order to produce documents demonstrates poor faith in negotiation matched by unimaginative leadership; a tendency to say that things are progressing when they have not commenced; and especially a lack of concern for First Nations communities in the maintenance of the essential building block of safe, secure and heathy housing.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:19):  I rise to take note of the response from Minister Scullion. As shadow minister for housing and homelessness I deal with community groups who are trying to deal with homelessness and housing issues around the country. Today at the Press Club there is an engagement between community housing groups and faith based organisations, which they're calling Everybody's Home. Everybody's Home is absolutely essential, because without housing, you can't educate or look after your kids, nor get a decent health outcome for your family. Housing is so important. Day after day I get reports and see the problems of the lack of engagement from this government on housing and homelessness. What you see in the general community is nothing compared to what you see in Indigenous communities: the lack of effective policy for decent housing and the increase in homelessness are absolutely terrible.


For Minister Scullion to stand up and blame the lack of progress on what he describes as a lack of graciousness from state ministers is another demonstration of the incapacity of this government to show any leadership on social issues in this country. One of the key areas where some leadership should be shown is Indigenous housing. This minister put together a review of Indigenous housing. Let's have a look at some of the recommendations of this minister's own review:


A recurrent program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets.


Minister, that's what you should be doing. You should be in there talking and engaging with the states, but you don't feel it should be done because ministers are ungracious. You should be doing it for Indigenous communities in this country, because they need decent housing. They need to get rid of overcrowding and improve their health and education outcomes. As Minister for Indigenous Affairs you should be engaging with the states, showing some leadership and dealing with this issue. You even put your own report on the backburner and did nothing about it, because you deemed those ministers to be ungracious. It's not about whether or not you're gracious; it's about outcomes for Indigenous communities.


Your own report talks about an additional 5,500 houses needed by 2028 to continue efforts in closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. You don't do that by coming here and having a pot shot at state ministers; you fix that by sitting down with the states and providing a decent outcome. It's alright for the National Party, who don't give a hoot about Indigenous disadvantage or disadvantage in regional and rural areas.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What nonsense!




Senator McGrath:
  You live in Sydney; you've never been to regional Australia.




Senator CAMERON:
  It's alright for you guys sitting there and going on at me when I'm raising a key issue. You're just not in the game on regional or Indigenous housing. You're absolutely hopeless, a government that has no idea about the key issues facing Australians—especially Indigenous Australians.




Senator McKenzie:
  Like mining jobs!




Senator CAMERON:
  Mining jobs? That's all these people can talk about. Indigenous people are dying in regional communities because of bad health, have no access to decent housing and are living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and all this minister can do is to say, 'The states are ungracious, because they won't talk to me.' You need to show some leadership. Why the National Party have been given Indigenous housing beggars belief. The National Party, of all groups in this area, have no clue about what is required for housing. Another recommendation the review talks about is:


The costs of a remote Indigenous housing program should be shared 50:50 between the Commonwealth and the jurisdictions.


I'm sure the jurisdictions—the states—would be happy to talk to this minister about the key issues needed. Because by not getting an agreement in place, we've actually seen some good things happen over the years as a result of the Labor Party's initiatives in this area to deal with insecurity in housing, bad health outcomes and bad education outcomes in Indigenous communities. 


What this minister should be doing is getting on the phone today, ringing the various states and getting them to a meeting to get an agreement in place. He shouldn't be hiding behind the secrecy that this government revels in. You're a do-nothing government. You don't answer any questions and you ignore the key issues for Australians and Indigenous communities. You should stop hiding behind bureaucracy, and you should stop hiding behind your incapacity. You should be getting some decent advice. Look at the recommendations that have been put in place and actually deal with the issue of looking after Indigenous communities.


The recommendation also said that there should be a regional governance structure to facilitate better administration of the program. What has the minister done about improving regional governance structures? Not much. There should be greater transparency. A regional governance and performance framework would be better than a collection to be made available to individuals and communities. Where is that up to, Minister? All you do is come here and make excuses. All you do is come here and hide behind the bureaucracy. You hide behind what someone else is not doing, instead of showing some leadership as a minister and dealing with one of the great social problems in this country.


The recommendations also said there should be a five-year rolling plan to fix the program. Where is the rolling program? What initiatives have you come up with? Absolutely nothing. You can't even communicate effectively between your ministry and the representative minister in the House of Representatives. We get different stories from each area. This is a minister who is just not up to the task. I've come to the conclusion this minister is not up to the task. The National Party can moan and wail all they like, but they are not up to the task either. When it comes to housing, when it comes to homelessness, when it comes to Indigenous housing, the National Party do not have a clue how to fix any of those issues. These are key issues. When we've got Indigenous families with intergenerational health issues, surely the National Party and this minister should be taking the issues seriously, not coming here and simply saying it's ungracious of the state governments. You need a bit of leadership and a bit of backbone to stand up against those in your own party—those in the National Party and those in the Liberal Party—who don't care about Indigenous housing or Indigenous social disadvantage. How about a bit of backbone, Minister? Stand up and do something to fix these terrible problems that Indigenous communities are facing.


Where is the comprehensive planning across governments? Where is the funding that you should be putting in place? You have failed to do it as a minister, and you have failed to deliver for Indigenous communities. The first thing you lot did was to cut half a billion dollars out of support for Indigenous communities around this country—that was your first act. The 2014-15 budget will never be forgotten in this country. That was when you stood back and allowed Indigenous funding to be cut across a range of portfolios. You should stand up, you should show some commitment, and you should get in there and argue in your cabinet to make sure that the Indigenous communities in this country are looked after.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  We've got Senator O'Sullivan bellowing away in the background continually. They're doormats for the Liberal Party until One Nation actually becomes the partner for the Liberal Party—they'll be pushed to the side by One Nation. You are too worried about your relationship with the government and your relationship with the Liberal Party.




Senator McGrath:
  They are the government.




Senator CAMERON:
  No, they're not the government; they're the doormats. We know fine and well what the National Party are: the absolute doormats, with no capacity to deliver on key policy issues.

Senator McKenzie:
  I know we've got Senator Cameron on his favourite topic, but his last three or four minutes of diatribe are not relevant to the matter before the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thanks, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher. Again, they're trying to shut people down when the message doesn't suit them; that's their position: We know that the National Party are in absolute chaos. We know that the National Party are leaderless. We know that the new leader of the—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. Senator McKenzie on a point of order.




Senator McKenzie:
  I rise on a point of order, on relevance. Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Cameron's contributions since you made your earlier ruling on my point of order have been simply to continue to talk about the National Party and not actually talk about the motion before the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I don't believe there is a point of order, but I do encourage Senator Cameron to return to the topic before the Senate.




Senator CAMERON:
  Well, I'm happy to return to the incompetence of the National Party and the incompetence of the minister who is a member of the Liberal-National party and who is unable to deal with the issue of Indigenous housing, unable to deal with the issue of Indigenous health and unable to deal with the issue of Indigenous education. And when asked to show some leadership, failing to show any leadership is pretty typical of the National Party—pretty typical of the government from the Prime Minister down. They are not prepared to deal with the real issues affecting people in this country and are unable to make sure that there is employment in those areas.


Here we are with a national partnership that has created thousands of jobs for Indigenous people around this country. The housing program put in place by Labor created thousands of jobs. It created hundreds of businesses. It created hundreds of apprenticeships and brought some capacity for long-term, stable jobs relating to housing in Indigenous areas. And this minister has been incapable of understanding that it's not just about housing: it's about health; it's about education; it's about employment; and it's about getting an economy established in the Indigenous areas. This is a minister absolutely incapable of dealing with issues of importance in his own portfolio. He is an absolute failure in this area, an absolute failure. Just ask the National Party what a failure—a leaderless failure—we have as a member of this government.


We have huge issues for Indigenous groups around the country. Overcrowding has come down a bit, but not enough. Indigenous health is still a problem under this government. Indigenous education is still a problem. Indigenous people can't get decent health and can't get decent education unless they've got a home to go to, a home that is culturally appropriate for Indigenous groups. These are the issues that this minister should be dealing with. These are the issues that this minister seems to be incapable of dealing with. This minister allowed half a billion dollars to be cut out of Indigenous support in this country and said nothing about it; he was mute when it came to an attack on Indigenous communities around the country. That was how he started off his career as Minister for Indigenous Affairs—a failure to start with, a failure ongoing and a failure in the future.


That's why we need a change of government. We need a change of government federally so that we can look at exactly the issues that are needed for both Indigenous communities and communities around the country. We need to stop this ideological attack by the coalition against Indigenous people, against the trade union movement, against workers' penalty rates and against the rights of workers when they go on the job. This is an absolutely pathetic government that shows no leadership and has no capacity to understand how difficult it is for Indigenous communities around this country to make their way, with bad housing, poor health outcomes and poor education outcomes.


Minister, it costs money to fix these problems and you are incapable of getting a clear commitment or negotiating with the states to get an outcome on housing for Indigenous communities around this country. You should pick up the phone, you should talk to the various ministers across the country who have responsibility for this area, you should get a national agreement put in place, you should look at the recommendations that your own review recommended and you should start implementing them. We've got children dying in Indigenous communities because of overcrowding and unsanitary situations. You've been there now for years. You have failed to deal with some of the basic problems in Indigenous communities in this country. You are too busy carving each other up, too busy fighting with each other and too busy defending the absolutely indefensible as a government—a rabble of a government, a government with no capacity to lead, a government with no economic policies and no social policies. All you want to do is use fear and loathing as the basis of your policy proposals.


This is a government that is in absolute decline; a government in internal decline. And nothing epitomises the decline of this government more than their approach on Indigenous affairs. We've got the Closing the Gap approach, and this government, who were going to be the grown-ups—well, no-one can look at this government and use the word 'grown-up'—have failed to deal with the key issues that are important to all communities in this country, especially Indigenous communities. You can argue all you like about what you may have done and what you will do, but the reality is that you have failed miserably to deal with the issues of health, education and housing for Indigenous communities.


You must get a situation where we've got a minister that can actually focus on this. I don't think there is one politician on the Liberal-Nationals side, either in the lower house or in the Senate, who has the capacity to deal with these issues, because you are so obsessed with each other, so obsessed with having a go at each other and so obsessed with the rabble that you have become that you cannot concentrate on the key issues for Indigenous communities in this country. We need to improve the health of Indigenous communities. We need to improve education for Indigenous communities. We need to ensure that there is a business case to build these houses, and that's the job of this minister. This minister has been incapable of delivering on what is a fundamental right everywhere in the world, and that is to have a roof over your head. This minister is just incapable of doing that.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  And it doesn't matter how much Senator O'Sullivan rants away behind the minister, trying to defend the indefensible; it is just not going down with the community. The community know that you are a rabble. The community know that you are incompetent. The community know that you are weak from the Prime Minister down—a weak Prime Minister and weak ministers, incapable of dealing with education, incapable of dealing with health and incapable of dealing with the issues facing Indigenous communities. Maybe, Minister, your next contribution should just be to resign and make sure that we get somebody in that can actually look after the Indigenous community, because you patently cannot.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:40):  I rise to take part in this debate on the motion to take note of the minister's explanation. This is an extremely important issue that, it is very clear, needed very strong leadership from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has been investing in remote housing—in fact, in social housing—for a long time, but in particular in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing. This is an absolutely essential area where the Commonwealth should be providing leadership, and it was very clear, even before the review came out, that there was a need for ongoing Commonwealth involvement and, in fact, an agreement with the states and territories around this issue. That was confirmed, of course, through the review document, which clearly points out in its leading recommendations:


1. A recurrent program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets.


2. Investment for an additional 5,500 houses by 2028 is needed to continue efforts on Closing the Gap on Indigenous Disadvantage.


It was very clear that there was need for further investment and that there is a need to continue to build houses.


But just as important was to send the signal very early that this was going to occur. We all know in this place—because I'm sure every single senator has had representations from constituents on these programs, whether it's the remote housing program, soil and land conservation programs or whatever programs you're talking about—that, as programs are coming to an end, there is a need to send a very clear signal as to whether they're going to continue, because things grind to a halt. You lose essential staff, contracts can't be made and they can't plan for the future.


What we see here are a lot of organisations and a lot of people that are employed, because part of this process is employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It's very clear that signals should have been sent much earlier than they were that this program was going to continue. There has been huge disquiet in the sector about knowing the future of this program. Yes, the program to date has been addressing issues of overcrowding, but, as the review pointed out, more houses are needed. You just have to go into communities to know that we still have an exceedingly high overcrowding problem.


On top of this, this has also manifested in concern in communities, because in my home state of Western Australia—and we heard Senator Dodson talking about our home state earlier—we have had to contend with the past government talking about closing remote communities. Then, when there's uncertainty over whether this housing funding is going to continue, that exacerbates concerns that still exist in communities about closure of those communities. Again, there is a need for some leadership to be clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth.


I think that we could fund a number of years worth of election campaigns if I had a dollar for every time I heard the Commonwealth government blame the states and territories and the states and territories blame the Commonwealth. It happens in this place virtually every day, and that's exactly what we're seeing here: blame for the state and territories and failure to show leadership, despite the fact that it was very clear that further investment is needed and that the community expects the Commonwealth to be showing leadership on this issue and on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues in general.


On one hand, while we've got the government failing to take action here, we've got the Refresh program for Closing the Gap. We know that housing is absolutely fundamental to addressing issues of Closing the Gap. We need to be addressing issues around the social determinants of health, and we know that housing plays a critical role there. An issue we are yet to resolve is otitis media and the impact it has on Aboriginal children, and poor housing and overcrowding is a key component of that issue. We had a workshop in Perth the week before last, where we were talking about those essential social determinants of health to ensure that we can deal with this. Make no mistake, OM is at pandemic levels in this country. We have one of the highest rates of OM in the world, if not the highest. This is just one example of the issues that we are yet to resolve where housing plays an absolutely critical role. We have to reduce and get rid of overcrowding. We have to ensure that people can live in hygienic circumstances. As the review pointed out, we have to ensure that existing houses are maintained and we have preserve their functionality and increase the life of the housing assets. That is absolutely critical. But building more houses and addressing this issue in remote communities is absolutely essential. I have addressed OM in particular because it is an issue that I think is fundamental; it is a classic example of why we need to be addressing this issue.


I have had a lot of contact from constituents asking about this. People are asking a lot of questions. Why the focus first on NT? It has been commented that half of the housing problem is in the NT. Does that mean that half of the money is going to the NT? Why was the focus there first? I appreciate that there are some very important issues there. I have been in the communities a lot of times, so I understand the nature of those issues in the Northern Territory. But we also have those fundamental issues in Western Australia, as does Queensland. These are important issues that people want answers to. I put in a long list of questions at estimates, which I presume will go to the minister at some stage when the department has answered them. They are fundamentally important. Organisations also need to know whether this funding is going to continue. In terms of planning into the future, communities need to know. Employment programs will cease if there is not ongoing commitment to these programs in a timely manner.


As I said, we knew a long time ago that this investment was going to have to continue. Yet we are still playing the blame game. Yes, of course there has to be investment from the states and territories. But a much more conciliatory approach to negotiations, in a timely manner, should have occurred first instead of being reduced to this game of brinkmanship. From the outside, to a whole number of people, it looks like that is what is happening. Delays will cause very significant issues to building programs, to employment, to the outcomes that we are all looking for. So at the same time that we are talking about the Refresh program and updating Closing the Gap, we are back to basic principles of fighting over housing. That is essentially what we are talking about here. We are back to fighting over housing, and the delays that brings with it.


We know very well, as I said when I started, that urgent action is needed to address this issue. To those who have been working in this space—including the minister, who has been working in this space for a very long time, organisations that have been working in this area and communities that have been agitating to know what the future of this program will be—it's absolutely clear that it needs to continue.


Ever since I've been in this chamber, I think, we've been debating this issue. We've also been debating funding for this issue. Every time a funding program is about to run out, we are back to debating who pays, when they are going to sign up, how much it's going to be, and what the states and territories are going to kick in—all of those issues. You would have thought by now that we could have been addressing those issues in a timely manner. But, no, we're not. We're back to this issue yet again, with people waiting with bated breath to find out what funding will be available and what states are going to be putting in. As I said, it's fair enough that states are contributing as well. But it's all happening again at the very last minute. Again, how many times have we been in this place having these debates about programs? It comes down to the line when they are going to be funded, and this is yet another example.


It comes back to a lack of leadership in trying to get these issues resolved. The government are trying to withdraw the Commonwealth from these issues if they can possibly get away with it. It's time that this issue was resolved as a matter of urgency. That may mean getting the states together with the Territory to resolve this issue. It is absolutely critical that this issue be resolved, that there be certainty and that the recommendations be implemented, such as the additional investment with a recurrent program so that these sorts of debates don't have to be held every time a funding program is going to run out. We know, as was pointed out in the review, that 5,500 houses are needed by 2028. Let's get in place an ongoing recurrent program that deals with this issue so that we can accomplish the elimination of overcrowding, so that there is certainty for the program and so that there is certainty that we can have a Closing the Gap Refresh, knowing that a key component of that can be delivered. We are not going to close the gap if we don't address some of these fundamental social determinants, of which housing is a critical component. If we don't address that issue, we will fail to close the gap, and that has been pointed out by many people who have been contributing, particularly recently, on this extremely important area of investment, where the Commonwealth can show leadership and in fact must show leadership.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (12:53):  I rise to speak in response to the explanation on housing provided to the Senate by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. In his statement, he mentions that he waits for each territory and state jurisdiction to show the money. Well, in the Northern Territory, the Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, and the housing minister, Gerry McCarthy, have worked on their preparation in terms of what they will offer with housing across the Northern Territory, and they have put forward $1.1 billion over 10 years. I would like to let the Senate know that this was the first offer, I think—and correct me if I'm wrong—from a state or territory jurisdiction to the Commonwealth in terms of that full-time commitment.


The minister made a comment in relation to that in Gunbalanya in January, and that comment was to support the payments by the Territory, so naturally there was a great deal of positive confirmation coming from the federal government at that point. However, that has since been rescinded. It is not the $1.1 billion commitment in equal terms with the Northern Territory over 10 years, which is a great concern.


Reading through these documents that have been tabled by the minister, a number of things come up. One of them that comes up straightaway—and I think it's important for the Senate to be aware of some of the issues—is that here we have a jurisdiction that has shown the money, so to speak, and yet we do not have the political will within the Turnbull cabinet to support a jurisdiction that has already shown the money. We know, in the Northern Territory in particular, the desire to have improved and certainly increased housing for our remote communities.


Looking through the papers that the minister has tabled here in the Senate, there is an agenda item, from 'Capital works milestone'—it has been redacted, so I'm not sure who it has been prepared by—which focuses on this situation: 'As of 30 November 2017, a total of 117 new houses have been completed since July 2016, with 122 new houses underway.' The Commonwealth, then—and I understand this to be the COAG meeting—in November, was alerted to the fact that the NT government 'remains committed to deliver the target of 300 new houses under the national partnership on remote housing, as per schedule F of the agreement, but the achievement of that target by 30 June this year is at risk, due to factors that are outside the Northern Territory government's control. These include—again, this is for the benefit of the Senate, to understand the intricacies that impact on the lives of First Nations peoples in this country. The first issue here is leasing. Delays in securing land tenure have delayed contracts being awarded, most notably in the communities of Yarralin, Pirlangimpi and Mutitjulu. There are seasonal impacts. The wet season in the Northern Territory has considerable impact on the ability to deliver capital works, and the 2017-18 wet season has commenced early in some parts of the Northern Territory, including at Amanbidji, a community programmed to receive six new replacement houses. The third area of concern, in terms of these risk factors, is transitional accommodation. Capital works cannot commence in a community until appropriate accommodation is provided for people who need to move from a dilapidated house or those needing a new house, so they can be accommodated somewhere in the interim. So works have to be aligned to ensure transitional housing is in place, to avoid delays.


The Northern Territory government requested then, in November, via ministerial correspondence, that the new house target of 300 be revised to an achievable 243 by 30 June 2018, with a commitment that the remaining new houses be contractually committed to this date and then rolled over beyond June 2018 into the financial year of 2018-19. The status of that request is still unclear. But, again, that was an important request by the Northern Territory government.


There are issues that are compounding here for residents in the Northern Territory. Again, these are questions for the minister and his department. There is the issue of rental payments as a key element of funding for repairs and maintenance. The current system of tenancy management is dependent on large rental contributions from tenants. So what is the impact of the record and disproportionate number of fines and suspensions of unemployment benefits and CDP payments to Aboriginal tenants? We've had debates in here about CDP payments and the concerns in relation to breaching and those participants on CDP who are breached. There is actual evidence within the housing department that shows there are concerns as to the rental payments because of reductions in people's CDP payments and welfare benefits.


The other question around housing for the Northern Territory is homelands and town camps. In 2012 the Labor government set aside $10 million from the ABA funds for homelands and outstation housing. In 2015 a full audit of homeland and outstation housing and infrastructure was conducted by the Centre for Appropriate Technology in Alice Springs with the support of the Commonwealth and territory governments. The Commonwealth is now insisting that the land councils carry out a similar audit to determine the priority for infrastructure investment in the same homelands and outstations.


So what payments will be made for the land councils to be able to rescope infrastructure work on outstations? These are the conversations that need to be had well before June 2018. Hasn't the Commonwealth previously stated that it wants no further involvement with outstations since it paid out the Giles government? The Commonwealth created 600 to 700 outstations from the 1960s onwards, and has now walked away from any responsibility in that regard. In terms of town camps, the Commonwealth has offered nothing to address the substandard infrastructure that it created across the Territory.


We know that the minister is currently underway with the Closing the Gap Refresh. One of the areas that consistently comes up is the importance of housing. As we've heard previously from Senator Dodson and Senator Cameron, the importance of housing and homelessness links to the fact that we cannot close the gap in health, in education or in employment. I know that as part of the conversations that are now taking place around closing the gap, it is absolutely critical that this government looks at the importance of housing and the lack of it, and the impact that it's having on the very policy that it stands up to give a report on in the House in February every year on the life expectancy of First Nations people. The government needs to connect it.


If there were the political will 10 years ago to have a 10-year agreement on an incredibly visionary housing program for our country and for our remote and regional areas, where is the political will today? It is completely absent, abrogating every kind of responsibility to find excuses and reasons why it is not this parliament's duty to the First Nations people of this country to make sure that the government shows leadership in navigating a way through the absolutely complex and political process within the state and territory jurisdictions to have that vision again. Have that vision again! Have the backbone to have that vision again. Have the will to have that vision again. That's what is required for a 10-year vision on housing for our remote and rural regions in this country.


I'll give you another example. Only 18 months ago—in fact, the minister may remember this—we celebrated the handback to the community of Yarralin in the VRD region, west of Katherine. We celebrated the handback after 40 years where the people of Yarralin had been waiting and had their struggle for land. The story is that a group of Aboriginal workers walked off the job at a cattle station in the NT over 44 years ago to protest about a lack of pay and about mistreatment. Today, more than 50,000 hectares belong to them. Fifty thousand hectares of land were returned at that moment. I was there, the minister was there, the Northern Land Council was there and all the men, women and children of the VRD region were there. What was promised as part of that handback was at least 20 new houses and 17 upgrades. I have spoken with people from that region who are incredibly disappointed that not enough has been done in that space. And that's just one example of a number of communities that are waiting.


I say to the Prime Minister: if you want to close the gap, if you are sincere about wanting to close the gap, you have to be committed in every way—not cherry-picking when you want to dive in and dive out—and you've got to back it all the way. We know that housing is a critical aspect of improving the lives of everyone, and the ones who need it the most in this particular instance are the First Nations people of our country. The cabinet needs to have the backbone and the vision, because it is within your power to make a real difference here. It is within your power to break the stalemate. It is within your power to rise above the politics of every situation here when you look at the figures of our families and our children on the ground, who desperately need this parliament to get it right. Thank you.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (13:06):  I rise to take note of Minister Scullion's comments. What we now know is that, under the Turnbull government, housing in remote communities will continue to be overcrowded for years to come. The minister's comments were underwhelming. No-one could have confidence that the Turnbull government has a commitment to remote housing with what we're seeing in how this policy is playing out and what we've heard today. We know this is not just a housing crisis; it's a jobs crisis. While the current program is not perfect, it's not adequate to the degree that's needed, what it has done is provide not only some houses but also desperately needed jobs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. What we have here is both a housing crisis and a jobs crisis because of the appalling way the government is acting.


We know that the current program had reduced overcrowding by 46 per cent. There are few success stories when it comes to this federal government and housing. Again, this program is not perfect, but it's heading in the right direction. So here we had something in the housing area at a federal level that actually had something to show for what it set out to do. What I'm referring to there is that it was delivering new homes, refurbishing homes, providing maintenance for homes. That is significant for anybody, but when you live in overcrowded premises it's incredibly important.


I thank Senator Dodson for putting forward this motion so that we can have this debate and assist the remote communities—particularly in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, as well as across the whole country—that are now in such an uncertain period. It really has put the spotlight on the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. I also congratulate my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert for her work in this area, which has been very extensive. She spelled it out very clearly, as have others, in her speech about how important housing is for those other essential rights, basic human rights, of education, of health.


All of these issues are connected, and when you have overcrowding you're going to run into so many other problems that are impacting on people's day-to-day lives and costing the government money. So much of what they're doing here is short-sighted. We know the remote housing program is not a huge amount of money, so what is going on here? This is a real reminder of how this really is a government of inequality. Previous federal governments committed $776 million to the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. It's been cut to $100 million. That extra $676 million that they think they're saving—I mean it's not a huge amount of money. It should have been improved, increased, not what we're seeing here today.


What we also know—and this comes from the latest census work of the Australian Bureau of Statistics—is the whole impact that overcrowding has on communities. It really is worthwhile reminding ourselves how serious this is. The ABS stated that the overall number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experiencing homelessness in 2016 was 23,437 and more than two in three were living in severely crowded dwellings. Those figures are shameful. We are a rich country and this should not be happening. The ABS stated that people living in severely crowded dwellings—which are defined as requiring four or more extra bedrooms to accommodate the people who usually live there—was the greatest contributor to the national increase in homelessness. It is disgraceful that this is where we are at in this country. These are recent figures; that is the latest census data.


Again, we should remind ourselves about the overall housing crisis caused by the shocking policies of the federal government—and I acknowledge that the work of many of our state governments in this area is also below par. The 2016 census data showed that the rate of homelessness in Australia over the last five years has gone up by 5.6 per cent. It is increasing, not decreasing; it is not even staying the same. At every turn, the way this federal government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, is handling housing is shameful. Again, that is why they are increasingly being called the government of inequality.


The National Partnership Agreement for Remote Indigenous Housing and the Remote Housing Strategy have been very significant. The remote housing review gives us some insight into how significant it has been. By this year, the strategy will have delivered 11,500 more livable homes in remote Australia. And I will repeat a comment I made earlier. When we are talking about the number of homes that are being delivered, there are new homes, there is refurbishment and there is maintenance. And what does that mean? It means hundreds and hundreds of jobs. And we cannot emphasise enough how important that is in remote Australia.


In regard to overcrowded dwellings for people in remote areas, the review found that this increase in supply is estimated to have led to a significant decrease in the proportion of overcrowded households in remote and very remote areas—falling from 52.1 per cent in 2008 to 41.3 per cent in 2014. The panel projects that this will fall further—to 37.4 per cent by 2018. That is really welcome; those figures are good; at least it is heading in the right direction. There could be a lot more improvement, but I would still say that it is welcome; there is much more to do, but it is welcome. It is welcome because we know we need to improve the strategy and continue to invest in remote housing. The remote housing review has recommended that an additional 5,500 houses be built.


Where does all that sit with where the government is at now? I have not read all the documents that the minister has put forward, but you would have thought he would put all the good news up top—and there wasn't good news there in terms of the uncertainty this whole sector is facing. The minister has been incredibly inadequate in terms of how he has handled the portfolio. The minister really has questions to answer here. Why has it taken so long? Why has it got to this point? What justifies leaving communities and housing providers in so much uncertainty? That is one of the very shocking things that is going on here—where it leaves these communities. We don't know why they are doing that, but we do know the impact it is having. Firstly, it is reckless and it is mean-spirited and it is bringing more hardship and uncertainty. When it comes to housing, people should be confident that they and their family and their loved ones—the people they are sharing their home with—can have a roof over their head and not have to be worried about it in a month's time or a year's time. That is a human right. People have a right to homes and to have secure housing. It is actually set out as a human right, but this government appears not to know that.


Again, let's emphasise that we're not talking about a lot of money here. It's been about $540 million per year so far. Compare that to the roughly $8 billion of public money we're expected to dish out, and we do dish out, that goes on the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discounts in one year alone. This why I say we're a rich country and we can afford it. We know where the money can come from: clean up negative gearing and clean up capital gains tax discounts. That's one way to reduce the inequality in this country and have money to fund these essential programs.


Essentially, what the Turnbull government should be doing here is to end the uncertainty. That's the first thing. They need to come out with a very clear position that the current system remains and that it's going to be improved on, and we're not all left wondering what happens when this 10-year agreement ends. The state and territory governments should not have to siphon off already constrained funds for these housing programs. You get the sense when you listen to the federal government that that's their idea with housing, 'Oh, well, it's basically a state issue and so we can just get away with pushing it onto state governments.'


As I've heard other speakers say, the Turnbull government needs to find some backbone on this. They need to find a commitment. Again, we hear all the fine statements about Aboriginal rights and Closing the Gap, but here is a case in point: this is where they can actually do the job, and, surely, that's what they should be doing. What we've heard today from the Liberals and Nationals is another reason why this government needs to be defeated. It's ruthless, it's shocking and this is clearly another example why this government should be voted out of office. Thank you.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-03-20,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:16):  There have been a number of contributions and I thank everybody for them. I particularly acknowledge my senator colleague from Western Australia, Senator Dodson. I know you have an ongoing and genuine interest in this matter, and I thank you for your ongoing interest, mate.


I will try to deal with a number of the questions and assertions that've been put up, but let me, perhaps, get the dross out of the way first. Senator, your contribution certainly stood in stark contrast to the contribution from the shadow housing minister. I wasn't actually aware that Senator Cameron was the shadow housing minister. When he got to the four-minute mark he decided to blither on to personal insults and to say that the National Party doesn't care about Indigenous people. I guess we're used to it. There are some people in this place—there's certainly one—who everybody in Australia should factor in. He is so offensive in his nature that he should just be ignored. We do our best under a torrent of specific and personal offence given by this man. We don't forgive him. He's just what he is and we just ignore it. It was insightful that he ran out of steam after four minutes and went into the remainder with the of sort of rubbish he normally makes in a contribution.


But h should be held to account for a couple of things. He said that Indigenous homelessness has increased. He's the shadow minister, he should have a bit of a clue about that, wouldn't you reckon, Senator Dodson? He should have a clue about a fact that he's just put on the table. He said, 'Indigenous homelessness has increased.' Perhaps I can point him to a number of articles and statistics that he should inform himself of—after all, this is his shadow portfolio. The number of Indigenous people counted as homeless has fallen by 12.3 per cent in the five years leading up to 2016, and it goes on. I'm not suggesting in any circumstance that that is okay, but to say that it's gone up not down, I think, is something he won't ever be held to account for. Nobody takes him seriously, but I thought I would, again, just correct the record.


There were a couple of other issues. Senator Dodson, you brought up document 19, and I agree, to have an entire document that is redacted you'd think was a bit awkward, but I have it on good advice that this is the process. This process of redaction is by agreement. I will tell you, through the redactions, it was actually a draft letter from your colleague in the Northern Territory government. It was a confidential draft working document that belonged to Gerry McCarthy, the housing minister in the Northern Territory.


Throughout this debate, there may well have been positions put that have not been clearly understood. So let me be absolutely crystal clear: the Commonwealth remains committed to remote housing. But, as for the increase, we want the states and territories to take their place. We want them to take responsibility for their housing. It is entirely their responsibility, and I believe that they have abdicated that responsibility over the entire time of this agreement. I believe that if they are held to account in the way they can be we can get the same outcome that the leadership of the Northern Territory and the federal government have provided for.


What I'm saying about the Northern Territory outcome is that twice as much money will now be invested, twice as much as ever before. That's not a bad bloody outcome. And we have Indigenous people who are standing right there, making sure the administration and all of the other processes in place are actually observed in a transparent way. We have ownership by Aboriginal people and the land council. It is significant reform not only in the amount of money that goes in but in how it is provided. On all of those predictions, we can reach them in half the time if we can build twice as many houses, so this is an outcome that is achievable.


There's been a general theme of: 'I'm very nervous; it's all at the last minute.' But the fact of the matter is that in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia—the builds that are going on at the moment—the notion that everyone will finish on the 30 June 2018 is a complete nonsense. I'm very much aware of the program. And in Queensland assertions were made that everyone has to finish on the 30 June 2018 by no less than the Queensland local government authority, mostly from North Queensland. I had quite a large contingent come and see me to say they were concerned. I said, 'That's an odd concern to have. I'm not like that. Why would we do that?' They said, 'It was put to us by Minister De Brenni directly that I had written a letter to him saying that everyone has to put pens down on 30 June 2018.' I said, 'There's no such letter, I said no such thing.'


It's pretty disingenuous for people to suggest this program is suddenly ending. There's a large taper. In Queensland it will go on for a long time, 12 months or so in addition to the remaining period of time. And so I am absolutely confident that we'll come to a settlement on where we go in Queensland, Western Australia and in South Australia. The Northern Territory has already got a clear direction where we're going to go, so there's not going to be a hiatus of activity in this particular area. 


People have been talking about leadership, particularly about me, and asking why don't I show some leadership? As I have just indicated, you could not ask for a better outcome. I went to the Northern Territory government. They run their budget on an annual basis, unlike the Commonwealth—we run our budget over three-year forward estimates. That is entirely a matter for them. It is just a different way in terms of scale. I am not criticising them for that. They've indicated they're going to put $110 million in a fund, not in their own budget, and I've said that we'll match whatever you put in that fund. They indicated there's one year's funding in the fund and they are going to get back to me about the second year, and I hope to have it on the second year. We'll be matching the funding they put in there. As I have indicated, you can't ask for much more than doubling the investment in some of the most needy parts of Australia. That opportunity is, in fact, available to Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. As I indicated earlier, I can give some grace to the South Australian government, because they've just been in caretaker mode and they're unable to negotiate through letters—that's just a fact—but it is very important that we continue to make a joint effort.


What I want out of the state and territory governments and what I've asked them to provide—as you'd see by your letter, Senator Dodson—is effectively three things. I think people need to know how many dollars they have provided from their own budgets over the last decade. The Commonwealth are clear: we've invested $5.4 billion. That's been our investment in NPARIH. We've also made some investment through special purpose payments, national partnerships and Commonwealth rent assistance. Commonwealth rent assistance puts it up to about $49 billion or $50 billion in the last decade. Commonwealth rent assistance will take that apart. Whilst it's a huge number, I think we need to set that aside and just look at those funds that were available for investment by the states and territories that were funds given to them. I know that, because we have records of the funds that have been provided to the Queensland government, to the Western Australian government, to the South Australian government and to the Northern Territory government over that period of time.


I want to know how much of their own funds they've provided from their own budgets. I'm talking about 'in remote areas', and that's actually defined. I've asked them if they would provide the number of houses that have been built by them in those areas. I've also asked them: 'How many dollars are from the Commonwealth funds that we provided you for public housing for your most needy?' Between the special purpose payments and the national partnerships on homelessness, over the last decade there's been about $5.5 billion in those specific areas. That's an investment that could've been made to the most needy in those jurisdictions. The most needy live in those remote areas. That $5.5 billion is almost the same as the Commonwealth amount, isn't it, Senator Dodson? Imagine what you could do with that. I've asked them: 'How did you go with that, and how much have you invested?' Western Australia had $1.5 billion of discretionary funds that they could have invested over the last decade, Queensland had $2.6 billion, South Australia had a tad over $1 billion and the Northern Territory had $300,000. That's the discretionary funding that has been allocated over the last decade for investment in public housing. I wanted to know that. I think it's very important we all know that.


It's very important, as we go into the future, that people talk to me. Senator Dodson, you said, 'We need to be serious. We need to be respectful. This needs to be a joint effort. This needs to be a collaboration. This needs to be equally shared.' I agree entirely, which is why we're taking this approach. We've asked them that. I have to say, Queensland has written me back a highly political letter. You would have seen that. It doesn't tell me anything, and it certainly doesn't answer those questions. The most fundamental question, of course, is: how much are you going to put on the table in the future, given what you've just done? I haven't got an answer from Western Australia, but I'm really looking forward to meeting with their minister later this week.


The answers to those are the sorts of questions I think you should be putting to your Minister for Housing in Western Australia. We've had New South Wales take on its own responsibilities. That's it; they're out—they're taking on their own responsibilities. The funds that they get they're now allocating to the most in need, and their remote areas they're going to be able to service. Victoria have taken the same approach. They're going to be servicing those people most in need. Tasmania has said, 'I'm going to take over my responsibilities as a state, and a fundamental responsibility is the provision of public housing.' Yes, the Commonwealth help out in certain ways. We now need the same approach.


I know what the states have been provided. I want to know how much has come out of that. I want the answer to the question, but sadly—through you, Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, to Senator Dodson—it appears, certainly in Queensland, and I'm looking closely at Western Australia, they haven't provided the answer to the question of how much of that discretionary $2.6 billion did they actually invest? I suspect the answer is zero. It is just depressing to think about why that would be the case. Perhaps because of the colour of someone's skin you would decide that these discretionary funds are not available to an entire demographic because they happen to live in remote areas. I'm not sure of the answers to those questions, Senator Dodson, but I am, as you are, looking forward to them. As I've indicated, I will share the answers in the letters from the jurisdictions with you and other interested parties.


I hope I have dealt with most of the issues that were brought up. People have indicated there is some concern. There were some discussions about outstations and the $40 million, of course, that is going through the ABA, Senator McCarthy. I have been in discussions with all four land councils, as you'd be aware, and we want to ensure that that is rolled out using Indigenous labour and procurement.


I thank everybody for participating in this important debate. It is so important, as Senator Dodson indicates, that this should be a shared responsibility. I think the rolled-gold example is the example of the Northern Territory government. The Northern Territory government have stepped up to the plate. They have been fair dinkum. Yes, they can only do it year by year, but they've indicated that about $110 million a year will be forthcoming. We've indicated that we'll meet that. We've also indicated that it will be separate from the Northern Territory government's budget and that it will be overseen by including the land councils in that. That's a significant move forward. I would encourage the other states to genuinely and openly embrace this opportunity to be part of a future in which your First Australians in your jurisdictions are an absolutely central part of that.


In conclusion, I thank the Senate for the debate, and I look forward to further negotiations with the state and territory jurisdictions.

 (Western Australia) (12:01):  In accordance with the order of the Senate of 14 February 2018, I rise to ask for an explanation from the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, regarding the failure to engage in detailed consultations with the states and territories on remote housing.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Order for the Production of Documents</title>,DOCUMENTS,2,2
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-03-20,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:02):  I thank Senator Dodson for that question and for the opportunity to respond—as I have done in much detail, through the 52 documents we provided as part of this order for the production of documents. As the order demonstrated, I am clearly in negotiations with state and territory governments, and I refer you to the documents, particularly documents 1 to 6—reference to my letters to my state and territory counterparts. As this order for the production of documents shows, my officials have been in discussions with their state and territory counterparts since 2017, and that would be standard, for discussions to commence after the MYEFO, before a national partnership agreement expires. The order to produce documents also shows that I have written to the states and the Northern Territory government with an unequivocal commitment to future Commonwealth investment in remote housing.


But I asked the states and the Northern Territory to provide advice on any investment they have made in remote public housing, given public housing is a state and territory responsibility. I also asked for any future funding commitments states and territories are willing to make. I'm strongly of the view that state and territory governments should make a contribution and not treat the residents of remote communities differently from communities in any other part of their state or territory jurisdiction. Why should the residents of Bamaga, Palm Island, Mimili or Jigalong be treated any differently by their state governments? I welcome the response from the Northern Territory government in my negotiations and its commitment to $110 million a year, which I look forward to investing not only in partnership with the Northern Territory but in partnership with Aboriginal leadership and with Aboriginal control for the first time.


I'll obviously have to give some grace to the South Australian government, given it has been in caretaker mode through this process. But I have to say, Senator, I won't be as gracious with your counterparts in Western Australia and Queensland. To date, Queensland and Western Australia have not put a single dollar on the table when it comes to remote housing in either of those states. I will just repeat that: they haven't put a single dollar on the table when it comes to remote housing. So you should be asking Mick de Brenni and Peter Tinley, the housing ministers for Queensland and Western Australia, why no commitment has in fact been made. But I'm here and willing to stand up for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians living in remote Australia, despite your defence of Western Australia's and Queensland's lack of commitment in this important area.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (12:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I thank the minister for complying with the order to produce documents and also for providing me with advance copies of his ministerial letters on the issue. His cooperation with the Senate order is noted and appreciated. Nevertheless, the issue which gives rise to the order remains. As we've just heard, he's obviously got problems with my minister in Western Australia and the minister in Queensland.


The documents confirm the fact that this government has abruptly and unilaterally closed the door on a decade of commitment to remote housing, primarily for First Nations families. Since 2008 the Commonwealth government has cooperated with state and territory governments to address the urgent needs that have been unmet of First Nations communities in remote Australia. These governments—Labor, Liberal and Liberal National Party; all political persuasions—combined to work together for a decade to improve health and wellbeing outcomes in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through better housing outcomes. The thinking behind this cooperative approach is clear, agreed and a strong consensus view.


In 2008 COAG agreed to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement, which sets out a joint commitment to the National Integrated Strategy for Closing the Gap in Indigenous Disadvantage. A key building block of that agreement was healthy housing:


A healthy home is a fundamental precondition of a healthy population. Important contributors to the current unsatisfactory living conditions include inadequate water and sewerage systems, waste collection, electricity and housing infrastructure (design, stock and maintenance). Children need to live in accommodation with adequate infrastructure conducive to good hygiene and study and free of overcrowding.


To support this building block, the strategy was agreed between the Commonwealth and all jurisdictions, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. The main aim of the agreement was to decrease overcrowding and increase housing amenities. The Commonwealth committed $5.4 billion through the strategy from 2008 to 2018. The aims were to build and refurbish houses in remote Indigenous communities and, where appropriate, town camps, including delivery of housing related infrastructure; implement robust and standardised property and tenancy management of all remote Indigenous housing; and increase employment opportunities for local residents in remote Indigenous communities.


By 2018 the strategy will have delivered over 11,500 more-liveable homes in remote Australia—around 4,000 new homes and 7,500 refurbishments. It is estimated that over 2,000 jobs have been created, most of them in remote communities where a steady, secure job is as rare as a win in TattsLotto. This increase in supply is estimated to have led to a significant decrease in the proportion of overcrowded households in remote and very remote areas, falling from 52.1 per cent in 2008 to 41.3 per cent in 2014-15, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The government's own independent review panel projects that this will fall further to 37.4 per cent by 2018.


These are real achievements made by the program. Real jobs have been created, safety has improved and health preconditions have improved. If there were real leadership from the Commonwealth, this government would have built on these achievements and looked ahead to the maintenance of a joint effort. Getting in and keeping the work going: that's what we needed. The government's independent panel recommended that, after accounting for population growth, an additional 5,500 homes were required by 2028 to reduce the levels of overcrowding in remote areas to acceptable levels. It may well be beyond that figure, but that's the figure we were told. The remote panel recommended the key matters were: a recurring program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets; investment for an additional 5,500 houses by 2028 is needed to continue the efforts on closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage; the cost of a remote Indigenous housing program should be equally shared—and I take the minister's point: it should be equally shared, not given up on because someone won't talk to you—between the Commonwealth and the other jurisdictions; and a regional governance structure should be established to facilitate better administration of the program.


It is clear that these are worthwhile recommendations that should be considered and carefully implemented. The documents produced by the minister—we have been pushing for them for some time, since last year—show that these recommendations have been followed through in part, but in a remarkably idiosyncratic way. Rather than considered negotiations, given the sensitivities and importance of this issue and its bipartisan basis, the minister has abruptly chosen this ill-conceived approach. Most of the documents provided—45 out of the 52—relate to correspondence between state and territory officials and Commonwealth officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Most of them relate to the organising of meetings with joint steering committees of officials between the Commonwealth and the states.


It is appreciated that, in supplying these documents, there needs to be some redactions to avoid providing information that may be commercial-in-confidence, or could damage Commonwealth-state relations and would infringe the privacy of individuals. We accept and understand that fact, but for the life of me I cannot understand which of these provisions is applied to annexure 19. The cover page is of an email indicating the content is a draft letter to the minister from the Norther Territory jurisdiction. Dated 5 December 2017, it's just highlighted with blanks. I'm not sure how to read this; I have no capacity to understand what it says. That's annexure 19. The attachments, some 22 pages, are completely redacted—black page after black page—except a few where the Northern Territory coat of arms is not redacted. That's the only reason I understood it.


I've looked closely at the correspondence between officials. It would seem to me that the release of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December 2017 was the catalyst for a range of meetings between officials. This was when the states and territories were informed, directly or indirectly, that the existing arrangements for remote housing were not likely to continue past June 2018. This was the first indication that a decade of Commonwealth-state cooperation was coming to an abrupt end. Most of the papers, however, go to wrapping up the reporting to the Commonwealth on expenditure of the current financial year. There is little in the way of any negotiations with the states on any ongoing contribution to a bilateral partnership to continue the work. This is where the correspondence between ministers is critical to an understanding of how this was playing out. There is no indication of that.


For my own state of Western Australia—and I'm glad the minister is meeting with my ministers this week, and I hope something more productive than this exchange takes place—the first letter on the issue was dated 11 December. In that letter he indicated that his department had commenced discussions with states about 'the future of remote Indigenous housing and how a new housing program might look'. It seems from the documents provided that such a meeting was not scheduled until 22 February, just last month, at the regular meetings of the joint steering committee.


Minister, it is evident that there were no formal intergovernment communications on the issues of intergovernmental agreements on the future of the program. It is evident that there was no high-level dialogue aimed at ensuring that the states and territories were willing to contribute in a bipartisan way to the future of the program. There was no sustained effort to redesign the program to meet the recommendations of the independent review and to build on the successes of the program.


Minister, it seems evident that you got rolled in the ERC, the Expenditure Review Committee, that the cabinet of this government decided to pull up the drawbridge on a decade of collaboration, and that there was no effort on the part of you as a minister, or your officials, to enter into serious, respectful and transparent negotiations on remote housing. You did not pick up the phone, it seems to me, to commence negotiations or invite the participation of the states and territories into an ongoing program. Instead, there have been a series of statements from the Prime Minister, Minister Wyatt and Minister Scullion.


The Prime Minister responded to two questions without notice in the House on Thursday, 8 February, saying:


I just confirm that we are negotiating a new agreement for remote housing with the jurisdictions who remain part of the terminating program. 


We can now ask if that statement was accurate at the time, given the correspondence shows that the ministers of South Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia were not signed until that day. On the same day, 8 February, Minister Wyatt told the House:


The negotiations that we will continue to have with state and territory governments on this are important …


Minister Wyatt had earlier said:


The funding has not been cut. It has not been reduced. Senator Scullion is in ongoing negotiations with the relevant ministers.


We now question whether Minister Wyatt's statement was correct. On 12 February, Minister Scullion told the Senate in answer to my question:



A national partnership involves every state and territory. It is self-evident that New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria are no longer in it. So now we're moving to a bipartisan approach. We've made the announcement with the Northern Territory and we're still in discussions with the other states and territories.


Minister, a couple of letters rushed out of your office to back up the statements in the House and a planned officials meeting in a couple of months time are not at all the grounding for solid bipartisan negotiations.


Regrettably, the order to produce documents demonstrates poor faith in negotiation matched by unimaginative leadership; a tendency to say that things are progressing when they have not commenced; and especially a lack of concern for First Nations communities in the maintenance of the essential building block of safe, secure and heathy housing.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:19):  I rise to take note of the response from Minister Scullion. As shadow minister for housing and homelessness I deal with community groups who are trying to deal with homelessness and housing issues around the country. Today at the Press Club there is an engagement between community housing groups and faith based organisations, which they're calling Everybody's Home. Everybody's Home is absolutely essential, because without housing, you can't educate or look after your kids, nor get a decent health outcome for your family. Housing is so important. Day after day I get reports and see the problems of the lack of engagement from this government on housing and homelessness. What you see in the general community is nothing compared to what you see in Indigenous communities: the lack of effective policy for decent housing and the increase in homelessness are absolutely terrible.


For Minister Scullion to stand up and blame the lack of progress on what he describes as a lack of graciousness from state ministers is another demonstration of the incapacity of this government to show any leadership on social issues in this country. One of the key areas where some leadership should be shown is Indigenous housing. This minister put together a review of Indigenous housing. Let's have a look at some of the recommendations of this minister's own review:


A recurrent program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets.


Minister, that's what you should be doing. You should be in there talking and engaging with the states, but you don't feel it should be done because ministers are ungracious. You should be doing it for Indigenous communities in this country, because they need decent housing. They need to get rid of overcrowding and improve their health and education outcomes. As Minister for Indigenous Affairs you should be engaging with the states, showing some leadership and dealing with this issue. You even put your own report on the backburner and did nothing about it, because you deemed those ministers to be ungracious. It's not about whether or not you're gracious; it's about outcomes for Indigenous communities.


Your own report talks about an additional 5,500 houses needed by 2028 to continue efforts in closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. You don't do that by coming here and having a pot shot at state ministers; you fix that by sitting down with the states and providing a decent outcome. It's alright for the National Party, who don't give a hoot about Indigenous disadvantage or disadvantage in regional and rural areas.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What nonsense!




Senator McGrath:
  You live in Sydney; you've never been to regional Australia.




Senator CAMERON:
  It's alright for you guys sitting there and going on at me when I'm raising a key issue. You're just not in the game on regional or Indigenous housing. You're absolutely hopeless, a government that has no idea about the key issues facing Australians—especially Indigenous Australians.




Senator McKenzie:
  Like mining jobs!




Senator CAMERON:
  Mining jobs? That's all these people can talk about. Indigenous people are dying in regional communities because of bad health, have no access to decent housing and are living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and all this minister can do is to say, 'The states are ungracious, because they won't talk to me.' You need to show some leadership. Why the National Party have been given Indigenous housing beggars belief. The National Party, of all groups in this area, have no clue about what is required for housing. Another recommendation the review talks about is:


The costs of a remote Indigenous housing program should be shared 50:50 between the Commonwealth and the jurisdictions.


I'm sure the jurisdictions—the states—would be happy to talk to this minister about the key issues needed. Because by not getting an agreement in place, we've actually seen some good things happen over the years as a result of the Labor Party's initiatives in this area to deal with insecurity in housing, bad health outcomes and bad education outcomes in Indigenous communities. 


What this minister should be doing is getting on the phone today, ringing the various states and getting them to a meeting to get an agreement in place. He shouldn't be hiding behind the secrecy that this government revels in. You're a do-nothing government. You don't answer any questions and you ignore the key issues for Australians and Indigenous communities. You should stop hiding behind bureaucracy, and you should stop hiding behind your incapacity. You should be getting some decent advice. Look at the recommendations that have been put in place and actually deal with the issue of looking after Indigenous communities.


The recommendation also said that there should be a regional governance structure to facilitate better administration of the program. What has the minister done about improving regional governance structures? Not much. There should be greater transparency. A regional governance and performance framework would be better than a collection to be made available to individuals and communities. Where is that up to, Minister? All you do is come here and make excuses. All you do is come here and hide behind the bureaucracy. You hide behind what someone else is not doing, instead of showing some leadership as a minister and dealing with one of the great social problems in this country.


The recommendations also said there should be a five-year rolling plan to fix the program. Where is the rolling program? What initiatives have you come up with? Absolutely nothing. You can't even communicate effectively between your ministry and the representative minister in the House of Representatives. We get different stories from each area. This is a minister who is just not up to the task. I've come to the conclusion this minister is not up to the task. The National Party can moan and wail all they like, but they are not up to the task either. When it comes to housing, when it comes to homelessness, when it comes to Indigenous housing, the National Party do not have a clue how to fix any of those issues. These are key issues. When we've got Indigenous families with intergenerational health issues, surely the National Party and this minister should be taking the issues seriously, not coming here and simply saying it's ungracious of the state governments. You need a bit of leadership and a bit of backbone to stand up against those in your own party—those in the National Party and those in the Liberal Party—who don't care about Indigenous housing or Indigenous social disadvantage. How about a bit of backbone, Minister? Stand up and do something to fix these terrible problems that Indigenous communities are facing.


Where is the comprehensive planning across governments? Where is the funding that you should be putting in place? You have failed to do it as a minister, and you have failed to deliver for Indigenous communities. The first thing you lot did was to cut half a billion dollars out of support for Indigenous communities around this country—that was your first act. The 2014-15 budget will never be forgotten in this country. That was when you stood back and allowed Indigenous funding to be cut across a range of portfolios. You should stand up, you should show some commitment, and you should get in there and argue in your cabinet to make sure that the Indigenous communities in this country are looked after.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  We've got Senator O'Sullivan bellowing away in the background continually. They're doormats for the Liberal Party until One Nation actually becomes the partner for the Liberal Party—they'll be pushed to the side by One Nation. You are too worried about your relationship with the government and your relationship with the Liberal Party.




Senator McGrath:
  They are the government.




Senator CAMERON:
  No, they're not the government; they're the doormats. We know fine and well what the National Party are: the absolute doormats, with no capacity to deliver on key policy issues.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thanks, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher. Again, they're trying to shut people down when the message doesn't suit them; that's their position: We know that the National Party are in absolute chaos. We know that the National Party are leaderless. We know that the new leader of the—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. Senator McKenzie on a point of order.




Senator McKenzie:
  I rise on a point of order, on relevance. Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Cameron's contributions since you made your earlier ruling on my point of order have been simply to continue to talk about the National Party and not actually talk about the motion before the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I don't believe there is a point of order, but I do encourage Senator Cameron to return to the topic before the Senate.




Senator CAMERON:
  Well, I'm happy to return to the incompetence of the National Party and the incompetence of the minister who is a member of the Liberal-National party and who is unable to deal with the issue of Indigenous housing, unable to deal with the issue of Indigenous health and unable to deal with the issue of Indigenous education. And when asked to show some leadership, failing to show any leadership is pretty typical of the National Party—pretty typical of the government from the Prime Minister down. They are not prepared to deal with the real issues affecting people in this country and are unable to make sure that there is employment in those areas.


Here we are with a national partnership that has created thousands of jobs for Indigenous people around this country. The housing program put in place by Labor created thousands of jobs. It created hundreds of businesses. It created hundreds of apprenticeships and brought some capacity for long-term, stable jobs relating to housing in Indigenous areas. And this minister has been incapable of understanding that it's not just about housing: it's about health; it's about education; it's about employment; and it's about getting an economy established in the Indigenous areas. This is a minister absolutely incapable of dealing with issues of importance in his own portfolio. He is an absolute failure in this area, an absolute failure. Just ask the National Party what a failure—a leaderless failure—we have as a member of this government.


We have huge issues for Indigenous groups around the country. Overcrowding has come down a bit, but not enough. Indigenous health is still a problem under this government. Indigenous education is still a problem. Indigenous people can't get decent health and can't get decent education unless they've got a home to go to, a home that is culturally appropriate for Indigenous groups. These are the issues that this minister should be dealing with. These are the issues that this minister seems to be incapable of dealing with. This minister allowed half a billion dollars to be cut out of Indigenous support in this country and said nothing about it; he was mute when it came to an attack on Indigenous communities around the country. That was how he started off his career as Minister for Indigenous Affairs—a failure to start with, a failure ongoing and a failure in the future.


That's why we need a change of government. We need a change of government federally so that we can look at exactly the issues that are needed for both Indigenous communities and communities around the country. We need to stop this ideological attack by the coalition against Indigenous people, against the trade union movement, against workers' penalty rates and against the rights of workers when they go on the job. This is an absolutely pathetic government that shows no leadership and has no capacity to understand how difficult it is for Indigenous communities around this country to make their way, with bad housing, poor health outcomes and poor education outcomes.


Minister, it costs money to fix these problems and you are incapable of getting a clear commitment or negotiating with the states to get an outcome on housing for Indigenous communities around this country. You should pick up the phone, you should talk to the various ministers across the country who have responsibility for this area, you should get a national agreement put in place, you should look at the recommendations that your own review recommended and you should start implementing them. We've got children dying in Indigenous communities because of overcrowding and unsanitary situations. You've been there now for years. You have failed to deal with some of the basic problems in Indigenous communities in this country. You are too busy carving each other up, too busy fighting with each other and too busy defending the absolutely indefensible as a government—a rabble of a government, a government with no capacity to lead, a government with no economic policies and no social policies. All you want to do is use fear and loathing as the basis of your policy proposals.


This is a government that is in absolute decline; a government in internal decline. And nothing epitomises the decline of this government more than their approach on Indigenous affairs. We've got the Closing the Gap approach, and this government, who were going to be the grown-ups—well, no-one can look at this government and use the word 'grown-up'—have failed to deal with the key issues that are important to all communities in this country, especially Indigenous communities. You can argue all you like about what you may have done and what you will do, but the reality is that you have failed miserably to deal with the issues of health, education and housing for Indigenous communities.


You must get a situation where we've got a minister that can actually focus on this. I don't think there is one politician on the Liberal-Nationals side, either in the lower house or in the Senate, who has the capacity to deal with these issues, because you are so obsessed with each other, so obsessed with having a go at each other and so obsessed with the rabble that you have become that you cannot concentrate on the key issues for Indigenous communities in this country. We need to improve the health of Indigenous communities. We need to improve education for Indigenous communities. We need to ensure that there is a business case to build these houses, and that's the job of this minister. This minister has been incapable of delivering on what is a fundamental right everywhere in the world, and that is to have a roof over your head. This minister is just incapable of doing that.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  And it doesn't matter how much Senator O'Sullivan rants away behind the minister, trying to defend the indefensible; it is just not going down with the community. The community know that you are a rabble. The community know that you are incompetent. The community know that you are weak from the Prime Minister down—a weak Prime Minister and weak ministers, incapable of dealing with education, incapable of dealing with health and incapable of dealing with the issues facing Indigenous communities. Maybe, Minister, your next contribution should just be to resign and make sure that we get somebody in that can actually look after the Indigenous community, because you patently cannot.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:40):  I rise to take part in this debate on the motion to take note of the minister's explanation. This is an extremely important issue that, it is very clear, needed very strong leadership from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has been investing in remote housing—in fact, in social housing—for a long time, but in particular in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing. This is an absolutely essential area where the Commonwealth should be providing leadership, and it was very clear, even before the review came out, that there was a need for ongoing Commonwealth involvement and, in fact, an agreement with the states and territories around this issue. That was confirmed, of course, through the review document, which clearly points out in its leading recommendations:


1. A recurrent program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets.


2. Investment for an additional 5,500 houses by 2028 is needed to continue efforts on Closing the Gap on Indigenous Disadvantage.


It was very clear that there was need for further investment and that there is a need to continue to build houses.


But just as important was to send the signal very early that this was going to occur. We all know in this place—because I'm sure every single senator has had representations from constituents on these programs, whether it's the remote housing program, soil and land conservation programs or whatever programs you're talking about—that, as programs are coming to an end, there is a need to send a very clear signal as to whether they're going to continue, because things grind to a halt. You lose essential staff, contracts can't be made and they can't plan for the future.


What we see here are a lot of organisations and a lot of people that are employed, because part of this process is employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It's very clear that signals should have been sent much earlier than they were that this program was going to continue. There has been huge disquiet in the sector about knowing the future of this program. Yes, the program to date has been addressing issues of overcrowding, but, as the review pointed out, more houses are needed. You just have to go into communities to know that we still have an exceedingly high overcrowding problem.


On top of this, this has also manifested in concern in communities, because in my home state of Western Australia—and we heard Senator Dodson talking about our home state earlier—we have had to contend with the past government talking about closing remote communities. Then, when there's uncertainty over whether this housing funding is going to continue, that exacerbates concerns that still exist in communities about closure of those communities. Again, there is a need for some leadership to be clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth.


I think that we could fund a number of years worth of election campaigns if I had a dollar for every time I heard the Commonwealth government blame the states and territories and the states and territories blame the Commonwealth. It happens in this place virtually every day, and that's exactly what we're seeing here: blame for the state and territories and failure to show leadership, despite the fact that it was very clear that further investment is needed and that the community expects the Commonwealth to be showing leadership on this issue and on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues in general.


On one hand, while we've got the government failing to take action here, we've got the Refresh program for Closing the Gap. We know that housing is absolutely fundamental to addressing issues of Closing the Gap. We need to be addressing issues around the social determinants of health, and we know that housing plays a critical role there. An issue we are yet to resolve is otitis media and the impact it has on Aboriginal children, and poor housing and overcrowding is a key component of that issue. We had a workshop in Perth the week before last, where we were talking about those essential social determinants of health to ensure that we can deal with this. Make no mistake, OM is at pandemic levels in this country. We have one of the highest rates of OM in the world, if not the highest. This is just one example of the issues that we are yet to resolve where housing plays an absolutely critical role. We have to reduce and get rid of overcrowding. We have to ensure that people can live in hygienic circumstances. As the review pointed out, we have to ensure that existing houses are maintained and we have preserve their functionality and increase the life of the housing assets. That is absolutely critical. But building more houses and addressing this issue in remote communities is absolutely essential. I have addressed OM in particular because it is an issue that I think is fundamental; it is a classic example of why we need to be addressing this issue.


I have had a lot of contact from constituents asking about this. People are asking a lot of questions. Why the focus first on NT? It has been commented that half of the housing problem is in the NT. Does that mean that half of the money is going to the NT? Why was the focus there first? I appreciate that there are some very important issues there. I have been in the communities a lot of times, so I understand the nature of those issues in the Northern Territory. But we also have those fundamental issues in Western Australia, as does Queensland. These are important issues that people want answers to. I put in a long list of questions at estimates, which I presume will go to the minister at some stage when the department has answered them. They are fundamentally important. Organisations also need to know whether this funding is going to continue. In terms of planning into the future, communities need to know. Employment programs will cease if there is not ongoing commitment to these programs in a timely manner.


As I said, we knew a long time ago that this investment was going to have to continue. Yet we are still playing the blame game. Yes, of course there has to be investment from the states and territories. But a much more conciliatory approach to negotiations, in a timely manner, should have occurred first instead of being reduced to this game of brinkmanship. From the outside, to a whole number of people, it looks like that is what is happening. Delays will cause very significant issues to building programs, to employment, to the outcomes that we are all looking for. So at the same time that we are talking about the Refresh program and updating Closing the Gap, we are back to basic principles of fighting over housing. That is essentially what we are talking about here. We are back to fighting over housing, and the delays that brings with it.


We know very well, as I said when I started, that urgent action is needed to address this issue. To those who have been working in this space—including the minister, who has been working in this space for a very long time, organisations that have been working in this area and communities that have been agitating to know what the future of this program will be—it's absolutely clear that it needs to continue.


Ever since I've been in this chamber, I think, we've been debating this issue. We've also been debating funding for this issue. Every time a funding program is about to run out, we are back to debating who pays, when they are going to sign up, how much it's going to be, and what the states and territories are going to kick in—all of those issues. You would have thought by now that we could have been addressing those issues in a timely manner. But, no, we're not. We're back to this issue yet again, with people waiting with bated breath to find out what funding will be available and what states are going to be putting in. As I said, it's fair enough that states are contributing as well. But it's all happening again at the very last minute. Again, how many times have we been in this place having these debates about programs? It comes down to the line when they are going to be funded, and this is yet another example.


It comes back to a lack of leadership in trying to get these issues resolved. The government are trying to withdraw the Commonwealth from these issues if they can possibly get away with it. It's time that this issue was resolved as a matter of urgency. That may mean getting the states together with the Territory to resolve this issue. It is absolutely critical that this issue be resolved, that there be certainty and that the recommendations be implemented, such as the additional investment with a recurrent program so that these sorts of debates don't have to be held every time a funding program is going to run out. We know, as was pointed out in the review, that 5,500 houses are needed by 2028. Let's get in place an ongoing recurrent program that deals with this issue so that we can accomplish the elimination of overcrowding, so that there is certainty for the program and so that there is certainty that we can have a Closing the Gap Refresh, knowing that a key component of that can be delivered. We are not going to close the gap if we don't address some of these fundamental social determinants, of which housing is a critical component. If we don't address that issue, we will fail to close the gap, and that has been pointed out by many people who have been contributing, particularly recently, on this extremely important area of investment, where the Commonwealth can show leadership and in fact must show leadership.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (12:53):  I rise to speak in response to the explanation on housing provided to the Senate by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. In his statement, he mentions that he waits for each territory and state jurisdiction to show the money. Well, in the Northern Territory, the Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, and the housing minister, Gerry McCarthy, have worked on their preparation in terms of what they will offer with housing across the Northern Territory, and they have put forward $1.1 billion over 10 years. I would like to let the Senate know that this was the first offer, I think—and correct me if I'm wrong—from a state or territory jurisdiction to the Commonwealth in terms of that full-time commitment.


The minister made a comment in relation to that in Gunbalanya in January, and that comment was to support the payments by the Territory, so naturally there was a great deal of positive confirmation coming from the federal government at that point. However, that has since been rescinded. It is not the $1.1 billion commitment in equal terms with the Northern Territory over 10 years, which is a great concern.


Reading through these documents that have been tabled by the minister, a number of things come up. One of them that comes up straightaway—and I think it's important for the Senate to be aware of some of the issues—is that here we have a jurisdiction that has shown the money, so to speak, and yet we do not have the political will within the Turnbull cabinet to support a jurisdiction that has already shown the money. We know, in the Northern Territory in particular, the desire to have improved and certainly increased housing for our remote communities.


Looking through the papers that the minister has tabled here in the Senate, there is an agenda item, from 'Capital works milestone'—it has been redacted, so I'm not sure who it has been prepared by—which focuses on this situation: 'As of 30 November 2017, a total of 117 new houses have been completed since July 2016, with 122 new houses underway.' The Commonwealth, then—and I understand this to be the COAG meeting—in November, was alerted to the fact that the NT government 'remains committed to deliver the target of 300 new houses under the national partnership on remote housing, as per schedule F of the agreement, but the achievement of that target by 30 June this year is at risk, due to factors that are outside the Northern Territory government's control. These include—again, this is for the benefit of the Senate, to understand the intricacies that impact on the lives of First Nations peoples in this country. The first issue here is leasing. Delays in securing land tenure have delayed contracts being awarded, most notably in the communities of Yarralin, Pirlangimpi and Mutitjulu. There are seasonal impacts. The wet season in the Northern Territory has considerable impact on the ability to deliver capital works, and the 2017-18 wet season has commenced early in some parts of the Northern Territory, including at Amanbidji, a community programmed to receive six new replacement houses. The third area of concern, in terms of these risk factors, is transitional accommodation. Capital works cannot commence in a community until appropriate accommodation is provided for people who need to move from a dilapidated house or those needing a new house, so they can be accommodated somewhere in the interim. So works have to be aligned to ensure transitional housing is in place, to avoid delays.


The Northern Territory government requested then, in November, via ministerial correspondence, that the new house target of 300 be revised to an achievable 243 by 30 June 2018, with a commitment that the remaining new houses be contractually committed to this date and then rolled over beyond June 2018 into the financial year of 2018-19. The status of that request is still unclear. But, again, that was an important request by the Northern Territory government.


There are issues that are compounding here for residents in the Northern Territory. Again, these are questions for the minister and his department. There is the issue of rental payments as a key element of funding for repairs and maintenance. The current system of tenancy management is dependent on large rental contributions from tenants. So what is the impact of the record and disproportionate number of fines and suspensions of unemployment benefits and CDP payments to Aboriginal tenants? We've had debates in here about CDP payments and the concerns in relation to breaching and those participants on CDP who are breached. There is actual evidence within the housing department that shows there are concerns as to the rental payments because of reductions in people's CDP payments and welfare benefits.


The other question around housing for the Northern Territory is homelands and town camps. In 2012 the Labor government set aside $10 million from the ABA funds for homelands and outstation housing. In 2015 a full audit of homeland and outstation housing and infrastructure was conducted by the Centre for Appropriate Technology in Alice Springs with the support of the Commonwealth and territory governments. The Commonwealth is now insisting that the land councils carry out a similar audit to determine the priority for infrastructure investment in the same homelands and outstations.


So what payments will be made for the land councils to be able to rescope infrastructure work on outstations? These are the conversations that need to be had well before June 2018. Hasn't the Commonwealth previously stated that it wants no further involvement with outstations since it paid out the Giles government? The Commonwealth created 600 to 700 outstations from the 1960s onwards, and has now walked away from any responsibility in that regard. In terms of town camps, the Commonwealth has offered nothing to address the substandard infrastructure that it created across the Territory.


We know that the minister is currently underway with the Closing the Gap Refresh. One of the areas that consistently comes up is the importance of housing. As we've heard previously from Senator Dodson and Senator Cameron, the importance of housing and homelessness links to the fact that we cannot close the gap in health, in education or in employment. I know that as part of the conversations that are now taking place around closing the gap, it is absolutely critical that this government looks at the importance of housing and the lack of it, and the impact that it's having on the very policy that it stands up to give a report on in the House in February every year on the life expectancy of First Nations people. The government needs to connect it.


If there were the political will 10 years ago to have a 10-year agreement on an incredibly visionary housing program for our country and for our remote and regional areas, where is the political will today? It is completely absent, abrogating every kind of responsibility to find excuses and reasons why it is not this parliament's duty to the First Nations people of this country to make sure that the government shows leadership in navigating a way through the absolutely complex and political process within the state and territory jurisdictions to have that vision again. Have that vision again! Have the backbone to have that vision again. Have the will to have that vision again. That's what is required for a 10-year vision on housing for our remote and rural regions in this country.


I'll give you another example. Only 18 months ago—in fact, the minister may remember this—we celebrated the handback to the community of Yarralin in the VRD region, west of Katherine. We celebrated the handback after 40 years where the people of Yarralin had been waiting and had their struggle for land. The story is that a group of Aboriginal workers walked off the job at a cattle station in the NT over 44 years ago to protest about a lack of pay and about mistreatment. Today, more than 50,000 hectares belong to them. Fifty thousand hectares of land were returned at that moment. I was there, the minister was there, the Northern Land Council was there and all the men, women and children of the VRD region were there. What was promised as part of that handback was at least 20 new houses and 17 upgrades. I have spoken with people from that region who are incredibly disappointed that not enough has been done in that space. And that's just one example of a number of communities that are waiting.


I say to the Prime Minister: if you want to close the gap, if you are sincere about wanting to close the gap, you have to be committed in every way—not cherry-picking when you want to dive in and dive out—and you've got to back it all the way. We know that housing is a critical aspect of improving the lives of everyone, and the ones who need it the most in this particular instance are the First Nations people of our country. The cabinet needs to have the backbone and the vision, because it is within your power to make a real difference here. It is within your power to break the stalemate. It is within your power to rise above the politics of every situation here when you look at the figures of our families and our children on the ground, who desperately need this parliament to get it right. Thank you.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (13:06):  I rise to take note of Minister Scullion's comments. What we now know is that, under the Turnbull government, housing in remote communities will continue to be overcrowded for years to come. The minister's comments were underwhelming. No-one could have confidence that the Turnbull government has a commitment to remote housing with what we're seeing in how this policy is playing out and what we've heard today. We know this is not just a housing crisis; it's a jobs crisis. While the current program is not perfect, it's not adequate to the degree that's needed, what it has done is provide not only some houses but also desperately needed jobs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. What we have here is both a housing crisis and a jobs crisis because of the appalling way the government is acting.


We know that the current program had reduced overcrowding by 46 per cent. There are few success stories when it comes to this federal government and housing. Again, this program is not perfect, but it's heading in the right direction. So here we had something in the housing area at a federal level that actually had something to show for what it set out to do. What I'm referring to there is that it was delivering new homes, refurbishing homes, providing maintenance for homes. That is significant for anybody, but when you live in overcrowded premises it's incredibly important.


I thank Senator Dodson for putting forward this motion so that we can have this debate and assist the remote communities—particularly in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, as well as across the whole country—that are now in such an uncertain period. It really has put the spotlight on the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. I also congratulate my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert for her work in this area, which has been very extensive. She spelled it out very clearly, as have others, in her speech about how important housing is for those other essential rights, basic human rights, of education, of health.


All of these issues are connected, and when you have overcrowding you're going to run into so many other problems that are impacting on people's day-to-day lives and costing the government money. So much of what they're doing here is short-sighted. We know the remote housing program is not a huge amount of money, so what is going on here? This is a real reminder of how this really is a government of inequality. Previous federal governments committed $776 million to the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. It's been cut to $100 million. That extra $676 million that they think they're saving—I mean it's not a huge amount of money. It should have been improved, increased, not what we're seeing here today.


What we also know—and this comes from the latest census work of the Australian Bureau of Statistics—is the whole impact that overcrowding has on communities. It really is worthwhile reminding ourselves how serious this is. The ABS stated that the overall number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experiencing homelessness in 2016 was 23,437 and more than two in three were living in severely crowded dwellings. Those figures are shameful. We are a rich country and this should not be happening. The ABS stated that people living in severely crowded dwellings—which are defined as requiring four or more extra bedrooms to accommodate the people who usually live there—was the greatest contributor to the national increase in homelessness. It is disgraceful that this is where we are at in this country. These are recent figures; that is the latest census data.


Again, we should remind ourselves about the overall housing crisis caused by the shocking policies of the federal government—and I acknowledge that the work of many of our state governments in this area is also below par. The 2016 census data showed that the rate of homelessness in Australia over the last five years has gone up by 5.6 per cent. It is increasing, not decreasing; it is not even staying the same. At every turn, the way this federal government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, is handling housing is shameful. Again, that is why they are increasingly being called the government of inequality.


The National Partnership Agreement for Remote Indigenous Housing and the Remote Housing Strategy have been very significant. The remote housing review gives us some insight into how significant it has been. By this year, the strategy will have delivered 11,500 more livable homes in remote Australia. And I will repeat a comment I made earlier. When we are talking about the number of homes that are being delivered, there are new homes, there is refurbishment and there is maintenance. And what does that mean? It means hundreds and hundreds of jobs. And we cannot emphasise enough how important that is in remote Australia.


In regard to overcrowded dwellings for people in remote areas, the review found that this increase in supply is estimated to have led to a significant decrease in the proportion of overcrowded households in remote and very remote areas—falling from 52.1 per cent in 2008 to 41.3 per cent in 2014. The panel projects that this will fall further—to 37.4 per cent by 2018. That is really welcome; those figures are good; at least it is heading in the right direction. There could be a lot more improvement, but I would still say that it is welcome; there is much more to do, but it is welcome. It is welcome because we know we need to improve the strategy and continue to invest in remote housing. The remote housing review has recommended that an additional 5,500 houses be built.


Where does all that sit with where the government is at now? I have not read all the documents that the minister has put forward, but you would have thought he would put all the good news up top—and there wasn't good news there in terms of the uncertainty this whole sector is facing. The minister has been incredibly inadequate in terms of how he has handled the portfolio. The minister really has questions to answer here. Why has it taken so long? Why has it got to this point? What justifies leaving communities and housing providers in so much uncertainty? That is one of the very shocking things that is going on here—where it leaves these communities. We don't know why they are doing that, but we do know the impact it is having. Firstly, it is reckless and it is mean-spirited and it is bringing more hardship and uncertainty. When it comes to housing, people should be confident that they and their family and their loved ones—the people they are sharing their home with—can have a roof over their head and not have to be worried about it in a month's time or a year's time. That is a human right. People have a right to homes and to have secure housing. It is actually set out as a human right, but this government appears not to know that.


Again, let's emphasise that we're not talking about a lot of money here. It's been about $540 million per year so far. Compare that to the roughly $8 billion of public money we're expected to dish out, and we do dish out, that goes on the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discounts in one year alone. This why I say we're a rich country and we can afford it. We know where the money can come from: clean up negative gearing and clean up capital gains tax discounts. That's one way to reduce the inequality in this country and have money to fund these essential programs.


Essentially, what the Turnbull government should be doing here is to end the uncertainty. That's the first thing. They need to come out with a very clear position that the current system remains and that it's going to be improved on, and we're not all left wondering what happens when this 10-year agreement ends. The state and territory governments should not have to siphon off already constrained funds for these housing programs. You get the sense when you listen to the federal government that that's their idea with housing, 'Oh, well, it's basically a state issue and so we can just get away with pushing it onto state governments.'


As I've heard other speakers say, the Turnbull government needs to find some backbone on this. They need to find a commitment. Again, we hear all the fine statements about Aboriginal rights and Closing the Gap, but here is a case in point: this is where they can actually do the job, and, surely, that's what they should be doing. What we've heard today from the Liberals and Nationals is another reason why this government needs to be defeated. It's ruthless, it's shocking and this is clearly another example why this government should be voted out of office. Thank you.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-03-20,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:16):  There have been a number of contributions and I thank everybody for them. I particularly acknowledge my senator colleague from Western Australia, Senator Dodson. I know you have an ongoing and genuine interest in this matter, and I thank you for your ongoing interest, mate.


I will try to deal with a number of the questions and assertions that've been put up, but let me, perhaps, get the dross out of the way first. Senator, your contribution certainly stood in stark contrast to the contribution from the shadow housing minister. I wasn't actually aware that Senator Cameron was the shadow housing minister. When he got to the four-minute mark he decided to blither on to personal insults and to say that the National Party doesn't care about Indigenous people. I guess we're used to it. There are some people in this place—there's certainly one—who everybody in Australia should factor in. He is so offensive in his nature that he should just be ignored. We do our best under a torrent of specific and personal offence given by this man. We don't forgive him. He's just what he is and we just ignore it. It was insightful that he ran out of steam after four minutes and went into the remainder with the of sort of rubbish he normally makes in a contribution.


But h should be held to account for a couple of things. He said that Indigenous homelessness has increased. He's the shadow minister, he should have a bit of a clue about that, wouldn't you reckon, Senator Dodson? He should have a clue about a fact that he's just put on the table. He said, 'Indigenous homelessness has increased.' Perhaps I can point him to a number of articles and statistics that he should inform himself of—after all, this is his shadow portfolio. The number of Indigenous people counted as homeless has fallen by 12.3 per cent in the five years leading up to 2016, and it goes on. I'm not suggesting in any circumstance that that is okay, but to say that it's gone up not down, I think, is something he won't ever be held to account for. Nobody takes him seriously, but I thought I would, again, just correct the record.


There were a couple of other issues. Senator Dodson, you brought up document 19, and I agree, to have an entire document that is redacted you'd think was a bit awkward, but I have it on good advice that this is the process. This process of redaction is by agreement. I will tell you, through the redactions, it was actually a draft letter from your colleague in the Northern Territory government. It was a confidential draft working document that belonged to Gerry McCarthy, the housing minister in the Northern Territory.


Throughout this debate, there may well have been positions put that have not been clearly understood. So let me be absolutely crystal clear: the Commonwealth remains committed to remote housing. But, as for the increase, we want the states and territories to take their place. We want them to take responsibility for their housing. It is entirely their responsibility, and I believe that they have abdicated that responsibility over the entire time of this agreement. I believe that if they are held to account in the way they can be we can get the same outcome that the leadership of the Northern Territory and the federal government have provided for.


What I'm saying about the Northern Territory outcome is that twice as much money will now be invested, twice as much as ever before. That's not a bad bloody outcome. And we have Indigenous people who are standing right there, making sure the administration and all of the other processes in place are actually observed in a transparent way. We have ownership by Aboriginal people and the land council. It is significant reform not only in the amount of money that goes in but in how it is provided. On all of those predictions, we can reach them in half the time if we can build twice as many houses, so this is an outcome that is achievable.


There's been a general theme of: 'I'm very nervous; it's all at the last minute.' But the fact of the matter is that in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia—the builds that are going on at the moment—the notion that everyone will finish on the 30 June 2018 is a complete nonsense. I'm very much aware of the program. And in Queensland assertions were made that everyone has to finish on the 30 June 2018 by no less than the Queensland local government authority, mostly from North Queensland. I had quite a large contingent come and see me to say they were concerned. I said, 'That's an odd concern to have. I'm not like that. Why would we do that?' They said, 'It was put to us by Minister De Brenni directly that I had written a letter to him saying that everyone has to put pens down on 30 June 2018.' I said, 'There's no such letter, I said no such thing.'


It's pretty disingenuous for people to suggest this program is suddenly ending. There's a large taper. In Queensland it will go on for a long time, 12 months or so in addition to the remaining period of time. And so I am absolutely confident that we'll come to a settlement on where we go in Queensland, Western Australia and in South Australia. The Northern Territory has already got a clear direction where we're going to go, so there's not going to be a hiatus of activity in this particular area. 


People have been talking about leadership, particularly about me, and asking why don't I show some leadership? As I have just indicated, you could not ask for a better outcome. I went to the Northern Territory government. They run their budget on an annual basis, unlike the Commonwealth—we run our budget over three-year forward estimates. That is entirely a matter for them. It is just a different way in terms of scale. I am not criticising them for that. They've indicated they're going to put $110 million in a fund, not in their own budget, and I've said that we'll match whatever you put in that fund. They indicated there's one year's funding in the fund and they are going to get back to me about the second year, and I hope to have it on the second year. We'll be matching the funding they put in there. As I have indicated, you can't ask for much more than doubling the investment in some of the most needy parts of Australia. That opportunity is, in fact, available to Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. As I indicated earlier, I can give some grace to the South Australian government, because they've just been in caretaker mode and they're unable to negotiate through letters—that's just a fact—but it is very important that we continue to make a joint effort.


What I want out of the state and territory governments and what I've asked them to provide—as you'd see by your letter, Senator Dodson—is effectively three things. I think people need to know how many dollars they have provided from their own budgets over the last decade. The Commonwealth are clear: we've invested $5.4 billion. That's been our investment in NPARIH. We've also made some investment through special purpose payments, national partnerships and Commonwealth rent assistance. Commonwealth rent assistance puts it up to about $49 billion or $50 billion in the last decade. Commonwealth rent assistance will take that apart. Whilst it's a huge number, I think we need to set that aside and just look at those funds that were available for investment by the states and territories that were funds given to them. I know that, because we have records of the funds that have been provided to the Queensland government, to the Western Australian government, to the South Australian government and to the Northern Territory government over that period of time.


I want to know how much of their own funds they've provided from their own budgets. I'm talking about 'in remote areas', and that's actually defined. I've asked them if they would provide the number of houses that have been built by them in those areas. I've also asked them: 'How many dollars are from the Commonwealth funds that we provided you for public housing for your most needy?' Between the special purpose payments and the national partnerships on homelessness, over the last decade there's been about $5.5 billion in those specific areas. That's an investment that could've been made to the most needy in those jurisdictions. The most needy live in those remote areas. That $5.5 billion is almost the same as the Commonwealth amount, isn't it, Senator Dodson? Imagine what you could do with that. I've asked them: 'How did you go with that, and how much have you invested?' Western Australia had $1.5 billion of discretionary funds that they could have invested over the last decade, Queensland had $2.6 billion, South Australia had a tad over $1 billion and the Northern Territory had $300,000. That's the discretionary funding that has been allocated over the last decade for investment in public housing. I wanted to know that. I think it's very important we all know that.


It's very important, as we go into the future, that people talk to me. Senator Dodson, you said, 'We need to be serious. We need to be respectful. This needs to be a joint effort. This needs to be a collaboration. This needs to be equally shared.' I agree entirely, which is why we're taking this approach. We've asked them that. I have to say, Queensland has written me back a highly political letter. You would have seen that. It doesn't tell me anything, and it certainly doesn't answer those questions. The most fundamental question, of course, is: how much are you going to put on the table in the future, given what you've just done? I haven't got an answer from Western Australia, but I'm really looking forward to meeting with their minister later this week.


The answers to those are the sorts of questions I think you should be putting to your Minister for Housing in Western Australia. We've had New South Wales take on its own responsibilities. That's it; they're out—they're taking on their own responsibilities. The funds that they get they're now allocating to the most in need, and their remote areas they're going to be able to service. Victoria have taken the same approach. They're going to be servicing those people most in need. Tasmania has said, 'I'm going to take over my responsibilities as a state, and a fundamental responsibility is the provision of public housing.' Yes, the Commonwealth help out in certain ways. We now need the same approach.


I know what the states have been provided. I want to know how much has come out of that. I want the answer to the question, but sadly—through you, Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, to Senator Dodson—it appears, certainly in Queensland, and I'm looking closely at Western Australia, they haven't provided the answer to the question of how much of that discretionary $2.6 billion did they actually invest? I suspect the answer is zero. It is just depressing to think about why that would be the case. Perhaps because of the colour of someone's skin you would decide that these discretionary funds are not available to an entire demographic because they happen to live in remote areas. I'm not sure of the answers to those questions, Senator Dodson, but I am, as you are, looking forward to them. As I've indicated, I will share the answers in the letters from the jurisdictions with you and other interested parties.


I hope I have dealt with most of the issues that were brought up. People have indicated there is some concern. There were some discussions about outstations and the $40 million, of course, that is going through the ABA, Senator McCarthy. I have been in discussions with all four land councils, as you'd be aware, and we want to ensure that that is rolled out using Indigenous labour and procurement.


I thank everybody for participating in this important debate. It is so important, as Senator Dodson indicates, that this should be a shared responsibility. I think the rolled-gold example is the example of the Northern Territory government. The Northern Territory government have stepped up to the plate. They have been fair dinkum. Yes, they can only do it year by year, but they've indicated that about $110 million a year will be forthcoming. We've indicated that we'll meet that. We've also indicated that it will be separate from the Northern Territory government's budget and that it will be overseen by including the land councils in that. That's a significant move forward. I would encourage the other states to genuinely and openly embrace this opportunity to be part of a future in which your First Australians in your jurisdictions are an absolutely central part of that.


In conclusion, I thank the Senate for the debate, and I look forward to further negotiations with the state and territory jurisdictions.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:33):  Thank you, Senator Siewert, for restating the question. Under the new compliance framework, while jobseekers are able to appeal any financial penalty, they will not receive payment pending the outcome of the appeal or payment pending review. However, jobseekers will be paid back pay if their appeal is successful. Under the current compliance framework, in practice, payment pending review is only available for eight-week serious failure penalties and unemployment non-payment periods, which will no longer exist under the new framework. Payment pending review is currently not available for the majority of penalty types.


Before a jobseeker faces any financial penalty under the new framework, they will have missed a minimum of five requirements in six months without reasonable excuse, or will have refused work and therefore be demonstrably capable of obtaining work. The jobseeker's capabilities will also generally have been assessed twice, by both their provider and Human Services, before any penalties are applied. These arrangements are intended to ensure that only those jobseekers who are fully capable of meeting their requirements, but deliberately choose not to, will lose payment. The intention is to provide such jobseekers with a strong incentive to change their behaviour or find work. Allowing payment pending review for such jobseekers would significantly undermine this incentive effect.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:35):  The issue here, as I articulated yesterday, is that we still may have vulnerable jobseekers who get to this point if they haven't disclosed. In effect, what we've got is people being able to access the first appeals process, the departmental appeals process and then the AAT. For a start, we know the AAT takes quite a long period of time—certainly more than the four weeks. Well, it's seven weeks, but the maximum one-time suspension is four weeks, and it certainly takes longer than that.


I've got a couple of questions. What is the time it takes for the departmental review? Following that, if somebody has appealed and they do their four weeks—say it's the four-week one—what happens if they're still under appeal? Do they still go back? If they are still appealing—say it's an AAT or departmental one, but it's more likely AAT because they take longer—do they go back to the start of the process? What happens if they are still under appeal? Is that clear? So they've appealed and they've actually done their four weeks off income support—you've just said they would not be receiving income support. Do they then go back to the start, as everybody else does? What happens there?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:37):  Senator Siewert, I'm advised they go back to where they were in the intensive compliance phase.


I've also managed to get you some additional information in terms of another question you were asking about last night, which was around what happens if a jobseeker is already in the penalty phase and they develop issues affecting their capacity to comply, or they reveal previously undisclosed issues. If a jobseeker had no issues when they underwent their compliance assessment, but their circumstances change while they're in the penalty phase, they will remain in the penalty phase but will have their requirements adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that they can meet them. They do not return to the demerits phase because they were capable of meeting the requirements when they incurred their demerits and underwent their capability assessment. However, if the jobseeker does fail to meet a requirement, Centrelink will not apply a penalty if the jobseeker's barriers provide a reasonable excuse for failure. Also, providers would continue to monitor jobseeker requirements and take personal circumstances into account following any further noncompliance. If a jobseeker reveals a previously undisclosed barrier whilst in the penalty phase, and it results in the retrospective application of an activity test exemption, any demerit incurred within the exemption period will be removed and they will return to the demerits phase. I hope that gives you a little bit more in terms of what we were discussing last night.

The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 8288, moved by Senator Siewert, be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (13:51):  I want to ask some questions with respect to information management, schedule 17. We've very firmly put our opposition to this schedule. As we understand it, it seeks that the secretary of the department will be able to get from a person information that can be used as evidence to investigate and prosecute that person for criminal offences. We're concerned that it limits the privilege against self-incrimination, which, in our view, is a basic common law right.


You're putting forward to this place a schedule that means that a person subject to the coercive information-gathering power will not have the right to refuse to provide information or documents on the basis that it may be incriminating or will expose a person to a penalty. What you're doing, as we understand it, is to effectively allow the department to circumvent the need to obtain admissible material by search warrants pursuant to section 3E of the Crimes Act 1914. We're extremely concerned that, in practice, this means that a person can be asked to provide information to prove that they've not complied with their obligations as a welfare recipient, and any information provided can be used as evidence against them. You have to ask yourself where the onus of proof is here. I've certainly seen, in relation to robo-debt, a considerable reversal of that onus within DHS. I'm very concerned that the information can also be used as evidence that a person has not fully complied with the requirements to give information or documents, or has provided false or misleading information or has engaged in forgery.


Importantly, the Social Security Rights Network, whose advice I very much respect, has expressed their significant concerns about this schedule. They're very concerned that it limits the privilege against self-incrimination and can be used to gather information from welfare recipients that can be used against them in criminal proceedings. Minister, does the government believe that this schedule limits the privilege against self-incrimination, which is a basic and substantive common law right?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:54):  In relation to the measure itself, what the measure actually does is streamline the process of referrals for welfare fraud prosecution by allowing information or documents obtained in the course of an administrative action by the Department of Human Services to be used in subsequent investigation and criminal prosecution.


You raised a number of issues in the statements that you just made. In relation to the amendments and their impact on the debtor's right to silence, I can advise that this amendment does not change any rights to silence, as the common law right to silence has been retained, other than in proceedings for the provision of false information. Third parties do not currently have a right to silence.


In relation to your questions around self-incrimination, the proposed changes retain the common law right to silence, preventing the use of information or documents against the person providing them. That is retained in the bill. Again, the exception to this is in relation to proceedings for the provision of false information. Therefore, the only way that the information provided by a person could be used against them is if that information were false. If the person provides correct information, it logically flows that that information would not be able to be used against them. This is consistent with the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers, which deals with the privilege against self-incrimination. The guide states that the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply where it is alleged that a person has given false or misleading information.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH

 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:57):  I'll just take you through how the bill actually deals with self-incrimination. For example, a new section 197A will be inserted into the Social Security (Administration) Act to clarify the effect of the privilege against self-incrimination on a person's obligation to respond to a statutory demand. Subsection 197A(1) provides that a person is not excused from giving information or producing a document or record that may incriminate them or expose them to a penalty. In short, that person cannot refuse to provide the information or document on the grounds that it may incriminate them. Well-established law dictates that a person cannot be compelled to convict themselves from their own words, and subsection 197A(2) section applies to this principle. Section 197A(2) provides for what is called use or derivative use immunity for an individual providing information or documents in response to a statutory demand to produce. The subsection sets out that any information given or any document or record produced by an individual may not be admitted in evidence against the individual in criminal proceedings, with only limited exceptions.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (13:58):  What are those exceptions?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:58):  The rationale for abrogating the privilege against self-incrimination is that the information requested is often essential to maintain the integrity of the social security system—for example, through fraud prevention and detection—and is rarely, if ever, used against the person providing it. Generally, only information that is relevant to another person's social security payment under the social security law is sought from persons. For example, information may be sought from an employer about cash-in-hand income received by a social security recipient or from a financial institution about a social security recipient's financial assets, incomes and outgoings. Section 197A(2) ensures that only limited criminal consequences flow from the person's inability to refuse to provide information. The use and derivative use immunity in subsection 197A(2) is subject to certain exceptions. Essentially information or documents given by an individual are admissible in criminal proceedings against that individual that relate to the falsity of the information.


Progress reported.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
) (13:32):  The committee is considering the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 and the amendments moved by Senator Siewert on sheet 8288. The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 8288 be agreed to.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:32):  When the adjournment was proposed last night, we were just in the middle of a question and answer process, and I had at that stage said this was my last question, but unfortunately the adjournment was proposed before it could be answered, and I was a bit premature, because depending on the answer I actually may wish to ask another question specifically on that.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Not having been in the chair, I wasn't aware of that, Senator Siewert.




Senator SIEWERT:
  No, of course.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  So debate can continue.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I was asking about the appeals process for the one-week penalty, the two-week penalty and the four-week penalty. You will recall that we had had significant discussion around when people could appeal, and I was asking what happens with those penalties in terms of income support.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:33):  Thank you, Senator Siewert, for restating the question. Under the new compliance framework, while jobseekers are able to appeal any financial penalty, they will not receive payment pending the outcome of the appeal or payment pending review. However, jobseekers will be paid back pay if their appeal is successful. Under the current compliance framework, in practice, payment pending review is only available for eight-week serious failure penalties and unemployment non-payment periods, which will no longer exist under the new framework. Payment pending review is currently not available for the majority of penalty types.


Before a jobseeker faces any financial penalty under the new framework, they will have missed a minimum of five requirements in six months without reasonable excuse, or will have refused work and therefore be demonstrably capable of obtaining work. The jobseeker's capabilities will also generally have been assessed twice, by both their provider and Human Services, before any penalties are applied. These arrangements are intended to ensure that only those jobseekers who are fully capable of meeting their requirements, but deliberately choose not to, will lose payment. The intention is to provide such jobseekers with a strong incentive to change their behaviour or find work. Allowing payment pending review for such jobseekers would significantly undermine this incentive effect.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:35):  The issue here, as I articulated yesterday, is that we still may have vulnerable jobseekers who get to this point if they haven't disclosed. In effect, what we've got is people being able to access the first appeals process, the departmental appeals process and then the AAT. For a start, we know the AAT takes quite a long period of time—certainly more than the four weeks. Well, it's seven weeks, but the maximum one-time suspension is four weeks, and it certainly takes longer than that.


I've got a couple of questions. What is the time it takes for the departmental review? Following that, if somebody has appealed and they do their four weeks—say it's the four-week one—what happens if they're still under appeal? Do they still go back? If they are still appealing—say it's an AAT or departmental one, but it's more likely AAT because they take longer—do they go back to the start of the process? What happens if they are still under appeal? Is that clear? So they've appealed and they've actually done their four weeks off income support—you've just said they would not be receiving income support. Do they then go back to the start, as everybody else does? What happens there?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (13:58):  The rationale for abrogating the privilege against self-incrimination is that the information requested is often essential to maintain the integrity of the social security system—for example, through fraud prevention and detection—and is rarely, if ever, used against the person providing it. Generally, only information that is relevant to another person's social security payment under the social security law is sought from persons. For example, information may be sought from an employer about cash-in-hand income received by a social security recipient or from a financial institution about a social security recipient's financial assets, incomes and outgoings. Section 197A(2) ensures that only limited criminal consequences flow from the person's inability to refuse to provide information. The use and derivative use immunity in subsection 197A(2) is subject to certain exceptions. Essentially information or documents given by an individual are admissible in criminal proceedings against that individual that relate to the falsity of the information.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and O'Neill today relating to school funding.


I farewell those students from Sacred Heart College in South Australia. It's a very fine school, a terrific school. About Easter time 100 years ago my grandfather was at the Western Front, fighting in World War I. He'd been born in Jamestown in the mid-north of South Australia, not far from where the Musk batteries are now. His father was Irish and his mother was Australian, but her mother was also Irish. His mother had died when he was one year old, and he ended up being brought up by his grandmother, Ellen Silverthorne.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I hope this is going somewhere.




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, it's coming to the point, Senator Macdonald.




Senator Payne:
  Today?




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, today. While he was fighting in World War I in Ypres 100 years ago—in fact, not that far from where Senator Cormann came from—his grandmother used to write to him. Being of Irish extraction, she was very critical of the fact that he had decided to sign up and fight for England, but he persisted. He was injured at one stage and gassed at one stage, but fortuitously he returned to South Australia after 3½ years at the front and then married my grandmother. Coming back from that war, he was looking for employment. He was an accountant before he left, but unfortunately it was a very difficult time for Irish people and particularly Irish Catholics in South Australia, and they were discriminated against. On the doors of employers where jobs were available there were signs saying, 'Catholics need not apply.'


I thought we'd seen the end of discrimination, bigotry and sectarianism in South Australia, but I've been very surprised by the comments of Senator Birmingham in the last couple of days referring to statements by the Catholic Education Commission of Victoria in support of the Labor Party as being 'bought by a few pieces of silver'. I think he means 30 pieces of silver, but he said 'a few pieces of silver'. I don't believe Senator Birmingham is a bigot or sectarian or seeks to discriminate against Catholics, but it's very easy to interpret his comments in that way, and I think most Catholics would see those comments of Senator Birmingham in that light.


There is an opportunity, I think, for Senator Birmingham to correct the record. There's an opportunity for him to now say, 'Yes, I realise these sorts of comments are inappropriate.' They're not the way in which a federal minister in this government should be referring to members of the Victorian Catholic education office. There's now an opportunity for Senator Birmingham to withdraw those comments. I'd strongly urge Senator Birmingham to take the opportunity now to come into this place, come into this chamber and say 'Yes, my comments were inappropriate.' A week and a half out from Easter, this is not the way he should be making references to members of the Victorian Catholic education office. I'd very strongly urge Senator Birmingham to take the opportunity now, before this issue starts to steamroll and get worse and we find ourselves in a situation where we're back to the bad old days in terms of sectarianism in this country and this state, to withdraw.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  Pot, kettle, black. We've got the Labor Party standing up here today, accusing Minister Birmingham of starting some sort of sectarian battle, when they're the ones who have, quite frankly, made a funding offer to a particular sector of the education system that doesn't apply to any other part of the education system, and in a way that fundamentally misrepresents what this government is trying to do in education.


It's one of the myths that we constantly hear—it's important to say this for all those people listening out there and all those people up in the gallery. There are no cuts to school funding from this government. The Quality Schools package in fact delivers an extra $25.3 billion on top of the 2016-17 budget in recurrent school funding over the next 10 years. That's 10 years out to 2027—a very solid and serious commitment to the funding of all students in every education sector of Australia over the next decade. That is both significant and very important. Funding for Catholic schools, in fact, is estimated to grow from $6.3 billion in 2017 to $6.6 billion in 2018, to $7.6 billion in 2021 and to $9.9 billion in 2027. The Catholic schools system will receive a total of $28.4 billion in Commonwealth recurrent funding over the four years from 2018 to 2021. What we are doing here is providing significant and accounted-for funding for all parts of the education sector, including the Catholic education sector, over the next 10 years. This is an average per-student increase in the Catholic sector of 3.7 per cent over the next decade, clearly higher than inflation.


Funding is provided directly to the Catholic system and not to individual schools. It is the Catholic systems that redistribute this growing level of funding to their schools according to their own needs based model. The move to a six-year transition for schools or systems below the targeted Commonwealth shares of the funding standard provides additional funding compared to the 10-year transition that was originally proposed. We also have the National School Resourcing Board undertaking a review of socioeconomic status, score methodology and current capacity to contribute arrangements for non-government schools and systems. This will look at the funding in this area and ensure that it is adequate. The board has already met with representatives from the Catholic schools sector, including principals from Victoria. The government will provide additional funding to support transition to the new funding arrangements for ACT Catholic schools.


This is a government and a minister committed to providing significant and budgeted funding for schools over the long term, so schools and school sectors, such as the independent sector and the Catholic sector, can plan for the future and can plan with certainty. What's most important for the schools sector is to know what's coming, when it's coming, to be able to plan for increases in students and to be able to plan for the educational needs of those students over time. So what we need are numbers that can be believed—not fantasy numbers, which is usually what we get from the other side. Here we have $25.3 billion in recurrent funding over 10 years. That brings the total Commonwealth recurrent funding to almost $250 billion out to 2027. This is real needs based funding. The real needs based funding is provided and grows from $17½ billion this year to $31 billion in 2027. This is dealing with the education system in a fair way. It's giving students what they need, it's giving the various parts of the education system certainty going forward and it is fair across all parts of the education system.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:15):  What Catholic parents understand is that the changes that Minister Birmingham made are not fair. I suggest to Senator Brockman that he have a discussion with former Senator Back, who at least partially understood how these changes disadvantage Catholic schools from his history with the Western Australian Catholic Education Commission board. Unfortunately, unlike former Senator Back, this minister is able to delude his colleagues, as in the talking points we just heard from Senator Brockman—and that is what they are. They are the minister's spin.


The minister spun again in question time today. He misled the Senate and he is misrepresenting David Gonski. He's misrepresenting David Gonski because this minister and this government have single-handedly dismantled the Gonski principles. This minister's principles are not the Gonski principles, and anyone who believes otherwise has been fooled. This minister set up his own creation and what he subsequently told us was, 'Oh, gosh, I upset the Catholics and I don't know why. In retrospect, had I known, I may not have done some of this.' Today, you've got this minister claiming that the School Resourcing Board is doing work that Labor is ignoring. That is simply not true. What Labor said in its letter referred to by Senator Brockman, as we have consistently said since this fabrication of Gonski 2, was that Labor would return the $17 billion to government and non-government schools that this minister has ripped out. We said we would return it and we quantified what that meant for Catholic schools over the next two years. There's no shock in that, and Catholic parents are alive to it because they're the ones who are facing the fee increase as a consequence of what this government has done.


Senator Cormann and the Prime Minister can keep their heads in the sand if they want. But, if they don't get a sense of the con that this minister is running here and if they continue to defend him, then these problems will occur again and again. You will get, like in the story in today's Australian, Catholic school parents who will clearly say, 'Our priorities are our children's education. I might have voted green in the past, but once I understood'—no politicking here; sheer facts—'what changes this government was making and how it impacted on my school, I was prepared to vote for Labor in Batman.' This is not politicking, as Minister Birmingham might pretend; this is responding to facts. This is advocacy and this is fair game because of the unfair changes that this government has made.


Whilst we talk about politicking, boy, has this been the biggest example of projection that I have ever seen. This minister projects by accusing others of politicking, while he reverts, probably through a brain snap that he should apologise for, to cheap sectarianism. He didn't deny it today. All he has said is that he won't apologise, when he should.


In my time here I have not come across this type of cheap sectarianism before. I've been accused of many things myself, but I have not seen a senior political representative refer to another party as Judas Iscariot, and it's outrageous. He should apologise. He should be counselled by the Prime Minister. Senator Cormann should not be defending him, and it should be noted for what it was—that is, Simon Birmingham is starting to run out of spin. The facts are coming forward. The parents are facing the increases in school fees. As Paul Bongiorno highlighted in a piece today—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Paul Bongiorno—a member of the Labor Party!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Yes, Paul Bongiorno—Catholic education faces a cut of 12 per cent under Gonski 2, whereas independent schools face only two. Justify that difference. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:20):  You know the Labor Party's in trouble when they start quoting Paul Bongiorno—lovely fellow he is, but clearly a card-carrying member of the Labor Party, and he has been for some time. As I said, a nice fellow, and good luck to him for his wrong political opinions, but don't quote him as an authority.


Senator Collins has brought a sectarian element into this debate, which I find unfortunate. I'd just say to Senator Collins that she should listen to what the Catholic Church said about her and some of her colleagues in the same-sex marriage debate, when many from the Catholic Church felt left by some members of the Labor Party. I really don't think we should get involved in that, but I want to get back to the principal opposition speaker, Senator Farrell. I'm authorised to say, Senator Farrell, that I found your history of your Irish ancestors and the First World War very interesting—almost as interesting, I might say, as Senator Simon Birmingham's Irish grandfather, who lost a leg at Polygon Wood, a major battle in World War I. Simon's grandfather, Patrick O'Loghlen, would probably have shared the battlefields with Senator Farrell's forebears, and I hope they got on well there together.


I'm pleased to enter into this debate, because it allows me to pass on publicly to Senator Birmingham and Mr Turnbull the thanks of a school that I was at just last Friday, up in Charters Towers in Queensland. I pay my respects to Columba College, the amalgamation of the old Mount Carmel College and St Mary's College at Charters Towers. They joined together a few years ago to form Columba College and are the recipients of a $4 million grant from the Turnbull government to do some wonderful extensions to their science blocks, to their school rooms, joining some work that the parents of that school did in improving the school playing fields, the quadrangle and the central meeting area. It was a wonderful experience I had on Friday, and I have many of them in North Queensland, more often than not at Catholic schools. And I mention—not that it matters—that I'm not a Catholic myself. But I love going to Catholic schools. They do wonderful work, and all credit to Columba College Principal Mr Daniel McShea. Congratulations, Sir, on the wonderful work that you and the P&C and all of your staff do there, and congratulations to the wonderful young people at that school.


I promised the Bishop of North Queensland and the principal that I would accede to their request of personally thanking Mr Turnbull and Senator Birmingham for the support that they have given to that school and to most other Catholic schools. I well know Catholic education in Townsville—and I pay respects to Cathy Day, who's just about to retire, unfortunately—and understand how pleased the Catholic Church, particularly in the dioceses of North Queensland and Far North Queensland, are with the school funding they receive from the current federal government.


Mr Acting Deputy President, I don't have much time left, but, finally, I just want to again correct Senator Collins. She seemed to be playing that basest form of politics, in trying to bring religion and sectarianism into debates in this chamber. But she also got Professor Gonski completely wrong. I remind Senator Collins that actually Professor Gonski stood with the Prime Minister and Senator Birmingham when the new, wonderful package increasing funding to all school children was announced. If Professor Gonski was there, supporting the Prime Minister and Senator Birmingham, you can see how totally false are the claims made by Senator Collins in her very, very poor contribution to this debate in the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I know that you're focused on your contribution, but I am not 'Mr Acting Deputy President'.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I'm sorry.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:26):  The others really have their heads buried in the sand on this issue. It's quite remarkable—when we've gone through a by-election in Batman, where this was a significant issue, particularly in the last week of the campaign, and where Labor put on record its commitment to supporting Catholic education—and quite interesting that those opposite really dismiss it. They can say, 'Well, that contest in Batman was just Labor versus the Greens; it wasn't really consequential for the Liberals and Nationals.' But what they need to know is: what happened in Batman is going to happen and be replicated right across Australia by the time the next election comes around. I know what families will believe when it comes to school funding, and that's not the spin from those opposite. They'll believe the information coming out from the sector that their children go to school at, and that is going to be rammed home to them. And that's what we saw in Batman.


So it's very disappointing—and we've sort of got used to it from Minister Birmingham; we know that he comes in here and delivers his lines—that there's not more fight on the backbench. We see that fight from Tony Abbott, the former Prime Minister. He's prepared to bell the cat and say what is actually happening out there in the community. But those backbenchers on the Senate side at the moment—particularly since former Senator Back has left—have really quietened down.


But the issue isn't going away. Those families and parents out there who are concerned and making choices about where their kids go to school want to know that they are being adequately funded. It's outrageous for the minister to attack the legitimate concerns of a sector, the Victorian Catholic schools sector, with the comments that he made.


But it's probably not surprising that he would do it, given that the standards of this government are slipping. We saw it over recent weeks, with Minister Dutton and his basic dog whistling when it came to South African farmers. We saw it during the Senate estimates process, with Senator Cash and her comments about the staffers in Bill Shorten's office. Neither one of them apologised. Neither one of them have said that they did the wrong thing. They really backed those comments in. And we've seen the same from Senator Birmingham in the last 48 hours as well. You would really hope that there would be a higher standard from a federal cabinet minister, and you would also hope that there would be a higher standard from the government that would pull these people into line. But we see none of that from those opposite.


Let's go to the division that we've seen on this issue. Former Prime Minister Abbott said on radio yesterday that this is 'going to make low-fee schools in middle-class suburbs almost impossible to run'. He went on to say that Catholic schools would 'suffer a big loss in funding'. That was coming from a member of their government—indeed, the former Prime Minister—completely contradicting what we hear from ministers and what we've seen from the contribution of other members in this debate so far today.


So, for Senator Macdonald to come in here and talk about some funding for a new building—that's one thing. But this is actually going to the ongoing funding of those schools. As someone who spends a lot of time in Queensland, and regional Queensland in particular, I know the concern that these schools are going to have. Already the opportunities for kids in regional Queensland and other parts of regional Australia aren't as great as they are for those from capital cities. Any further funding divide is only going to accentuate those problems, so there are going to be fewer opportunities for those kids from lower socioeconomic areas, from remote areas, to get the start in life that they need through primary school and through high school. This is what former Prime Minister Abbott is actually laying on the table. Those opposite who repeat the lines from Senator Birmingham and stick to the script are going to pay a price for this when it comes to the election, because parents understand this issue. From what I can pick up when I'm picking my kids up from school, parents absolutely know every issue going on in their school, as you'd expect them to. They understand this issue, and when it comes closer to the federal election they will increasingly look to who they are going to take their advice from about who is going to be better for their schools when it comes to ongoing funding.


The final comment that I want to make is a quote from former Prime Minister Abbott:


… if the government was smart we would have a look at our existing policy.


So the former Prime Minister Abbott is putting it out there that the government needs to relook at its policy. But what we've seen is a stonewalling from those opposite today, not a willingness to engage about legitimate concerns raised by the Victorian Catholic education sector that are only going to spread as we get closer to a federal election. So I urge them to relook at this issue, because it is such an important one for Australian families.

Senator McGRATH:
  While the government does not support this motion, it does agree that members should have a say in any decision to merge a registered organisation. That is why the government went to the last election with the commitment to introduce a public interest test. Currently, the Fair Work Commission has very limited ability to do anything other than effectively rubber-stamp a merger approved by just a bare majority of members. It's hard to see how a bare majority was even reached in the current merger of interests between the CFMEU, the Maritime Union and the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union. Less than six per cent of members of the three unions voted in favour of the merger, and CFMEU members were denied the ability to even vote. It is only right that a public interest test applies and that interested parties have their views considered before the Fair Work Commission.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:45):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The government is absolutely committed to ensuring the Federal Courts operate as efficiently as possible and facilitate greater access to justice for Australian families. Thanks to steps taken by this government in the 2015-16 and 2017-18 budgets, the courts have a clear path to financial sustainability. Measures include: a $22.5 million funding injection; $13 million efficiency dividend relief; streamlining courts administration, with all savings reinvested in the courts; $10.7 million for additional family consultants; $12.7 million to establish parent management hearings; and $40 million to transform and digitise court processes. Each of these measures will enhance the courts' capacity to provide services, particularly in family law.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that motion No. 733 be agreed to.

Pursuant to standing order 75, I give notice that today I propose to move ""That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need to enforce compliance by all Australian importers and suppliers of building products with Australian Standards including by:


(a) preventing the importation of plumbing fittings that contain lead that can be leached into drinking water and banning of the sale of such fittings in Australia;


(b) ensuring that plumbing products are Water Mark certified;


(c) preventing the importation of other building materials which are non-compliant with the National Construction Code;


(d) adequately enforcing the National Construction Code requirements in relation to materials being installed to ensure compliance with Australian Standards; and


(e) ensuring there are sufficient measures in place to check materials used on building sites and in industry.""

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-03-20,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (16:02):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need to enforce compliance by all Australian importers and suppliers of building products with Australian Standards including by:


(a) preventing the importation of plumbing fittings that contain lead that can be leached into drinking water and banning of the sale of such fittings in Australia;


(b) ensuring that plumbing products are Water Mark certified;


(c) preventing the importation of other building materials which are non-compliant with the National Construction Code;


(d) adequately enforcing the National Construction Code requirements in relation to materials being installed to ensure compliance with Australian Standards; and


(e) ensuring there are sufficient measures in place to check materials used on building sites and in industry.


I rise to speak on behalf of Senator Burston's urgency motion. Building products are being imported that don't meet Australian standards and are putting the health and safety of all Australians at risk. Only as recently as Sunday, an extensive media report revealed that cheap imported plumbing fittings containing lead can be leached into drinking water. As you all know, lead is a toxin that can be particularly harmful to children. I believe this is a problem Australia must address as a matter of public urgency at a national level.


Perth's new multimillion-dollar children's hospital is an example of what can go wrong and how urgent the situation is. The hospital was originally due to open in 2015, but has been plagued by a series of problems including asbestos in roofing panels and lead in the water. A comprehensive report by the state's Chief Health Officer found imported brass fittings to be the likely cause of lead contamination in the hospital's drinking water, which has contributed to lengthy delays in its opening. The report found the fittings had corroded, leaching lead into the water system. It has cost millions of dollars to try and rectify these problems, and the opening of this much-needed children's hospital has been delayed by over 2½ years. Last month it was revealed that there was also lead in the water at the drinking fountains at Perth's new billion-dollar stadium.


I believe public health and safety is being put at risk by the flood of cheap taps and other non-compliant parts that have the potential to leak lead and other toxic metals into drinking water. It's a concern which is shared by the WA Master Plumbers and Gasfitters Association and the Plumbing Products Industry Group, which represents manufacturers and importers. TheSunday Times newspaper in Perth reported at the weekend that they had been contacted by plumbers who say they are seeing more and more defective parts which don't comply with the WaterMark Certification Scheme, which exists to ensure products are safe and fit for purpose. They blame a massive loophole that allows hardware stores to sell taps and other plumbing products that aren't WaterMark certified, even though plumbers risk penalties if they install these fittings. They are demanding legislation to close the loophole. Today I spoke to the master plumbers association's chief executive, Murray Thomas, who outlined a series of issues, stating:


This isn't about protecting our industry. This is about public health. There is nothing to stop consumers purchasing products that are not WaterMark certified, to prevent retailers stocking them or to prevent wholesalers and builders from directly importing them.


This problem is part of a wider crisis in Australia involving non-conforming and non-compliant building products. Asbestos was found in Chinese-made roof panels at Perth Children's Hospital. These panels were cut on site, putting workers at risk, and had to be removed at a considerable cost. As a former tradesman and someone who has real-life experience on building sites, I have spoken to a few colleagues in the industry and they have told me of recent encounters where cheap imported plumbing products, which have the potential to leach lead, have been fitted. At the same time, however, another problem has emerged, with the importation of counterfeit products that pose as being WaterMark certified but in actual fact are not. I am aware that pressure has been placed on plumbers to install non-WaterMark products that, in some cases, a builder or owner has sourced, and if the plumber refuses a residential customer then they may lose that job.


As well as being available as over-the-counter purchases in retail hardware stores, non-WaterMark and counterfeit WaterMark products are readily available online, and commercial builders buy them directly, in large volumes, from overseas suppliers for their large projects. Sometimes samples are used to gain certification and then cheaper, non-conforming products that carry the WaterMark logo are supplied.


There is no doubt that we are lacking a proper regulatory regime throughout the country, except in Queensland, which I understand has banned the importation of non-compliant plumbing products. What we need here is enforcement, which at the moment is the responsibility of state based authorities, and in some cases they don't even have enough resources to ensure the rules are met. In Western Australia, I have been told, there are only nine inspectors to do this job.


People assume their drinking water is safe, as we have the best standards here in Australia, but imports of non-compliant products put the safety of the general public in jeopardy. This is a serious problem which needs to be addressed. Therefore it is my firm belief that, rather than getting separate states to legislate on this issue, we need a national law to bring the whole industry into unison. The plumbing and gasfitting association have said that contamination of water systems as a result of non-conforming products 'is potentially catastrophic, and we'll be failing the Australian community if these problems are not addressed urgently'. There is a clear and entirely responsible expectation by the industry and consumers that if a product is for sale in Australia it will be lawful and fit for the purpose for which it was intended.


My office received, only a few hours ago, photos from today which show plumbing products that don't have WaterMark certification on sale at a Perth hardware store. I have also received a statement from the industry body outlining its position on importing products containing lead, and I have to say I give it my full support. It seeks:


absolute enforcement that ensures only WaterMark products are sold at all retail outlets, and an introduction of legislation with regard to the point of sale


an immediate review of the water-testing process to ensure that testing of lead levels is consistent


an in-depth research program, to begin as soon as possible, into the possibility of following the approach of the USA and Canada in removing from the manufacture of any brass product connected to the drinkable water supply all lead that can leach.


To sum up, there is mounting evidence that even minute traces of lead found in drinking water can do harm. The World Health Organization already maintains there is no known safe level for lead, and the master plumbers association has said we should follow the American step by reducing lead content to near zero. If we can help protect lives, why shouldn't we do this?

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:10):  One would almost say this motion is a no brainer. Clearly it deserves support, as does any regulation or law deserve support. I know there is one union around the country, the CFMEU, that thinks that laws are made for everybody else except it. It seems to think that it can choose which laws it will abide by and which laws it will ignore, but the rest of Australia agrees that laws are in place to abide by, even if sometimes we don't think they're appropriate. As law-abiding citizens, we should actually abide by them. What Senator Burston and the One Nation party have done with this motion is to highlight the inconsistencies in regulation, or perhaps enforcement, of the national building code around Australia. I thank Senator Burston for raising this matter; I thank Senator Georgiou for his opening remarks, which highlight the issues of concern. They are no doubt of concern not only to the movers but also, I would imagine, to all of us in this chamber.


The Australian government clearly recognises there is genuine community concern about the use of non-compliant and non-conforming building products. Our National Construction Code is amongst the best in the world, and Australians across the board can have confidence in our built environment. We do recognise that we need to continue to work hard to ensure that Australians can continue to have that trust in our built environment. The federal government does not have legislative or regulatory power in this area, but it has an important role in working with the states and territories to ensure the safety of buildings. I congratulate the Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation, the Hon. Craig Laundy, for his work with the Building Ministers Forum, which brings together the relevant Commonwealth, state and territory ministers to set strategic directions for building and construction activity in Australia. The key issue that all governments have agreed requires priority focus is addressing building safety in ensuring appropriate compliance with the national code.


Now I understand, from Senator Burston's motion and from the speech of its mover, Senator Georgiou, that what One Nation is saying is it shouldn't be left to the states and territories; there should be a national code and national enforcement. You could argue about that, but that is, unfortunately, an element of our federalism: we do have a lot of areas of jurisdiction where the Commonwealth doesn't have power but has, over the years, tried to bring a national approach to particular areas.


The Commonwealth is not set up in a public service way to send the police around to enforce the National Construction Code. That has always traditionally been left to the state and territory governments. I understand that One Nation is saying, 'You should get the states and territories out of it and get the Commonwealth to do it.' That opens up the debate on how much the Commonwealth should be centrally controlling everything and how much we believe in federalism, diversification of power and the right of states to administer the things they were left to do under the Constitution. Things that weren't specifically mentioned in the Constitution as Commonwealth powers automatically become the responsibility of the states. That's how it has worked over the years. As I said, there are many different arguments about whether that's good or bad.


One area I would like to see the Commonwealth have more involvement in is rivers and streams, and the allocation and control of water in our vast country, but, unfortunately, only in the Snowy Mountains area and the Murray-Darling Basin, where rivers cross state borders, does the Commonwealth have authority under the Constitution. You can see what happened with the Snowy Mountains scheme, and particularly Snowy 2.0, the brainchild—and love child, might I say—of Prime Minister Turnbull. The Commonwealth is able to go in and do things there, whereas in my state of Queensland, as Senator Hanson knows, although the Commonwealth government can get feasibility studies done and provide money for water activity, we can't actually do it, because it is a responsibility of the state government. As Senator Hanson well knows, you cannot get the Queensland Labor government to do anything with water, because of the Greens political party which keeps them in power—although I might say they're not the only party to do so; One Nation's preference arrangements also assisted. Because of that, you can never rely on some of the water regulation and storage projects desperately needed in my state of Queensland, and I suspect in other states also.


But I have diverged slightly from the question of this motion, in which the senator has highlighted a number of quite dangerous and concerning activities that should be curtailed. I'm not sure whether the Commonwealth can—perhaps by better use of import and border protection powers—look at some of these imported construction enhancements that are not in accordance with the National Construction Code. They are in the code for a reason. The code was adopted by the Commonwealth and all of the state ministers at the ministerial forum. Each state agreed this code would apply. As I mentioned, it's then up to the regulatory enforcement authorities in the various states and territories to ensure those rules in the code—which, as I understand, are replicated in state and territory legislation—are enforced.


In his motion, Senator Burston raises that wider issue: should we leave that with the states and territories or take it over as a Commonwealth responsibility? As I said, that's a bigger concern. But I think that by raising this very important issue in the chamber today when, fortuitously, the other chamber isn't sitting, so we get a little bit more publicity for these sorts of things than we would normally get in the Senate, the mover has highlighted some of the existing problems and the need for enforcement action.


As I said before, it's a no-brainer. The law is there for a very valid purpose, and if it's being breached it should be enforced because we certainly don't want the people of Australia to be impeded upon by substandard products that can, at times, be very dangerous. So I thank the mover for alerting the parliament to this. A number of Senate committees have dealt with similar issues, particularly following the fire in London last year. It is an important thing and I'm glad it is being discussed. The more we can draw attention to this, the more we can get community support for the proper enforcement of the laws which deal with construction within Australia.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:20):  I indicate from the beginning that the Labor Party will not be supporting this proposition relating to building products. I am surprised that the government is supporting it. It's quite clear that Senator Macdonald has not read the resolution that is before the chamber. I notice that the government was only too happy to stand to support this resolution, but they obviously haven't read it. Whilst I commend the proposal that we should re-regulate the building industry—I commend that, and the Labor Party has quite specific policies for the re-regulation of the building industry—I can't support a proposition, and I'm surprised the government can, that says we should ban the importation of other building materials that are not compliant with the National Construction Code. A ban on all non-compliant building materials would, of course, see very little material come in in terms of building products into this country, given the extent of the failure of regulation for the building industry in this country.


We know what has to be done in terms of the aluminium core cladding. We know what has to be done there, and that is that it has to be banned because it is so dangerous. We have made our policy position very clear on that. The government has opposed that position. The government has said, 'Oh, we can't do that.' But now they are supporting a proposition that says that all products that are non-compliant should be banned—all products. We know the situation with regard to the Australian building industry is one where the government is only too happy to fully regulate the building industry when it comes to controlling to reduce the wages and conditions of workers within the building industry. They are only too happy. They have no constitutional problems and there is no issue whatsoever about the capacity of the Commonwealth under a Liberal government to suppress the capacity of workers to protect themselves. But when it comes to the operations of crooks, of shysters, of people that have been ripping off the public, then this is a Commonwealth government that runs a million miles from its responsibilities in terms of public safety. Fundamental questions of enforcement on public safety are quite alien to this government.


It is not as if they don't know what's going on; there has been Senate inquiry after Senate inquiry in terms of the operations of aluminium cladding, in terms of glass, in terms of cabling, in terms of steel and in terms of plumbing products. The evidence before this chamber has been overwhelming. Let me give one example in terms of the question of sprinklers in terms of plumbing products. The non-conforming building products inquiry heard that in the run-up to the G20 summit in Brisbane in 2014, the Australian Fire and Emergency Services Council conducted a safety audit of hotels in the Brisbane CBD, and 71 hotels were checked for the audit. These are the hotels that were, of course, the five-star hotels designed to accommodate the leaders of the global nations who were attending the G20, like President Obama and other guests in this country. Of the 71 hotels that were checked for audit, 68 were found to be not up to standard. The sprinkling systems were not up to standard in 68 of the 71. Why was that? Because simple arrangements have now been entered into in the building industry in this country where the certification system has become relationship based. That is, the owner of a building—a hotel, in this case—goes out and subcontracts out the certification arrangement, and under those circumstances they can get the findings they want on fundamental issues as to whether their sprinkler system is working properly and safely. The certifiers now know that their livelihoods depend upon keeping good relations with the building owners, or with the builders in terms of putting up a building. The responsibility for making sure that products and practices conform with appropriate standards has effectively been privatised.


That's the position under the national Building Code in this country. This is a proposition that Minister Laundy seems to constantly misunderstand. The assistant minister, you might think, might have further responsibilities to understand his responsibilities. But of course, given that there have been no Liberals turning up to these various inquiries, it's not surprising that the senators aren't reporting back to the government on just how serious these propositions are.


But departmental officials have been going. They know the consequences of the failure to maintain our building regulations in this country. They know that the fundamental flaw in our building regulations is the provision that says that there is a capacity—no matter how strict the black-and-white rules—and a provision in the Building Code that says that we can change whatever provision is there, by a code that says, 'We can deem to satisfy; we have a performance based arrangement; we can get around the regulations,' by people who are acting in private industry, with a relationship to the developer, to the builder or to the building owner. It says, 'We've got an alternative to these so-called rigid standards.' Is it any wonder that we have such widespread abuse? And is it any wonder that the overwhelming evidence of document fraud, certification fraud and product substitution is so common in the building industry? What is a wonder is the fact that the government has done nothing about it. Oh, it has another committee look into it. It gets the mirror out. It looks into the problem—and goes on looking into the problem.


We've seen this issue in the Grenfell Tower fire in London. The fire officials in this country are saying that the same thing can happen here. The minister says, 'Oh, we've got a sprinkler system regulation here. It's different from the British.' Well, the reality is there's no enforcement mechanism in place. We know this from the evidence to the inquiry—put by not just anybody in the process but by General Manager of the Australian Building Codes Board Mr Neil Savery. He said that the industry had changed dramatically in recent decades, with deregulation and globalisation making it harder to ensure that buildings were built to certain standards. He said that the sophisticated, performance based code of regulation which was introduced in the early 1990s needed highly qualified people to understand how it works. At the same time, the former, government-run building certification was privatised, and the industry underwent a process of 'deregulation or reduction in regulatory requirements around things like mandatory inspections'. So there is a fundamental flaw in the regulatory arrangements in this country.


Then of course there is a system where there is just an appalling record as to compliance, where developers want to cut corners, and they say, 'Well, of course, if you enforce the standards, it's a brake on innovation.' Public safety then becomes a product to be traded. And governments—particularly Liberal governments—that want to promote this notion of deregulation and privatisation say that public safety is someone else's concern.


The interim taskforce in Victoria which looked at these issues highlighted the simple facts—which the Senate report also identified—that these were not isolated questions but questions that were systemic, running right throughout the building industry, and that this cost-cutting attitude, this attitude of a cavalier disregard for public safety, ran right across the industry.


That's why Labor has said: 'We need a new licensing arrangement. We need to bring public accountability back into the building industry. Everyone in the supply chain needs to be licensed, and if you fail this fundamental test in terms of your obligations to public safety you lose your licence. You lose your livelihood.'


We want to ensure that public accountability is restored to the building practices in this country. We do not just want an assault on trade union activity; we want everyone in the building industry to be responsible for meeting their obligations. We do not want a blind eye to be turned, we do not want another buck shoved, we do not want another suggestion that it is someone else's responsibility; we want genuine accountability brought back into the industry. That is why Labor has said we will ban the importation of cladding of a particularly dangerous type. But we will also ensure that there is proper accountability in the industry by having a national licensing system that ensures public accountability.


We will also say this: the cabinet minister in the national government takes responsibility for the building industry, not the person who runs behind the organ grinder's cart like the curs in this government—people who have no knowledge of what is going on, no genuine commitment to public safety and no political weight to actually ensure that they can stand up— (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (16:30):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this and I appreciate a matter of this importance being brought before the Senate for discussion. It is interesting to note that Liberal senators are supporting One Nation in bringing this matter on, continuing the ever-strengthening Liberal-One Nation alliance. And it is even more astonishing to hear Senator Macdonald, the senior Liberal in this place—at least in terms of years served—saying 'any regulation or law deserves support'. I had to write that down to make sure I got it right! That is good to hear because this is a government that in so many areas completely ignores the laws it is required to enforce. And as Senator Carr just outlined—reasonably eloquently!—already they are completely ignoring their own standards, their own requirements and their own obligations in the area that is being talked about. As usual, they say it's the states' fault. Ensuring human safety, ensuring that humans and our environment are not poisoned, has been a core Greens value since the foundation of the Australian Greens.


Normally when we are talking about having regulations not just in place but enforced to protect people from being poisoned by corporations that put profit ahead of human safety and community need, you would expect Senator Macdonald to be complaining about green tape and red tape getting in the way of business being able to operate. This government has a fixation on attacking not just the CFMEU but also teachers. Today there was a motion by the Liberals, which, sadly, was supported not just by the usual One Nation-Liberal alliance but by others as well, attacking teachers in Queensland for handing out a sticker with a flag on it. The government are so concerned about the safety of buildings that they want to attack the union that focuses on the safety of buildings to protect the people who have to live in those buildings. That's how concerned they are about human safety. They want to attack the organisation that, more than anything else, focuses on trying to ensure that the building materials are safe. And yet they have the astonishing gall to come in here and say that any law or regulation deserves support! Time and time again, this government deliberately seeks to undermine its own legal obligations—in the environmental area, for starters. They completely and deliberately flout their obligations under our national environment laws and in so many other areas as well. I suppose we should be pleased that at least that statement from the government speaker is on the record, but it is hard to believe that it is actually genuine.


It is absolutely crucial that we ensure that the most fundamental aspects of human existence—our drinking water, the homes we live in and the hotels we stay in—are safe from contamination and also in terms of fire standards and all the other building standards that the Greens and others have promoted for years. We continually get attacked for red tape and green tape. What we are about is trying to ensure that sustainability, human safety and the basic rights and needs of the community are put first, rather than corporate profit. But we usually get attacked. Whilst there may be the usual hollow words that we have come to expect over quite a number of years now from Senator Macdonald, it is at least important to have that on the record.


So the Greens very much support the need for proper enforcement of construction codes and, in many cases, the strengthening of them to make them more effective. The tragedy of that fire in London that killed so many people was not just because of its basic human loss but because it was a symbol of what happens when corporate profit gets put ahead of human safety, particularly, as it happens, for those who are least well-off—those least able to afford to ensure that their drinking water and their homes are safe.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:35):  I rise to speak to this motion not necessarily because I support it but because I think it deserves to be debated. It is an issue of concern for someone who spent 25 years working in the construction industry and who has seen the results of this at a practical level, as Senator Georgiou has expressed he has himself. In fact, we're probably rare beasts, alongside Senator Marshall, who was an electrician—is an electrician? I'm not sure whether he still has his licence.




Senator Marshall:
  I still am; my hourly rate's much higher now!




Senator COLBECK:
  I'm sure, appropriately, Senator Marshall. I will go to one of the points that Senator Carr talked about. I'm not sure, to be honest, whether he was actually arguing for the motion or against the motion at the time because he was talking about wanting to ban products but then not wanting to ban products. He was talking about regulation but in different forms or another. But I do note the work that he's done in relation to the number of inquiries, particularly around cladding. I have to say I disagree with him on the cladding ban too, because the core element of this whole debate is ensuring that products that are used in construction, whether they be for residential, commercial or industrial, are fit for purpose.


Australia has, as a number of senators have said already, a standards based construction code. One of the really good things that has happened in recent years is that that construction code has been put online and is freely available for everybody. Once upon a time, that wasn't the case. When I was in the industry you had to buy it and then maintain it at currency. It wasn't necessarily easy, because one of the elements of our federation, as Senator Macdonald indicated, is that there are different rules and regulations in varying states, which can be an issue. We have progressed significantly over the last couple of decades not only with common recognition of qualifications within the construction industry for various trades but also with bringing some of the standards that exist into the national code. 


Senator Georgiou, if I were a taxpayer from Western Australia who had contributed to the hospital, for example, or to the stadium, I'd be pretty bloody angry that the circumstances that arose in those places actually occurred. I can recall, as a very, very small contractor in the early nineties, when the big guys in the construction industry in this country decided they'd bring in quality assurance. One of the reasons for bringing it in was that they thought that nobody else could provide it as well. They were looking for quality assurance to be a competitive advantage for them in the marketplace with key customers, particularly government, that nobody else could offer. They would provide that assurance as part of their system of offering design-and-construct packages, particularly to government and to large corporate clients, as to how their project was going to comply not only with the specification but also with the construction codes. 


One of the genuine questions that I have in this broader debate is: what is going on with that process? Who is actually properly operating their quality systems and the compliance that should fit within those, and then checking those before a contractor goes on to the next project? If I were in the government of Western Australia, I'd be going back through the systems of the people who were responsible for various elements of those particular projects to see where they went wrong.


Senator Carr talked about the issue around substitution, and I think Senator Georgiou did also. The bane of my existence in competing in the construction industry as a contractor was knowing that there were a set of specifications provided, particularly when you were dealing with a commercial project, and somebody wasn't providing, in particular, materials that were compliant with the specifications. Again, the specifications are written in a way that refers back to compliance with the standards. So those sorts of things that you talked about raise for me a question about the system: who's looking at that process of compliance when considering the next project or the next tender?


Senator Georgiou mentioned the issue of lead in fittings. That was taken out of the Australian system in 1989. The requirement is that fittings be lead free. So here we are, decades later, with a problem. If someone's going to provide a counterfeit product, that creates a particular problem in itself—and that, in my view, is a criminal act in more than one way. There are already rules, regulations and laws in place that deal with that. If you're providing a counterfeit product into the market, if it's not as you present it, it breaches not only consumer law but also other laws in respect of potential safety and a number of other things.


Like Senator Carr, I've had representations around glass. I've had representations around plywood. I've had representations around steel. I've had representations around pipework for fire systems, and there have been some incidents—let's not call them 'famous'; let's call them 'infamous' incidents—where, particularly in respect of fire systems, the pipe that was provided wasn't in compliance with the Australian standard required, and it burst. It's been a significant expense to people who are looking to access their building, but also to other contractors through the system. Having also looked at some projects in respect of trying to work out where the fault lay, I think it's a complex and difficult matter.


I think the work that is being done, through the body that looks after the national consumer code, to ensure that qualified, competent practitioners are engaged throughout the construction process is very important because, as I said earlier, this is about ensuring that materials are fit for purpose. There's no point putting a 10-millimetre galvanised bolt into a machine that requires something that has high-tensile steel in it. It's going to fail.



That's what the standards are there for. That's what the certification processes are supposed to be there for. That's what the specification processes are there for. In circumstances where you've got an architect and an engineer working on a project, part of their job is to ensure that the products that are going into the building are as they have specified. For an engineer, their job is to design a structure such that it's structurally sound, and it's also part of their job to ensure that it's built to that standard, particularly if they are employed to do that, rather than just do the initial design. But there should be a process of ensuring that that's done, and the quality assurance system that I talked about earlier is certainly part of that process. But, in respect of other products that perhaps are not so much structural but part of the fit-out process, it's certainly up to the architects or the supervising agent to ensure that those products are what they specified they were. Substitution in the industry is not a new thing. I can recall submitting tenders and being required, if I wanted to put a substitute product in, particularly in government circumstances, to justify the fact that it was at least equivalent to the product in all aspects to the one that was specified in the specification.


One of the real concerns I have in this current debate is actually about compliance and—as Senator Carr said, and I agree with him—enforcement of the system. It's all very well, though, for Senator Carr to try and blame the Commonwealth government for this, but we do live in a federation of states and there is a division of powers. Quite frankly, from my perspective, those who are responsible for managing those things should manage those things. They shouldn't be passing it off to one level of government or another. One level of government shouldn't need to come in over the top of the other. The responsibilities are there for a purpose, and they should be complied with, in my view.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (16:45):  Senator Georgiou, thank you for your contribution in this debate. I think there is much merit to what you have said. In fact, your resolution wouldn't have been far away from getting support from the opposition. Given it was a motion that wasn't about wedging anyone politically—it was about trying to address a very genuine need, which I accept is there—I would encourage you to talk to us about these matters. We may have been able to get to a position of support for such a resolution, but, as it stands, we can't quite get there. We do support the bulk of it. I certainly support your comments and the concerns that you've raised.


I do want to take a little bit of issue, before I get back to some of the substance of it, with some of what Senator Colbeck said. I do this respectfully. Senator Colbeck indicated that there are regulations and standards out there that have to be complied with and that it's those people that are responsible for complying with the regulation who should have the responsibility to do so. That's absolutely self-evident, but what is also self-evident is that people that are responsible for ensuring compliance, under regulations and the code, are not doing so. This is the problem that Senator Carr indicated very clearly earlier is because—




Senator Colbeck:
  And I agree.




Senator MARSHALL:
  I'm glad you say you agree.



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator MARSHALL:
  We have a proposition—Senator McKenzie laughed, but Senator Colbeck just indicated he did agree—that we've privatised the system, and we've made it so weak no-one's responsible for doing it.




Senator Colbeck:
  They are.




Senator MARSHALL:
  Well, if it wasn't, Senator Colbeck, then we wouldn't have this problem, but we do have the problem. Again, it's self-evident that those that are supposed to be enforcing these standards are not doing so. If they're not doing so and people are being put at risk, it is incumbent to come back to where Senator Macdonald left off. He actually told us:


Australians across the board can have confidence in our built environment.


Australians should assume and, I think rightfully, do assume that the products in our buildings are safe and fit for purpose, and that if they weren't the government would have done something about it—but they are wrong. There are so many things in our built environment that are not safe and are not fit for purpose, and the government has not done anything about it.


As Senator Colbeck pointed out, I'm a tradesperson and I've worked in the built environment, as has he and as has Senator Georgiou. I'm sure Senator Georgiou—even though I think he's a bit younger than I am—will have experienced asbestos in the workplace. I was told by people when I started my apprenticeship: 'You really shouldn't be working with asbestos. It's unsafe.' Nonetheless, all our switchboards had asbestos surroundings. The manufacturer very cleverly renamed asbestos sheet as Zelemite and all sorts of other things. So, we were happily drilling it and putting enormous amounts of asbestos into an enclosed environment in which we were working. And people would say, 'Oh, that's not asbestos; it's called something else now'—putting people at risk.


At the time, even though the companies knew that asbestos was dangerous—my employer accepted that asbestos was dangerous—we were still being given those products to work with. At that time we started to say, as tradespeople, that we were not going to work with this anymore: 'We're not going to do it.' You raised the point earlier, Senator Georgiou, about plumbers being pressured to use lead based fittings, and I'll come back to this, because I want to use this example. I and many other tradesmen with my employer started to say, 'We're simply not going to use asbestos anymore; we're just not going to do it', but if I tried to do that now I would have the ABCC down on me like a tonne of bricks. I would be deemed as taking unlawful industrial action, and I would be fined. I would be absolutely unable to push back. If my employer said, 'Well, bad luck; you will use those products,' there would be nothing I could do about it. And if I attempted to do something about it I would be in breach of the code of conduct of the building industry and I'd be prosecuted by the ABCC.


That is how bad it's gotten in this country, where the government will spend hundreds of millions of dollars putting up an organisation to ensure that employees can't take anything that looks remotely like industrial action, whether it be about their safety or not, but will spend a pittance, if anything, on compliance with building products. That's where the priorities of this government are completely twisted and completely wrong. Senator Georgiou tells us that he's been talked to by plumbers who are now being pressured to use products that have lead in them, and I say to them that they'd better be very careful in pushing back about that. The fact that they have to go to their senator to complain about it, and not do something themselves in their own workplace, speaks volumes about the lack of rights and the lack of ability of working people in this country now to protect themselves from substandard products—things that are dangerous not only for the people they're being installed for but also for the people doing the installation.


So, I'm absolutely in sync with your objectives, Senator Georgiou. You are absolutely right that this is a problem. You are right to point out—and as I said earlier, and Senator Macdonald confirmed—that people automatically assume that in this civilised country the things we're using have been deemed safe, that we would not allow things that are unsafe to be sold. But they're wrong, because there is no compliance. And whether it be just substitution—and I accept that there is an element of criminal substitution, but that's not the whole problem; that's a part of the problem—there are these products out there that can be used. The example of the aluminium cladding is, again, one of those classic examples, with a flammability rate higher than that of petrol. You are effectively surrounding your building with petrol and assuming that that's safe. Yet everyone who bought one of those apartments thinks, 'Well, surely the Australian government and the regulators that we employ would not allow a building to be built out of petrol—surely not!' Yet we do, and we've failed to stop it. This Senate has done inquiries into that matter and made recommendations, and we've still failed to act. It's an absolute abrogation of our responsibility. Quite frankly, I'm gobsmacked.


I say to Senator Georgiou: there are a number of ways of really addressing this problem. Senator Carr went through some of the ways we intend to address the problem when we're in government. But I would encourage you to think about the restriction on the rights of working people to push back against employers who want to use these products. And you might ask: 'Why do employers want to use such products? Do they really want to kill people? Do they want to poison people?'


Of course they don't! But they're driven by the dollar. They're driven by the profit motive. And while that profit motive is there, if there's weak regulation or a weak regulator and employees can't push back—if no-one can push back—they'll take the dollar. That's the problem: they'll take the dollar. And people can't have confidence in a system that allows that to operate in such a way.


So, I'd encourage you, Senator Georgiou, to talk to the opposition about these matters. Senator Carr has been deeply involved in these matters. Let's see if we can get a position that the Senate can agree to and move forward on. We would look forward to your support, but I say, also, to look at the way industrial relations are managed in this country. It has gone so far against the rights of workers, and I think that's worthy of your consideration as well. (Time expired)

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-03-20,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (16:55):  I rise to contribute to the urgency motion relating to the need for enforcing compliance with Australian building product standards.


On 23 June 2015, three former senators—Nick Xenophon, John Madigan and Jacqui Lambie—referred an inquiry into non-conforming building products to the Senate Economics References Committee. Since then, the committee has tabled three interim reports. The most recent, on protecting Australians from asbestos, was tabled in the Senate on 22 November 2017. The evidence presented to the committee was concerning and demonstrated significant issues with non-complying and non-conforming building products.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee and, in particular, Senator Ketter, for the extensive work done on this important issue of public policy. I'd also like to acknowledge the work done by the Building Ministers Forum, who I understand has commissioned Professor Peter Shergold AC and Bronwyn Weir to assess problems in compliance and enforcement within the building construction system across Australia. I look forward to seeing the results of this work.


From glass windows that cracked and disintegrated at ASIO's new headquarters in Canberra to non-complying electrical products, such as the Infinity electrical cables that posed serious risks to the health and safety of Australians, the impact of non-complying and non-conforming building products cannot be overstated. The cladding issue is a most serious public safety issue that requires urgent attention. The issue was brought to the public's attention in November 2014 when the Lacrosse building in Docklands in Melbourne caught fire. Since that time, governments, both federal and state, have failed to respond adequately. The Lacrosse incident was the trigger for the Senate inquiry. The Lacrosse apartment building in Docklands had aluminium cladding fixed to its exterior. Flames raced up several floors, and it was only through sheer luck that no lives were lost. Builders who consciously chose to cut costs by using non-compliant panels saved only about $3 per square metre, putting profit ahead of lives. I could talk about the follow-on fire in the Grenfell Tower where, sadly, the luck at Docklands was not present. I don't feel the need.


The Senate inquiry also received submissions and heard evidence that compliance and enforcement are not keeping pace with rapid changes to our economy and global supply chains, or how or where products are manufactured or sourced. There appears to be a growing number of fraudulent documents associated with imported products, and this makes it hard for surveyors to identify what is compliant and what is not. Overseas laboratories are now testing to Australian standards, but their reports have identified major testing and reporting flaws in addition to misuse. This is simply not good enough.


I note that everyone who has spoken here today has done so in earnest agreement with the principles behind the motion. This need not have been an urgency motion. If there had been action when these issues were first raised, it could have been managed calmly, strategically and without ever-present risk to life. I look up in the gallery and see primary school children that I fear may still be debating this topic when they are in the Senate. Unfortunately, Senator Burston is right in saying that this is a matter of urgency, and I thank Senator Burston for bringing it to the Senate's attention.


Question negatived.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:00):  by leave—I present the report of the delegation to Papua New Guinea in November last year and seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I first of all thank the members of the delegation, which included my fellow senator Senator Kimberley Kitching and also Mr Ken O'Dowd, the member for Flynn; and Ms Cathy O'Toole, the member for Herbert. I particularly thank Julia Agostino, the delegation secretary. I thank officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and representatives from the Crawford business school at ANU for some pre-delegation briefings. I particularly thank His Excellency the high commissioner, Mr Bruce Davis, for the support from him and his staff to the delegation during the trip.


Papua New Guinea is our closest neighbour. It's one that I always feel we have an obligation to. It was once a colony of Australia and it is a mere seven kilometres across the water from my electorate, which is the state of Queensland. So we have a lot in common with the people of PNG, and we've worked hard as Australians over many years to bring benefits and progress to that particular place.


The delegation was privileged to arrive on the day of the most important thing that has happened in Port Moresby for a long, long period of time, and that was the Rugby League World Cup match between Ireland and PNG, which I'm delighted to report that PNG won. That was a great introduction to PNG and to many of the ministers who we met who were attending that very significant match as guests of the high commissioner. I have to say that PNG comprises many hundreds of different tribes—700 or 800 different tribes and 800 or 900 different language groups. But to me the thing that joins PNG together as a nation is their Rugby League team. When that happens, they are all on the same page.


We were privileged to meet not only a lot of parliamentarians but also significant administrative people in PNG. I particularly want to mention just a few. There was our meeting with the Speaker of the parliament, the Hon. Job Pomat, who curiously is the member for Manus. He was able to give us some information not only about the running of the parliament and how his role as Speaker works in that parliamentary assembly but also about his own electorate of Manus, and I often wish that Senator McKim had been there to get the real  information on that island.


We attended a very productive meeting with the Women in Leadership lunch, went to the National Museum and Art Gallery, and went up to the Western Highlands provincial administration, which was a real eye-opener. It was interesting to see the real progress being made in some areas, and I particularly want to mention the Mul-Baiyer District development administrative office and Mr Mark Kamjua, who is doing wonderful things in that part of the Highlands of PNG. It was interesting to go to a Westpac innovation hub and see people lining up to actually open a bank account. It was of great interest, of great trauma almost, and very surprising for us Australians to find that many people didn't have a bank account and that the actual activity in opening a bank account was almost an once-in-a-lifetime event.


We met with the Mount Hagen Chamber of Commerce. We went to Coffee for Connoisseurs, a great commercial organisation. There was a group of people gathered outside the fence of this place we were at and the crowd approached the gate. We thought,' Gee, there's trouble here.' What it was, they were demanding that we come and speak to them. As Australian politicians, having a crowd demand that we come and speak to them was a new experience for us! They were delighted that we were there. We mixed with the crowd. There is a lovely photograph in our report of my colleague Mr Ken O'Dowd addressing them, because Ken was in PNG for some time and was able to speak to them in pidgin English. It was a wonderful trip to build on the relationship we have with PNG, and I congratulate all involved.

 (Tasmania) (17:06):  I wish to respond to that report.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  You don't have to respond to it; you can speak to the motion.




Senator McKIM:
  I very much appreciate your assistance and your counsel there, Mr Acting Deputy President. I wanted to make some observations about the situation on Manus Island which, of course, Senator Macdonald referred to and, in fact, he referred to me personally. I will place it again on the record in this place that I've visited Manus Island five times in the last 12 months. I want to say that the many hundreds of men who Australia has abandoned on Manus Island are still there. They are still doing it tough. They still do not have adequate supports. Most of them have no idea what is going to happen to them in the future. And many of them have been profoundly harmed by the experience of the last five years; profoundly harmed by the indefinite detention to which the Australian and Papua New Guinean governments have subjected them; profoundly harmed by the lack of basic human services and supports; and profoundly harmed by becoming—through no fault of their own; through doing nothing wrong whatsoever other than stretching out a hand to Australia for assistance—Australia's political prisoners.


The men on Manus Island and the men, women and children on Nauru are like the corpses that used to be impaled on the walls of medieval cities in an attempt to dissuade other desperate people from trying to enter. These people, our fellow human beings, have been treated disgustingly and disgracefully in order to try and send a message to other desperate people that they should not try to seek asylum in Australia and arrive by boat. The United Nations has time after time declared that Australia is in breach of international law and declared time after time that Australia is in breach of conventions that we have signed as a country. Our global reputation as a compassionate country is in tatters, and these people—the men on Manus Island, and the men, women and children on Nauru—are still suffering every day as a result of the policy lockstep within which the Labor and Liberal parties are operating in this country.


We still have no idea how many more, if any more, will be sent to the United States as part of the people-swap arrangement, where Australia agreed to accept people seeking asylum in the US in return for the US agreeing to accept some people from Manus Island and Nauru. This is a dark and bloody stain on our country's history, and it's time that people in this parliament got active, rediscovered their humanity and worked together to bring an abrupt end to this terrible chapter in our national story.


Decades ago, Australia was held up around the world as a human rights leader and, in fact, was actively involved and showed great leadership in crafting some of this planet's most important human rights conventions. And where are we now? We're lagging because we torture people in this country. The Labor and Liberal parties support torture of innocent people. We are deliberately harming these people. No matter how much members of the Labor and Liberal parties in this place and other parties that support the disgrace that is occurring on Manus Island and Nauru put their hands over their ears, there are still cries for help. As someone who's visited the Lombrum prison run by Australia on Manus Island, I can tell you the cries, the psychological harm and the physical harm will never ever leave me.

 (Western Australia) (17:34):  Senator Cash, Senator Hanson has asserted that some people will be better off under the Hanson amendment. Can you please explain to us who these people are.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (17:34):  This gives me an opportunity, Chair, to advise the Senate that the government will be supporting the amendments put forward by One Nation. It's an amendment to schedule 4. Schedule 4 of the bill closes bereavement allowance and provides support to bereaved persons through a new jobseeker payment or youth allowance from 20 March 2020. This amendment changes the formula for calculating payments to those who lose a partner, to ensure that no-one will receive less in financial support under the new arrangements than they would receive under the current system. I believe they are the people that Senator Hanson is actually referring to.


The government supports this amendment, which builds upon the government amendments to support bereaved pregnant women. This amendment ensures that no bereaved person will be worse off with the cessation of the bereavement allowance. Bereavement allowance is paid at the pension rate of payment, compared to the jobseeker payment, which will be paid at the allowance rate of payment. As the bill is currently drafted, a bereaved person claiming jobseeker payment or youth allowance will receive a one-off lump sum payment, in addition to their ongoing fortnightly payment, following the death of their partner. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, this amendment will, from 20 March 2020, change the way payments are calculated for bereaved persons to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person will receive under the jobseeker payment or youth allowance and what they would receive under bereavement allowance. Again, they are the people Senator Hanson is referring to.


I need to point out that with the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment as they do under the current system. Instead, they will receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements, to support them in their time of bereavement, and will seamlessly move into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:37):  Minister, I seek your advice. Senator Hanson asserted that some people will be better off under these amendments. Do the amendments to schedule 4 bring the payments up to what they are under the existing arrangements? Is anyone going to be paid more than they would currently receive under the existing bereavement entitlements?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:39):  I'm sorry; you might need to explain that to me a little more. Our understanding, from looking at this amendment, is that while some people will be better off they'll only be better off relative to the schedule as you amended it, not better off compared to the bereavement payments as they are currently paid—is that correct?

 (Western Australia) (17:43):  Senator Hanson asserted that people will be better off. I want to know who will be better off.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:44):  While Senator Hanson prepares to move her amendment, I want to clarify something with the government. The assertion that this amendment will make people better off is based on their being better off in relation to the schedule that is proposed in this bill, not compared to the existing arrangements for bereavement payments?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:45):  I have a question for Senator Hanson, when she's ready, but we might give her the opportunity to move her amendments. I might continue asking questions of the government while Senator Hanson prepares herself. As I understand it, the eligibility for this payment is more stringent, because it's moved from the pensions asset test to the job seeker allowance assets test. Is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (17:46):  I'm instructed that the figure that relates to your question is that 960 people who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim job seeker payment and be no worse off.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:46):  That is not the question. My question is about the eligibility for the job seeker payment in bereavement circumstances. The assets-and-income test for that used to be the assets-and-income test equivalent to the age pension, but that is now changing to the income-and-assets test for the job seeker allowance. Is that correct?

 (Western Australia) (17:47):  So, Minister, when you say that no-one will be worse off, they will have the same income, but only if they are eligible to receive that income and the eligibility for a bereavement allowance or the new equivalent of it, job seeker allowance, under bereavement circumstances is now more stringent?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (17:49):  I understand that most bereavement allowance recipients receive payment for 14 weeks at the high pension rate. Without this amendment, the total amount of jobseeker payments over the 14 weeks, including the lump-sum payment, is estimated at around $1,300 less for bereavement allowance paid for the same period; and, for youth allowance, the difference is estimated at around $2,200. This is now rectified with this amendment put forward by One Nation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:50):  But the opposition, with the support of the Greens, sought to rectify this yesterday by asking this place to vote against schedule 4. If we had voted against schedule 4 in this place then the existing entitlements, which means bereavement allowance paid at the age pension rate, would have been the status quo. Members of One Nation missed that vote and they came back into this place and asked for that vote to be recommitted because they agreed with the government. Now why are you moving this motion today if you agree with the government? The simple fact is: this is exactly contrary to what the government put forward yesterday and, what's more, it does not restore the entitlements for bereavement allowance to everyone who would have otherwise had it under the existing arrangements in the legislation. You should have stuck with your vote to reject schedule 4 yesterday because, had you voted it down, people would receive exactly the same rate as they do now, which is what you're seeking to do with this amendment. But what's more, your claim that no-one will be worse off is completely false, because those 30 persons a year will no longer be eligible for bereavement allowance.

Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendments (R6) and (R8)



The effect of amendment (R6) is to increase the amount of a one‑off payment to certain recipients of youth allowance under the Social Security Act 1991. It is framed as a request because it will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and so will increase a ""proposed charge or burden on the people"".


The effect of amendment (R8) is to increase the amount of a one‑off payment to certain recipients of jobseeker payment under the Social Security Act 1991. It is framed as a request because it will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and so will increase a ""proposed charge or burden on the people"".


Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendments (R6) and (R8)



These amendments will increase the amount of a one‑off payment to certain recipients of youth allowance and jobseeker payment.


The statement of reasons for moving these amendments as requests advises that they will increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.


The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments that would result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation. If that is the effect of the amendments, then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that they be moved as requests.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:53):  I've got a number of questions, particularly for Senator Hanson, about this amendment. I think it is appropriate to direct them to her given that it is her amendment. I assume that this is something she's worked on very hard. My first question is simply: how is this amendment different to the amendment you voted against last night? If it refreshes your memory, last night, you, on two occasions, voted with the government to remove the bereavement allowance. We had to put the vote again because two of your senators missed the vote so they came back in and voted with the government, with the Liberal Party, to cut this allowance. I'm interested to know how it is that this amendment that you're now putting up, that you claim is about supporting the allowance, differs from the amendment that you personally voted against twice last night.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:54):  If you look at the government's amendment, at 567FB, you see that the daily rate of a person's youth allowance on the relevant day was times 14, for the 14 weeks, and it was double that amount. Under the amendment that I have put forward, under 567FB, it would be the daily rate of youth allowance on the relevant day times 14, times seven. So the amendment that I am putting up has increased it considerably. The same is relevant to 660LI. It is the daily rate of a person's jobseeker payment on the relevant day, times 14, by two, under the government. Under my amendment, it would be the daily rate of a person's jobseeker payment on the relevant day by 14 by 4½ times. So it is a lot more for the person.

I don't have the resources of the Labor Party or the government to put an actual figure on the number of people that would be better off. The amendment states that it is better for the people, and I stand by that. It is the Labor Party—and you yourself, Senator Watt—trying to make political points on this, by your comments this morning. It is just the usual you. So, if you are—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Hanson, I would encourage you to speak to the chair.




Senator HANSON:
  All right; to the chair: as I am saying, if the Labor Party and everyone here is in agreement that this bereavement payment should not be gone, for a cost of $1,040,000, I think it's important that we do support this bereavement allowance. Hence, although the One Nation party voted the way that we did last night, on reflection this is why we have put this amendment forward today—because it should be there and we stand by that. I don't want to cause any pain or undue stress on people, especially those going through this time.


As I've said, the amendment ensures that no bereaved person is worse off with the cessation of bereavement allowance. As the bill is currently drafted, from 20 March 2020 a bereaved person claiming youth allowance or jobseeker payment who is not pregnant will receive a one-off higher payment following the death of their partner. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, this amendment will change the way payments are calculated for bereaved persons from 20 March 2020, to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person receives under jobseeker payment or youth allowance compared to what they would've received under a bereavement allowance. With the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment, as they do under the current system. Instead, they receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements to support them in their time of bereavement and they will seamlessly move on into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends. This will make the system simpler and maintain support for those experiencing one of the most difficult moments of crisis. I have moved my requests for amendment. I hope that they get the support of this chamber and that people stop playing party politics.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:59):  I'm actually not trying to play politics; I'm just asking questions about an amendment that you've moved, Senator Hanson. As I say, Senator Hanson and her colleagues have spent the day claiming to be moving an amendment here which will make many people in Australia better off. I ask you again: how many? Surely, if you were going to make that claim, you would have some idea of how many people are going to be better off. Do you have any idea how many people will be better off as a result of this amendment, given that you've spent the day claiming that people will be?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:00):  I also wish to direct a question to Senator Hanson, and my question is this: you maintain that you want to make bereaved people in this nation better off; is that correct? Senator Hanson, I need to ask you: are you aware that there is still an alternative amendment before this chamber that would allow us to knock out schedule 4? You voted with the government yesterday to reinstate that amendment. However, Senator Siewert still has a motion before this chamber that will knock out the schedule as drafted by the government. It will reinstate the existing eligibility arrangements. That means that those 30 people who would miss out on this bereavement payment would retain eligibility for it.


The simple fact is that the minister has clarified that, rather than your amendment making people better off, that definition of 'better off' is only relative to the regressive steps in this legislation. No-one is actually better off than the status quo with your amendment. If you truly want to make people better off, will you vote for Senator Siewert's amendment to knock out schedule 4?

Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (18:02):  I am sitting here absolutely amazed at the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. We are trying to introduce an amendment that will make people no worse off in terms of their bereavement. It is a very sad time in people's lives when they lose a loved one. It is a very difficult time in terms of partners losing their loved one, and for them to lose remuneration or pensions or allowances at that particular time would be very, very distressful. We are trying to play a fair card. We're not playing politics like the Labor Party and the hypocritical senators over there who want to score political points at every opportunity.




Senator Chisholm:
  Thirty people.




Senator BURSTON:
  You can interject as much as you like; it won't concern me too much. I strongly support this amendment by One Nation and Senator Hanson, and you can bellyache all you like. In the public eye, you are just being total and absolute hypocrites, and you just do not like One Nation coming up with policies and ideas that perhaps—




Senator Urquhart:
  That disadvantage people.




Senator BURSTON:
  Well, they don't disadvantage people. I'll take that interjection. They do not disadvantage people. It's 30 people in 25 million. I think that every decision made by parliament will disadvantage someone in some way and will not advantage 100 per cent of the population, so I support the amendment before the chamber.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:04):  I find it strange that it's being said that this is going to help everyone. There have been claims made that everybody is going to be better off under this schedule. There will be people who will be worse off. That's the point about this whole schedule. That's why we are seeking to disallow the whole schedule, to knock off the whole schedule. It is because people will be—



Senator Burston interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  Don't get ridiculous!



The CHAIR:  I remind senators to speak through the chair.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Sorry. Through you, Chair, I'm saying to Senator Burston: don't be ridiculous! The point is that people will be worse off under this overall schedule.


We've just heard from Senator Hanson and Senator Burston about how people in bereavement are obviously going through a really, really hard time—and they are. That is why we supported the ALP amendment last night to disallow it. At the time I said I had an amendment, too. I will be moving it because the situation with this schedule will be different if this amendment gets up. Senator Burston, you will have the chance to actually make sure nobody will be worse off because we will have the opportunity to vote down that schedule. I'm hoping you will lend support to my amendment that says: 'Let's get rid of this schedule because it is cruel to people who would have been able to access this allowance when they were in fact bereaved. They will now be excluded.' It is a fallacy to say that no-one will be worse off. It's too cute by half to say that when you are supporting a schedule that means that people will no longer be able to access this allowance.


Let's be really clear. If Senator Hanson can't provide the numbers for those who will be better off in terms of getting more money than they would have—that is what I understand Senator Hanson to have said—is the minister or the government, who have indicated support for this amendment, able to tell us how many will be better off or getting more money than they would have both under the original allowance and under the process that was passed previously by the Senate in the amendment? Does that make sense?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:07):  I think I've explained this several times in relation to different questions that have been put. The answer is 960 people annually who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim the jobseeker payment or another payment. As I've also already stated, approximately 30 newly bereaved people per year would not qualify for the income support payment due to their income, assets or other circumstances—for example, their age. In terms of what this amendment does, most bereavement allowance recipients, as I've already stated, receive payment for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment put forward by Senator Hanson, the total amount of jobseeker payments over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, is estimated at approximately $1,300 less than the bereavement allowance paid for the same period. For youth allowance, the difference is estimated at approximately $2,200. So what this amendment will do is ensure that under the legislation that is currently before the Senate—and the government's amendment was passed—no bereaved person is worse off with the cessation of the bereavement allowance.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (18:10):  Just to be really clear, Senator Cash, on these numbers, you're saying that the original proposal that was voted for last night by the government and One Nation would have transferred 960 current recipients of the bereavement allowance to Newstart or another form of payment which was a lower form of payment, so—let's just be frank—they would have been worse off. There would be another 30 who would miss out on any payment altogether, so they'd be worse off still. The result of this amendment, you're saying, will essentially maintain the payment that 960 people would have received in the form of a bereavement allowance. They might be getting something different now, but the dollars that they get in their pocket will be the same as what they would have received yesterday, the day before—is that correct?

What you're saying is that this amendment only takes people to the lower amount of money that they would be provided with as a result of the legislation that was voted on last night? If that's the case, they are worse off.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:14):  Senator Watt, I've answered this on numerous occasions. The government is simplifying the welfare system. As part of simplifying the welfare system, there will be the cessation of the bereavement allowance. The bill has not yet passed the Senate. In relation to the cessation of the bereavement allowance, as I've stated now several times on the record, from 20 March 2020, up to 960 people annually who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim jobseeker payment or another payment. Approximately 30 new bereaved people per year will not qualify for an income support payment due to their income, assets or other circumstances.


Senator Hanson's amendment in relation to bereaved persons—and I've stated this several times—provides that most bereavement allowance recipients will receive payment for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment, the total amount of jobseeker payment over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, is estimated at around $1,300 less than the amount of bereavement allowance paid for the same period. For youth allowance, the difference is estimated at around $2,200. The effect of what Labor wants to do is to continue with the bereavement allowance and not simplify the system. We are committed to simplifying the system. This is what we have put forward. It is now for the Senate to determine if it agrees.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:16):  I fail to see how this reduces the number of payments. It is in effect a different payment because you have put in a fancy calculation to restore it to the equivalent of the age pension. What happens when the age pension is adjusted, relative to when a jobseeker allowance is adjusted? We've got no guarantee that the value of the jobseeker bereavement period will retain its relativity to the age pension, because you've put in a completely different formula. I fail to see how this simplifies payments or simplifies the system when we're taking a bereavement allowance that is for bereaved people and calling it a jobseeker allowance for people who aren't looking for work because they're bereaved.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:17):  Perhaps I should point out that, with the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment as they do under the current system. Instead, they receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements to support them in their time of bereavement and will seamlessly move into JobSearch or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.

But we still have an opportunity in this place to do exactly what Senator Hanson says and make sure no-one is worse off, and that is by supporting Senator Siewert's amendment to knock out schedule 4. By all means support Senator Hanson's amendment—we'll at least have some baseline guarantee that we won't be stuck with what the government has put forward and what this place voted for last night, including you, Senator Hanson—but the only true way that this place can claim that no-one will be worse off in terms of their bereavement entitlements is to take the opportunity to knock out schedule 4. Schedule 4 will keep the payments as they are, which is all that Senator Hanson's amendment does. In addition, by supporting Senator Siewert's amendment, we will make sure that those 30 people who would lose eligibility under the tightened eligibility criteria would not be worse off. That is the only way that this chamber can make sure that bereaved persons who need the support of the government in their time of need are supported by the government and are no worse off.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (18:24):  I have a number of other questions that I want to put to Senator Hanson, but, before I do so, I might just try to put this debate that we're having at the moment in some context. Let's be honest about what's happening here. What's happening here is that Senator Hanson and her colleagues are now scurrying back into this chamber to try to fix the mess that they created last night. They have been shamed into coming back into this chamber to reverse cuts to pensions and cuts to allowances that they voted for only last night. In Senator Hanson's case, she voted for them twice.


This is just the latest example we are seeing from Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues in their ongoing campaign to sell out the very battlers that they say they are here to represent. This has been happening for so, so long, ever since Senator Hanson and her colleagues came to this chamber after the double dissolution. We've seen it on a range of workplace matters. Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues voted for the government's ABCC legislation. What was buried in there was that Senator Hanson—despite all of her xenophobic remarks criticising foreigners, criticising migrants—in voting, along with her colleagues, for the ABCC legislation made it easier for construction companies to bring in temporary overseas workers to replace local workers. If that's not selling out the battlers that she says that she represents, I don't know what is.


In voting for the ABCC legislation, Senator Hanson and One Nation also voted to cut apprenticeships in the construction industry. They've actually cut the floor out from underneath the young battlers who they say that they are here to represent, by reducing the number of apprenticeships that are available to young people in the construction industry. In voting for that ABCC legislation, Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues also made it a hell of a lot easier for construction companies to bring in labour hire and keep people in insecure work. These are the people that Senator Hanson and her colleagues say that they are here to represent—people in regional Queensland, in particular, and outer suburban areas who are really struggling to make ends meet, who are on labour hire rather than permanent work, who are in casual employment rather than permanent work, who are struggling to get an apprenticeship. Through Senator Hanson's own votes, she is actually making it harder still for these people, by removing what opportunities they do have.


Who can forget that we've seen them do it as well on penalty rates? There have been a number of occasions now when we on the Labor side have given One Nation and Senator Hanson the opportunity to stop cuts to penalty rates from going ahead. But over and over again they vote with the government to let these penalty rate cuts go through, to cut money out of the pockets of the battlers that they say they're here to represent. We've seen them do it on child care, by voting with the Liberals to cut childcare payments to low-income families. We've seen them do it again on labour hire, by refusing to back amendments that Labor moved that would have held host employers liable for underpayments to workers made by labour hire firms.


These people are the biggest bunch of hypocrites this Australian parliament has ever seen. They spend every day out there, particularly in regional Queensland, claiming that they're the friends of battlers, claiming that they are going to come down here to Canberra and sort out the major parties, and, at every single chance they get, they line up and vote with Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberals to cut money out of the pockets of the very people they say that they represent. I'm actually surprised that it's only about 85 per cent of the time that Senator Hanson and One Nation vote with the government. You would think it is 100 per cent. They might as well just go and join the Liberal Party today, which is where Senator Hanson came from in the first place. If you're going to come down here and continue voting with the Liberals to hurt battlers, to allow more 457 visas into construction sites, to cut apprenticeships, to hurt labour hire workers, to cut child care to low-income families and now to cut bereavement allowances, why don't you just go back and join the Liberal Party? You might as well do that since you're voting with them all the time.


Here again, on this very bill, we're seeing yet again Senator Hanson and One Nation sell out the battlers that they say they represent. They might sit there and smirk about it. It is actually not funny. It's not funny that you get out into regional Queensland and tell people that you're going to protect them and you come down here and leave them in the lurch by voting with the Liberal Party over and over again. It's not funny; it's dishonest, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you keep on doing it. These people have a right to be represented in the way that you say that you're going to, not sold out every time you come down here to Canberra.


On this bill, let's just cut through the nonsense that we've been seeing from Senator Hanson and her colleagues all day today and here tonight. They're trying to proclaim this as some massive win that they've been able to engineer for pensioners. What has actually happened here is that they've been caught out yet again selling out the battlers that they say they represent.


Last night we had the farcical situation in this chamber where two of the three One Nation senators weren't here for a vote. The vote, for a Greens amendment, I think, that was backed by Labor to try to protect this bereavement allowance, was put. The Greens voted to protect bereavement allowances. Labor voted to do so. Senator Hinch mentioned that he did. I'm not sure about some of the other crossbenchers. All of us were standing up for the battlers that you say you represent. Senator Hanson came over here, sat with the Liberals and voted to cut the bereavement allowance altogether, and two of her senators couldn't even be bothered showing up. We then had this pathetic situation where those two senators came into the chamber. One said he was detained inadvertently and one said he was in the toilet. Not only did they vote to cut this bereavement allowance once but they demanded that it be put to the vote again so that they could get the numbers up and guarantee this bereavement allowance could be cut once and for all.


Don't pretend that you're in here trying to help battlers or trying to protect the bereavement allowance. What you're actually doing is coming in to fix the mess that you created last night by voting with the Liberals not once but twice. The only reason this has happened is that you have been shamed into it. I and a number of other people were out on social media very loudly last night pointing out what you did. And I notice, Senator Hanson, that you spoke to the minister about this amendment last night. I bet that was after you had been exposed for being a fraud yet again and for selling out the battlers that you say that you represent again. I see you nodding there. Is that correct?



The CHAIR:  Senator Watt, I remind you to direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator WATT:
  I see Senator Hanson nodding there, so I'd be interested to know if it's correct that she only actually bothered to talk to the minister about this after her selling out of battlers yet again had been exposed.


It's bad enough that we get this One Nation crowd coming down to Canberra and repeatedly voting with the Liberals to sell out the battlers that they represent, but then to spend the entire day lying about why they are moving this amendment just makes it even worse. Just be honest. Be honest and admit that you made a mistake, you sold out the battlers that you represent, you got it wrong, you've seen the error of your ways and now you're trying to rectify it. Don't get Malcolm Roberts in his tinfoil hat out there trying to pretend something different; just be honest for once. Admit you got it wrong. Admit that you're actually going to stand up for the battlers that you say you represent and you're going to vote with Labor, just like you should have done in the first instance. And maybe you should make a habit of it and vote with Labor on a whole range of other things to protect the battlers that you say that you care about.


The claim that you are in here today because you care about pensioners and you want to save people is an out-and-out lie. I'm glad that you've been found out for it and I'm glad that you've come in here and moved an amendment. But as we've heard, despite this amendment, there will still be 30 people a year whose partners will die and they will need support. We're not talking about rich people. Thirty low-income Australians a year are going to die and their partners, who would have once qualified for a bereavement allowance to help them pay for a funeral and get back on their feet—they might not even have a job—will be actually worse off still because of the vote that you cast last night. Why aren't you fixing that? Why aren't you making sure that every single person you sold out last night is going to be no worse off? Why are you still leaving 30 people a year in the lurch?


Now that you have seen the error of your ways in relation to the cuts to the bereavement allowance that you voted for last night, what I want to know is: have you got other amendments ready to go now to try to reverse the other cuts that you voted for last night? This was not the only cut to low-income Australians that One Nation voted with the Liberals to get through last night. One Nation last night also voted to cut the wife pension, the widow allowance and the partner allowance and to make people older than 55 now stop volunteering in order to qualify for the dole and make them go out and look for work instead.


There are a whole range of other cuts that One Nation voted with the Liberals last night to put through. There are thousands of low-income Australians, battlers who One Nation say they care about, who are still going to be worse off as a result of all these other cuts that you voted for last night. Are you going to move amendments? Are One Nation going to move amendments to reverse the other cuts that you voted for last night or are you still going to leave out thousands of people who once got a wife pension and won't anymore, who once got a widow allowance and won't anymore and who once got a partner allowance and won't anymore? Are they going to be fixed up or are you going to leave them to be hung out to dry with less money in their pocket facing a much harder existence? 


This is not the only sellout that you committed last night. I really hope that you have other amendments to make up for the sellouts to a range of other people that you committed last night as well. Don't think you get off the hook by fixing one problem when you created many. We are onto you and we are going to keep exposing you for the lies and fraud that you keep on committing every single time you come down here and vote with the Liberals.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:35):  I just want to add to that contribution. Senator Watt, I still have amendments on the grey where One Nation can support them to actually address some of those very issues, so they can knock off schedule 4. They can support our amendments on the wife pension in terms of overseas portability. There are a range of amendments that, if One Nation really cares about the most vulnerable members of our community, they can still support. Then we will see that we don't just pick out one particular group of people—and of course it's those who are bereaved, and we are all deeply concerned about the cuts to those that are bereaved, which is why we sought to knock that particular schedule off. But there is still an opportunity to knock that off. It's 30 a year, don't forget. It is not just 30 people but 30 a year.


The overseas portability of the wife pension is still there. I also asked about the amendments that we sought to move and Labor supported that addressed the issue around that transition rate for the wife pension so that those on the wife pension aren't worse off. So there is a whole range of amendments that are still on the grey that can be supported so that we can make this awful bill just that little bit better.


So, again, I would like to pursue this question of clarification around the claims that some people on the allowance will be better off. Does that refer to the 960? They'll be better off than what the government has on the books, but they won't be better off than they were originally under the allowance. That's correct, isn't it?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:37):  I've got a technical question about the amount of payment. I can see the amendment to the schedule in front of me which substitutes section 567FB and puts in a calculation of a person's youth allowance, for example, times the 14 weeks times the seven days to get it up to our 14 weeks. So I want to ask, technically, how it then gets topped up to the equivalent value of the age pension. I am trying to work out the extent to which it's now a lump sum paid in addition to those regular payments and exactly how that's calculated.

 (Western Australia) (18:41):  I will try to be clear. The intention of this amendment being put by One Nation, as I understand it, is to maintain its relativity with the current rate. Now, that current rate is the rate of the age pension, so you must have done something that helps you arrive at the equivalent of the age pension rate. I can see how you would do that by calculating the amount of the youth allowance or the jobseeker payment, and then adding on the difference over the 14 weeks of what it otherwise would have been under your age pension. Is that how you've calculated it?

 (Western Australia) (18:44):  If the argument is that the multiple of the jobseeker payment rate plus the daily rate over the 14 weeks is the equivalent of the age pension over the same period of time, how are you calculating the multiple of the jobseeker rate to equal the current age pension?

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:45):  But you've calculated it for this point in time for the purposes of Senator Hanson being able to state that people won't receive a cut. You've calculated those payments plus the multiple of the jobseeker rate to somehow equal that gap in the existing point in time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:45):  In the most simplistic of terms—just to take you through how it is all calculated—the bereavement allowance is paid at the pension rate of payment compared to the jobseeker payment, which will be paid at the allowance rate of payment. We've established that. As the bill is currently drafted, a bereaved person claiming jobseeker payment or youth allowance will receive a one-off lump sum payment following the death of their partner, in addition to their ongoing fortnightly payment. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, the amendment that we are currently looking at will change the way the payments are calculated for bereaved persons from 20 March 2020 to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person receives under jobseeker payment or youth allowance compared to what they would have received under the bereavement allowance.


In terms of the amounts, as I've already stated, most bereavement allowance recipients receive payment—as we've gone through in terms of the formula—for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment, the total amount of the jobseeker payment over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, was estimated by the department to be approximately $1,300 less than the amount of the bereavement allowance paid for the same period. In relation to the youth allowance, the difference is estimated at approximately $2,200. They will now receive that additional payment, which takes them back to what they would've received.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:48):  Thank you. I am now some way towards understanding what you're doing here. It goes back to the top-up payment, as it was attached to the daily rate of a person's youth allowance plus the top-up, which is not as much as it would've been over the equivalent time. So you have calculated a top-up that is relative to the age pension as it stands currently, but it will maintain its relativity to the original payment, not to the age pension?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:48):  Over time, we've seen increases to pensions, but we haven't seen increases to youth allowance or to Newstart, which is now the jobseeker allowance. We've seen an increase of just 50 cents announced this week. Will there be no ongoing relativity of the bereavement allowance to the age pension?

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:49):  But we have more chance of predicting what the increase in the pension will be over time than we have with poor students and poor jobseekers who've been dudded in their daily rates over time. So, if you're bereaved—you might have a casual job and be working full time when your spouse dies and you need time off work to organise yourself but you don't have access to any leave and you don't have access to any other kind of payment, because you're a casual—you're essentially now saying that you will be paid as a jobseeker, even though you're not a jobseeker, instead of at the bereavement allowance rate, which was otherwise equivalent to the age pension.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:50):  I think we're now just going round in circles. It's actually quite a simple amendment, and I've already answered this question a number of times. The potential difference between the amount of the jobseeker payment and the amount of the bereavement allowance will be removed. The new system is actually a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved, because those who lose a partner will not now have to go through the process of applying for another payment. They have to do that under the current system. The system that is proposed is streamlined and simplified, and they receive an exemption to support them through their time of bereavement. They then seamlessly move into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:52):  You have said you're simplifying these payments. Now, I understand that you're trying to argue that people don't need to reapply if they're already eligible as jobseekers. But the simple fact is that your schedule, amended or unamended, does away with the whole category of bereavement as a separate category; it rolls it into a jobseeker allowance. It seems reasonable that the expectation there would be that people are actually jobseekers. The simple fact is that this is the social safety net for people who are bereaved. It's not that they're necessarily looking for a job. It is simply that they are without a job at that moment in time precisely because they are bereaved. They don't have access to other employment entitlements that see them through that period of bereavement.

This would amend item 1 of schedule 15 and provides for a review. I'm aware of the government's comments on review in 18 months of the legislation, and I want to come back to that, but this would be a quite detailed process. In relation to the compliance focused amendments of schedule 15, as you can see, there's a detailed outline of an independent review of the participation payment obligations compliance framework. That's one part of the amendment. The second part relates to independent annual reviews of the participation payment obligations compliance framework. Again, it goes into quite a bit of detail about how that independent review would be undertaken. Again, I touched on this last night, and I also talked about it in my second reading contribution in December. We also had a second reading amendment about it.


We're deeply concerned that these changes have been brought in before a full review of the compliance framework was completed. We agree with the government that the compliance process at the moment is outdated. It's also very punitive and it's not producing the results that are effective in terms of helping people to find work. We believe that, in setting up this process and changing the compliance framework—and I think there is pretty universal agreement that we do need to change the compliance framework—we didn't undertake that full independent review. So we thought it was really important, given that that wasn't done. Even though we had a second reading amendment about it being done, that wasn't going to happen before the government brought on their legislation. That's why we feel very strongly that there needs to be an independent review carried out of the operation of the framework, and we also believe it's important that there are more independent annual reviews.


That's the outline of this particular set of amendments on sheet 8260. The government articulated and the minister articulated again yesterday some aspects around the review. I'd like to ask some more detailed questions about the nature of that review and whether the government is prepared to put anything more formal to the committee about how the review is going to be carried out, whether it is going to be independent and on what basis that review will be undertaken.



The CHAIR:  Just before we go on, may I remind the committee that, last year when this bill was under consideration, the committee agreed to incorporate into Hansard the statement of reasons accompanying the requests.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:58):  Thank you, Senator Siewert. Your amendment would require the minister to commission annual independent reviews of the jobseeker compliance framework with the first to be completed within 12 months of the targeted compliance framework commencing. The government will be opposing this amendment. As I have already stated, the government has already committed to a review of the targeted compliance framework 18 months after the commencement. This review would, of course, look at the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects, taking into account the views of relevant experts and stakeholders. There is no need to legislate a review requirement, and legislating the personnel, terms of reference and timing removes flexibility to focus on particular issues, should it be necessary at that particular point in time.


Further, a core role of the Public Service is the continued evaluation of the programs and policies which they are responsible for implementing, as well as staying informed about various stakeholder views. The targeted compliance framework was developed in full awareness of the views of all of those with an interest in this matter, including welfare sector organisations, employment service providers and jobseekers. It was also based on detailed analysis of the administrative data, utilising expertise drawn from three government departments. Going to your question on the review, as I've stated, the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects will take into account the views of relative experts and stakeholder groups. That's the information I'm able to provide.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:01):  In other words, it's not going to be independent. The concern here is the need for independence of the review, particularly given that this is operating 18 months after the process started. We haven't had that initial review process. I heard what the minister said about consultation beforehand. It's a bit of a different story from what I heard during the Senate inquiry into this legislation. There was a lot of criticism and concern from stakeholders around the way this compliance process is going to operate, so I am deeply concerned to ensure that the review is independent of the department.


The other concern there is that the department undertakes a number of reviews and then we don't see them for a long time—or, in fact, we don't see them. If we were to have an independent review process with annual reviews carried out independently, I'm more confident that we would be able to see the reviews, and I think it would give the community a sense of security that the review is independent. They would, quite frankly, have more faith in the review. I'm trying not to malign the department, but they are reviewing the system that they oversee. We need that to be independent. So I express deep concern around the fact that it's not independent and I seek a guarantee from the government around the time frame of the review—that it will be released to the public and that it will be released in a timely manner.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (19:03):  As I've said, the government has already committed to review the targeted compliance framework 18 months from commencement. That commitment has been given. As I've also stated in general terms, the review will look at the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects, taking into account the views of relevant experts and the stakeholders. It is the government's position that it will be the department conducting the review. We have full faith in the department and its ability to do this. At this point in time, I'm unable to provide any further information. That's the current position.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:04):  That is not reassuring at all. Here we have an internal departmental review of the most significant changes that have occurred to the compliance framework and process for a long time. The community is quite concerned about that, and I've expressed concern about that here. The government have not agreed to changes from ourselves and from the Labor Party that I think would have made the system better. The government designed this framework. They're now going to review it internally, and there is no commitment that this will be made public. Will this review be worth the paper it's written on, if we can't see it? Surely the government can commit to making the review public. I find it hard to believe that the government expects the Senate to accept that they're doing an internal review that won't be made public. How is that satisfactory, when people don't have confidence in such major changes to the compliance framework? Surely you can commit to it being made public.



The CHAIR:  The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 8260, as moved by Senator Siewert, be agreed to.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:13):  I would now like to move to the set of amendments on sheet 8254. However, it gets a bit complicated because I have a number of clauses there. Those amendments relate to schedules 1, 2, 5 to 8 and 15. I understand that the ALP want to vote on the item relating to schedule 15 separately. We oppose schedule 15 in the following terms:


   (30) Schedule 15, page 194 (line 1) to page 220 (line 23), to be opposed.


I will come back to the other items, because there's an indication that certainly the ALP want to vote differently on this than on the other items.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:15):  As anticipated. We sought to amend schedule 15 to improve schedule 15. Those amendments have not been supported, hence we don't support schedule 15. As I've articulated on numerous occasions, we are deeply concerned that schedule 15 and the compliance framework as it stands is going to hurt those seeking employment. However, we do agree that there needs to be change; we just can't support the current, unamended schedule 15 as it stands, because it hasn't been amended to deal with some of the more grievous concerns.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:31):  You have some amendments before the Senate that amend the bereavement allowance, schedule 4, which you had your colleagues vote to oppose yesterday. That vote was then reinstated when you said you would support the government. Now you've put forward amendments in this place that completely contradict your support for the government on schedule 4, because they're much closer to changing the payments. What are those payments changed to in your amendment?

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:32):  Thank you very much for your question. We opposed the amendment the Labor Party put up because it wasn't as good as the amendment we have put up. In 567FB the amount of payment is seven times better for the person. Previously it was only the Newstart payment; then there was a one-off payment two weeks later. My proposed amendment is far better for the people. No-one is going to be worse off under this. Some people are going to be better off with it. The government's costing for the bereavement was $1,040,000. It will cost a little bit more to instate this, but it is important that people in bereavement be looked after. That's why we put up this amendment. I understand you are going to support this amendment, and I'm pleased to hear that.

 (Western Australia) (17:34):  Senator Cash, Senator Hanson has asserted that some people will be better off under the Hanson amendment. Can you please explain to us who these people are.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (17:34):  This gives me an opportunity, Chair, to advise the Senate that the government will be supporting the amendments put forward by One Nation. It's an amendment to schedule 4. Schedule 4 of the bill closes bereavement allowance and provides support to bereaved persons through a new jobseeker payment or youth allowance from 20 March 2020. This amendment changes the formula for calculating payments to those who lose a partner, to ensure that no-one will receive less in financial support under the new arrangements than they would receive under the current system. I believe they are the people that Senator Hanson is actually referring to.


The government supports this amendment, which builds upon the government amendments to support bereaved pregnant women. This amendment ensures that no bereaved person will be worse off with the cessation of the bereavement allowance. Bereavement allowance is paid at the pension rate of payment, compared to the jobseeker payment, which will be paid at the allowance rate of payment. As the bill is currently drafted, a bereaved person claiming jobseeker payment or youth allowance will receive a one-off lump sum payment, in addition to their ongoing fortnightly payment, following the death of their partner. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, this amendment will, from 20 March 2020, change the way payments are calculated for bereaved persons to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person will receive under the jobseeker payment or youth allowance and what they would receive under bereavement allowance. Again, they are the people Senator Hanson is referring to.


I need to point out that with the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment as they do under the current system. Instead, they will receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements, to support them in their time of bereavement, and will seamlessly move into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.

I might continue asking questions of the government while Senator Hanson prepares herself. As I understand it, the eligibility for this payment is more stringent, because it's moved from the pensions asset test to the job seeker allowance assets test. Is that correct?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (17:46):  I'm instructed that the figure that relates to your question is that 960 people who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim job seeker payment and be no worse off.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:46):  That is not the question. My question is about the eligibility for the job seeker payment in bereavement circumstances. The assets-and-income test for that used to be the assets-and-income test equivalent to the age pension, but that is now changing to the income-and-assets test for the job seeker allowance. Is that correct?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (17:49):  I understand that most bereavement allowance recipients receive payment for 14 weeks at the high pension rate. Without this amendment, the total amount of jobseeker payments over the 14 weeks, including the lump-sum payment, is estimated at around $1,300 less for bereavement allowance paid for the same period; and, for youth allowance, the difference is estimated at around $2,200. This is now rectified with this amendment put forward by One Nation.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:50):  But the opposition, with the support of the Greens, sought to rectify this yesterday by asking this place to vote against schedule 4. If we had voted against schedule 4 in this place then the existing entitlements, which means bereavement allowance paid at the age pension rate, would have been the status quo. Members of One Nation missed that vote and they came back into this place and asked for that vote to be recommitted because they agreed with the government. Now why are you moving this motion today if you agree with the government? The simple fact is: this is exactly contrary to what the government put forward yesterday and, what's more, it does not restore the entitlements for bereavement allowance to everyone who would have otherwise had it under the existing arrangements in the legislation. You should have stuck with your vote to reject schedule 4 yesterday because, had you voted it down, people would receive exactly the same rate as they do now, which is what you're seeking to do with this amendment. But what's more, your claim that no-one will be worse off is completely false, because those 30 persons a year will no longer be eligible for bereavement allowance.

Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendments (R6) and (R8)



The effect of amendment (R6) is to increase the amount of a one‑off payment to certain recipients of youth allowance under the Social Security Act 1991. It is framed as a request because it will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and so will increase a ""proposed charge or burden on the people"".


The effect of amendment (R8) is to increase the amount of a one‑off payment to certain recipients of jobseeker payment under the Social Security Act 1991. It is framed as a request because it will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and so will increase a ""proposed charge or burden on the people"".


Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendments (R6) and (R8)



These amendments will increase the amount of a one‑off payment to certain recipients of youth allowance and jobseeker payment.


The statement of reasons for moving these amendments as requests advises that they will increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.


The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments that would result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation. If that is the effect of the amendments, then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that they be moved as requests.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:53):  I've got a number of questions, particularly for Senator Hanson, about this amendment. I think it is appropriate to direct them to her given that it is her amendment. I assume that this is something she's worked on very hard. My first question is simply: how is this amendment different to the amendment you voted against last night? If it refreshes your memory, last night, you, on two occasions, voted with the government to remove the bereavement allowance. We had to put the vote again because two of your senators missed the vote so they came back in and voted with the government, with the Liberal Party, to cut this allowance. I'm interested to know how it is that this amendment that you're now putting up, that you claim is about supporting the allowance, differs from the amendment that you personally voted against twice last night.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson, do you need more time?

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-03-20,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:54):  If you look at the government's amendment, at 567FB, you see that the daily rate of a person's youth allowance on the relevant day was times 14, for the 14 weeks, and it was double that amount. Under the amendment that I have put forward, under 567FB, it would be the daily rate of youth allowance on the relevant day times 14, times seven. So the amendment that I am putting up has increased it considerably. The same is relevant to 660LI. It is the daily rate of a person's jobseeker payment on the relevant day, times 14, by two, under the government. Under my amendment, it would be the daily rate of a person's jobseeker payment on the relevant day by 14 by 4½ times. So it is a lot more for the person.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:56):  I spoke to the minister last night. I was assured by the minister that, under this, people would be better off. I don't have the resources of the Labor Party or the government to put an actual figure on the number of people that would be better off. The amendment states that it is better for the people, and I stand by that. It is the Labor Party—and you yourself, Senator Watt—trying to make political points on this, by your comments this morning. It is just the usual you. So, if you are—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Hanson, I would encourage you to speak to the chair.




Senator HANSON:
  All right; to the chair: as I am saying, if the Labor Party and everyone here is in agreement that this bereavement payment should not be gone, for a cost of $1,040,000, I think it's important that we do support this bereavement allowance. Hence, although the One Nation party voted the way that we did last night, on reflection this is why we have put this amendment forward today—because it should be there and we stand by that. I don't want to cause any pain or undue stress on people, especially those going through this time.


As I've said, the amendment ensures that no bereaved person is worse off with the cessation of bereavement allowance. As the bill is currently drafted, from 20 March 2020 a bereaved person claiming youth allowance or jobseeker payment who is not pregnant will receive a one-off higher payment following the death of their partner. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, this amendment will change the way payments are calculated for bereaved persons from 20 March 2020, to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person receives under jobseeker payment or youth allowance compared to what they would've received under a bereavement allowance. With the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment, as they do under the current system. Instead, they receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements to support them in their time of bereavement and they will seamlessly move on into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends. This will make the system simpler and maintain support for those experiencing one of the most difficult moments of crisis. I have moved my requests for amendment. I hope that they get the support of this chamber and that people stop playing party politics.

As I say, Senator Hanson and her colleagues have spent the day claiming to be moving an amendment here which will make many people in Australia better off. I ask you again: how many? Surely, if you were going to make that claim, you would have some idea of how many people are going to be better off. Do you have any idea how many people will be better off as a result of this amendment, given that you've spent the day claiming that people will be?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:00):  I also wish to direct a question to Senator Hanson, and my question is this: you maintain that you want to make bereaved people in this nation better off; is that correct? Senator Hanson, I need to ask you: are you aware that there is still an alternative amendment before this chamber that would allow us to knock out schedule 4? You voted with the government yesterday to reinstate that amendment. However, Senator Siewert still has a motion before this chamber that will knock out the schedule as drafted by the government. It will reinstate the existing eligibility arrangements. That means that those 30 people who would miss out on this bereavement payment would retain eligibility for it.


The simple fact is that the minister has clarified that, rather than your amendment making people better off, that definition of 'better off' is only relative to the regressive steps in this legislation. No-one is actually better off than the status quo with your amendment. If you truly want to make people better off, will you vote for Senator Siewert's amendment to knock out schedule 4?

It is a very difficult time in terms of partners losing their loved one, and for them to lose remuneration or pensions or allowances at that particular time would be very, very distressful. We are trying to play a fair card. We're not playing politics like the Labor Party and the hypocritical senators over there who want to score political points at every opportunity.

There have been claims made that everybody is going to be better off under this schedule. There will be people who will be worse off. That's the point about this whole schedule. That's why we are seeking to disallow the whole schedule, to knock off the whole schedule. It is because people will be—



Senator Burston interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  Don't get ridiculous!



The CHAIR:  I remind senators to speak through the chair.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Sorry. Through you, Chair, I'm saying to Senator Burston: don't be ridiculous! The point is that people will be worse off under this overall schedule.


We've just heard from Senator Hanson and Senator Burston about how people in bereavement are obviously going through a really, really hard time—and they are. That is why we supported the ALP amendment last night to disallow it. At the time I said I had an amendment, too. I will be moving it because the situation with this schedule will be different if this amendment gets up. Senator Burston, you will have the chance to actually make sure nobody will be worse off because we will have the opportunity to vote down that schedule. I'm hoping you will lend support to my amendment that says: 'Let's get rid of this schedule because it is cruel to people who would have been able to access this allowance when they were in fact bereaved. They will now be excluded.' It is a fallacy to say that no-one will be worse off. It's too cute by half to say that when you are supporting a schedule that means that people will no longer be able to access this allowance.


Let's be really clear. If Senator Hanson can't provide the numbers for those who will be better off in terms of getting more money than they would have—that is what I understand Senator Hanson to have said—is the minister or the government, who have indicated support for this amendment, able to tell us how many will be better off or getting more money than they would have both under the original allowance and under the process that was passed previously by the Senate in the amendment? Does that make sense?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:07):  I think I've explained this several times in relation to different questions that have been put. The answer is 960 people annually who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim the jobseeker payment or another payment. As I've also already stated, approximately 30 newly bereaved people per year would not qualify for the income support payment due to their income, assets or other circumstances—for example, their age. In terms of what this amendment does, most bereavement allowance recipients, as I've already stated, receive payment for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment put forward by Senator Hanson, the total amount of jobseeker payments over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, is estimated at approximately $1,300 less than the bereavement allowance paid for the same period. For youth allowance, the difference is estimated at approximately $2,200. So what this amendment will do is ensure that under the legislation that is currently before the Senate—and the government's amendment was passed—no bereaved person is worse off with the cessation of the bereavement allowance.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (18:10):  Just to be really clear, Senator Cash, on these numbers, you're saying that the original proposal that was voted for last night by the government and One Nation would have transferred 960 current recipients of the bereavement allowance to Newstart or another form of payment which was a lower form of payment, so—let's just be frank—they would have been worse off. There would be another 30 who would miss out on any payment altogether, so they'd be worse off still. The result of this amendment, you're saying, will essentially maintain the payment that 960 people would have received in the form of a bereavement allowance. They might be getting something different now, but the dollars that they get in their pocket will be the same as what they would have received yesterday, the day before—is that correct?

 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:14):  Senator Watt, I've answered this on numerous occasions. The government is simplifying the welfare system. As part of simplifying the welfare system, there will be the cessation of the bereavement allowance. The bill has not yet passed the Senate. In relation to the cessation of the bereavement allowance, as I've stated now several times on the record, from 20 March 2020, up to 960 people annually who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim jobseeker payment or another payment. Approximately 30 new bereaved people per year will not qualify for an income support payment due to their income, assets or other circumstances.


Senator Hanson's amendment in relation to bereaved persons—and I've stated this several times—provides that most bereavement allowance recipients will receive payment for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment, the total amount of jobseeker payment over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, is estimated at around $1,300 less than the amount of bereavement allowance paid for the same period. For youth allowance, the difference is estimated at around $2,200. The effect of what Labor wants to do is to continue with the bereavement allowance and not simplify the system. We are committed to simplifying the system. This is what we have put forward. It is now for the Senate to determine if it agrees.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:15):  Minister, how is it simplifying the bereavement allowance if you are recalculating the jobseeker allowance and paying it at a different rate to the jobseeker allowance?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:16):  The McClure review recommended the simplification of the system by reducing the number of payments, which is what we're doing.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:16):  I fail to see how this reduces the number of payments. It is in effect a different payment because you have put in a fancy calculation to restore it to the equivalent of the age pension. What happens when the age pension is adjusted, relative to when a jobseeker allowance is adjusted? We've got no guarantee that the value of the jobseeker bereavement period will retain its relativity to the age pension, because you've put in a completely different formula. I fail to see how this simplifies payments or simplifies the system when we're taking a bereavement allowance that is for bereaved people and calling it a jobseeker allowance for people who aren't looking for work because they're bereaved.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:17):  Perhaps I should point out that, with the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment as they do under the current system. Instead, they receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements to support them in their time of bereavement and will seamlessly move into JobSearch or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.

I'm not sure if we've had an answer yet as to the claim that Senator Hanson and her colleagues have been making today, which is that their amendment will result in people being better off. Is there anyone who, as a result of this amendment, will be better off compared to the status quo?

 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:19):  I think you're verballing what Senator Hanson has said—and you're doing that quite deliberately, which is fine. I took what Senator Hanson said to mean that, under their amendments, there are some people who would have received less than what they are currently receiving and, because of her amendment, no bereaved person is worse off. In other words, according to Senator Hanson—and just the way she described it—there are some people who would be better off under this amendment than if the bill were to pass in its current form. That's all I took Senator Hanson to say.

 (Western Australia) (18:20):  Let's just make it very clear to the chamber: if this chamber wants to make sure no-one is worse off than the status quo, by all means vote for Senator Hanson's amendment, because at least we'll have some guarantee that the situation will be improved. But we still have an opportunity in this place to do exactly what Senator Hanson says and make sure no-one is worse off, and that is by supporting Senator Siewert's amendment to knock out schedule 4. By all means support Senator Hanson's amendment—we'll at least have some baseline guarantee that we won't be stuck with what the government has put forward and what this place voted for last night, including you, Senator Hanson—but the only true way that this place can claim that no-one will be worse off in terms of their bereavement entitlements is to take the opportunity to knock out schedule 4. Schedule 4 will keep the payments as they are, which is all that Senator Hanson's amendment does. In addition, by supporting Senator Siewert's amendment, we will make sure that those 30 people who would lose eligibility under the tightened eligibility criteria would not be worse off. That is the only way that this chamber can make sure that bereaved persons who need the support of the government in their time of need are supported by the government and are no worse off.

 (Queensland) (18:22):  I note that Senator Hanson didn't answer my last question, which was whether she now accepted that no-one in fact will be better off as a result of her amendment. Does she want to have another opportunity to answer that question? She's looking at her papers, so I assume the answer's no. I might just also respond to Senator Cash, who accused me of verballing Senator Hanson when I said that Senator Hanson and her colleagues had spent the day claiming that their amendment was going to increase the bereavement allowance. I have in front of me a tweet from someone who used to haunt this place, Malcolm Roberts. His tweet at 4.39 pm this afternoon shared the amendment that we're currently debating and said, 'This is the amendment that is soon to be voted on in the Senate. It clearly shows an increase'—he put that in big capital letters—'in support of pensioners who are', and I think he meant to say 'who are society's most vulnerable'. Does the minister want to retract her claim that I was verballing Senator Hanson and her colleagues?




Senator Pratt:
  No.




Senator WATT:
  I'm taking that as an acceptance that she was wrong to accuse me of verballing Senator Hanson.

 (Victoria) (18:23):  I just want to support Senator Watt. I read former Senator Roberts's comments today, and, even if I was Joe Blow, I would've read that and thought that this is a wonderful thing that One Nation are doing.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (18:24):  I have a number of other questions that I want to put to Senator Hanson, but, before I do so, I might just try to put this debate that we're having at the moment in some context. Let's be honest about what's happening here. What's happening here is that Senator Hanson and her colleagues are now scurrying back into this chamber to try to fix the mess that they created last night. They have been shamed into coming back into this chamber to reverse cuts to pensions and cuts to allowances that they voted for only last night. In Senator Hanson's case, she voted for them twice.


This is just the latest example we are seeing from Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues in their ongoing campaign to sell out the very battlers that they say they are here to represent. This has been happening for so, so long, ever since Senator Hanson and her colleagues came to this chamber after the double dissolution. We've seen it on a range of workplace matters. Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues voted for the government's ABCC legislation. What was buried in there was that Senator Hanson—despite all of her xenophobic remarks criticising foreigners, criticising migrants—in voting, along with her colleagues, for the ABCC legislation made it easier for construction companies to bring in temporary overseas workers to replace local workers. If that's not selling out the battlers that she says that she represents, I don't know what is.


In voting for the ABCC legislation, Senator Hanson and One Nation also voted to cut apprenticeships in the construction industry. They've actually cut the floor out from underneath the young battlers who they say that they are here to represent, by reducing the number of apprenticeships that are available to young people in the construction industry. In voting for that ABCC legislation, Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues also made it a hell of a lot easier for construction companies to bring in labour hire and keep people in insecure work. These are the people that Senator Hanson and her colleagues say that they are here to represent—people in regional Queensland, in particular, and outer suburban areas who are really struggling to make ends meet, who are on labour hire rather than permanent work, who are in casual employment rather than permanent work, who are struggling to get an apprenticeship. Through Senator Hanson's own votes, she is actually making it harder still for these people, by removing what opportunities they do have.


Who can forget that we've seen them do it as well on penalty rates? There have been a number of occasions now when we on the Labor side have given One Nation and Senator Hanson the opportunity to stop cuts to penalty rates from going ahead. But over and over again they vote with the government to let these penalty rate cuts go through, to cut money out of the pockets of the battlers that they say they're here to represent. We've seen them do it on child care, by voting with the Liberals to cut childcare payments to low-income families. We've seen them do it again on labour hire, by refusing to back amendments that Labor moved that would have held host employers liable for underpayments to workers made by labour hire firms.


These people are the biggest bunch of hypocrites this Australian parliament has ever seen. They spend every day out there, particularly in regional Queensland, claiming that they're the friends of battlers, claiming that they are going to come down here to Canberra and sort out the major parties, and, at every single chance they get, they line up and vote with Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberals to cut money out of the pockets of the very people they say that they represent. I'm actually surprised that it's only about 85 per cent of the time that Senator Hanson and One Nation vote with the government. You would think it is 100 per cent. They might as well just go and join the Liberal Party today, which is where Senator Hanson came from in the first place. If you're going to come down here and continue voting with the Liberals to hurt battlers, to allow more 457 visas into construction sites, to cut apprenticeships, to hurt labour hire workers, to cut child care to low-income families and now to cut bereavement allowances, why don't you just go back and join the Liberal Party? You might as well do that since you're voting with them all the time.


Here again, on this very bill, we're seeing yet again Senator Hanson and One Nation sell out the battlers that they say they represent. They might sit there and smirk about it. It is actually not funny. It's not funny that you get out into regional Queensland and tell people that you're going to protect them and you come down here and leave them in the lurch by voting with the Liberal Party over and over again. It's not funny; it's dishonest, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you keep on doing it. These people have a right to be represented in the way that you say that you're going to, not sold out every time you come down here to Canberra.


On this bill, let's just cut through the nonsense that we've been seeing from Senator Hanson and her colleagues all day today and here tonight. They're trying to proclaim this as some massive win that they've been able to engineer for pensioners. What has actually happened here is that they've been caught out yet again selling out the battlers that they say they represent.


Last night we had the farcical situation in this chamber where two of the three One Nation senators weren't here for a vote. The vote, for a Greens amendment, I think, that was backed by Labor to try to protect this bereavement allowance, was put. The Greens voted to protect bereavement allowances. Labor voted to do so. Senator Hinch mentioned that he did. I'm not sure about some of the other crossbenchers. All of us were standing up for the battlers that you say you represent. Senator Hanson came over here, sat with the Liberals and voted to cut the bereavement allowance altogether, and two of her senators couldn't even be bothered showing up. We then had this pathetic situation where those two senators came into the chamber. One said he was detained inadvertently and one said he was in the toilet. Not only did they vote to cut this bereavement allowance once but they demanded that it be put to the vote again so that they could get the numbers up and guarantee this bereavement allowance could be cut once and for all.


Don't pretend that you're in here trying to help battlers or trying to protect the bereavement allowance. What you're actually doing is coming in to fix the mess that you created last night by voting with the Liberals not once but twice. The only reason this has happened is that you have been shamed into it. I and a number of other people were out on social media very loudly last night pointing out what you did. And I notice, Senator Hanson, that you spoke to the minister about this amendment last night. I bet that was after you had been exposed for being a fraud yet again and for selling out the battlers that you say that you represent again. I see you nodding there. Is that correct?



The CHAIR:  Senator Watt, I remind you to direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator WATT:
  I see Senator Hanson nodding there, so I'd be interested to know if it's correct that she only actually bothered to talk to the minister about this after her selling out of battlers yet again had been exposed.


It's bad enough that we get this One Nation crowd coming down to Canberra and repeatedly voting with the Liberals to sell out the battlers that they represent, but then to spend the entire day lying about why they are moving this amendment just makes it even worse. Just be honest. Be honest and admit that you made a mistake, you sold out the battlers that you represent, you got it wrong, you've seen the error of your ways and now you're trying to rectify it. Don't get Malcolm Roberts in his tinfoil hat out there trying to pretend something different; just be honest for once. Admit you got it wrong. Admit that you're actually going to stand up for the battlers that you say you represent and you're going to vote with Labor, just like you should have done in the first instance. And maybe you should make a habit of it and vote with Labor on a whole range of other things to protect the battlers that you say that you care about.


The claim that you are in here today because you care about pensioners and you want to save people is an out-and-out lie. I'm glad that you've been found out for it and I'm glad that you've come in here and moved an amendment. But as we've heard, despite this amendment, there will still be 30 people a year whose partners will die and they will need support. We're not talking about rich people. Thirty low-income Australians a year are going to die and their partners, who would have once qualified for a bereavement allowance to help them pay for a funeral and get back on their feet—they might not even have a job—will be actually worse off still because of the vote that you cast last night. Why aren't you fixing that? Why aren't you making sure that every single person you sold out last night is going to be no worse off? Why are you still leaving 30 people a year in the lurch?


Now that you have seen the error of your ways in relation to the cuts to the bereavement allowance that you voted for last night, what I want to know is: have you got other amendments ready to go now to try to reverse the other cuts that you voted for last night? This was not the only cut to low-income Australians that One Nation voted with the Liberals to get through last night. One Nation last night also voted to cut the wife pension, the widow allowance and the partner allowance and to make people older than 55 now stop volunteering in order to qualify for the dole and make them go out and look for work instead.


There are a whole range of other cuts that One Nation voted with the Liberals last night to put through. There are thousands of low-income Australians, battlers who One Nation say they care about, who are still going to be worse off as a result of all these other cuts that you voted for last night. Are you going to move amendments? Are One Nation going to move amendments to reverse the other cuts that you voted for last night or are you still going to leave out thousands of people who once got a wife pension and won't anymore, who once got a widow allowance and won't anymore and who once got a partner allowance and won't anymore? Are they going to be fixed up or are you going to leave them to be hung out to dry with less money in their pocket facing a much harder existence? 


This is not the only sellout that you committed last night. I really hope that you have other amendments to make up for the sellouts to a range of other people that you committed last night as well. Don't think you get off the hook by fixing one problem when you created many. We are onto you and we are going to keep exposing you for the lies and fraud that you keep on committing every single time you come down here and vote with the Liberals.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:35):  I just want to add to that contribution. Senator Watt, I still have amendments on the grey where One Nation can support them to actually address some of those very issues, so they can knock off schedule 4. They can support our amendments on the wife pension in terms of overseas portability. There are a range of amendments that, if One Nation really cares about the most vulnerable members of our community, they can still support. Then we will see that we don't just pick out one particular group of people—and of course it's those who are bereaved, and we are all deeply concerned about the cuts to those that are bereaved, which is why we sought to knock that particular schedule off. But there is still an opportunity to knock that off. It's 30 a year, don't forget. It is not just 30 people but 30 a year.


The overseas portability of the wife pension is still there. I also asked about the amendments that we sought to move and Labor supported that addressed the issue around that transition rate for the wife pension so that those on the wife pension aren't worse off. So there is a whole range of amendments that are still on the grey that can be supported so that we can make this awful bill just that little bit better.


So, again, I would like to pursue this question of clarification around the claims that some people on the allowance will be better off. Does that refer to the 960? They'll be better off than what the government has on the books, but they won't be better off than they were originally under the allowance. That's correct, isn't it?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:41):  I will try to be clear. The intention of this amendment being put by One Nation, as I understand it, is to maintain its relativity with the current rate. Now, that current rate is the rate of the age pension, so you must have done something that helps you arrive at the equivalent of the age pension rate. I can see how you would do that by calculating the amount of the youth allowance or the jobseeker payment, and then adding on the difference over the 14 weeks of what it otherwise would have been under your age pension. Is that how you've calculated it?

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:45):  But you've calculated it for this point in time for the purposes of Senator Hanson being able to state that people won't receive a cut. You've calculated those payments plus the multiple of the jobseeker rate to somehow equal that gap in the existing point in time.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:45):  In the most simplistic of terms—just to take you through how it is all calculated—the bereavement allowance is paid at the pension rate of payment compared to the jobseeker payment, which will be paid at the allowance rate of payment. We've established that. As the bill is currently drafted, a bereaved person claiming jobseeker payment or youth allowance will receive a one-off lump sum payment following the death of their partner, in addition to their ongoing fortnightly payment. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, the amendment that we are currently looking at will change the way the payments are calculated for bereaved persons from 20 March 2020 to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person receives under jobseeker payment or youth allowance compared to what they would have received under the bereavement allowance.


In terms of the amounts, as I've already stated, most bereavement allowance recipients receive payment—as we've gone through in terms of the formula—for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment, the total amount of the jobseeker payment over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, was estimated by the department to be approximately $1,300 less than the amount of the bereavement allowance paid for the same period. In relation to the youth allowance, the difference is estimated at approximately $2,200. They will now receive that additional payment, which takes them back to what they would've received.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:48):  Thank you. I am now some way towards understanding what you're doing here. It goes back to the top-up payment, as it was attached to the daily rate of a person's youth allowance plus the top-up, which is not as much as it would've been over the equivalent time. So you have calculated a top-up that is relative to the age pension as it stands currently, but it will maintain its relativity to the original payment, not to the age pension?

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:48):  Over time, we've seen increases to pensions, but we haven't seen increases to youth allowance or to Newstart, which is now the jobseeker allowance. We've seen an increase of just 50 cents announced this week. Will there be no ongoing relativity of the bereavement allowance to the age pension?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:49):  Senator Pratt, as you would be aware, we can't predict what the increase in the pension will be over time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:49):  But we have more chance of predicting what the increase in the pension will be over time than we have with poor students and poor jobseekers who've been dudded in their daily rates over time. So, if you're bereaved—you might have a casual job and be working full time when your spouse dies and you need time off work to organise yourself but you don't have access to any leave and you don't have access to any other kind of payment, because you're a casual—you're essentially now saying that you will be paid as a jobseeker, even though you're not a jobseeker, instead of at the bereavement allowance rate, which was otherwise equivalent to the age pension.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:50):  I think we're now just going round in circles. It's actually quite a simple amendment, and I've already answered this question a number of times. The potential difference between the amount of the jobseeker payment and the amount of the bereavement allowance will be removed. The new system is actually a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved, because those who lose a partner will not now have to go through the process of applying for another payment. They have to do that under the current system. The system that is proposed is streamlined and simplified, and they receive an exemption to support them through their time of bereavement. They then seamlessly move into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:51):  The example I gave was of someone who is unable to work because they are bereaved but who otherwise has a job. It is my understanding that people would currently have eligibility for a bereavement allowance because they can't work because they are bereaved. Is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:52):  That is correct. However, they would still be able to apply for the jobseeker allowance as a bereaved person.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:52):  But is it correct that they may not actually be seeking a job? They may simply be bereaved and unable to work?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:52):  It would ultimately be that, after 14 weeks, they don't have to receive any other payment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,22,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:52):  You have said you're simplifying these payments. Now, I understand that you're trying to argue that people don't need to reapply if they're already eligible as jobseekers. But the simple fact is that your schedule, amended or unamended, does away with the whole category of bereavement as a separate category; it rolls it into a jobseeker allowance. It seems reasonable that the expectation there would be that people are actually jobseekers. The simple fact is that this is the social safety net for people who are bereaved. It's not that they're necessarily looking for a job. It is simply that they are without a job at that moment in time precisely because they are bereaved. They don't have access to other employment entitlements that see them through that period of bereavement.

Division


3AB—Compliance with participation payment obligations: review





42AT


Independent review of the participation payment obligations compliance framework



   (1) No later than 6 months after the commencement of this section, the Minister must cause an independent review to be undertaken by an eminent person with expertise in social services or employments services of the operation of Divisions 3AA and 3A of Part 3 of this Act and instruments made for the purposes of those Divisions.


   (2) The review must:


   (a) assess the effectiveness of those laws in enabling people to undertake activities or take action to gain employment; and

   (c) consider any other matters specified by the Minister.


   (3) Before completing the review, the person undertaking the review must be satisfied that any consultation has been undertaken:


   (a) that is considered by the person to be appropriate; and


   (b) that is reasonably practicable to undertake; and


   (c) that drew on the knowledge of persons having expertise in fields relevant to the operation of the participation payment obligations compliance framework; and


   (d) that ensured that persons affected by the operation of the participation payment obligations compliance framework, and any other interested members of the public, had an adequate opportunity to comment on its operation.


   (4) The review must be completed, and a report of the review must be prepared, before the end of 12 months after the commencement of this section.


   (5) The person undertaking the review must give the report of the review to the Minister.


   (6) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it.




42AU


Independent annual reviews of the participation payment obligations compliance framework



   (1) The Minister must cause annual independent reviews to be undertaken of the operation of Divisions 3AA and 3A of Part 3 of this Act and instruments made for the purposes of those Divisions.


   (2) An annual review must be undertaken by an eminent person with expertise in social services or employment services.


   (3) An annual review must assess the matters mentioned in subsection 42AT(2) and any other matters specified by the Minister.


   (4) A person undertaking an annual review must be satisfied, before completing the review, that consultation of the kind mentioned in subsection 42AT(3) has been undertaken in relation to the review.


   (5) An annual review must be completed, and a report of the review must be prepared, before the end of 24 months after the commencement of this section, and before the end of each subsequent 12 month period.


   (6) A person undertaking an annual review must give a report of the review to the Minister.


   (7) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it.


This would amend item 1 of schedule 15 and provides for a review. I'm aware of the government's comments on review in 18 months of the legislation, and I want to come back to that, but this would be a quite detailed process. In relation to the compliance focused amendments of schedule 15, as you can see, there's a detailed outline of an independent review of the participation payment obligations compliance framework. That's one part of the amendment. The second part relates to independent annual reviews of the participation payment obligations compliance framework. Again, it goes into quite a bit of detail about how that independent review would be undertaken. Again, I touched on this last night, and I also talked about it in my second reading contribution in December. We also had a second reading amendment about it.


We're deeply concerned that these changes have been brought in before a full review of the compliance framework was completed. We agree with the government that the compliance process at the moment is outdated. It's also very punitive and it's not producing the results that are effective in terms of helping people to find work. We believe that, in setting up this process and changing the compliance framework—and I think there is pretty universal agreement that we do need to change the compliance framework—we didn't undertake that full independent review. So we thought it was really important, given that that wasn't done. Even though we had a second reading amendment about it being done, that wasn't going to happen before the government brought on their legislation. That's why we feel very strongly that there needs to be an independent review carried out of the operation of the framework, and we also believe it's important that there are more independent annual reviews.


That's the outline of this particular set of amendments on sheet 8260. The government articulated and the minister articulated again yesterday some aspects around the review. I'd like to ask some more detailed questions about the nature of that review and whether the government is prepared to put anything more formal to the committee about how the review is going to be carried out, whether it is going to be independent and on what basis that review will be undertaken.



The CHAIR:  Just before we go on, may I remind the committee that, last year when this bill was under consideration, the committee agreed to incorporate into Hansard the statement of reasons accompanying the requests.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-20,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (18:58):  Thank you, Senator Siewert. Your amendment would require the minister to commission annual independent reviews of the jobseeker compliance framework with the first to be completed within 12 months of the targeted compliance framework commencing. The government will be opposing this amendment. As I have already stated, the government has already committed to a review of the targeted compliance framework 18 months after the commencement. This review would, of course, look at the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects, taking into account the views of relevant experts and stakeholders. There is no need to legislate a review requirement, and legislating the personnel, terms of reference and timing removes flexibility to focus on particular issues, should it be necessary at that particular point in time.


Further, a core role of the Public Service is the continued evaluation of the programs and policies which they are responsible for implementing, as well as staying informed about various stakeholder views. The targeted compliance framework was developed in full awareness of the views of all of those with an interest in this matter, including welfare sector organisations, employment service providers and jobseekers. It was also based on detailed analysis of the administrative data, utilising expertise drawn from three government departments. Going to your question on the review, as I've stated, the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects will take into account the views of relative experts and stakeholder groups. That's the information I'm able to provide.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:01):  In other words, it's not going to be independent. The concern here is the need for independence of the review, particularly given that this is operating 18 months after the process started. We haven't had that initial review process. I heard what the minister said about consultation beforehand. It's a bit of a different story from what I heard during the Senate inquiry into this legislation. There was a lot of criticism and concern from stakeholders around the way this compliance process is going to operate, so I am deeply concerned to ensure that the review is independent of the department.


The other concern there is that the department undertakes a number of reviews and then we don't see them for a long time—or, in fact, we don't see them. If we were to have an independent review process with annual reviews carried out independently, I'm more confident that we would be able to see the reviews, and I think it would give the community a sense of security that the review is independent. They would, quite frankly, have more faith in the review. I'm trying not to malign the department, but they are reviewing the system that they oversee. We need that to be independent. So I express deep concern around the fact that it's not independent and I seek a guarantee from the government around the time frame of the review—that it will be released to the public and that it will be released in a timely manner.

Here we have an internal departmental review of the most significant changes that have occurred to the compliance framework and process for a long time. The community is quite concerned about that, and I've expressed concern about that here. The government have not agreed to changes from ourselves and from the Labor Party that I think would have made the system better. The government designed this framework. They're now going to review it internally, and there is no commitment that this will be made public. Will this review be worth the paper it's written on, if we can't see it? Surely the government can commit to making the review public. I find it hard to believe that the government expects the Senate to accept that they're doing an internal review that won't be made public. How is that satisfactory, when people don't have confidence in such major changes to the compliance framework? Surely you can commit to it being made public.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:24):  I've often noted during previous contributions in this chamber the importance of our regional industries to the economic strength of our nation. Nowhere is this truer than in my home state of Western Australia. For most people, WA is synonymous, and rightly so, with the resource sector—iron ore, gold, diamonds, oil and natural gas, all major industries which have long contributed to Australia's economic wealth, creating jobs, establishing infrastructure and improving regional communities along the way. However, agriculture has always been, and will always be, an important contributor to the Western Australian economy.


Agriculture is WA's second major export industry, with up to 80 per cent of its agricultural production exported, representing about 10 per cent of the state's economy. According to the latest ABS statistics, WA gross farmgate values have risen from $5.4 billion to $8.16 billion over the past four years, and, due to increasing domestic and international demand and investment, the sector is expected to double its current contribution of $8.6 billion per annum to the state's economy over the next 12 years. Overall, broadacre farm cash income in Western Australia is estimated to have increased from an average of $312,700 per farm in 2015-16 to $340,000 per farm in 2016-17, which is around 90 per cent above the 10-year average for 2015-16. And 2017-18 is now looking even brighter.


After an erratic year of floods and storms and a mid-winter dry spell, Western Australia emerged as an unlikely bright spot in the nation's grain harvest, with an estimated 2017 harvest of between 12.7 million tonnes and 13.2 million tonnes. In stark contrast to the disappointing end to the season in the eastern states, many West Australian farmers can expect to return a profit on what could've been a disastrous year. For many, this profit has been boosted, with the state's largest grain handler, CBH Group, returning its largest ever surplus and biggest ever rebate to growers, following the previous season's record of a 16.6 million tonne harvest. In the 2016-17 year to September 2017, CBH generated a record surplus, before rebates, of $247 million, up 120 per cent on 2015-16. This enabled it to return a total of $156.3 million to growers through enhanced rebate offerings with more flexible options, an increase of 150 per cent on the previous year's rebates.


But it is not just grain that has seen an increase in farmgate values. WA wool auctions roared into 2018 with a year-opening, record-shredding two days of sales, producing the best results for woolgrowers in at least 20 years. Gross turnover at the Western Wool Centre during the opening week was $28,405,043 on 13,287 bales sold, with the average price per bale of wool coming in at $2,137.80. This is the highest Western Wool Centre turnover since June 1997, when the sale of 45,275 bales generated $34.3 million. However, back then, woolgrowers only received an average of $757.72 per bale of wool.


Perhaps this is why the latest Rabobank Rural Confidence Survey of 12,000 farmers across Australia found that West Australian farmers are going against the national trend of declining optimism. According to the report, net confidence for WA farmers' outlook on the performance of the agricultural sector over the next 12 months increased from 11 per cent in the December quarter to 23 per cent in March. This compared to a national net confidence rating of minus two per cent, down from 16 per cent in the December quarter, one of its lowest levels over the last four years. Only six per cent of WA producers held a negative outlook for the coming year, down from 11 per cent previously and compared to 21 per cent nationally. In WA, 61 per cent were anticipating conditions similar to last year, and 29 per cent expected an even better year ahead. As well as feeling more confident about their income outlook this year, WA producers have indicated their highest level of intention to invest in their businesses since early 2008. The year is indeed looking good already.
