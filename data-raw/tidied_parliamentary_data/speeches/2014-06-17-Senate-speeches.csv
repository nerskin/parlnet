Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:37):  As I indicated in my speech on the second reading, I want to make some inquiries of the minister in relation to this legislation. I will not repeat all of the things that I said in my speech, which I thought explained my position reasonably well. I know that the minister was not in the chamber, but I understand that the minister saw parts of my speech on the internal video. Basically—and I want to make this very clear, lest it be misreported—I do not object to the surcharge on the incomes of those earning $180,000 or more; in fact, I support that.


I know, of my own limited thought, that we do have a debt crisis, and I have heard the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister indicate that we have a debt crisis that needs to be addressed. I accept that there is a debt crisis. I can easily see that, when you go within six short years from $60 billion in credit to $560 billion in debt, you have a debt crisis that needs to be addressed. The same thing confronted the Howard government in 1996, but in those days we had some things that could be sold—for example, Telstra. As a result of those sales and judicious management by the Howard government, Labor's 1996 debt of $96 billion was paid off. It will take a lot longer to pay off the Gillard-Rudd government's debt of some $560-odd billion this time round. Desperate measures are needed to address Labor's $667 billion—I think it is—debt. Desperate measures need to be taken.


The government have been creditable in tightening their belts. They have got rid of a lot of Labor's wasteful programs and are trying desperately to bring the budget back to a manageable size, and good luck to them. Congratulations to the Treasurer, the finance minister and indeed the government as a whole on the work they have started in this budget. There is a long way to go.


One of those drastic measures that need to be taken is this surcharge of two per cent, I think it is, on incomes above $180,000. I repeat: I support that. But, as I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, I cannot understand, in spite of many inquiries in the appropriate circumstances, why individuals are being requested to make the contribution, but companies which are profitable are not. I well recall both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying, 'This is a matter for all of us,' and it is indeed a matter that all Australians should be contributing to. Certainly those who are on substantial incomes have an obligation to contribute, and I support that. But I simply cannot understand, and no-one can explain to me, why it is that companies which earn more than $180,000 per year in profits are not being asked to share the burden.


Some would say, 'We don't want to attack small business,' but there would not be many small-business companies earning more than $180,000, I regret to say, after six years of Labor, and many that have a corporate veil are really a trustee for certain family trusts, so they are really not in the equation. I am talking about companies that I have mentioned by name. I bear none of these companies any ill will, but just think of the biggest companies in Australia. There is a list of 3,000 of them, I think—companies in Australia that are very profitable. Why are they not being requested to make a contribution to a crisis that 'all of us' have to contribute to?


I will not name the names, although people who know what I am talking about will know the company involved. I bear no ill will towards this particular company. A lot of cane farmers up my way do bear ill will towards this company. It is the company that owns the four mills in the locality in which I live. It is doing things with the sale of sugar that a lot of the cane farmers do not like, but I am confident that in the fullness of time there will be some accommodation reached between the mill owners and the cane farmers—but that is an issue for another time. That particular company has no Australian shareholders. I do not know what profits that company makes, but I hope they are substantial, because it paid a lot of money for those four and other mills in the North Queensland area. It is a Singapore based company, and any profits by way of dividend after payment of Australian company tax go to Singapore.


I ask why those shareholders are not being asked to contribute to a debt crisis that I am pretty sure that company would have made something of in the days of the Rudd-Gillard dysfunctional government. Can someone please tell me—and this is my question to the minister—why is it that individuals have to pay the surcharge but not companies that earn their living, earn their income, from Australia?


It just does not make sense to me. And, as I say, in spite of asking all the cleverest people why this was so, I have not yet been able to get a substantial answer. The minister is aware of the issues that I am going to raise. I mentioned it in my speech on the second reading and I have mentioned it privately to the minister. I am hoping that he will be able to make me understand why this is so. 


This is not, as the minister generously acknowledged yesterday in his summing-up speech, a new-found passion of mine. It was an issue I raised at the time when the Labor government introduced a debt levy—again, a levy on individuals but not on companies. I raised the point at that time with the Labor government: 'Why is it that you are asking the butcher and the baker to contribute to the flood levy and not Coles and Woolworths, which are the principal competitors of the butcher and baker?' It just did not make sense to me then and it does not make sense to me now. I will listen intently in anticipation of the minister's explanation as to why this is so.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:46):  I thank my good friend and valued colleague Senator Macdonald, representing the great state of Queensland, for the questions and comments that he has put on the record. I indeed acknowledge, again, that I am very well aware that his is a longstanding interest in an issue that he has pursued for some time, including when the previous government decided, for whatever reason, to implement a flood levy in the context of events in Queensland a number of years ago.


Let me answer the question that Senator Macdonald has asked this way. When we came into government in September we inherited an economy growing below trend; rising unemployment; consumer confidence which was too low; business investment which had plateaued; and a budget in very bad shape, with a spending growth trajectory which was unsustainable and unaffordable. What we have sought to do since coming into government, and in implementing the commitments that we took to the last election, is build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, while also focusing on the important task of repairing the budget and putting us onto a believable path back to surplus. 


In the budget we are doing a range of things. We are pursuing a series of structural savings and structural reforms in order to build a stronger economy and also ensuring that our spending growth trajectory is more sustainable into the future. The virtue and the challenge with structural reforms and structural savings is that they start low and slow and build over time, which is why in this budget we have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for all Australians to be asked to contribute, to make a special and immediate contribution, and a special and immediate effort to help put the federal budget in a stronger starting position to start repairing the budget mess that we have inherited from Labor.


Obviously and necessarily reducing government payments, reducing the spending growth trajectory, will impact on individuals, families, pensioners, organisations, states and territories that receive payments from the federal government. The judgement that we have made is that, in order to spread the budget repair effort as fairly and as equitably as possible, the only way to ensure that higher income earners who do not receive payments from government make their fair, additional contribution to the budget repair effort over the forward estimates is by making a change to the top marginal tax rate, effectively, the two per cent increase, for a period that is the subject of the bills that we are currently debating.


When it comes to company tax, as part of our plan to build a stronger, more prosperous economy we took a couple of policies to the last election. One was to reduce the company tax rate by 1.5 per cent, from 1 July 2015. Another was to impose a 1.5 per cent paid parental leave levy as part of the introduction of a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme in relation to Australia's biggest and most profitable companies. That is also part of our plan to build a stronger, more prosperous economy and create more jobs. One of the structural challenges that we as an economy are facing is falling rates of workforce participation in the context of an ageing population. One thing we need to do is to lift workforce participation, in particular by women, and to lift productivity. The judgement that we have made is that in relation to the 3,000-odd companies, with a taxable income above $5 million a year, the workforce participation benefits, the economic benefits overall, including the workforce participation benefits and the productivity benefits, outweigh the cost of, effectively, keeping the company tax rate at 30 per cent for those companies. So all companies not subject to the paid parental leave levy will see their company tax reduced to 28.5 per cent. All companies subject to the paid parental levy will effectively continue to pay the same company tax rate. Increasing the company tax rate beyond the 30 per cent that is currently in place would hinder our efforts to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead. It would hinder our efforts to create more opportunities for business and individuals to be successful across Australia.


Finally, at the end of the day, businesses and companies are made up of individuals. What we are asking all individual Australians to do, whether they are receiving payments from government or whether they are taxpayers not receiving payments from government, is to contribute to the immediate effort to put Australia back onto a more sustainable footing.


I note in this context that, when we first flagged the proposition that there should be a temporary budget repair levy, a temporary Labor deficit levy—name it what you will—Mr Shorten's initial response was that it should be opposed: 'Oh, no, we're not going to be part of that. Labor will never be part of that. We are not going to support any increase in personal income tax under any circumstances.' Fast forward, a couple of weeks later, and of course, very quietly, Mr Shorten said, 'Yes, we're not going to oppose that.'


In this chamber we have had all sorts of people from the Labor side jumping up and down and making political assertions. I see Senator Dastyari is readying himself to jump up and get into fray and make a few comments. No doubt he will make an eloquent political speech about why everything this government is doing is bad and everything the previous government did was good, even though the previous government that he was a part of left Australia with $191 billion of accumulated deficits in their first five budgets, $123 billion in projected deficits in their last budget, and government debt heading for an unsustainable $667 billion within a decade and growing beyond that—based on an assumption that there was not going to be any adjustment or correction for bracket creep.


Senator Macdonald, I appreciate the points that you raise. I also appreciate the consistency with which you have raised these arguments in the period of the previous government, as you are now in the period of this government. Essentially, we have had to make a whole range of judgements which seek to finely balance our aspiration and our objective to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone can get ahead, while also seeking to repair the budget mess that we have inherited from our predecessors. It is in that context that we have obviously had to make some difficult decisions in order to reduce the spending growth trajectory that we have inherited. We are very mindful of the fact that these sorts of decisions necessarily impact only on those who receive payments from government, which is why we have sought to spread the effort over the forward estimates by also making the particular provision that is the subject of this bill.


The only alternative to doing what we are proposing—which obviously must have dawned on Mr Shorten eventually as well—would be to ask those who receive payments from government to carry 100 per cent of the burden. But, from our point of view, in the context of the judgements that the government have made, we do not think that it would help us in either building a stronger economic or repairing the budget if we increased company taxation in the way that Senator Macdonald has suggested.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:54):  I thank the minister for his courteous response. I have to say that there is not a lot of what he said that I do not strongly agree with, but he still did not answer the question. He did raise the issue of the paid parental scheme—which I had not raised today. But, Minister, you cannot have it both ways. If there is, and I accept there is a debt crisis that requires people to contribute, whether it is the reduction of government assistance or additional tax for high-income earners, why is it that companies—and you have told me that there are 3,000 of them earning more than $5 million a year, which is a bit of an advance on $180,000, I might say—are not being asked to contribute to the accepted and acknowledged debt crisis Australia faces?


I could say to you, Minister, in purely crass political terms, that every dollar that could be raised from companies would be a dollar less that individual taxpayers—that is, voters—would have to pay. So it is a no-brainer to me, from a purely crass political perspective, but that is not why I am arguing the point. I am not suggesting that we should increase company beyond 30 per cent, and I accept, Minister, you comments about Australia wanting to welcome investment into Australian companies. I accept all that but, if we are doing that, why then are we introducing what many have said is a very generous paid parental scheme at a time when we have a debt crisis?


You could easily divert the $5 billion that will be raised from the top 3,000 companies to pay off Labor's debt. That way, we perhaps may not need a three-year temporary levy on other Australians. We may not need to curtail other assistance that has had to be curtailed to pay off Labor's mismanagement and huge debt. If we could get more people contributing to the repair effort—which I accept is needed and which you have rightly explained, Minister—isn't that a good thing?


We clearly have this debt crisis. Labor, we know, were just appalling in the way they managed the country's finances. We are always left with the job of fixing that. As I say, I congratulate the government on the steps it has taken, but I do not think they go far enough. I was pleased to hear Mr Hockey say, 'The age of entitlement is finished.' So wouldn't this be an appropriate time—with the support of the Commission of Audit—to say, 'The paid parental scheme is a good goal to head towards. It is something that a wealthy, prosperous Australia could and should enter into, but perhaps now is not the right time because now, at this stage in our game, we are trying desperately to pay off Labor's debt'?


I repeat: we are doing that by getting additional tax from high-income earners and we are having to make very modest and moderate savings in other assistance measures because the age of entitlement is finished. Yet many have said to me that, with the paid parental scheme, the age of entitlement is finished. I will not enter into that. That is a debate for another place and another time. It is a debate, as I understand, yet to be held. I read in the paper that there are—quoting the Deputy Prime Minister—'different issues' being looked at by the government in relation to the paid parental scheme. I look forward at some time to being taken into confidence by the government on just what is going to happen with it. But, as I say, that is another debate for another time.


My concern at the moment is that we have this debt crisis—and those are Mr Hockey and the Prime Minister's words. I accept them. You do not need to accept their words to know that, after six years of Labor—as after the Hawke-Keating years, 13 years of Labor—there will be a financial crisis. It has to be addressed. I agree with that. I have no issue at all with my government on that, but what I simply cannot understand—and, with respect, Minister, I know it is not totally your responsibility but you have not answered the question—is why companies do not pay this.


Let me ignore this current levy and go back to Labor's flood levy. You might find this easier to answer, Minister. The Labor Party introduced that levy to help Queensland recover from floods. Why was it that individuals had to pay but companies—like the company I have talked about but not named, which makes a profit out of sugar cane grown in Australia and, quite rightly, sends its profits in dividends to Singapore—were not asked to contribute to the flood levy? I know for a fact that its mill operations actually received some benefit from the flood levy that individual Australians were asked to pay. Why wasn't that company asked to pay? It cannot be because the dividends were going to Australian shareholders who had already paid, because they all go elsewhere. I just use that company as an example because it is an immediate one for me, easy for me to relate, but with BHP, Rio and Wesfarmers—you name it—I am sure a lot of their shareholders are overseas. Why aren't they being asked to contribute to paying off Labor's debt as every other Australian is being asked to? It just does not make sense to me.


I note that the Labor Party and, I think, the Greens are supporting this flawed, in my view, method of raising additional funds that are needed. Labor, of course, would support it, because they did this with the flood levy. I indicate that I am opposed to the bill, because, with respect, Minister, neither you nor the Treasurer nor anyone has explained to me why it is that these 3,000 profitable companies earning $5 million or more are not contributing to solving Labor's debt crisis. Perhaps you could do that, Minister, not that it matters—as I say, with Labor and, I think, the Greens supporting the government, this is going to go through regardless of how I vote. But I do want to make the point as strongly as I can so that, if we in the future need to raise money for particular issues, we do it in an honest way by increasing the general rate of taxation on the progressive scales we have in Australia, so that we can deal with these things that come up. And floods come up—I accept that. Debt crises come up—I accept that. After Labor rule, it is a given—you know there is going to be a crisis. But everyone should be contributing, and that includes companies, many of which are foreign owned and controlled and with foreign shareholders. Why shouldn't they contribute as well?


Minister, I hope you can find something new that would convince me I should support this bill. So far, I regret to say, you have not, and you are not alone in that. We have a $5 billion bucket there that could be used to pay off Labor's debt, and we are apparently not using that. We are engaging in what some—not necessarily me—call an age-of-entitlement allowance to certain individual Australians. I hope, Minister, you will be able to persuade me. If not, I hope that, in the future, governments, be they of this persuasion or that persuasion, will have an honest tax system where additional money is raised and not this dodgy arrangement where we have a levy, not a tax, that is imposed on only a certain number of Australians and not on Australia's wealthiest companies.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:05):  I thank Senator Macdonald for his further remarks. I did do my absolute best to answer his previous questions as directly and relevantly as possible, but I will have another go. Senator Macdonald talks about the debt crisis that we inherited, and indeed Labor did leave behind a debt and deficit disaster, but, as I tried to point out in my earlier remarks, the debt and deficit disaster that Labor left behind was not the only challenge we inherited from the previous government. We also inherited some significant economic challenges. We inherited an economy growing below trend. We inherited an economy with rising unemployment. We inherited an economy with low consumer confidence. We inherited an economy where business investment had plateaued. The very direct answer to Senator Macdonald's question is, yes, we also inherited a budget in very bad shape and an unsustainable spending growth trajectory which needs fixing, but the way we fix the budget mess left behind by Labor cannot detract from our efforts to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where we can create more jobs, where we can attract more investment and where we can lift consumer confidence into the future.


In our judgement, to do what Senator Macdonald is suggesting would hamper our capacity to build a stronger, more prosperous economy and create more jobs and increase business investment. All these policies to build a stronger economy, create more jobs and create opportunity for everyone to get ahead, when properly implemented, will ultimately also lead to increased revenue for government, without the need to increase or implement new taxes.


So we are doing two things at the same time. We are working to put government expenditure on a more sustainable footing by reducing the spending growth trajectory we inherited from Labor, which was going to take us to 26.5 per cent of government spending as a share of GDP by 2023-24 or from $409 billion this financial year to $690 billion by 2023-24. We are significantly working to reduce that spending growth trajectory.


In order to spread the effort fairly and equitably, in the immediate effort required over the forward estimates beyond just those who receive payments from government we are also pursuing this budget repair levy, which effectively is an increase in tax of two per cent for individual Australians who earn more than $180,000 a year. If we were to increase company tax, it would make it harder for us to grow, to get out of the situation we have inherited where the economy is growing below trend. It would make it harder for us to reverse the rising unemployment trend we inherited from our predecessors and it would make it harder for us to attract business investment.


In his further remarks, Senator Macdonald raised with me, as he did privately on various occasions, the Paid Parental Leave Scheme. The Paid Parental Leave Scheme is an integral part of our economic strategy to build a stronger, more prosperous economy. If you look at the two economic challenges we are facing as a nation, one relates to the falling terms of trade and the other relates to the implications which come with the ageing of the population. The ageing of the population, among other things, has led to falls in workforce participation, which is why in the budget we are pursuing initiatives to encourage older Australians to work longer. Also we need to pursue initiatives to lift workforce participation by women in order to help us build a stronger, more prosperous, more resilient economy. The two areas of policy which we need to get right in order to lift workforce participation by women are paid parental leave arrangements and childcare arrangements. 


In relation to childcare arrangements, a Productivity Commission review, which is underway, will guide some of the government's thinking on the best way forward. But when it comes to paid parental leave, I know that it is easy to look at paid parental leave as though it is just another welfare entitlement. In our view it is not that. To ensure that, up to an appropriate level, women are able to draw a replacement wage for a certain period while they are having a baby is essentially the same as somebody who goes on annual leave, on long service leave or on sick leave, while also being paid a replacement wage. Nobody would suggest that somebody who takes three months long service leave should somehow receive a welfare payment. Nobody would suggest that and neither they should. Nobody would suggest that somebody who goes on sick leave should be moved onto a welfare payment. Everybody would accept and acknowledge that it is quite appropriate, while on sick leave, that you should continue to be paid at your wage. Public servants right now here in Canberra are able to access their replacement wage when they have a baby. Indeed, many big businesses are providing paid parental leave benefits now. The problem is that small businesses, as they compete for a workforce, find it difficult to compete with Public Service or big business employers because they cannot afford to pay for that sort of workplace entitlement. That is why the scheme we are putting forward as part of our broader strategy to build a stronger, more prosperous economy provides a fairer deal for small business and helps them to recruit and retain high-quality female workers.


We were very transparent in the lead-up to the last election on what we think needs to be done in order to build a stronger, more prosperous economy. Part of that strategy, of course, is scrapping all the bad Labor taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax. Part of it is to implement a 1.5 per cent company tax cut and part of it is to implement this fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave Scheme, which will be funded significantly with a 1.5 per cent levy.


If we were to do what was suggested by Senator Macdonald—that is, effectively to increase company tax by two per cent in the same way as we are proposing through this bill to increase the top marginal tax rate for Australians earning more than $180,000—we believe, based on all the information we have been able to review, that that would detract from growth and would make it harder for us to reverse the rising unemployment trend we have inherited. Ultimately, it would make it harder for us to repair the budget because rising unemployment means increased costs and less revenue than otherwise would be the case. So in all of the circumstances, we have not taken any of this lightly. We have made a series of very considered, deliberate decisions on how best and how most sensibly to reduce the spending growth trajectory we inherited. And that is never easy. 


If somebody believes they are going to get a particular increase in their payment from government, nobody is going to like to hear the government say, 'We can't afford that. The previous government might have made these promises but we actually cannot afford to give you them because we are going to have to continue to borrow from our children and grandchildren in order to fund these benefits and your current lifestyle. Our children and grandchildren would have to pay back those costs, with interest.' So we have said we cannot do that and we have reduced the spending growth trajectory. 


We have sought to spread the effort fairly and equitably by putting forward this temporary budget repair levy. But to pursue the change to company tax arrangements that Senator Macdonald is suggesting, for all the reasons which I have done my best to outline as clearly and as explicitly as possible, we do not think would be in Australia's national interests or in the interests of growing a stronger, more prosperous economy, of creating more jobs, when we have inherited an economy growing below trend and rising unemployment. We would humbly put to the chamber that the budget that we have put forward, including this measure, is part of a package of initiatives that seeks to protect our living standards, build opportunity and prosperity in the future and finely balance the whole range of competing issues that we have to deal with.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:14):  I will not continue on with this past this question. I acknowledge that Senator Dastyari has allowed me to finish my line of questioning, which I appreciate. Minister, thank you for that, but, with the very greatest of respect, can I just say that the arguments you raise really do not make sense. You said, 'If we were to increase company tax it would impact on our desire to build a stronger economy through additional investment.' Well, sorry, Minister—you are increasing the income tax on companies; you are increasing the company tax. As the coalition promised before the election, we were reducing company tax by 1½ per cent—a great initiative, to do everything you said, Minister. That is, we are going to build a stronger economy by encouraging investment. Yes, the 1½ per cent reduction was great for that. I supported that. So everyone gets a 1½ per cent reduction. But, hang on—for the top 3,000 companies the tax goes back. If it applies on one side it must apply on the other. So, by increasing the tax on those top 3,000 companies, you must be impacting on your desire to build a stronger economy through encouraging investment.


You also talked about falling terms of trade and ageing of populations. I am not quite sure what that has to do with the matter I am discussing. And, whilst I accept that women in the workforce do need encouragement to have their children and go back to work, there is already a scheme in place. It is a Labor scheme, so it cannot be particularly good, but it is there; it is in place.




Senator McKenzie:
  Public servants can double dip.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And public servants can double dip. But, Minister—and this is where the logic fails in the argument that you put to me—you say that big business already has a very generous paid parental leave scheme. Maybe big business should have a look at their schemes. And why isn't the Public Service having the same sort of Paid Parental Leave Scheme as every small business and every other Australian has? It is not brilliant, but it is a start.


We will get the economy back into the black. We will get it powering ahead. I know our government will do that, because we have the right policies and the right philosophy to do that. And we have done it before. It is a continuous cycle, be it at state or federal level: Labor gets in and smashes the economy; Liberals come back and improve the economy. We know that that is going to happen. And, when we have done that, then—perhaps instead of giving tax deductions—we can look at a properly funded, very good Paid Parental Leave Scheme. And I would be the first to support it.


But arguing that big business are already doing that, and then giving them a cut in their income tax so that they do not then have to use their own funds to do their own Paid Parental Leave Scheme, and then putting the 1½ per cent back so that we have this universal Paid Parental Leave Scheme—don't you see that it just doesn't make sense? I have tried. But, with Labor supporting your proposals and, I think, the Greens, too—I cannot take this anymore. I do thank you, Minister—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Keep going—we're thoroughly enjoying it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, I hope you might not just enjoy it but think about it in the future, so that the next time your mates in the Labor Party want to introduce a flood levy on individuals and not on these big 3,000 companies, you might encourage your mates in the Labor Party not to do that. That is presupposing they ever get back into government, and that is a big presupposition.


But I just hope that people do learn something from this. To me, there is no valid argument why the top companies, with profits of more than $5 million, are not contributing to the debt that Labor created—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Hear, hear!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  with the help of the Greens. There is that debt crisis there. We have to pay that debt back. Here is a way we could get the top 3,000 companies to do it. We are not doing it. I think it is a missed opportunity. But I cannot take it anymore. Minister, I thank you for your answers, although they have not convinced me.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Nonanswers.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, no. I do appreciate, Minister, the answers you have given. They have not convinced me. But I really cannot take it much further.

What you have here is a very senior coalition senator—somebody who has actually been in this chamber longer than you and I, Minister, have been in the country—coming in here and saying that the arguments that are being made by his own government do not make sense, and disputing the entire claim about increasing income tax on companies. Frankly, Minister, you, with your arguments, are unable to convince your own government backbench, seven or eight months into government. They are coming in here and pleading with you, saying: 'Please, Minister, please—give us a reason to support you. We want to vote for you but you're making it so hard for us.' So my first question is this: Minister, if you cannot even convince your own backbench, your own MPs, to support your budget measures, why on earth should the rest of us support them?

The fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme is a very important, indeed central, part of our economic action strategy to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone can get ahead. The measures in these bills here before us are designed to help us spread the effort to repair the budget mess that Labor left behind fairly and equitably. The only alternative to the measures in this bill, which ultimately and eventually must have dawned on Mr Shorten, would be to impose that burden of fixing up Labor's mess only on those who receive payments from government.

Let us be clear about how these things normally happen.

 (New South Wales) (13:25):  I am amazed. I think the silence from the minister is deafening. The minister is in such an extraordinary situation now that he cannot even get up anymore and defend the stability of his own government. You cannot get up anymore and say, 'This is a government that has unity, this is a government that has purpose, this is a government that has direction,' because there is so much disagreement, there is so much division, there is so much of a split within your own party. Let us be clear: you have already had one member—a senior member by your own words, not mine, although I accept he is senior—get up and say that he does not believe you, that you have not convinced him, that he feels that this is not a fair measure. This goes back to the heart of the problem with this budget, which is lack of fairness. I believe that if you wanted to tackle what you deem is some kind of a crisis, which has been manufactured, there were many better ways to do it. Do I think this is good legislation? No. Do I think it is perfect? No. I think it is nothing more than a fig leaf to cover the fact that this is a budget that you have designed that will hurt families, that will hurt lower-income earners, that will attack health care, that will attack education, that will attack the social fabric that holds this society together. And yes, as part of a fig leaf you put in one measure aimed towards higher income earners—




Senator Cormann:
  Which you will vote for.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Which I will support because I think it is better than a lot of the other measures. But if we were designing it we would have designed it a lot better than this. We would not have had a loophole so that what is a three-year measure will really only be paid for one actual year. We would have fixed up the fringe benefits tax. We would have looked at a proper program as part of a broader taxation review, not a fig leaf when we got to the end of a budget process and realised that, 'Oh, we are only attacking middle income earners, we are only attacking the young, we are only attacking the disabled, we are only attacking those who are in the bottom quartile of this society. We had better create something big and something exciting for the higher income earners so that we can say we are sharing the pain.' Well, Minister, the pain is not being shared. The pain is not being shared in this budget. It is an unfair budget, it is an unequal budget. That is why people are up in arms. That is why people out there in Australian society—you have seen the polling, you have seen the numbers—are outraged, because there is no fairness. You are now in a situation where even your own MPs, even your own backbench, are getting up and using this chamber to say, 'We are unhappy with this direction. We are unhappy with this budget. We are unhappy with these measures.' Minister, how can you deliver a budget when not even your own MPs support you?

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:37):  As I indicated in my speech on the second reading, I want to make some inquiries of the minister in relation to this legislation. I will not repeat all of the things that I said in my speech, which I thought explained my position reasonably well. I know that the minister was not in the chamber, but I understand that the minister saw parts of my speech on the internal video. Basically—and I want to make this very clear, lest it be misreported—I do not object to the surcharge on the incomes of those earning $180,000 or more; in fact, I support that.


I know, of my own limited thought, that we do have a debt crisis, and I have heard the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister indicate that we have a debt crisis that needs to be addressed. I accept that there is a debt crisis. I can easily see that, when you go within six short years from $60 billion in credit to $560 billion in debt, you have a debt crisis that needs to be addressed. The same thing confronted the Howard government in 1996, but in those days we had some things that could be sold—for example, Telstra. As a result of those sales and judicious management by the Howard government, Labor's 1996 debt of $96 billion was paid off. It will take a lot longer to pay off the Gillard-Rudd government's debt of some $560-odd billion this time round. Desperate measures are needed to address Labor's $667 billion—I think it is—debt. Desperate measures need to be taken.


The government have been creditable in tightening their belts. They have got rid of a lot of Labor's wasteful programs and are trying desperately to bring the budget back to a manageable size, and good luck to them. Congratulations to the Treasurer, the finance minister and indeed the government as a whole on the work they have started in this budget. There is a long way to go.


One of those drastic measures that need to be taken is this surcharge of two per cent, I think it is, on incomes above $180,000. I repeat: I support that. But, as I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, I cannot understand, in spite of many inquiries in the appropriate circumstances, why individuals are being requested to make the contribution, but companies which are profitable are not. I well recall both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying, 'This is a matter for all of us,' and it is indeed a matter that all Australians should be contributing to. Certainly those who are on substantial incomes have an obligation to contribute, and I support that. But I simply cannot understand, and no-one can explain to me, why it is that companies which earn more than $180,000 per year in profits are not being asked to share the burden.


Some would say, 'We don't want to attack small business,' but there would not be many small-business companies earning more than $180,000, I regret to say, after six years of Labor, and many that have a corporate veil are really a trustee for certain family trusts, so they are really not in the equation. I am talking about companies that I have mentioned by name. I bear none of these companies any ill will, but just think of the biggest companies in Australia. There is a list of 3,000 of them, I think—companies in Australia that are very profitable. Why are they not being requested to make a contribution to a crisis that 'all of us' have to contribute to?


I will not name the names, although people who know what I am talking about will know the company involved. I bear no ill will towards this particular company. A lot of cane farmers up my way do bear ill will towards this company. It is the company that owns the four mills in the locality in which I live. It is doing things with the sale of sugar that a lot of the cane farmers do not like, but I am confident that in the fullness of time there will be some accommodation reached between the mill owners and the cane farmers—but that is an issue for another time. That particular company has no Australian shareholders. I do not know what profits that company makes, but I hope they are substantial, because it paid a lot of money for those four and other mills in the North Queensland area. It is a Singapore based company, and any profits by way of dividend after payment of Australian company tax go to Singapore.


I ask why those shareholders are not being asked to contribute to a debt crisis that I am pretty sure that company would have made something of in the days of the Rudd-Gillard dysfunctional government. Can someone please tell me—and this is my question to the minister—why is it that individuals have to pay the surcharge but not companies that earn their living, earn their income, from Australia?


It just does not make sense to me. And, as I say, in spite of asking all the cleverest people why this was so, I have not yet been able to get a substantial answer. The minister is aware of the issues that I am going to raise. I mentioned it in my speech on the second reading and I have mentioned it privately to the minister. I am hoping that he will be able to make me understand why this is so. 


This is not, as the minister generously acknowledged yesterday in his summing-up speech, a new-found passion of mine. It was an issue I raised at the time when the Labor government introduced a debt levy—again, a levy on individuals but not on companies. I raised the point at that time with the Labor government: 'Why is it that you are asking the butcher and the baker to contribute to the flood levy and not Coles and Woolworths, which are the principal competitors of the butcher and baker?' It just did not make sense to me then and it does not make sense to me now. I will listen intently in anticipation of the minister's explanation as to why this is so.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:46):  I thank my good friend and valued colleague Senator Macdonald, representing the great state of Queensland, for the questions and comments that he has put on the record. I indeed acknowledge, again, that I am very well aware that his is a longstanding interest in an issue that he has pursued for some time, including when the previous government decided, for whatever reason, to implement a flood levy in the context of events in Queensland a number of years ago.


Let me answer the question that Senator Macdonald has asked this way. When we came into government in September we inherited an economy growing below trend; rising unemployment; consumer confidence which was too low; business investment which had plateaued; and a budget in very bad shape, with a spending growth trajectory which was unsustainable and unaffordable. What we have sought to do since coming into government, and in implementing the commitments that we took to the last election, is build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, while also focusing on the important task of repairing the budget and putting us onto a believable path back to surplus. 


In the budget we are doing a range of things. We are pursuing a series of structural savings and structural reforms in order to build a stronger economy and also ensuring that our spending growth trajectory is more sustainable into the future. The virtue and the challenge with structural reforms and structural savings is that they start low and slow and build over time, which is why in this budget we have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for all Australians to be asked to contribute, to make a special and immediate contribution, and a special and immediate effort to help put the federal budget in a stronger starting position to start repairing the budget mess that we have inherited from Labor.


Obviously and necessarily reducing government payments, reducing the spending growth trajectory, will impact on individuals, families, pensioners, organisations, states and territories that receive payments from the federal government. The judgement that we have made is that, in order to spread the budget repair effort as fairly and as equitably as possible, the only way to ensure that higher income earners who do not receive payments from government make their fair, additional contribution to the budget repair effort over the forward estimates is by making a change to the top marginal tax rate, effectively, the two per cent increase, for a period that is the subject of the bills that we are currently debating.


When it comes to company tax, as part of our plan to build a stronger, more prosperous economy we took a couple of policies to the last election. One was to reduce the company tax rate by 1.5 per cent, from 1 July 2015. Another was to impose a 1.5 per cent paid parental leave levy as part of the introduction of a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme in relation to Australia's biggest and most profitable companies. That is also part of our plan to build a stronger, more prosperous economy and create more jobs. One of the structural challenges that we as an economy are facing is falling rates of workforce participation in the context of an ageing population. One thing we need to do is to lift workforce participation, in particular by women, and to lift productivity. The judgement that we have made is that in relation to the 3,000-odd companies, with a taxable income above $5 million a year, the workforce participation benefits, the economic benefits overall, including the workforce participation benefits and the productivity benefits, outweigh the cost of, effectively, keeping the company tax rate at 30 per cent for those companies. So all companies not subject to the paid parental leave levy will see their company tax reduced to 28.5 per cent. All companies subject to the paid parental levy will effectively continue to pay the same company tax rate. Increasing the company tax rate beyond the 30 per cent that is currently in place would hinder our efforts to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead. It would hinder our efforts to create more opportunities for business and individuals to be successful across Australia.


Finally, at the end of the day, businesses and companies are made up of individuals. What we are asking all individual Australians to do, whether they are receiving payments from government or whether they are taxpayers not receiving payments from government, is to contribute to the immediate effort to put Australia back onto a more sustainable footing.


I note in this context that, when we first flagged the proposition that there should be a temporary budget repair levy, a temporary Labor deficit levy—name it what you will—Mr Shorten's initial response was that it should be opposed: 'Oh, no, we're not going to be part of that. Labor will never be part of that. We are not going to support any increase in personal income tax under any circumstances.' Fast forward, a couple of weeks later, and of course, very quietly, Mr Shorten said, 'Yes, we're not going to oppose that.'


In this chamber we have had all sorts of people from the Labor side jumping up and down and making political assertions. I see Senator Dastyari is readying himself to jump up and get into fray and make a few comments. No doubt he will make an eloquent political speech about why everything this government is doing is bad and everything the previous government did was good, even though the previous government that he was a part of left Australia with $191 billion of accumulated deficits in their first five budgets, $123 billion in projected deficits in their last budget, and government debt heading for an unsustainable $667 billion within a decade and growing beyond that—based on an assumption that there was not going to be any adjustment or correction for bracket creep.


Senator Macdonald, I appreciate the points that you raise. I also appreciate the consistency with which you have raised these arguments in the period of the previous government, as you are now in the period of this government. Essentially, we have had to make a whole range of judgements which seek to finely balance our aspiration and our objective to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone can get ahead, while also seeking to repair the budget mess that we have inherited from our predecessors. It is in that context that we have obviously had to make some difficult decisions in order to reduce the spending growth trajectory that we have inherited. We are very mindful of the fact that these sorts of decisions necessarily impact only on those who receive payments from government, which is why we have sought to spread the effort over the forward estimates by also making the particular provision that is the subject of this bill.


The only alternative to doing what we are proposing—which obviously must have dawned on Mr Shorten eventually as well—would be to ask those who receive payments from government to carry 100 per cent of the burden. But, from our point of view, in the context of the judgements that the government have made, we do not think that it would help us in either building a stronger economic or repairing the budget if we increased company taxation in the way that Senator Macdonald has suggested.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:54):  I thank the minister for his courteous response. I have to say that there is not a lot of what he said that I do not strongly agree with, but he still did not answer the question. He did raise the issue of the paid parental scheme—which I had not raised today. But, Minister, you cannot have it both ways. If there is, and I accept there is a debt crisis that requires people to contribute, whether it is the reduction of government assistance or additional tax for high-income earners, why is it that companies—and you have told me that there are 3,000 of them earning more than $5 million a year, which is a bit of an advance on $180,000, I might say—are not being asked to contribute to the accepted and acknowledged debt crisis Australia faces?


I could say to you, Minister, in purely crass political terms, that every dollar that could be raised from companies would be a dollar less that individual taxpayers—that is, voters—would have to pay. So it is a no-brainer to me, from a purely crass political perspective, but that is not why I am arguing the point. I am not suggesting that we should increase company beyond 30 per cent, and I accept, Minister, you comments about Australia wanting to welcome investment into Australian companies. I accept all that but, if we are doing that, why then are we introducing what many have said is a very generous paid parental scheme at a time when we have a debt crisis?


You could easily divert the $5 billion that will be raised from the top 3,000 companies to pay off Labor's debt. That way, we perhaps may not need a three-year temporary levy on other Australians. We may not need to curtail other assistance that has had to be curtailed to pay off Labor's mismanagement and huge debt. If we could get more people contributing to the repair effort—which I accept is needed and which you have rightly explained, Minister—isn't that a good thing?


We clearly have this debt crisis. Labor, we know, were just appalling in the way they managed the country's finances. We are always left with the job of fixing that. As I say, I congratulate the government on the steps it has taken, but I do not think they go far enough. I was pleased to hear Mr Hockey say, 'The age of entitlement is finished.' So wouldn't this be an appropriate time—with the support of the Commission of Audit—to say, 'The paid parental scheme is a good goal to head towards. It is something that a wealthy, prosperous Australia could and should enter into, but perhaps now is not the right time because now, at this stage in our game, we are trying desperately to pay off Labor's debt'?


I repeat: we are doing that by getting additional tax from high-income earners and we are having to make very modest and moderate savings in other assistance measures because the age of entitlement is finished. Yet many have said to me that, with the paid parental scheme, the age of entitlement is finished. I will not enter into that. That is a debate for another place and another time. It is a debate, as I understand, yet to be held. I read in the paper that there are—quoting the Deputy Prime Minister—'different issues' being looked at by the government in relation to the paid parental scheme. I look forward at some time to being taken into confidence by the government on just what is going to happen with it. But, as I say, that is another debate for another time.


My concern at the moment is that we have this debt crisis—and those are Mr Hockey and the Prime Minister's words. I accept them. You do not need to accept their words to know that, after six years of Labor—as after the Hawke-Keating years, 13 years of Labor—there will be a financial crisis. It has to be addressed. I agree with that. I have no issue at all with my government on that, but what I simply cannot understand—and, with respect, Minister, I know it is not totally your responsibility but you have not answered the question—is why companies do not pay this.


Let me ignore this current levy and go back to Labor's flood levy. You might find this easier to answer, Minister. The Labor Party introduced that levy to help Queensland recover from floods. Why was it that individuals had to pay but companies—like the company I have talked about but not named, which makes a profit out of sugar cane grown in Australia and, quite rightly, sends its profits in dividends to Singapore—were not asked to contribute to the flood levy? I know for a fact that its mill operations actually received some benefit from the flood levy that individual Australians were asked to pay. Why wasn't that company asked to pay? It cannot be because the dividends were going to Australian shareholders who had already paid, because they all go elsewhere. I just use that company as an example because it is an immediate one for me, easy for me to relate, but with BHP, Rio and Wesfarmers—you name it—I am sure a lot of their shareholders are overseas. Why aren't they being asked to contribute to paying off Labor's debt as every other Australian is being asked to? It just does not make sense to me.


I note that the Labor Party and, I think, the Greens are supporting this flawed, in my view, method of raising additional funds that are needed. Labor, of course, would support it, because they did this with the flood levy. I indicate that I am opposed to the bill, because, with respect, Minister, neither you nor the Treasurer nor anyone has explained to me why it is that these 3,000 profitable companies earning $5 million or more are not contributing to solving Labor's debt crisis. Perhaps you could do that, Minister, not that it matters—as I say, with Labor and, I think, the Greens supporting the government, this is going to go through regardless of how I vote. But I do want to make the point as strongly as I can so that, if we in the future need to raise money for particular issues, we do it in an honest way by increasing the general rate of taxation on the progressive scales we have in Australia, so that we can deal with these things that come up. And floods come up—I accept that. Debt crises come up—I accept that. After Labor rule, it is a given—you know there is going to be a crisis. But everyone should be contributing, and that includes companies, many of which are foreign owned and controlled and with foreign shareholders. Why shouldn't they contribute as well?


Minister, I hope you can find something new that would convince me I should support this bill. So far, I regret to say, you have not, and you are not alone in that. We have a $5 billion bucket there that could be used to pay off Labor's debt, and we are apparently not using that. We are engaging in what some—not necessarily me—call an age-of-entitlement allowance to certain individual Australians. I hope, Minister, you will be able to persuade me. If not, I hope that, in the future, governments, be they of this persuasion or that persuasion, will have an honest tax system where additional money is raised and not this dodgy arrangement where we have a levy, not a tax, that is imposed on only a certain number of Australians and not on Australia's wealthiest companies.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:05):  I thank Senator Macdonald for his further remarks. I did do my absolute best to answer his previous questions as directly and relevantly as possible, but I will have another go. Senator Macdonald talks about the debt crisis that we inherited, and indeed Labor did leave behind a debt and deficit disaster, but, as I tried to point out in my earlier remarks, the debt and deficit disaster that Labor left behind was not the only challenge we inherited from the previous government. We also inherited some significant economic challenges. We inherited an economy growing below trend. We inherited an economy with rising unemployment. We inherited an economy with low consumer confidence. We inherited an economy where business investment had plateaued. The very direct answer to Senator Macdonald's question is, yes, we also inherited a budget in very bad shape and an unsustainable spending growth trajectory which needs fixing, but the way we fix the budget mess left behind by Labor cannot detract from our efforts to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where we can create more jobs, where we can attract more investment and where we can lift consumer confidence into the future.


In our judgement, to do what Senator Macdonald is suggesting would hamper our capacity to build a stronger, more prosperous economy and create more jobs and increase business investment. All these policies to build a stronger economy, create more jobs and create opportunity for everyone to get ahead, when properly implemented, will ultimately also lead to increased revenue for government, without the need to increase or implement new taxes.


So we are doing two things at the same time. We are working to put government expenditure on a more sustainable footing by reducing the spending growth trajectory we inherited from Labor, which was going to take us to 26.5 per cent of government spending as a share of GDP by 2023-24 or from $409 billion this financial year to $690 billion by 2023-24. We are significantly working to reduce that spending growth trajectory.


In order to spread the effort fairly and equitably, in the immediate effort required over the forward estimates beyond just those who receive payments from government we are also pursuing this budget repair levy, which effectively is an increase in tax of two per cent for individual Australians who earn more than $180,000 a year. If we were to increase company tax, it would make it harder for us to grow, to get out of the situation we have inherited where the economy is growing below trend. It would make it harder for us to reverse the rising unemployment trend we inherited from our predecessors and it would make it harder for us to attract business investment.


In his further remarks, Senator Macdonald raised with me, as he did privately on various occasions, the Paid Parental Leave Scheme. The Paid Parental Leave Scheme is an integral part of our economic strategy to build a stronger, more prosperous economy. If you look at the two economic challenges we are facing as a nation, one relates to the falling terms of trade and the other relates to the implications which come with the ageing of the population. The ageing of the population, among other things, has led to falls in workforce participation, which is why in the budget we are pursuing initiatives to encourage older Australians to work longer. Also we need to pursue initiatives to lift workforce participation by women in order to help us build a stronger, more prosperous, more resilient economy. The two areas of policy which we need to get right in order to lift workforce participation by women are paid parental leave arrangements and childcare arrangements. 


In relation to childcare arrangements, a Productivity Commission review, which is underway, will guide some of the government's thinking on the best way forward. But when it comes to paid parental leave, I know that it is easy to look at paid parental leave as though it is just another welfare entitlement. In our view it is not that. To ensure that, up to an appropriate level, women are able to draw a replacement wage for a certain period while they are having a baby is essentially the same as somebody who goes on annual leave, on long service leave or on sick leave, while also being paid a replacement wage. Nobody would suggest that somebody who takes three months long service leave should somehow receive a welfare payment. Nobody would suggest that and neither they should. Nobody would suggest that somebody who goes on sick leave should be moved onto a welfare payment. Everybody would accept and acknowledge that it is quite appropriate, while on sick leave, that you should continue to be paid at your wage. Public servants right now here in Canberra are able to access their replacement wage when they have a baby. Indeed, many big businesses are providing paid parental leave benefits now. The problem is that small businesses, as they compete for a workforce, find it difficult to compete with Public Service or big business employers because they cannot afford to pay for that sort of workplace entitlement. That is why the scheme we are putting forward as part of our broader strategy to build a stronger, more prosperous economy provides a fairer deal for small business and helps them to recruit and retain high-quality female workers.


We were very transparent in the lead-up to the last election on what we think needs to be done in order to build a stronger, more prosperous economy. Part of that strategy, of course, is scrapping all the bad Labor taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax. Part of it is to implement a 1.5 per cent company tax cut and part of it is to implement this fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave Scheme, which will be funded significantly with a 1.5 per cent levy.


If we were to do what was suggested by Senator Macdonald—that is, effectively to increase company tax by two per cent in the same way as we are proposing through this bill to increase the top marginal tax rate for Australians earning more than $180,000—we believe, based on all the information we have been able to review, that that would detract from growth and would make it harder for us to reverse the rising unemployment trend we have inherited. Ultimately, it would make it harder for us to repair the budget because rising unemployment means increased costs and less revenue than otherwise would be the case. So in all of the circumstances, we have not taken any of this lightly. We have made a series of very considered, deliberate decisions on how best and how most sensibly to reduce the spending growth trajectory we inherited. And that is never easy. 


If somebody believes they are going to get a particular increase in their payment from government, nobody is going to like to hear the government say, 'We can't afford that. The previous government might have made these promises but we actually cannot afford to give you them because we are going to have to continue to borrow from our children and grandchildren in order to fund these benefits and your current lifestyle. Our children and grandchildren would have to pay back those costs, with interest.' So we have said we cannot do that and we have reduced the spending growth trajectory. 


We have sought to spread the effort fairly and equitably by putting forward this temporary budget repair levy. But to pursue the change to company tax arrangements that Senator Macdonald is suggesting, for all the reasons which I have done my best to outline as clearly and as explicitly as possible, we do not think would be in Australia's national interests or in the interests of growing a stronger, more prosperous economy, of creating more jobs, when we have inherited an economy growing below trend and rising unemployment. We would humbly put to the chamber that the budget that we have put forward, including this measure, is part of a package of initiatives that seeks to protect our living standards, build opportunity and prosperity in the future and finely balance the whole range of competing issues that we have to deal with.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:14):  I will not continue on with this past this question. I acknowledge that Senator Dastyari has allowed me to finish my line of questioning, which I appreciate. Minister, thank you for that, but, with the very greatest of respect, can I just say that the arguments you raise really do not make sense. You said, 'If we were to increase company tax it would impact on our desire to build a stronger economy through additional investment.' Well, sorry, Minister—you are increasing the income tax on companies; you are increasing the company tax. As the coalition promised before the election, we were reducing company tax by 1½ per cent—a great initiative, to do everything you said, Minister. That is, we are going to build a stronger economy by encouraging investment. Yes, the 1½ per cent reduction was great for that. I supported that. So everyone gets a 1½ per cent reduction. But, hang on—for the top 3,000 companies the tax goes back. If it applies on one side it must apply on the other. So, by increasing the tax on those top 3,000 companies, you must be impacting on your desire to build a stronger economy through encouraging investment.


You also talked about falling terms of trade and ageing of populations. I am not quite sure what that has to do with the matter I am discussing. And, whilst I accept that women in the workforce do need encouragement to have their children and go back to work, there is already a scheme in place. It is a Labor scheme, so it cannot be particularly good, but it is there; it is in place.




Senator McKenzie:
  Public servants can double dip.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And public servants can double dip. But, Minister—and this is where the logic fails in the argument that you put to me—you say that big business already has a very generous paid parental leave scheme. Maybe big business should have a look at their schemes. And why isn't the Public Service having the same sort of Paid Parental Leave Scheme as every small business and every other Australian has? It is not brilliant, but it is a start.


We will get the economy back into the black. We will get it powering ahead. I know our government will do that, because we have the right policies and the right philosophy to do that. And we have done it before. It is a continuous cycle, be it at state or federal level: Labor gets in and smashes the economy; Liberals come back and improve the economy. We know that that is going to happen. And, when we have done that, then—perhaps instead of giving tax deductions—we can look at a properly funded, very good Paid Parental Leave Scheme. And I would be the first to support it.


But arguing that big business are already doing that, and then giving them a cut in their income tax so that they do not then have to use their own funds to do their own Paid Parental Leave Scheme, and then putting the 1½ per cent back so that we have this universal Paid Parental Leave Scheme—don't you see that it just doesn't make sense? I have tried. But, with Labor supporting your proposals and, I think, the Greens, too—I cannot take this anymore. I do thank you, Minister—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Keep going—we're thoroughly enjoying it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, I hope you might not just enjoy it but think about it in the future, so that the next time your mates in the Labor Party want to introduce a flood levy on individuals and not on these big 3,000 companies, you might encourage your mates in the Labor Party not to do that. That is presupposing they ever get back into government, and that is a big presupposition.


But I just hope that people do learn something from this. To me, there is no valid argument why the top companies, with profits of more than $5 million, are not contributing to the debt that Labor created—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Hear, hear!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  with the help of the Greens. There is that debt crisis there. We have to pay that debt back. Here is a way we could get the top 3,000 companies to do it. We are not doing it. I think it is a missed opportunity. But I cannot take it anymore. Minister, I thank you for your answers, although they have not convinced me.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Nonanswers.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:

Frankly, Minister, you, with your arguments, are unable to convince your own government backbench, seven or eight months into government. They are coming in here and pleading with you, saying: 'Please, Minister, please—give us a reason to support you. We want to vote for you but you're making it so hard for us.'

The minister is in such an extraordinary situation now that he cannot even get up anymore and defend the stability of his own government.

I believe that if you wanted to tackle what you deem is some kind of a crisis, which has been manufactured, there were many better ways to do it. Do I think this is good legislation? No. Do I think it is perfect? No. I think it is nothing more than a fig leaf to cover the fact that this is a budget that you have designed that will hurt families, that will hurt lower-income earners, that will attack health care, that will attack education, that will attack the social fabric that holds this society together.

  Which I will support because I think it is better than a lot of the other measures. But if we were designing it we would have designed it a lot better than this. We would not have had a loophole so that what is a three-year measure will really only be paid for one actual year. We would have fixed up the fringe benefits tax. We would have looked at a proper program as part of a broader taxation review, not a fig leaf when we got to the end of a budget process and realised that, 'Oh, we are only attacking middle income earners, we are only attacking the young, we are only attacking the disabled, we are only attacking those who are in the bottom quartile of this society. We had better create something big and something exciting for the higher income earners so that we can say we are sharing the pain.' Well, Minister, the pain is not being shared. The pain is not being shared in this budget. It is an unfair budget, it is an unequal budget. That is why people are up in arms. That is why people out there in Australian society—you have seen the polling, you have seen the numbers—are outraged, because there is no fairness. You are now in a situation where even your own MPs, even your own backbench, are getting up and using this chamber to say, 'We are unhappy with this direction. We are unhappy with this budget.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2014-15 Budget.


Once again, today, we see in this chamber those opposite defending their insidious and horrid budget. Some of the questions in respect of what I will touch on today in answers provided by those opposite reflect the position that not only the Prime Minister but also the partners of the coalition have taken with regard to the concerns they have raised about this budget.


It was quite amusing and quite extraordinary to be in the chamber today to hear from the likes of Senator Macdonald when he was, to some degree, probing and questioning the position that the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, had taken in respect of the deficit bill that is currently before the chamber.


You only need to reflect, however, on the position that the Prime Minister has taken on this budget. In question time yesterday, in response to a question from the member for Hotham, he said:


We have done precisely what the people of Australia asked us to do …


I am pretty certain, as I go around and talk to constituents and people in general in my state of Queensland, that they did not precisely ask to be lied to, to have their pensions cut, to have their health priorities cut, to have higher  education and education cut, and to have a fuel excise put upon them. I would really question why the Prime Minister raised that type of response in question time yesterday.


But we do know this is a budget of Liberal-National Party values. It is a budget based on the values where the rich are rewarded, as opposed to the poor being pushed more and more into poverty. We heard, once again, today in questions a defence by the Nationals here in this chamber of their position on the fuel excise increase. It would pay them to have some intestinal fortitude and to stand up to their partners in this chamber and oppose the fuel excise. You may recall, Mr Deputy President, in this chamber yesterday, my contribution to a debate where I spoke of a constituent of mine, who lives west of Barcaldine. He was complaining to my office about the fuel increase and not being able to afford to go to polo shows anymore. That seems to be a consistent line that rolls out through many emails that I receive in my office. I would also like to refer to an email from a constituent who lives in the Hinkler electorate. He wrote to the member for Hinkler, advising:


… I live in the Hinkler electorate and voted for you at the last election. However since the coalition took office their performance has been less than fair mainly because, of the 2014 budget. 


He refers to concerns about other measures and how there are different ways of dealing with the current budget appropriations. He then ends the commentary by saying:


With the skyrocketing costs of energy, water, medical, food, transport, fuel etc. it is becoming increasing difficult for the average family to make ends meet. Give us a break and tax those people, companies and organisations who don't pay tax and who can afford it. The Coalition's voter support may even increase instead of rapidly decreasing since the budget release.


Once again, we find the Prime Minister of this country saying in a meeting with the US President recently, 'The fuel excise is a carbon tax on steroids.' He actually said to Barack Obama, during the wide-ranging private discussions in Washington that he had, that the fuel excise, which the government announced would increase in the budget, was acting like a carbon price signal.


On one hand, the coalition are wanting to do away with the carbon price but, on the other hand, they are here promoting a fuel excise. I can only imagine that they are claiming it will result in fewer people on the roads and will promote the fact there will be less carbon monoxide rising into the atmosphere. I imagine that is what they are promoting. But it is difficult to get in the heads of a National Party member or a senator and work out what they are really promoting when it comes to these sorts of comments that our Prime Minister made in the US recently.


The last comment I want to make, and I am running out of time, is the effect on the retail sector that has been— (Time expired)

Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (15:07):  I always enjoy Senator Furner's contributions. They are always considered—even if somewhat misguided. Let's just draw the broader picture of the budget. Let's give a little bit of context. At present as a proportion of debt to GDP, this nation is at about 14 per cent. Senator Furner is right—at least in this respect—that that is nothing shocking when looking at most of the OECD. That is true. The problem is not the amount; the problem is the trajectory of government debt. Funding Labor's future promises is the problem.


It is as simple as this: if we were to do nothing it would get so much worse. If we did nothing about the education funding, the Gonski funding, the NBN, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the indexation of welfare and so forth the problem would be that government debt would rise and rise and rise.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator MASON:
  The trajectory is like this, Senator Conroy: under your government, public debt in this country would have trebled in nine years. The steepest trajectory in the developed world is what that lot left us—the steepest trajectory of public debt in the entire developed world. It will treble within nine years. Debt will be at $667 billion and interest payments will be about $3 billion a month. On current projections, within a decade, every man, every woman and every child in this country will be in debt to the tune of $25,000. That is on their projections. That is if we do nothing. For an average family, that is about $100,000 for each family within nine years—virtually no time at all.


But, of course, Labor would be happy. Labor would be delighted, because at long last they would have achieved their great ambition—a public sector that eats up more and more of the national wealth. Labor would love that—government which increasingly decides who are the new rent seekers, the new spivs, the new carpetbaggers and the new cronies they will play to. They love that. They want to be just like Western Europe. What a prognosis for a successful future! The Labor Party would finally get what they want—a little bit of Western Europe in South-East Asia. Wouldn't they love that! They would finally get what they want. What sort of prognosis is that for Australia's future? In the fastest developing part of the world, with the economies that are growing the fastest, we would have an economy something like a sclerotic economy, something like Western Europe—and it would happen within nine years.


That is the legacy of this lot, and they sit here and talk about fairness. I accept that Australians are being asked to give. That is true. And I suspect that there is some pain. But any difficulties, any pain, any complaints from anyone in this country will be nothing compared to the sacrifice that will have to be made in just nine short years if we do not fix this problem now. That is the problem that confronts this country. Is there some difficulty? Is there some pain right now? Yes, there is, but if we do not fix this problem it will be so much worse within three terms of parliament. That is all it is. On their figures, they have forecast $667 billion of debt within nine years.


We do not even know any more whether Labor believe in balancing the budget. Mr Swan used to talk the talk though he could never walk the walk, but at least he said he believed in balancing the budget. When was the last time you heard Mr Shorten or Mr Bowen say they believe in balancing the budget, that they believe that generations should live within their means? When is the last time you heard that? They will all talk about, 'We should just go for broke'—which of course is economic surrender. I have heard 'Go for broke' spoken in French. I have heard 'Go for broke' spoken in Portuguese. I have heard 'Go for broke' spoken in Icelandic.' I have heard 'Go for broke' spoken in Greek. Do you know why? Because it is always a surrender. It is always said in Greek: 'When you have got nothing to offer, go for broke.'

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:12):  I do not know if it is going for growth but we certainly had the enlargement of a voice, which was approaching screaming, here in the chamber. I think that it is a sign of that great Shakespearian saying, 'Methinks the lady doth protest too much.' This shouting, carrying on and nonsense is a distraction. This government want Australians to be distracted from what they are actually doing in terms of ripping away the fabric of this very society.


Yesterday the Prime Minister stood up in the House of Representatives and said, 'This budget is the budget that the Australian people elected us to bring down.' He could not be further from the truth. But there is something very powerful about his budget. It reveals the values of this Liberal-National coalition party and how wantonly and desperately they are under the influence of an ideology that would seek the destruction of Australia's social fabric—our egalitarian fabric about moving forward together.


This budget from this government reveals a complete lack of care for fairness—and we can see it most clearly in the questions that we asked today and the inadequate responses about the differences between people in the bush and people in the city and about failures of consultation with key stakeholders, including the National Farmers Federation and the Country Women's Association. Believe you me, when Nola Macleod, president of that great Australian organisation, the Country Women's Association, says, 'Warren Truss certainly didn't speak to us,' I will believe her every day over the stream of lies that the Australian people have now come to expect is the level of communication they can get from this federal government.


With particular regard to the answer given by Senator Abetz in response to my question about paid parental leave, it is not surprising that the minister was so quick to shoot down dissent from his own coalition partners, the Nationals, this question time. It is not surprising that the Nationals are standing up for their electorates as they watch the golden rivers of Tony Abbott's signature Paid Parental Leave Scheme flow into the inner city Liberal seats and only trickle to the regions.


Sadly, it is also not surprising that the Prime Minister and Senator Abetz are so quick to try and shut down any public dissent from the Nationals. But they are failing in that as much as they are failing this nation. With 700 women on the northern beaches of Sydney, in the electorate of Warringah, eligible for up to $50,000 in Paid Parental Leave payments and only one-third of that number eligible in the electorate of Wide Bay, the Nationals have a right to be bemused by the equity of this Liberal Party policy. That is why we are seeing the complete unravelling of a dysfunctional, arrogant government that is not listening to the people of Australia and is still insisting on the budget that it brought down, the budget that is set to undo Medicare, the budget that takes money away from pensioners. 


This budget is not the one that Australians believed that they were getting. It just reveals over and over again the big gap between what Australians think is fair and right and what this government is willing to inflict on ordinary people. The regional electorates were forgotten when this government came up with this policy. It did not consult. It does not care to. There is a constant failure of consultation. There is a constant failure to address the reality that inequity is absolutely in the genes of this Liberal Party, which is leading its coalition allies by the nose to a disgraceful position of inequity in Australian public policy.


With regard to school funding, in the time that remains to me I would like to put on the record that I am proud to be a New South Welsh woman when people in New South Wales—including the Nationals, at the New South Wales conference—are seeking to hold this federal Liberal government to account to honour its six-year commitment to school funding and to reverse the cuts. We had questions today put to the Minister representing the Minister for Education here in the Senate, Senator Marise Payne, who continued to roll out misinformation to try and deflect from the reality that an exit of $30 billion of education funding has been confirmed. She might try and play the game with the pea and the thimbles, where you shift money around—they tried to get away with that with $1.2 billion in education—but the reality is: this government is taking money from the poor— (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:17):  I am delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the proposed Paid Parental Leave program to promote post-parturition participation, to improve productivity and profitability, towards parity, in a particularly and peculiarly appropriate process. And how wrong Senator O'Neill is when she comments on the value of this particular program to rural women. As Sharman Stone, the member for Murray, said the other day, in response to a question from a female ABC interviewer: 'You enjoy these benefits, don't you? You in the ABC enjoy them. Commonwealth and state civil servants enjoy them. Employees in insurance companies, banks and big mining companies all enjoy them, don't they?' Do you know what the ABC interviewer did, Senator O'Neill? She was silent, simply because, as we all know, this is not a welfare payment; it is equally applicable to anybody across the spectrum. This Paid Parental Leave scheme is going to allow women to stay in small businesses. Over time, as we all know, women have left small businesses to join banks, insurance companies and the public sector. So, far from this being some sort of an accusation against rural and regional Australia—which is a little bit rich coming from the Labor Party, who would not know where rural and regional Australia was—Mr Deputy President, I can say to you, after an entire life associated with rural and regional Australia, that the bush is very, very happy with the coalition.


Senator Furner asked a question about my friend Tony Seabrook, who may have made a comment about the diesel fuel excise. Let me tell you what Tony Seabrook said in June 2011, when then Prime Minister Gillard and then Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig cut the knees and the legs out from under regional and rural Australia by banning the live export trade, affecting not just northern Australia but sheep producers, grain producers and, particularly, cattle producers and damaging the relationship with Indonesia, which Prime Minister Abbott, Foreign Minister Bishop and Defence Minister Johnston have only recently been able to start to repair.


I am delighted, as an ex-academic in a rural and regional university, to comment on the benefits of the higher education changes which have been brought in by the Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne. I met with one of the vice-chancellors yesterday, and we discussed the benefits of sub-bachelor degrees. I could speak for some time about how those young people who did not quite make it into university initially will be able to get financial support, through HELP, to do sub-bachelor degrees, which will start them on a process possibly even through to doctoral and postdoctoral studies, something which the Labor government, when it was in power, never, ever legislated for.


In the short time left to me, I would just like to comment on how Labor decimated the bush when they responded to the global financial crisis. We heard the nonsense from then Prime Minister Rudd and Treasurer Swan about how they saved the nation. There were four reasons this nation was saved.




Senator Conroy:
  Ah, yes!




Senator BACK:
  It certainly wasn't because of your NBN! The four reasons were these: firstly, Labor went in with a $20 billion surplus; secondly, there were very good prudential regulations in place because of the efforts of the Howard-Costello government; thirdly, the Governor of the Reserve Bank had the opportunity to significantly reduce interest rates because, peculiarly, Australia had been in such a strong economic position that he could do that; and, fourthly, we had this place called China which so lavishly wanted to buy our resources—our coal, our iron ore and, eventually, our energy resources. Far from incurring debt on assets and activities that would add to the wealth creation of this nation, what did the Labor government spend Australia's wealth on? What did they incur debt on, borrowing money from overseas? Pink batts that led to deaths and house fires, and we are still paying; school halls which are now falling down and which did not add one element to the educational value for young people in Australia; and $900 cheques, followed by $1,200 cheques, which went straight to casinos, alcohol, drugs and Chinese television sets. There was nothing spent on adding to the wealth of this nation, nothing on mining exploration, nothing at all to add value to the future of Australia. (Time expired)

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:22):  I have to say, Senator Back, I would love to live in the world you seem to inhabit where everything is fantastic, where this glorious budget has been handed down, where as you walk through the streets of your community peopled throw flowers and rose petals at your feet and thank you for the amazing job you have done—when you have put a $7 co-payment on Medicare, when you have cut funding to universities by 30 per cent, when you are putting in the Paid Parental Leave Scheme which is going to disproportionately hurt people in rural and regional Australia. Senator Back is shocked because clearly the people he is talking to keep telling him what a fantastic job the government have been doing. I would love to inhabit that world because no-one else appears to be there. You would be all alone.


In question time today we saw the government beginning to unravel. Just prior to question time, on the key government measure of a debt levy, a very senior former government minister—a backbencher who has been 30 years in this place and who, after 1 July, will be the longest serving member—said he had lost faith in this government on this issue, that he did not believe them and that the government could not convince its own MPs and its own backbench.


Senator Bernardi and Senator Williams are making clear their opposition to the Paid Parental Leave Scheme. Not only have they been backgrounding media about it but they have certainly been up front loading the media.  I have to give them both credit. They have been quite upfront about their views. In this budget there are measures which are unfair, there are measures which are inequitable. This government cannot convince its own backbench. You wonder why so many Australians have so many doubts.


My state of New South Wales today handed down the state budget. We saw a figure in the vicinity of $2 billion coming from money that has already been cut. This is not money that is going to come before the forward estimates, which is in the tens of millions, but already the impact that this government's cuts are going to have on  New South Wales families. You have strong opposition from state premiers including state Liberal premiers. You have opposition from the Liberal Party backbench. There is opposition out there from the community and, apart from a few elements of the conservative media, no-one supports these measures. 


The government have convinced themselves that the tougher they are the fairer they are being. They have convinced themselves that it is a tough budget with tough measures, but it is not that. This is an ideological budget. These are ideological measures. These are value statements. When you are doing something like PPL but you are cutting university funding and when you have a research fund but you are putting a $7 tax on every time you go to a doctor, those are political decisions. They are value statements. The government have got it wrong on the values. They have got it wrong on their priorities. We now have a situation where even the coalition is starting to fray, with their own backbench are saying, 'This isn't fair, this isn't right, this isn't equitable.' 


Earlier today a lot of us supported a measure that we were not happy with. If I had designed the debt levy, I would have made sure it was there for all three years. I would have fixed up the fringe benefit tax loophole and a few other measures as well, but we supported it because we are not opposed to action and we are not opposed to sharing the burden. We are opposed to inequitable measures like the PPL, measures that discriminate against those in the bush, against lower income earners. We are opposed to increasing the Medicare levy, which many Australians, especially those on lower income, cannot afford to pay.  Today we saw the beginning of the government, certainly their Senate team, already starting to fall apart.

 (Queensland) (15:35):  by leave—I table this document which has been presented as a petition in a non-conforming way. This document is from the group Independent Regional Mothers in Victoria and is about a demand for accountability and justice for past sexual crimes, abduction of newborn babies and medical experimentation. I seek leave to make a short statement of one minute.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MOORE:
  I thank the chamber. This document has come from a very strong group of women in Victoria known as the Independent Regional Mothers. Many of those in this chamber have met these women through a series of Senate community affairs committee inquiries.


Ms Brenda Coughlan is the spokesperson for this group. Over many years she has been strong about her own extremely sensitive and damaging personal experiences when she was a young woman who had her baby stolen. More particularly, she has very strong claims that, while she was young, she was subjected to a number of medical experiments with drugs and other activities. She feels very strongly that the medical profession in this nation has not been held to account for this kind of activity, and she continues her fight. This particular document is part of her ongoing battle. I strongly support her strength and resilience, and I am very proud to be able to table this document in her name today.

  The Curriculum Review was established in January 2014 regarding the development and implementation of the Australian curriculum, its robustness and balance and curriculum development processes.

The review is a long-time coalition election promise.


The government is happy with making the preliminary report public. It was advice from March on the progress of the review to date. It was released online earlier this afternoon and it is available on the curriculum page of the Students First website. The review is continuing to work so as to complete its report as promised by the end of July.

Senator RYAN:
  The Curriculum Review was established in January 2014 regarding the development and implementation of the Australian curriculum, its robustness and balance and curriculum development processes. It is needed to ensure that the Australian curriculum is on track, meets Australia's long-term education needs and assesses criticisms that occurred prior to this review. The review is a long-time coalition election promise.


The government is happy with making the preliminary report public. It was advice from March on the progress of the review to date. It was released online earlier this afternoon and it is available on the curriculum page of the Students First website. The review is continuing to work so as to complete its report as promised by the end of July.

  The government extends its sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Seemanpillai.

The issuing of documents for nationals of other countries is a matter for those countries. To make a visa application valid, travel documents are required. Family members need to hold valid visas to enter Australia. Any application for a visa is assessed by the department against relevant criteria.

What we should also know is that, because of the decision that he made, there are now Australians who have a kidney where they previously did not have one, and they have functioning lungs, because he has donated his lungs to ordinary Australians. He has donated a cornea so that Australians can live the life that he was denied. The very least we can do is give the opportunity for his family to come to this country to grieve and say goodbye to their son, who has given his life so that others in Australia can have the opportunities that he was denied.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:54):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter urgency:


(a) the Abbott Government's failure to honour its election promises to support Australia's defence manufacturing industry by excluding Australian ship building companies from tendering for two new naval supply ships and refusing to commit to building twelve future submarines in Australia; and


(b) the need for the Government to keep its election promises and take action to avoid sending thousands of Australian ship building jobs overseas and putting at risk Australia's strategically vital ship building industry.


I rise to support this motion because this government is putting the Australian shipbuilding industry in peril. Australia's shipbuilding industry is a vital strategic asset for our Navy and for our country. The shipyards in Newcastle, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth form the backbone of this vital industry. It would be grossly irresponsible for any government to take decisions that put these vital assets at risk, but that is what this government is doing. 


The Abbott government have excluded Australian companies from tendering to build two replacement supply ships for the Royal Australian Navy. They have excluded them from bidding at all. They claim that Australia cannot do it. The minister claims that our shipyards and their workers are not good enough. It is clear that the government is no longer happy just talking down our economy; they are now talking down entire industries. At the last election Labor proposed, at a minimum, a hybrid build—and potentially a complete local build—of these two important vessels as a key plank in our plan to bridge what has come to be referred to as the 'valley of death'. We knew from advice that we received in government that this was feasible and that work could have begun in the first quarter of 2016 if the government had followed Labor's plan. But rather than acting quickly after coming to government, those opposite have sat on their hands for nine months. We announced a plan in the election campaign that you could have started after the election. But no. Nine months later, we had the minister pretending to the Australian public that he had a plan. In March, this minister boasted on the front page of The Australian Financial Review that he had a plan; he had a plan to fix the valley of death. That is what he said on the front page of the Fin Review in March of this year. Minister, you do not fix the valley of death by sending Australian shipbuilding jobs to Spain or South Korea. But that is what this minister announced a week ago. No Australian companies are allowed to bid; we are building the ships in Spain or South Korea. The minister even went so far as to declare this an 'exciting' announcement. He was excited for shipbuilding workers in South Korea and Spain but he just could not give a proverbial about Australian shipworkers. 


Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President: I do not think that shipping high-skilled jobs to other countries is exciting. The Labor Party does not think it is exciting, and the Australian public do not think it is exciting. This is not just a bad decision; it is another Abbott government broken promise. Let me recap the history on this. Before the election, on 9 August 2013, now Minister Johnston went up to Newcastle in election campaign mode, and he went on the local ABC radio station in Newcastle and said:


I get really fired up when I find us giving away our manufacturing base in the Defence space to foreign manufacturers, it's just not on.


Yet here he is, nine months later, doing just that. He is excluding Australian businesses from tendering for a major shipbuilding project. He says one thing before the election, misleads voters in Newcastle and all around the country. This is just another Liberal lie. It is another broken promise. 


I would love to say that that was the only lie the Liberal government has been engaged in recently. But, just before the election, the Liberals made another promise. On 8 May 2013, Senator Johnston went to the ASC shipbuilding yard in South Australia—and I am willing to bet that Senator Birmingham was standing next to him when he said the following regarding Australia's future submarine project: 'We will deliver these submarines from right here at the ASC in South Australia. The coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide.' That is what he said—I am willing to bet he was standing next to a couple of those senators opposite—in May last year. And yet yesterday, when I asked him to repeat that promise in this chamber, he ran and hid. He refused to do it. He refused to commit to 12 submarines, and he has refused to commit to having them built in Australia. That is another Liberal lie; another Liberal broken promise.


Australia needs a domestic shipbuilding industry. Over the next 30 years the Australian Defence Force needs 48 ships at a cost of $60 billion to $80 billion, with an additional $180 billion to $200 billion for the through-life support that these ships will need. Among the vessels we need are submarines, frigates, patrol boats, mine hunters, survey vessels and heavy landing craft—and do not tell me we cannot build these in Australia. The Anzac frigate project was an outstanding success—built in Australia with world-class ships delivered to the Royal Australian Navy. At present we have three air warfare destroyers and two landing helicopter docks under construction. These are the most sophisticated ships built or assembled in Australia. 




Senator Birmingham:
  Yeah, who started that?




Senator CONROY:
  Do not believe the minister when he claims that they are failing projects. The AWDs remain within their funding envelope. The LHDs are on track to be delivered in 2014 and 2016. The Labor government invested heavily to provide industry with the means to recover the skills lost during the Howard years and to steadily improve productivity. But this government wants to junk this investment and these jobs.


I will take that interjection from Senator Birmingham because it is true, Senator Birmingham, that the Howard government—on one of the very few occasions—had a forward vision on this. They accepted that we needed to start the program; they accepted that that would be because we were starting from scratch and we had to upskill an entire sector so we were ready for the future. All those ships I talked about were—to be fair to the Howard government—a legacy. But what we have seen in the last few weeks is endangering thousands of jobs. All that extra investment, all those extra costs that were incurred to get us up to world-class standard were all thrown out the window because the minister got rolled in cabinet again. In March he said, 'I have got a plan to fix this.' He could have just done what Labor called on to happen and was planning to do after the election—that is, start the project. Nine months were wasted, the minister got rolled and jobs were lost. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (16:08):  The sheer front, the sheer hypocrisy of those opposite seems to know absolutely no bounds. Senator Conroy came in here hectoring and lecturing, and I am sure Senator Carr and Senator Gallacher will do likewise. We heard the hysteria of Senator Wong yesterday on this topic. For six long years the government of those opposite did nothing to help naval capability in this country and did nothing to actually sign any contracts or develop any further delivery of work to Australia's shipbuilding industry. We had nothing from the government of those opposite and now they come in here and talk about what has happened in nine months.


The so-called 'valley of death' that may exist for Australia's defence industries is entirely the making of six years of failure by the Labor government to make a decision, sign a contract or fund a project. It was entirely the fault of those opposite. If you listened carefully to Senator Conroy's nine minutes, you would have realised that, in that entire nine-minute period, never was he able to talk about a project that was initiated, started and with work commenced by the Labor government. I issue this challenge to further Labor speakers in this debate: tell us, in the naval shipbuilding space, of the projects that your government initiated, funded and contracted. Name one. Please, during this debate tell us where you started work like the Howard government started the work on the AWDs. Those opposite were too damn busy defending each other from their own attacks within to worry about the successful and effective defence of the country.


Let us look back at the record of those opposite because, when Senator Conroy wants to talk about promises, I remember promises. I remember 19 August 2007 when then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, went to Adelaide and promised that there would be submarines built by the ASC with construction to begin in 2017. In 2007, he said:


Starting the process this year will guarantee continuity of work for South Australia's defence industry and those employed in the sector. It will also provide a big boost to South Australia's growing knowledge and skills base and its reputation as the defence state.


Well, I am sure if the project had started after the election of Mr Rudd as Prime Minister in 2007, those words may have come true. But, of course, it did not start then, did it? Far from it. Another two years it took until 2009. What did we then get? We got a promise to a commitment for 12 submarines. That was it, no funding, no detail, no contract. After two years of hard work by that Labor administration, they had gone from Rudd's election promise where work was going to start in 2007 to two years later in 2009 and they could now say it would be 12 submarines. That was all. And there was a promise that there would be initial operating capacity by 2025-26.


Then what happened? Another few years rolled forward until last year, 2013, when, because of the complete inactivity of the government to fund any work on developing those submarines, they had to push back the date for the operating capability by another four years. So the 2007 promise saw nothing happen until 2009 and then saw nothing happen until 2013 and then again got delayed further. Of course, nothing ever happened. What the Labor Party did for naval shipbuilding in this country during six long years was zero, zip, nada, nothing at all. The challenge remains to those opposite to come in here and demonstrate that they delivered anything.


Senator Conroy had the gall to come in here and say that at the last election Labor proposed something. Well, for God's sake. At the 2010 election Labor proposed something and did not deliver; at the 2013 election Labor proposed something and did not deliver. Why on earth should we believe that they would have delivered had they actually been re-elected in 2013? Because for the previous six years, they had delivered absolutely nothing at all. In fact, in the defence space, what had they done? They cut $16 billion from the defence budget. The share of GDP spent on defence fell to 1.56 per cent—its lowest level since 1938. They want to talk about investing in defence industries but, when they were in government, they drove investment in defence down to its lowest share of our economy since 1938.


In 2012-13 the government of those opposite made the single largest cut to the defence budget since the end of the Korean conflict. They cut 10½ per cent from the defence budget. There is little wonder that they were not able to make any decisions to fund shipbuilding, because they were cutting the budget and cutting the funding that you need to commit to make those decisions. They had no budget there to be able to make decisions or commitments. As a result of their disregard, it was not just the submarine projects that suffered the fate of deferral and inaction and an inability to be delivered. Overall some 119 different Defence projects were delayed, 43 different Defence projects were reduced and eight were cancelled altogether. 


This is the chaos that Senator Johnston as Defence minister in our government inherited in the Defence portfolio. It is the utter chaos and mismanagement that saw funds bled from Defence, projects deferred—and continued announcements, of course. The announcements never stopped. They were always very good at going out and doing press conferences and making announcements. They could just never deliver on them at all.


We are getting on with two tasks here. Firstly, we are delivering for Defence—for their capabilities and what they need for their naval capabilities in the future. Secondly, we are trying to put naval shipbuilding in Australia back on a sustainable footing that we hope and trust can be a sustainable footing for the long term, not just the type of ad hoc approach that reflects the decision making of those opposite. 


In terms of delivering for Defence, and for the Navy in particular, that has required us to make some difficult decisions. The truth is that the Navy needs new supply vessels, they need them urgently and they are of a size and scale that cannot be cost-competitively delivered in Australia. The estimates are that for the two vessels that the minister announced we would procure—decisions that could have been taken by those opposite but were not—it would have cost an additional $300 million to $500 million for just those two vessels alone to be built in Australia.


Knowing that that is a difficult decision—and I would rather, of course, have seen them built in Australia if it were cost competitive to do so—we have committed to try to get the Australian naval shipbuilding industry back in a competitive position so that the overwhelming majority of future work may be bid for and hopefully won by Australia's naval shipbuilding industry. That is why some $78.2 million has been brought forward to begin preliminary engineering and design work so that future frigates may be built in Australia. It is why we have given a commitment to construct more than 20 Pacific Patrol Boats here in Australia. It is why we are working hard to get the AWD contract under control so that ultimately the delivery of those air warfare destroyers will be a success and will be something that the ASC and the other partners in that contract can use to earn support for winning future contracts and ensuring they get work in Adelaide and elsewhere around Australia.


So, as a government, we are working to a very clear plan. Unlike those opposite, we have made decisions. Unlike those opposite, we have funded those decisions. Unlike those opposite, we will enter into contracts to deliver upon those decisions. Unlike those opposite, those working in the naval shipbuilding industries and those companies involved in those industries can see a clear plan and a clear pathway from this government, which is working through towards the delivery next year of our naval capability plan as part of the new Defence white paper that will give certainty for the long haul. They can have certainty that when this government says it will do something and says it will build something, we will follow through and we will deliver for our Defence industries, unlike the six years of malaise they suffered previously.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:18):  I only have three minutes to make a contribution on this very important issue because I want my colleague Senator Madigan to speak on behalf of his state of Victoria. In relation to my state of South Australia, this is a bad decision made by the government. I am sick of the blame shifting and the finger pointing as to who should have done what or who could have done what over the last few years and over the last nine months of this government. The fact is this: two supply ships will not be built in Australia. It could have avoided the valley of death. As decent and as good and as capable a Defence minister as Senator Johnston—who, I believe, is a good man grappling with a very difficult portfolio—is, I believe a fundamental mistake has been made by the government.


To say, as Senator Birmingham has said, that we cannot build ships of this size and scale cost-competitively in Australia when we have not even allowed the Australian industry to tender for these ships is a fundamental flaw in the argument of the government. This is what I do not understand: I do not understand why you will not even give Australian industry a go. I understand that the ASC shipbuilding in Adelaide was in a position to deliver these ships in cooperation with an overseas shipbuilder to assist where necessary. I believe they have the capacity to do so, yet they will not even have a chance to tender for these ships, and that is something which baffles me. If, at the end of a tender process, it was simply too expensive or not cost competitive, then I think that Australian manufacturers could wear that. But they were not even given an opportunity to fight for Australian jobs and Australian industry.


Why is it important in my home state of South Australia? It is this: we are losing Holden. We are losing one of the last original automotive manufacturers in the state. We are facing a critical situation in South Australia with manufacturing jobs, and these are good jobs in shipbuilding. There is a transference of skills. There is a transference of decent jobs where people can put food on the table for their families and have good productive jobs. We are losing even the chance to tender for those jobs. 


I must say this: I do not have an axe to grind against the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, but what he said last year when he basically taunted Holden—'Are you going to stay or are you going to go?'—was reckless. It was reckless because it destroyed a bipartisan consensus for our auto industry in this country, and I believe it hastened the demise of Holden. Now we are faced with a critical situation where our shipbuilding sector is not even given an opportunity to tender for these two supply ships. The valley of death is a valley of destruction of jobs, it is a valley of destroyed lives, it is a valley of losing skills in this country that we will never, ever get back again. That is why I urge Senator Johnston—a decent man with a good heart—to reconsider this decision as a matter of absolute urgency before it is too late.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:21):  I rise to make a contribution in support of this resolution. I have just a couple of points very early on. Senator Macdonald, in an earlier contribution today, complained about the lack of honesty and the fact that the legislation did not make a lot of sense. I think that could be appropriately applied in this case to the contribution from Senator Birmingham. The facts are that successive governments have accepted that the building of these ships would involve a premium over and above building them overseas. It has been the decision of successive governments to build shipbuilding capability in Australia—to get the people, train them, get the experience up and build a decent product.


In an earlier contribution on this matter, I raised an issue of the Australian National Audit Office report on this capability. I also raised at the same time the fact that the embargoed report had been written about profusely in The Financial Review the night before, and I inquired as to whether Senator Johnston or his office had anything to do with that. No answer was forthcoming on that. But it is really interesting. The simple facts are that there is an early release of an audit report and a dark cloud of 'blow-out in productivity', and all of a sudden the whole world thinks that the workers are not going to work on time; the workers are not doing the work on time; the workers must be badly trained; or there is some other inherent lack of capacity in the workforce. But when you actually read the audit report you realise that nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing could be further from the truth. The workers who are doing these jobs—these highly paid, high-skilled, extremely worthy jobs—are not at fault in any of this.


The minister's office is not leaping to the front saying what the core of the problems of productivity in this sector is. But, if you just glance at the audit report, you see that the total number of construction drawings for the Hobart class DDG was 2,132, and the total number of revisions issued at October 2013 was 6,071. In this argument, what has been missed is that no-one is seeking to address the core problem. There have been multiple revisions of the plans after the work has been done, and in some cases—about 20 per cent of the time—the work has had to be redone. That has got this aura of: 'We can't do it. Australians can't make it.' Well, we can make it. Very clearly we can make it. And, if you are doing something two or three times and you only have a 20 per cent loss of productivity, perhaps that is not a bad effort.


As Senator Xenophon has rightly said, we are not even getting a chance to tender, despite all of the lessons that have been learnt in this process; despite successive governments, going back a long way, backing this industry to give us the capability, to give us the skills; and despite a very complete audit report highlighting the deficiencies. I accept that design is part of productivity. I hasten to say that you cannot label a workforce as unproductive when it has to do something twice or three times because there has been a change in design from the Spanish Navantia corporation. When are we going to get down to brass tacks here?


Senator Birmingham will go over, ad infinitum, five or six years of Labor's allegedly poor decision making. That is not relevant, nine months after the coalition winning government, to those people who work in this industry. It is not relevant to those companies seeking to make an investment in this industry. What is relevant is a government that actually allows the industry to compete. Why would they not be allowed to competitively tender? They may have the answers to some of these problems that have come up in the Australian National Audit Office report. They may well have learnt very good and valuable lessons, so those mistakes will not be replicated in the next round. But they will not be given a chance.


What is it about this government that it so dislikes manufacturing? What is it about Senator Birmingham in particular, who shows no empathy for the workers in his own state? I think one of the things you need to do in the Senate is bring your home game. You have to bat for your state. You have to bat for South Australian jobs—or, in Senator Carr's case, Victorian jobs—and, as a senator, for all Australian jobs.


But Senator Birmingham comes in and gives us about seven minutes of his time, not talking about the way to fix the problem, the way to go forward and actually get good Australian well-paid jobs and successful companies into our economy to build and grow our own home states. He talks about the alleged failings of the previous government, and then he spends a little bit of time saying, 'We have to make some tough decisions.'


You have to make tough decisions, but at least tell the truth. Are you changing the philosophy that successive governments in this country have had about building Defence capability, about building Defence warships, about building submarines? Are you throwing all of that out? Is the work of your predecessors, the contribution of those South Australian senators of the conservative variety who really did get this, who really did want to make South Australia the Defence state, all to be thrown out the window, Senator Birmingham, because you need to make a hard decision?


All government decisions are essentially hard decisions, but they should be made in the clear, cold, hard light of day, taking into account all of the things that need to be addressed. And very clearly what needs to be addressed in this arena is this audit report. It would seem to me that it is heavily weighted to those a bit further up the food chain. The problems are coming from people a little bit further up the food chain than the actual workers in South Australia, who go to work, do a damned good job, really take pride in their work, want their company to be successful, want their workplace to grow and want to achieve an outstanding result for Australia's Defence forces. The disgraceful fact that they are not even allowed to tender for additional work is almost beyond the pale.


Not to give Senator Xenophon too much credit, but he probably is a little bit on the mark here. Have they such a hatred for manufacturing that they told GMH to go away and now they are not allowing good Australian workers, good Australian companies, spread right across this country to even tender? They are not even allowed to put in a price. These are people who have actually done good work, who have learnt valuable lessons, who have only one motivation and that is to be successful at the job they are doing, in a successful company, getting a successful result for the defence industry.


This government should be ashamed of itself. It will not even allow people to tender in those circumstances. The workers in these places will hear Senator Birmingham's contribution, but they will treat it as nothing more than a speech about partisan politics. It does not address the issue. Look at the audit report, fix the problems and build these ships here.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (16:30):  I rise to address this urgency motion, in three areas. First, to just rebut some of the political points that have been made by speakers opposite. Second, to talk about some of the areas of shipbuilding where this coalition government is already taking steps to put shipbuilding onto a sustainable footing. Third, to talk about some areas of defence reform that we need to be looking at to ensure defence industry is on a sustainable footing into the future.


Firstly, I go to the political points. We have just had a speech from Senator Gallacher where one of his main points was that Australian industry did not get a chance to tender. Can I take him back to JP 2048, phase 3 of the Amphibious Watercraft Program, which was the only naval construction program for ships that the Labor government, under Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard, approved. And that was sent to Spain. I deliberately asked in last estimates whether ASC and others had the opportunity to be consulted, to talk about it, to put in a bid. Senator Gallacher is walking out; he does not want to hear this. What was confirmed by ASC was that they had no chance, that work was not tendered in Australia. The ALP sent that work to Spain, as opposed to allowing Australian industry to pick it up.


The other side of the argument, which the ALP do not like to recognise, is that when we realised a new icebreaker was required, they let a tender. In this case they put out an RFT and it included Australian industry. Two companies came back and said, 'Yes, we can build the ship, but it will be built overseas.' The Labor Party never even got around to funding it but nor did they require that that ship be built here in Australia. My rebuttal of the key argument around the fact that we have not allowed Australian companies to tender is not supported by the ALP's own actions when they were in government.


I hear Senator Xenophon's view around the valley of death and the impact on my own state of South Australia. I, like other senators here from all sides, am a passionate advocate of seeing good, high-skilled jobs retained in South Australia in manufacturing, as well as in other areas. Again, in estimates I asked the head of ASC about the time line for the project of their warfare destroyer and looked at the peak of the workforce, which is on us now—almost past it—and asked about the decision points that led to that. 


In 2005 the Howard government chose ASC to be the builder of the air warfare destroyer. In 2007 Navantia was chosen to be the designer of the ship. We are now in 2014. If we are concerned about a valley of death in 2016-17, then decisions had to be made years ago, not months ago. That is one of the key flaws in the argument from the opposition on this matter. Both speakers today have talked about the fact that the coalition has now been in government for nine months, so why isn't there follow-on work? It is because the time required from decision, and commitment to funding, to having people actually cutting metal and building ships is measured in years. Take the air warfare destroyer as an example. That is between five and seven years.


Why has the government taken the decision that the best way to get Australia onto a sustainable footing for shipbuilding is to look at the Future Frigate program? It goes to the issue of productivity. Unlike the comments from Senator Gallacher, the criticism is not of the workforce; it is of the enterprise as a whole. Whether you look at the UK, the US or Australia—even the Anzac program, which was correctly mentioned before, was very successful in Australia—the first ship is horrendously expensive. It happens in the US, in the UK and here. Over time, with enough ships in the fleet, you bring down that cost, which is why DMO, when they put together the Air Warfare Destroyer program. set a target of 80 man-hours per tonne, which is still 20 above world's best practice, but that was the target they set for the program. So they realised it would take some time to bring that target down. The issue with short builds—just one-off ships or maybe two—is that you do not get the chance with a new design to bring that target down. With Anzac, we did. Over time we brought that down and Anzac ships were being produced at a productivity that was better than world's best practice, better than benchmarks. That is where we can also end up with the air warfare destroyer. 


The government, by bringing the $78 million forward for engineering and design work, is allowing us to look at the option of taking the Navantia hull, which is being used for the air warfare destroyer, originally designed for a vessel to be a subhunter and, once that design work is done, to look at the integration of an Australian system, CEA's CEAFAR radar, and at the option of integrating Australian design and supported ship control systems like those produced by Saab in South Australia. Then we can start bringing forward the manufacture of hull blocks, because the hull is the same design as the platform. That means that we can continue to draw value from the investment we have made in infrastructure and, more importantly, in the skills of the workforce not only on the production line but in the design area. By building on that air warfare destroyer program for future frigates, over time we will drive that productivity right down and, like the Anzac class, to world's best practice benchmarks. That is how we put Australian shipbuilding onto a sustainable footing. Setting people up to fail and costing the taxpayer a motza in the meantime is not a way to gain the confidence of the public, the media or the parliament around shipbuilding in Australia.


How we move forward for defence as a whole I believe fundamentally comes back to rethinking how we look at defence industry. For far too many years across both sides of politics defence industry policy has sat separate to defence's capability planning. Defence, in their capability development manual and procurement approach, look at what they call the fundamental inputs to capability—the people, the organisational structures, the training, the equipment and the doctrine that is required. One of those fundamental inputs is industry. The way that we will put defence industry onto a sustainable footing is by not seeing it as a job-creation place, not seeing it as something that is there for its own benefit; we will put it there by saying, 'What does defence capability need over time?' Then when we take first and second pass decisions to government, built into those cases should be a clear articulation of the skill sets within industry, the manufacturing and repair capabilities within industry, that we need such that government procurement decisions are informed as opposed to saying, 'We want this particular piece of equipment and we will decide down the track whether Australian industry has a role.' That should be a fundamental part of our decision process as to what we will buy and how we will buy it.


One of the critical things to enable that to work is to overcome the objections of the central agencies when they consider best value for money, which at the moment looks at an off-the-shelf price and compares that to the price of the enterprise here in Australia. That is not an appropriate comparison. If you look at the work of people like Professor Goran Roos, it is very clear on a global scale—from work on things like the Anzac project, the Collins here in Australia, or shipbuilding in the UK, or KPMG in Canada, who have done good work—that for every dollar spent on a defence project, particularly something large like shipbuilding, the taxpayer, over a 10-year period, gets a substantial return. So the true value-for-money comparison has to be done on the 10-year return to the Commonwealth and to our society—all those spill-over effects or second-order effects in terms of training, other industry opportunities, improvements in quality. That is the comparison.


When you put that together with a defence capability plan that sees industry as one of its fundamental inputs, we then start to get to a place where we will have a procurement plan, a defence capability plan, that will look at sustaining the skill sets that Australia needs—not only to make sure that the men and women in our defence force have the very best capability but also to make sure that we retain the sovereign capability we need to make the decisions that are in Australia's best interests about our defence equipment and the skills of our defence and industry personnel.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-06-17,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:40):  What we see today is what we see every day in this place—the blame game unfolding before us and two sides attempting to outdo each other on who is less responsible for the damage being done to our nation and, in particular today, to our shipbuilding industry. I am not speaking in favour of this motion; however, the government should not take that to mean that I support the lack of clear vision they seem to have for our shipbuilding industry. The fact of the matter is that this motion attempts to chastise the government for not building these vessels in Australia in order to protect our industry from the valley of death. However, my understanding is that building two supply vessels will only go a little of the way to saving the shipbuilding industry in this country. As much as I believe that we must build the future submarines in Australia, the way this government is going it will not be them who even makes the decision. Submarines are still years away.


What we need to be talking about today are other potential options—bringing forward the Future Frigate project, replacing the Armidales with steel-hulled boats built in our shipyards. We need to be talking about how our shipbuilding industry can be competitive on a world scale so we can also export. A strong shipbuilding industry does not simply rely on a strong skills base. We need to make sure that energy is affordable as well and that infrastructure at the yards has been upgraded and modernised to meet the requirements of the new multibillion dollar projects that are before us.


So, as much as I think today's motion is a cheap shot across the bow, I believe that this government must take all meaningful steps to help our shipbuilding industry to grow so that, when the time comes for the building phase of the submarine project, Australia will seem the most likely sensible option. What we need are long-term strategic decisions to be made and commitments with a 10-, 20-, 30-, 40- or 50-year vision—vision that was displayed by Ben Chifley with the Snowy Mountains project. We need to think of the abilities and skills that have been built up at the naval dockyards at Williamstown over generations and at the Australian Submarine Corporation in Adelaide. We need to be thinking about upgrading the slipways. Infrastructure such as this takes years to build and to design. It is not just about skills, as in the tradesmen; it is about the benefits to real people, communities and the nation. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:43):  I support the motion. I am concerned that the government's decision with regard to the procurement of these two vessels entirely from overseas suppliers without Australian industry being given the opportunity to even tender, suggests an approach to industry policy which we have seen reflected in so many decisions by this government to date. The most powerful comparison of course is the government's approach to the automotive industry, but we have also seen it in the food processing industry, in other transport areas and we have seen it in the statements by the Treasurer about his view that support for building industry capabilities is really a version of corporate welfare. We have seen it argued by the Treasurer that the government's job is not to level the playing field. There is almost an acknowledgement that the playing field is not level, but the government's attitude—the attitude of the North Shore Sydney bankers that run this government—is that governments should not intervene to level the playing field.


We have, essentially, an approach to industry policy which demonstrates a profound ignorance of the way in which manufacturing works and the requirement to sustain manufacturing capabilities in an advanced industrial country such as ours—an attitude that is not held by any other advanced industrial country. These are not the rules the Americans use. These are not the rules the Europeans use. These are not the rules the Japanese use. These are certainly not the rules that a country like China would use. We have this abstract notion that, somehow or other, Australia will not be able to be competitive or be capable of providing these industrial skills because of cost disadvantages or productivity or whatever the argument happens to be—it varies from place to place. But in essence there is a neoclassical assumption that, in a perfect competitive market, Australia does not measure up. That is, of course, nonsense, because, in real-world economics, the textbook theories of the university seminar just do not apply. In the real world, in terms of strategy and social and political constraints, particularly when it comes to defence procurement, those perfect competitive market scenarios simply do not apply.


This government is trying to suggest that our economy is not able to provide economic diversity in its way of life or its economic capacities and that we should concentrate on mining, tourism and agriculture—this idea that we can be a farm, a quarry and a beach. The reality is very different, because all competitive advantage is built. In every country in the world, that is how it works. You actually have to go out and develop the strategic capabilities. They come about as a product of real investment, real innovation, the development of new technologies, education, research, building industrial clusters and ensuring that the appropriate networks are in place so that you have the advantages that build upon experience. The reality of real-world economics is that, the more you do things, the better you get at them. This notion that we can somehow or other just go offshore and get, off the shelf, a major defence platform, and that will not have any real consequences for Australia, is something that I very strongly reject.


Last Thursday I was at Hoffmans in Bendigo. Hoffmans is an advanced engineering firm that has been attracted to Bendigo as a direct result of government support. It has taken over part of the Thales plant, which used to be ADI. It has renovated equipment and developed skills and is able to participate in the ship repair work that is so important for the Collins class submarine. There, on the floor—it was wrapped up, ready to be delivered—was the drive shaft for a Collins submarine, developed out of Bendigo. Those capacities are built, developed by a large number of people working cooperatively together to ensure that we are able not just to build ships but to repair them. Those capacities can only be developed as a direct result of government action and ingenuity and innovation to have the capacities of our workforce developed in Australia. Shipbuilding is at the cutting edge of science, technology and innovation. That is why it is so important—just like in the automotive industry—that governments invest in these capacities, so that we can constantly adapt, design new solutions to problems and ensure that we have the very best kit this country is able to produce and the skills necessary to ensure a way of life for many thousands of people.


I reject the notion that is often put on the other side, that this is all about job creation. It is about the development of this nation and ensuring that we can do things independently of other people, particularly in defence industries, in times of acute crisis, when we will not be able to rely on other people, when we have to rely upon the capacities in this country. That is why I find this attitude so extraordinary, where the government tries to suggest, 'Oh, we'll look at it in the future; we'll try to do something in the future.' When they had the decision before them, they took the option to offshore the jobs, offshore this particular contract, rather than saying, 'As part of the ongoing process, we need to develop the capacities in this country so that we have the skills and the technological applications to do the things necessary for this country and, in times of real crisis, we can sustain them.'


We know how innovative shipbuilding is. We know that the manufacturing sector benefits enormously from it in skills development, new applications, new discoveries and high-performance capacities. It can only do that if the Australian government works with industry to ensure that those skills are able to be developed. I take the view that this government essentially wants to turn its back on manufacturing. This government has a notion, in terms of the model economic theory, that it does not really matter. That is a position which essentially is economic vandalism. If the government were genuinely committed to our naval strategic plan, we would be in the business of ensuring that these crucial industries were developed so that the skills were kept in Australia. This is the attitude—this reckless North Shore Sydney merchant banker attitude—that cost us the automotive industry. This is the attitude where the government has turned its back on food processing. This is the attitude where the government now seems to be in the process of turning its back on advanced ship manufacturing and ship repair. It is to the long-term detriment of this country that such an attitude is pursued by this government, and it is not just— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:52):  Where, oh where was Senator Carr when as industry minister in the last government he presided over the greatest decline in manufacturing that Australia has ever seen? The man you have just been listening to, with all those fine words about developing Australia's capacity in manufacturing and in defence procurement, was the minister in charge of manufacturing when Holden, heading towards bankruptcy, shut down, and when Ford shut down, when manufacturing across Australia went overseas because the then government completely priced Australian manufacturers out of the game with their carbon tax, their mining tax and all the other taxes. Where were Senator Carr's fine words when he was the minister able to do something about it?  Where was Senator Carr when his government singlehandedly destroyed what had been, for 20 to 30 years, a very vibrant, successful and prosperous shipbuilding industry in Cairns?


I know Senator Carr has a thing against Cairns. Just last week he slagged off at James Cook University of Townsville and Cairns, saying it was not a university capable of doing good research work and saying the grant for the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine—a world-class facility—to build upon JCU's world-class reputation in tropical research, was 'pork barrelling'. If anyone were inclined to believe anything the previous speaker said, they should just look at his attitude towards Townsville and Cairns in the university area. More importantly, they should look at what Senator Carr did when the Labor government in Queensland and the Labor government in Canberra shut down what had been a very successful shipbuilding industry in Cairns.


Senator Carr comes in here and sheds crocodile tears over the demise of the shipbuilding industry, but where were you, Senator, when you could have done something about it? Where was your colleague Senator McLucas when the Australian shipbuilding industry in Cairns was brought to its knees by a deliberate decision of the Labor government in Queensland and the Labor government here? Perhaps I am wronging Senator Faulkner who was at the time the defence minister because I know that Senator Faulkner was prepared to sign the contract for Cairns to build certain sections of the hulls of the air warfare destroyers—the shipbuilding work which the 'southern rust bucket states' are currently experiencing difficulty in building. Cairns was going to be part of that and on the eve of signing the contract with North Queensland Engineers and Agents, the company which had built the patrol boats and had built survey craft and had done a lot of shipbuilding work, the Queensland Labor government pulled the rug out from under them, withdrawing the bond it had been asked to pick up, a lousy $20 million. And did we hear one squeak from Senator Carr when that vibrant shipbuilding industry was sent to the wall? There was not a word from Senator Carr and regrettably not a word from Senator McLucas, who claims to be based in the City of Cairns, where this very vibrant shipbuilding industry was based. I would love Senator Carr to explain why, despite all the fine words he has just delivered in support of Australian manufacturing, he did not put his words into action when he was the minister and could have done something about it. And where was Senator Carr when the Cairns shipbuilding industry, which employed lots of skilled workers in the shipbuilding trade, had the rug pulled out from under them by the Queensland Labor government and by the federal Labor government?  It is okay to get up here in the chamber and deliver all these fine words about what should be done with shipbuilding in Australia and what should be done with manufacturing, but Senator Carr, who just spoke on those things, was in a position to do something about it. He was the minister who, as I said, presided over the greatest ever downturn in the manufacturing industry in Australia. So how can anyone take any notice of what Senator Carr has said?


I say to Senator Madigan that he would be pleased to see that this government has brought forward the proposals to get proper drawings done for the Pacific Patrol Boat program and some other shipbuilding work, things which the previous Labor government should have done but did not get around to doing. Senator Madigan, you should be congratulating Senator Johnston and this government for what they have done in relation to getting some work for the Australian shipbuilding industry. I conclude by again asking Senator Carr: where were you when you could have done something about it? Where were you when you singlehandedly destroyed the Cairns shipbuilding industry? And where was Senator McLucas, a Cairns based senator, when she could have done something to help the Cairns shipbuilding industry?


I have a few seconds to go but I may stop now. I suspect people have not come into the chamber to hear my oratory. I finish this speech with some sadness in acknowledging that it precedes what I know will be a fine speech from a fine Australian, a fine Queenslander, a guy who has done so much for all Australians. It is a great pleasure to be a colleague of Senator Boswell's and to be in the Senate to hear what I know will be a magnificent valedictory speech.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2014-06-17,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (17:00):  Parliamentary service is a privilege. I will have served 31 years and 118 days when my term expires on 30 June. Hansard notes that I have made over 1,100 contributions. Now is the time to dismount and hand over the reins. I have enjoyed my time in parliament, every minute of it. I have enjoyed the friendships I have made on both sides of the House.


Everyone comes into this place with the very best of intentions to do their best for this nation. To be part of this great Australian institution, the federal Parliament of Australia, is an absolute privilege and honour—to represent Australians from all walks of life. While it is a privilege, it is also a great responsibility.


I have always tried to represent the people who have elected me. In my first speech on 25 May 1983, I committed to being a voice for small business, primary industry and family values. I believe I have kept my promise and stood by those commitments. It is important to have these views heard loud and clear in this parliament.


I have faced the people seven times, running on a separate ticket, going for that third and last conservative position. It was only the last time I ran that I had the luxury of a joint Senate ticket. Having to pick up that third conservative seat focuses the mind on representing your constituents and delivering for them.


Small business is the heart and soul of Australia's have-a-go, egalitarian society. Farming and fishing are small businesses, too, even though they have some extra, unpredictable factors like weather and world prices thrown in.


I understand small business. I believe this has stood me in good stead throughout my parliamentary career. I was an agent representing manufacturers from the southern states. My original contact with the parliamentary process came when deregulation of trading hours was being debated in Queensland in the early eighties.


I was asked by 16 retail peak bodies—pharmacies, butchers, grocers and others—to take a deputation to the Premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, to oppose the deregulation of trading hours. We told the Premier that deregulating trading hours would destroy small business, would destroy country towns and would destroy family life.


To make my point, I said: 'Premier, if you un-restrict trading hours, these people will have to work on Saturdays and Sundays. They won't have a family life, and they won't be able to go to church on Sunday.' His reply was clear: 'That would be a desecration of Sunday.' He said it would never happen while he was Premier, and it never did.


After that delegation, I was the contact point for small business, representing them at a state level. That deputation of 16 retailers eventually led me into successfully running for the Senate in 1983.


I do not have a formal degree, but there can be no better qualification for serving in parliament than actually having run your own business. The microbusiness of R Boswell & Co employed nine and taught me how a business must run, to keep control of spending, the interaction between staff, good times, hard times, making sales—because that keeps your staff in jobs. It was a great training ground.


Because I understood it so well, I joined many fights in this place and battles on behalf of small business. Labor Senator Chris Schacht and I successfully amended the Trade Practices Act so you could not substantially lessen competition in a substantial market. That amendment changed the face of business in Australia. It was a big win for small business.


There is much more work to be done on the competition policy. The coalition has established a review with wide terms of reference. Small business will be making strong submissions, as will the dairy industry and other primary industries.


Recently, Woolworths were reported to be trying to pass costs on to fruit and vegetable growers to fund Woolworths' Jamie Oliver TV advertising campaign. This is the sort of thing the ACCC should have the power to investigate. It is wrong for Woolworths to demand growers pay Woolworths' advertising bills. The ACCC must be given the legislative teeth to balance market power and assess the claims made by food processors, farmers and other contractors. It must be given the teeth to take court action under section 46, on the abuse of market power—something it has never had. Also, we must have an 'effects test': that is, based on the effect of anticompetitive behaviour, rather than trying to prove intent. I wish I was going to be here to drive that debate.


I know that Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Business, is going to receive a buffeting on these issues from big business and their friends—but he has to stay strong, stay the course, and continue to stand up for the rights of small business, and I am confident he will do so.


Just last month, the major chain stores were pressing on with their everlasting quest to further deregulate trading hours, this time under the pretext of helping the federal government reduce red tape. I told the party room that trading hours are a state issue, nothing but tears for us and to keep well and truly out of it.


A strong voice in the party room is so important. This is the advice I always give new parliamentarians. You must speak up in support of your cause in the party room. Drive the debate in the party room.


One of the hardest battles I ever successfully fought was to maintain pharmacies as standalone businesses—owned and operated by pharmacists—and not incorporated into supermarkets. Recently I had to remind my Liberal colleagues in the joint party room of the statement of their founder, Sir Robert Menzies, in 1970. He said: 


Australian Liberals are not the exponents of an open go, for if we are all to have an open go each for himself and the devil take the hindmost, anarchy will result and both security and progress disappear.


Just keep remembering it. These are prophetic words. The Liberal Party founder was saying that deregulation is not the answer to all problems and the free market will not always produce the best outcomes.


Let me talk a little bit about primary producers, the backbone of the National Party and people of whom I am so fond. They include farmers and fishermen and others who represent the very best in Australian character, physically courageous, battling the elements and the unforgiving environment and prepared to work hard in remote locations to create wealth for the country. These people reflect the true Australian spirit of taking a risk, having a go and persevering when times are tough. Working with my colleagues, we have had some great wins for regional and rural Australia. I think of telecommunications, Roads to Recovery, sensible management of marine parks, work on behalf of the sugar, banana, ginger, pineapple and tobacco growers and helping beef producers retain control of sustainability issues.


A highlight of my career—and something that benefits everyone living in rural and remote areas—was bringing modern telephone, email and internet services to the bush, services on a par with those in the city. I was reminded recently of the importance of telecommunications in the bush. Sadly, someone I knew was killed in a car accident on a remote stretch of road in Queensland. However, the other occupants of the vehicle, some of whom were hurt, were able to telephone for help. Getting a telephone signal would have been impossible in that part of Queensland 15 years ago. 


On marine parks, a major achievement recently for the coalition was to reverse Labor's and the Greens' planned bans on fishing in 2.3 million square kilometres of water in 40 new marine parks right round Australia. This was a huge win that saved literally thousands of jobs. Under their plan, from 1 July, just a couple of weeks from now, not only professional fishermen, and some are in the gallery, would have lost their livelihoods but also charter-boat operators, tackle shops, seafood processors, wholesalers, ship's chandlers, repair facilities, and other suppliers of goods and services. Prior to the September election, I worked closely with professional and recreational fishing groups, especially the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation and its CEO, Allan Hansard. Guided also by my colleague Senator Richard Colbeck, the Liberal-National coalition developed a policy to keep the marine parks but remove the fishing bans till scientists could take a sensible look at how these parks should be managed. In government, we kept our promise and have removed the fishing bans. I am enormously proud of that achievement. 


I have always opposed the destructive behaviour of powerful, well-funded local and international environmental activists. They make their living by frightening people into believing that the environment is being threatened one way or another by the activities of our farmers, fishermen, miners or even Aboriginal communities. I am proud to say I have given the 'big environment' groups a bloody nose on more than one occasion. This includes maintaining Aboriginal access to minerals and other resources in Cape York by standing side-by-side with people like Noel and Gerhardt Pearson and Richie Ahmat to stop World Heritage and Wild Rivers legislation on Cape York. I share their aspirations to see a strong future for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Far North Queensland, on their own land, and not force them to be welfare-dependent. I am enormously pleased and proud that this very morning the Federal Court of Australia found the Wild Rivers declarations for the Archer, Lockhart and Stewart Rivers were invalid. This is a magnificent victory for the Aboriginal people of Cape York. This process began in 2009 and 2010 with questions on notice and a Senate inquiry that exposed the lack of due process by the then Labor government in Queensland, and provided material for the successful court action. It is a great demonstration of the effectiveness of the Senate system. I worked closely on this issue with Terry Piper from Balkanu. I welcome Terry and Richard Aiken, Chairman of the Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation, to the gallery on what has been such a wonderful day for them and all the Aboriginal people of Cape York. 


I am also proud of having helped keep the beef industry out of the clutches of World Wildlife Fund and other environmental activists. Don't have any doubt: the World Wildlife Fund wants to ultimately control how seafood, timber, beef and every other primary product is marketed in Australia and round the world. I have detailed their schemes before and won't repeat them now. My Queensland colleague Senator Barry O'Sullivan shares my deep concern about the activities of WWF. Together, we were able to drive debate on this issue, engage the rural media and alert cattle producers to the threat they faced. It gives me enormous satisfaction to have seen beef producers get together on 23 May and begin to develop their own industry-driven program to verify sustainability of Australian beef. This will mean our red meat customers won't have to go to organisations controlled by the WWF to verify sustainability. This is a major achievement and a very important win for primary industry. 


I have always been a voice for traditional family values and a defender of the unborn. I have stood up for these values in debates on issues such as abortion, RU-486, stem cell research, pornography and euthanasia. Politics is an honourable calling but will remain so only if politicians have the courage of their convictions. In 1988, I tackled the League of Rights, a far-right-wing, anti-Semitic organisation I saw as trying to exert influence over the churches and other areas of society 


For me, this was a defining moment: to be taken seriously, you have to stand for something. In the fight of my life, against Pauline Hanson, I risked everything to stand up against her aggressive, narrow view of Australia. Defeating Pauline Hanson and One Nation in 2001 has been my greatest political achievement.


I will now say something about the National Party. The Nationals are as important as ever in representing rural and regional Australia and small business at a time when primary industry is playing a vital role in sustaining the Australian economy and jobs. I have been a proud member of the National Party since 1970. I have been loyal to them and they have been loyal to me. Loyalty is a hallmark of the National Party. It comes from that time-honoured tradition of helping your neighbour when things are tough—and its spirit carries through to today. It was the National Party that the farmers, fishermen and miners called on last month, when the diesel fuel rebate was under threat, in preparation for the federal budget—and under threat it was; believe me, there was no subterfuge about it. The rallying call went out to the National Party from the mining industry, the farming industry and the fishing industry—and the diesel fuel rebate stayed.


While there have been great achievements in the past three decades, there is always more to do. Each of us in this place steps in, and out, on one page of a continuing history; it is for others to write the future. There is still much to achieve; the job is never-ending. For example, we have to ensure that independently owned post offices receive enough income to maintain the vital community service they provide. We must abolish the carbon tax and the renewable energy targets. I was the first member of the coalition to speak out against the carbon tax. I believe also that RETs are costing Australian jobs; you cannot have a manufacturing sector if you have high energy costs.


I am handing over the reins to Senator Barry O'Sullivan and Senator-elect Matthew Canavan, who is in the gallery, to carry on. I am confident they will represent the enduring principles espoused by The Nationals for more than 100 years. I know they will provide a strong voice in the party room and in parliament. They have big shoes to fill—Earle Page, Doug Anthony, Flo Bjelke-Petersen, ""Black Jack"" McEwen and many others—but I believe they are up to the job. The party has been written-off more than once but it endures because it is needed. I have tried to mentor new members in the Senate and prospective candidates because, good or bad, there is no teacher like experience. On reflection, one of the things that has given me the greatest pleasure is seeing Barnaby Joyce emerge as a statesman, a fine minister, a future Leader of the National Party and a future Deputy Prime Minister.


One of the great joys of being in this place has been working with my fellow members of parliament. There are too many colleagues, past and present, to mention them all. However, it has been a special privilege to work with former leader John Anderson, with whom I remain great mates, and with our current leader, Warren Truss. Warren shouldered the burden of leadership at a very difficult time for this party and has done a wonderful job. It is a feature of Warren's leadership that he allows vigorous party room debates, another tradition in the National Party, and he has the total loyalty and respect of everyone in the party room.


I must single out John Howard. In delivering gun control, he took the most courageous action I have seen in my time in politics. Every time I hear about another gun massacre in America, I know that bringing in those gun control laws was the right thing to do and I give thanks for his courage and leadership. He also understood small business and the ethos of the bush. John Howard was the best Prime Minister the Nationals ever had.


I have also enjoyed working with senators on the other side of the chamber—people like John Button, Peter Walsh and Chris Schacht—and, on the crossbench, Brian Harradine, John Madigan and Nick Xenophon. For 18 years, I had the privilege of being Leader of the Nationals in the Senate. This position gave me enormous leverage to achieve things for regional and rural Australia. The role is now being ably filled by Nigel Scullion. Nigel has a real feeling for his role as Minister for Indigenous Affairs and is doing a wonderful job.


Parliament has been like a second home to me. We spend approximately five months of the year here, and the parliament has been made more hospitable and homely by the officers and staff. Whether they be Comcar drivers, library staff, clerks, committee staff, Hansard reporters, attendants or dining room staff, they all give their very best to make our life as easy as possible.


I also want to pay tribute to another group of people who play an essential role in parliament and, in fact, an essential role in the protection of a transparent and vigorous democracy, and that is the media. I have known many journalists in my three decades in parliament and they have been thoroughly professional. At this time, when some of the icons have left and others are approaching retirement, I say to those journalists coming through that they have a great tradition to uphold.


No parliamentarian is ever successful without personal staff who are completely dedicated and committed to the cause. I have been particularly fortunate in the people that have worked with me over the years. Joanne Newbery started with me in the first year and remained for 23 years. She was a great speechwriter, tactician and friend. In fact, she did the work on the Wild Rivers. Prue Regan was another one who started with me when I began. She was a solicitor, she was able to interpret legislation, and did some spectacular work. Prue's maiden name was Page. Her grandfather was Sir Earle Page, the first leader of the Country Party. The National Party is in her DNA. My present staff are here in the advisers' box. They are all great people who have worked really hard because they believe that, through parliament, changes can be made. I thank Lisa Gambaro, Yvonne Tran, Martin Bowerman, Geoff Harrison and Peter Newbery for the wonderful friendship and hard toil they have put in.


I want to give particular acknowledgement to Mike and Pam Tyquin in the gallery. Mike helped me establish my own manufacturer's agency business all those many years ago, and he helped me again in a tight campaign with those famous roadside signs: 'Ron Boswell. He's not pretty … but he's pretty effective.' I would never have got here without Michael.


I also want to acknowledge David Goodwin, Isaac Moody and Damien Tessman. They are all here tonight with their families. I believe their time will come and they too will represent the people of Australia in this parliament.


I especially want to acknowledge my gratitude to Lady Flo and the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, both great Queenslanders. Sir Joh did so much for Queensland, including building up the mining industry and getting rid of death duties. They both displayed complete support, loyalty and friendship to me throughout my political career.


My wife, Leita; my daughter, Cathy, and her husband, Kent; and my grandchildren Sophie and Will are all here tonight. Cathy, Kent, Sophie, Will and my other grandson, Tom, are the delight of our lives. Thank you, Leita, for the wonderful support you have given me. You were always there to encourage me, to lift me up when things went wrong. I always looked forward to coming back to a peaceful, tranquil home after weeks in parliament, travelling or campaigning. I could never have got to the Senate, nor remained here as long as I have, without you.


Someone who is not here tonight is our son, Stephen. He passed away when Leita and I were on a parliamentary trip to Taiwan. He was proud of me being a senator and we miss him every day. We wish he could be here now.


In the Senate, I have always sought guidance and help from my God, and I acknowledge He has always had a guiding hand on my career. In the parliament of Australia, in the assembly of His people, I have always received constant help, and I offer my thanks.


Ultimately, politics is about the power to endure. I go from this place undefeated, at a time of my own choosing, the sixth longest-serving member of the Senate.


I will end with these words of Saint Paul: 'My time of departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have run the race. I have kept the faith.' Thank you very much. God bless and goodbye.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (17:29):  Almost two decades ago, I entered this place. Not for a moment have I regretted that decision. Everything about this place—its history, its culture, its officials, its very special place in our parliamentary system, the engagement with colleagues from all sides, and the committee system—have combined to make it a workplace like no other. I am privileged to have played a part.


Let me turn to some of the more personal aspects of my time in Canberra. Firstly to my wife, Fran Marsh, who has served every moment of the three Senate terms with me. She mostly served her time in Perth, working as a lawyer and raising our two daughters, Gabrielle and Georgia. Fran did an excellent job, and the girls have matured into beautiful, intelligent, well-balanced, capable young women, knowing they have been well parented and loved. This December I will be attending Gabrielle's graduation from the ANU—the first such ceremony during the girls' education that I have been available to enjoy and, more importantly, to attend. Western Australians are used to fly in, fly out parents but a term of 18 years has been a big ask. Fran has accepted and answered the call on all fronts. I thank her for the love, the support and the patience. 


We live in the federal seat of Curtin, and our girls attended a local school. It was common knowledge at the school that one of their parents was a politician working in Canberra. After continual queries they finally agreed that, yes, they were Julie Bishop's daughters. Playing that card allowed them to bask continually in the glory from whichever side was in government. Seriously, though, it will not be news to anyone in this chamber to hear that all time in politics is served by the entire family—particularly so out of Perth, Western Australia, the most remote capital city in the world. 


Next I wish to express my thanks to those staff who have served with me. As you all know, politicians do not work in isolation. I am very pleased to say that most of my staff were 'stayers'. In particular, I sincerely thank Sheryn McLaughlin, Marie Dias, Marie Liau and Peter Reece, for their loyalty, dedication, patience, expertise and contribution throughout my three terms. There were others during that time of course, and I mention two, Amanda Dowling and Lydia Roberts, who had integral roles in my office. I thank them also. Again, to all my staff, I particularly say thank you for your patience.


For many years I worked on the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and, in more recent times, the Senate Economics Committee. For nearly all that time, the secretary of both committees has been Dr Kathleen Dermody. She is a remarkable woman. Her professionalism, expertise, counsel and support is exceptional. I signed off on many reports, possibly hundreds. In nearly all cases I explored ideas and came to conclusions after consultation with Dr Dermody. I value her input greatly and simply say thank you.


Colleagues, too many to mention, come and go as is the nature of our occupation. I have enjoyed working with colleagues and opponents alike. I thank those men and women for their contribution, their friendship and their support. I have just a quick word regarding Steve Hutchins, former senator from New South Wales. In his valedictory speech he relayed the story of telling one of his daughters that he was due to meet the Bishop at the Holy Grail. She remarked to her mother, 'When did Dad get so religious?' I have to confess that I too have missed our late night prayer sessions at the Holy Grail led by 'Father' Meldrum. 


Why federal politics rather than state? It certainly would have been more convenient going home every evening. My interests have been and are federal in nature, hence Canberra was always the destination. My work here has been in communications, veterans' affairs, defence procurement, trade, foreign affairs and, more latterly, economics. I took an interest over many years in two particular areas: military justice and defence procurement—a bit esoteric for most. These areas separately offered challenge, complexity, human emotion and the satisfaction of reform and justice. Sadly, I know that in the area of military justice, more public reform is needed. I see that military culture is changing. However, that change will not be complete until all of those senior officers and all of those senior NCOs who abuse their power are removed once and for all. We need young men and women to join the armed forces, confident that they are safe and protected and that they can advance in their careers without any fear of inappropriate treatment or behaviour from their peers, NCOs or more senior officers.


Some refer to the Senate in pejorative terms; as ineffectual and not of equal value to the House. The Senate accommodates a different facet of political life. I refer particularly to the unending committee work. Last week alone, I signed off on seven reports for the Labor Party. Next week I will deliver my final Senate committee report. It addresses, inter alia, the efficiency and effectiveness of ASIC. I thought my last six months in office would be relatively less demanding. However, while in the United States late last year, my Labor colleagues unanimously agreed that the chairmanship of that inquiry should be adjourned until I returned to Australia. Accordingly, the last six months have been hectic. I thank those Labor colleagues for their foresight and consideration. The inquiry has been fascinating and has captured public interest and a lot of press attention, and rightly so.


In some respects, the Senate committee system can be the final court of appeal. This report will engender close review of our entire financial services industry, the approach of major players, the utility of our public regulators and a new interpretation of the word 'inappropriate'. I commend that report in due course. The work of the Senate committee system will be fully on display.


Interests in the policy areas of defence, foreign affairs and trade require engagement domestically and overseas. I have led a number of delegations on defence matters overseas, primarily in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom. I have come to appreciate the high regard in which Australia is held in all of these countries. They value our growth orientated economic system, the ability to invest in business, the excellence of our regulatory system and our capacity to offer serious policy advice. Time and time again officials have taken me aside and expressed private thanks on the part of their government for our contribution in a particular forum.


It is little understood in this country the significance of thirty years of continuing economic growth, commenced under Hawke and continued under all governments since. We are arguably the richest country in the world, certainly on a per capita basis. Growth has come from reform. Reform came from ingenuity, discipline and a policy focus. In the not too distant future this will be a country of forty million people and a net capital exporter. That will impose a different set of demands and our response will need to be more outward focused and less selfish. That will be our challenge and there is no reason it cannot be done. Our views are valued. Our views are sought. This facet of our contribution is undervalued here in Australia. It is with pride I have led these delegations.


I now turn to my home state of Western Australia. A friend, a once friend of mine, used to refer to his home town of Badgerys Creek as the 'centre of the Western civilization'. He said it in all seriousness and could never understand everyone's outburst of mirth. Ironically, Badgerys Creek has since become the focal point for airport development in New South Wales and its fame has spread. Similarly, Western Australia regards itself in the same terms, in all seriousness and without the mirth.


Some have noted that from time to time I use strong language to express disapproval of some decisions of my federal colleagues. Those comments were never accidental. They were considered remarks because I fear too many in our party choose not to understand Western Australia and hence dismiss lightly legitimate concerns. Labor cannot be in government whilst it holds a mere three federal seats out of a total of fifteen—soon to be 16. The head start is too much. It is akin to giving a 30-metre start to your opponent in a 100-metre race. This is a development only of the last ten years. In 2001 the Australian Labor Party held nine seats out of 14 in Western Australia, 60 per cent of all available seats—a remarkable effort in a non-manufacturing state where the majority of the population works in mining or service industries. Those six seats were given away for free. The challenge for Labor in the west is to revitalise and re-engage on terms attractive to the Western Australian community. Views in the Labor Party are relatively homogeneous. It does not matter if it is Victoria or Western Australia. The political views are remarkably similar. However, community views in Western Australia are different to those on the eastern seaboard. Why is this? The answer is simple. The size, distance and wealth of Western Australia means community views gestate and grow in a different context. Labor in the west needs to embrace our federal system and accommodate regional perspectives. That is our failing. The west cannot be ignored in our quest to regain government.


In the last few months there has been a radical turnaround in the polls. I for one did not expect such a quick return to favour. The question is whether this return is permanent or just a passing fancy. The answer to that question is in the history books. In early 1996, we made some critical decisions to run away from a lot of the economic reforms of the previous 13 years. Successive decisions in those 11 years of opposition led us further from the grail of continuing economic reform.


Mr Shorten and our front bench have done very well so far, very well indeed, and I congratulate them. I believe mere noise and total opposition to any and all government proposals will be ultimately self-defeating. Soon we need to prove our capacity to be in government in the short term. I say unequivocally, let the major opposition party lead the debate and be the opposition party—isolating the rest. I hold to the view that the party or parties that control a majority on the floor of the House should govern in both places. The same principle should have applied for the last six years and the same principle should apply again when we again occupy the Treasury benches. I wish Mr Shorten and Senator Wong all the best to in their respective roles as leaders. They have earned their opportunity to lead. That is the politics done.


Now turning to my personal future. I led my first strike forty years ago. I have been an activist in the labour movement all that time. Fran and I will move to the Northern hemisphere for six months. Work, study, travel, leisure will be the order of the day but not particularly in that order. Then, upon our return to Australia in December or early next year, I will be resuming employment in the private sector. I understand that a few of my retiring colleagues have similar plans. We will be wise and silent men and women at a distance. I wish everyone well. It has been a privilege. Thank you very much.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2014-06-17,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:47):  Bish, it is with some deal of regret that we are farewelling you from this place, mate. My colleagues from all sides of politics would agree that Senator Bishop has made a significant contribution in his time in the Senate. I make my comments without any mischief, but, Senator Bishop, many on our side of politics were surprised that you were not afforded the opportunity of the front bench. Certainly, with your talents and the high regard with which you are seen on this side of the place, we were not sure why that had not happened. Your capacity has particularly been highlighted by your service as the shadow minister for defence. You have just touched on the excellent work that I and many of us watched for so long in terms of justice. Coming from a garrison town, I can guarantee you that the circumstances that you have driven have really changed the culture across the Defence Force, so congratulations. One only has to turn to your parliamentary web page to see some of the value of the contribution you made to various committees. If there were an award for contributions at committees, Bish, you win that absolutely hands down.


Mark, as a friend and as a colleague, I have enjoyed many a drink with the deadly duo, with yourself and Hutchie, at the Holy Grail. We had plenty of prayers together and I enjoyed them very much. I wish you all the best in the future. You are a true gentleman.


Senator Boswell, I rise not to farewell my friend and my mentor, Senator Boswell, Bozzie, because I do not think my friendship will change. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his career that has spanned several decades across several governments. There are a few things about Bozzie that are inexplicable. Whilst I knew Bozzie quite well, I can remember the first time I came to parliament. I arrived at some hotel somewhere. I was a fisherman, but I knew how to get here. I got to the Ministerial Entrance because that is the way I had always come. Nobody knew I was coming. I was coming in here to see John Anderson. I arrived at the Ministerial Entrance—nobody knew I was going to be here—and Boswell appeared at the door. He swung the door open and said, 'Nige, come this way,' and we went through security—the normal stuff that I would get used to. I never gleaned an explanation about how he knew that I was arriving at the Ministerial Entrance at that time. He sat me down and told me that this was such an important task because of the changes that I could make to people's lives.


Bozzie has seen many events in this place since he was first elected in May 1983, but at the forefront he has always cared about what such events meant for his constituents and for Australians generally. I will go on to talk about his career more specifically, but it is impossible to talk about the man without talking about his political side. To Bozzie, everything is political. It is political and it is important because he cares deeply about ordinary Australians and how decisions impact on their day-to-day life. Whilst he sees himself as ordinary, I can assure you that he is not. Bozzie's influence and impact on the fabric of Australian society should not be underestimated, even if he considers himself, as he is, a truly humble man. He is a man of conviction and he has always worked away quietly—I have observed somewhat more loudly—but always for others. This humility and authenticity is something that we as politicians and representatives in 2014 can learn from.


As has been indicated, he led the National Party for nearly 18 years in this place. He has been a formidable leader and his leadership has been informed by his conviction that we all have a purpose in making the world a better place. I refer to his speech in the Senate on 25 May 1983, in which he tried to capture the essence of the National Party. He stated:


The National Party of Australia can trace its origins back to 1893 when the circumstances of the day demonstrated the need for a party to look after the political needs of the small businessman, the struggling settler and the people who wanted jobs.


These values have been at the core of Bozzie's approach to his leadership even today. They are values that are as pertinent as ever. He has been strongly motivated to speak for those in our community he considers voiceless, taking up causes that are not always considered fashionable. Some of us may not have agreed with all his views, but it is difficult not to admire a man whose convictions stem from a place wanting a strong and better future for generations to follow.


Lest we rush to the conclusion that Senator Boswell is a man who can simply be characterised as conservative, his approaches have defied definition. For me, as for many of us here, he represents a real paradox. A social conservative but someone who is also a progressive, Bozzie has fought against the far right political movement in Australia, epitomised in the November 2001 federal election, when he refused to preference One Nation. He was able to compete directly with Pauline Hanson and retain his Queensland Senate seat and in the process removed the far right from the Australian political landscape—no mean feat. Bozzie's views on matters of race have always been informed by a basic sense of decency and fairness. When he believes in something strongly, he is truly an irresistible force.


In other areas, Senator Boswell has been a real warrior for family values. As he indicated in his speech, he has opposed human embryonic stem cells for research in Australia and advocated instead of adult stem cell research as a safer, pro-life way forward for this type of progressive science. In 2006 he secured a $22 million federal grant to establish a world-first adult stem cell centre at Griffith University in Brisbane. I have often wondered where Bozzie's inner strength and energy come from. I am convinced that he is driven by his sense of justice, because he is a man of deep faith. He sees himself a man for others, and all life is sacred.


There are few areas of national endeavour that Senator Boswell has not been involved in. In February 1998 he was chosen as the Nationals representative at the constitutional convention, leading the 'no' vote campaign for the referendum on whether Australia should become a republic in November 1999. As a counterpoint to this conservative stance, a decade earlier he campaigned to enable disallowance of mergers between large companies by changing the mergers test in the Trade Practices Act. Bozzie believed in promoting greater competition in Australian consumer markets and giving small businesses an ability to compete.


His other major contributions involved providing better communications for regional areas, enabling collective businesses and farms, campaigning against dumped and highly subsidised imported foodstuffs, providing exceptional circumstances funds for regional and rural dwellers during times of prolonged drought, securing assistance packages for the restructuring of rural industries like dairy, sugar and commercial and recreational fishing, and taking up the case for independent newsagents, service station operators, grocers, farmers, hoteliers and other small businesses in light of the growth of the large retailers. In this place he railed against the unions and academics across the other side who he considered did not understand small business. As always, he wanted to see the creation of jobs, jobs and more jobs, not, as he stated in the Senate, public sector pump priming.


I guess our bromance was really cemented in his support for commercial and recreational fishing. His indefatigable efforts contributed to the reversal of the proposed ban that would have locked out fishing from 1.3 million square kilometres of ocean around Australia. He urged instead for a rational and scientific examination of what was needed in marine parks to ensure genuine consultation. As ever, he was the voice of common sense and refused to bow to alarmism. That is his appeal; he is the everyman.


While in some areas, as I have already indicated, he was a social conservative, in many others I regard him as a visionary. When I first entered parliament he looked at me on that very same day and he said, 'I think you're pretty green.' He was right; I had an awful lot to learn. I have often spoken in this place about the importance of achieving reconciliation with Indigenous people based on promoting Indigenous business and industry. The way out of poverty for disadvantaged Indigenous people is real and meaningful work. But Bozzie was well ahead of me. In June 2006 he gave a memorable speech entitled 'Pathway for reconciliation' in which he said it all. His speech congratulated the Gidarjil Land Development Corporation, which was to take possession of Gaythorne Station. He also recognised Gerhardt Pearson of the Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation and Gay Voss from the AGL Petronas Consortium, involved with the gas pipeline project. In working together, Senator Boswell spoke of the group as achieving reconciliation of substance. I think it is apposite to read from that speech in 2006 which could just as well have been the current government's foundation on the way forward for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. He stated the handover of Gaythorne Station:


… is about not just handing land over but a workable future that goes along with it. Tomorrow puts in place the ability to forge a sustainable economic future for traditional landowners.


He continued:


Maybe if you're looking for a one word definition of reconciliation, you can look to ""tomorrow"" – one word that means a future for black and white Australians.


…   …   …


And hope can only exist where there is safety, education and employment.


Sound familiar? Today it would serve us well to go back to that fine speech, to reactivate that message of hope and reconciliation and to refocus on the government's current priorities that echo Senator Boswell's call to reconciliation of substance through getting kids to school, getting adults to work and creating safer communities. I know that every single parliamentarian in both houses would support those fine goals.


But it is Indigenous people themselves who have bestowed on the senator the greatest recognition for his work on wild rivers and their attempt to protect their rights to make decisions about their own land. In October 2013 Cape York traditional owners and Indigenous communities, along with Gerhardt Pearson and Richie Ah Mat, gifted Senator Boswell with a plaque calling him 'a champion of our people' for his work on the wild rivers. To appreciate how significant this gesture is one needs to understand that few white Australians ever receive such recognition, let alone a Nationals senator or member of parliament. It must be with some satisfaction that Senator Boswell was able to tell us today that Indigenous groups are celebrating the Federal Court win against development restrictions imposed by the former Queensland government's wild rivers laws. Again his efforts have achieved results.


Bozzie was never in this for recognition, that is for sure. I will share a short anecdote. It was a little bit like coming into parliament and not really understanding why I was there. I was involved in a Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I was in Timor and I was wobbling around exhausted and stumbled out of the jungle in a place called Vikeke. There were a few school kids running around. I put the pack on the ground, slowly recovered, had a few lollies and talked to the kids. Then I was talking to this guy who said, 'How's it going as a soldier?' I said, 'I'm not really a soldier, mate, I'm a dud, a fake—I'm actually a senator at home.' He said: 'An Australian senator? You built the school here.' I looked around and said, 'I don't think we did that, it might be foreign aid money.' He said, 'No, the Australian Senate built this.' I said I wasn't sure about that, but he went off, scurried around to a few blokes and then said, 'Senator Boswell.' I came back to Australia determined to work it out. 'Bozzie,' I said, 'what've you done? I went to this school and they reckoned you built it.' He said: 'Yeah, I did. My family and me invested in our future and built this school.' That goes to the stamp of the man, the sort of contribution that he is happy to make for others and have absolutely no recognition for it.


Before entering parliament, as we all know, Bozzie was a great salesman and he goes to great lengths to tell us that he was a manufacturer's agent, he sold paintbrushes, he sold rubbish bins to councils. I think he brought his sales pitch to parliament. He was an incredible salesman when he was here. Any of those who have been subjected to his 'We're going to do this' and who thought there was any other way would know exactly what salesmen were about. He remained faithful to his origins in keeping at the forefront of public debate the importance of small business and the independent retail sectors.


In his free time, of which there has been little, he has been a very keen yachtsman. There has not been a dull day when I have spent it with Bozzie. I would not mind a dollar for every time he said, 'Your mother only had to carry you for the nine months, Nige, I've had to carry you for 10 years!'—which would normally be the start of quite a long lecture about how I hadn't got it right. His MO since I have known him here is simply, when he comes up against any opposition, to just keep crunching at it until it crumbles. He is a Herculean political force.


I have another quick anecdote, and some in the National Party may recall this—it was one of those monumental Bozzie moments. We were gathered in his suite. He is not much of a drinker and he blames the fact he had a couple of sips of Scotch on my emergence in parliament, but we decided to have a scotch—if quite a few of the National Party people were around we would have a quiet scotch. There was a new bottle but, we discovered, no ice. So Bozzie said, 'Well, let's get some ice!' So Paul, the staffer at the time, rang the Hyatt and went to get some ice while we continued talking. The Hyatt deposited a $5 bag of ice in one of those caddies, so Paul came in with a caddy to much derision from Bozzie: 'You blokes would never survive in private industry. I was a paint salesman. When I want an iceberg …' 


I thought that deserved a very well crafted bill to Bozzie the next day from the Hyatt—a very authentic bill for $450 for ice! It was going to be just one of those practical jokes that you play. The 'bill' went into his in-tray with the number to call for the Hyatt. Of course, it was my number, but I had forgotten that Bozzie doesn't use the phone—it was: push 9, 'Get me the Hyatt.' I arrived, after there had been explosions downstairs and panic calls, to see this fairly diminutive person from the Hyatt getting their ears pinned back. We settled it all down and Bozzie took it in absolutely tremendous humour—and I understand he still has that invoice.


I think it is only appropriate as well to acknowledge that Senator Boswell's achievements were as they were because Leita was always there. It is a partnership forged of many successes and also some of their sorrows. Their faith in one another and their ideals have seen them through ups and downs. Leita knows more than anyone that the reason Senator Boswell has continued to give of himself and his time to public life is because it is not really a job, it is a vocation—it is who he is. Leita has borne the sacrifice of having a partner who often belongs to Queensland, the National Party and sometimes the entire country. Sadly, I expect that in retirement not a lot of that will change. Helping and listening to others is just who he is, regardless of what position he may hold.


Bozzie, we will always miss your larger-than-life presence in this place. We have been honoured to work and serve with you. You so richly deserve to enjoy a fantastic retirement in good health, surrounded by your loved ones—Leita, Cathy and your grandchildren. I personally thank you for all your guidance, for transferring to me your great love of this nation and the National Party and your belief in a just and fair Australia, where people, no matter their colour or race, can enjoy the fruits of this country. Your legacy will endure in this parliament and beyond.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (18:04):  Can I start by thanking the Leader of the Opposition in this place for her forbearance in allowing the Leader of the National Party and me to speak first. Each senator who serves here adds something to the practice and debate and therefore every senator contributes to the good of Australia, regardless of the length of time they serve. Tonight we farewell two who have had distinguished careers and, if I might say, for a considerable period of time. 


I must say that 18 years does not sound much in comparison to 31 years, but 18 years is a fair stint and I will address a few comments first to departing senator Mark Bishop. He has been here for three terms and re-elected twice to represent the people of Western Australia. He made a worthy contribution to this chamber, especially in the fields of defence, defence personnel and veterans affairs, for which for a period of time he was the shadow minister. Like Senator Scullion I will not go into the vagaries and the dark art of how the Labor Party chooses its front bench in government, but I believe that you were a talent that was overlooked.


Senator Bishop gained the respect of all the senators, including those on this side. He was clearly a very strong advocate for his state, Western Australia, and was willing on the odd time to speak out against the party line in his defence of Western Australia, which of course is in the finest traditions of this place, the Senate, the states house. I am sure one thing Senator Bishop will not miss are the long flights across the Nullarbor Plain, to and from Canberra 


Senator Bishop, you were solid on some of the more important issues which we dealt with across the chamber. I simply say that I believe your replacement will share similar views in relation to those matters. I wish you every success for the future and thank you for your contribution.


I turn to Senator Boswell, a great senator, a fellow who is now the Father of the Senate and will continue to be so for only a few more days. Having served for 31 years, that clearly entitles him to the position Father of the Senate. He has seen six prime ministerships—I will not go into how many leaders of the opposition. He is the fifth longest serving senator since Federation. By any measure that is a remarkable parliamentary career—pretty good for a self-effacing senator who just says he is a humble paintbrush salesman. Senator Boswell always says that he is an ordinary bloke. Yes, he is. Can I just add a few letters before that: you are an extraordinary bloke. You really are. You have done yourself and your family proud by your contributions.


You are a wonderful colleague. The gallery bore testament to the sort of people that you are able to attract to this place to pay tribute to this your last speech. You had the fisher of men in Reverend Peter Rose, the parliamentary chaplain. You had the fisher of fishers in David Carter. And you had a whole lot of people in between, all anxious to be here to pay tribute to the wonderful contribution that you have made. I also note former senator Sandy Macdonald in the gallery, who I know was exceptionally fond of Senator Boswell. Sandy Macdonald provided me with a number of the one-liners that Bozzie used to deliver. The leader of the National Party provided the one that said, 'Your mother only carried you for nine months; I've been carrying you for years and years.' There was another one when he commented on Labor ministers who were in strife. He would say, 'Those whom the gods condemn they first turn mad.' In relation to his longevity as leader of the National Party he would say, with a few words deleted, 'But they still haven't realised that if they just keep voting for themselves I will just remain being leader.' He had a very good self-effacing sense of humour, but even when he had a cutting sense of humour to a colleague or those opposite it was the humour that was important—there was never any malice or ill will in the wonderful turn of phrase that this self-described paintbrush salesman brought to this place.


It is your character as well that I think has endeared you to colleagues right around this chamber but especially in the coalition. Will I miss Senator Boswell shuffling into my office demanding a question, and saying, 'Well, sorry, Bozzie, all the questions are already lined up—bad luck'? And he would say, 'But I've told The Australian. It's going to be on the front page tomorrow. It's got to be asked.' So the paintbrush salesman always got his way. One wonders if he employed those sorts of tactics to get pity when he sold his paintbrushes and rubbish bins. I do not know. But clearly you are very successful in every endeavour of your life.


Your speech this evening confirmed exactly the reason why you got into politics: you believed in things. You wanted to fight for things. You believed in people. You wanted to fight for people. Your first speech 31 years ago was full of that sort of content. Here tonight you gave us a whirlwind tour of all the ills of the world in relation to the ACCC, small business, fishing, farming, shopping hours, marine parks, the Greens, the renewable energy target, carbon tax—you name it, you went through them all. You touched on something else as well, and I want to dwell on this a bit. You did also dwell on your fundamental belief in the Christian faith and your commitment to the sanctity of life, be it at the very commencement of life or at the latter stages of life. In this place you were able to show to your colleagues the very importance of having a world view as a foundation for all your beliefs that then informed your moral values, and then how those moral values should be translated into public policy, into law and into regulations. That is why I think you stand out as a beacon amongst many of the colleagues here, because there was that consistency and there was that solid foundation. You knew exactly where you were coming from and what you were seeking to achieve.


You were one who wanted to change opinion polls, as opposed to some who are involved in politics who simply want to follow opinion polls. You did change the opinion polls. What is more, you also saw off from the parliamentary sphere organisations such as the League of Rights and One Nation. That took courage; that took guts; that took a belief that there were greater causes to be fought for other than cheap, short-term popularity. You did that so exceptionally well with great effect.


There are many Australians right across this country in all sorts of communities, be it in the Christian church faith communities, be it in the fishing industry, be it in farming, be it in the live export cattle trade. No matter where, you have friends all around Australia. 


I still recall one day driving with my wife on the east coast of Tasmania and saying, 'I cannot believe this. No, it can't be.' Sure enough, it was Bozzie walking down the road in a pair of shorts and a sloppy jumper. You would not believe the sight. I am completely jealous of his hair. If I had hair like Senator Boswell, I would be combing it every day—unlike Senator Boswell. I think it sees a comb once a week! It is a great crop of hair he has.


That aside—I distracted myself—Senator Boswell, in the few times you spent in Tasmania with Leita and my wife, there was no doubt about your sincerity. You are genuine and you are authentic. You have a love of family. You made a wonderful tribute to your wife, daughter and grandchildren. We all know about them because whenever we sit down with you it does not take very long for the conversation with you to turn to family and how very thankful you are for them.


Bozzie, on behalf of all of your coalition colleagues I wish you good health and happiness. You can look forward to 1 July when you can look in the shaving mirror as citizen Boswell instead of Senator Boswell and can be well and truly satisfied that you served your nation, your party, your coalition and your state of Queensland. Above all, you have remained true to your faith. I simply say: God bless.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-06-17,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:16):  We have had a number of speeches and we are going to have a number more, as we have a real changing of the guard in the Senate in the lead-up to the end of June. Tonight I want first pay tribute to my Labor colleague Senator Mark Bishop from Western Australia. Senator Bishop was actually born in Adelaide. He completed his undergraduate degree there. I have forgiven him for leaving town and going to Western Australia.


I think those who represent Western Australia—and probably the Northern Territory, but I often think of WA—do deserve special thanks in this place because I think many people would think that if they had to do that sort of travel from Western Australia then they would rather go into state politics or do something different. Senator Bishop did reference that in his speech tonight and said that the reason he wanted to go into federal politics and not state politics was that he was interested in federal issues. I think everyone in this place does make a sacrifice for the honour of representing their state, but those from Western Australia really do pay a very big price in terms of time with family.


As has been said, Senator Bishop was first elected in 1996 and was re-elected in 2001 and 2007. He has made a comprehensive contribution to the Australian Labor Party and the Senate during his 18 years in the chamber, although I have to confess I was not aware of the 'Holy Grail evening prayers' until tonight. I do note that his contribution has been extensive both as a frontbencher and in the context of an extraordinary amount of committee work.


There are four areas that I want to mark about Senator Bishop's contributions. Firstly, the enormously important work that he did in the areas of military justice and Defence procurement. He is a senator who understands Australia's place in the world and he has worked on the relevant committees. He is a senator who has a very good understanding of economics—and I want to come back to that—and he has been a passionate advocate for the state of Western Australia.


As Senator Bishop outlined in his speech, military justice and Defence procurement were areas that he had a great interest in. He certainly demonstrated that both as a frontbencher and in terms of his committee work. During the period in particular when he served on the front bench of the Labor Party—a time when Australia's military commitments were escalating—having someone like Senator Bishop to articulate Labor's support for our Defence personnel and for veterans was very important.


As has been said, he has given extensive service on those committees of the Senate and of the parliament. He is the Chair of the Senate Economics References Committee and previously the Economics Legislation Committee. Can I add a personal note here. As Minister for Finance and as the Minister representing the Treasurer, I was often grateful for Senator Bishop's intervention as chair when things might have got a little difficult in those committees. Certainly, I think as Chair of the Economics References Committee he made a very important contribution. As someone who has been involved in the economics portfolio for a number of years, I do want to say how much I valued the role that Senator Bishop played in this regard and the fact that he was one of the senators on Labor's side who I could turn to and say, 'We really need someone to speak on this issue and deal with this issue,' and he was able to do that.


In that context, it is also the case that Senator Bishop has been an advocate for economic reform. He again referenced that tonight in his contribution. There is a lot of merit in what he says. I am one who does believe that Labor must always be the party of reform, both social and economic, and that is not always an easy task. Sometimes we do better and sometimes we do less well, but maintaining that capacity and will to reform is an important part of what it means to be Labor. I thank him for his continued advocacy for that proposition and that fact.


As I said, Australia's place in the world has also been a focus of Senator Bishop's work here, particularly in the context of the Senate and joint standing committees on foreign affairs, defence and trade. I want to reference also, again, Senator Bishop's advocacy for his state. I was interested tonight to listen to Senator Bishop talk about times when he has voiced disapproval at his federal colleagues. He said it quite well. He said, 'When I did, it was always considered.' One of the barbs or interjections Senator Abetz often throws at me is that, unlike the Labor Party, the Liberal Party values differences of opinion. We do value different views; we just do not agree with demonstrating them on the floor of the Senate chamber in a vote. But whatever people's views, and whether or not they agreed with Senator Bishop, we could always count on Senator Bishop and others from Western Australia to put a view about the perspective of the people he represents—and has represented for 18 years in Western Australia. And that is enormously important for our party.


I was elected to this place in 2001. Over the period I have been here I have seen the shift in the voting patterns that Senator Bishop has described, and we do have a responsibility on this side of the parliament to address that. So I thank him for his willingness to engage respectfully on those issues.


In relation to Senator Boswell, Bozzie is one of the great characters of the Senate. I went up to Senator Boswell after his speech and said, 'The place really won't look the same without you.' I was reflecting, as Senator Boswell spoke, on his election in 1983 and I was trying to think where people might have been at that time. I think Senator Birmingham is one of the youngest; he was probably in primary school at that time. Would that be right? I was in high school and probably only just starting to understand something about politics in year 9 or year 10.


So it is an extraordinary period of service from that election in 1983 through to now. He faced the people, I think, seven times. It is meritorious service to this place and to our country. I assume also, given the dates, that Senator Boswell must be one of the last senators—if not the last senator—to have served in the Senate chamber of the Old Parliament House. Senator Boswell, that is, perhaps, a mark of the generational change that your leaving this place demonstrates.


There are many things that can be said about Senator Boswell. I think he had one of the best re-election slogans I have ever seen: not pretty, but pretty effective. I thought that was fantastic. I disagreed with it, obviously.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  I actually meant that I disagreed with the 'pretty effective' part, not the 'not pretty' part. Anyway, I am glad you took it that way. 


There were a number of things that you said in your speech tonight, Senator Boswell, which really resonated. One of them was that you have been a strong voice in your party room. There is no doubting that. Sometimes, frankly, we have enjoyed that and sometimes it has been more difficult for us. You have really taken the maxim that one has to be a strong voice inside one's party as a core political creed. 


Others have made more extensive contributions about Senator Boswell's service to the party and to the parliament, including his leadership of the Nationals in this place for some 17 years, which is an exceptional achievement, in itself. I want to focus my remarks on one aspect of Senator Boswell's career. He said tonight in his speech that politicians must have the courage of their convictions. I agree with this. Senator Boswell showed the courage of his convictions when he stood up against right-wing extremism. He deserves enormous credit for his stand against the far Right of the kind that was symbolised by Pauline Hanson. 


Others have spoken—as has Senator Boswell—of the long fight against the far Right political movement, probably culminating in the 2001 federal election, which was the election when I was elected to this place. That was when Senator Boswell vindicated his position by refusing to preference One Nation. Senator Boswell competed directly with Pauline Hanson—the woman who famously said that Australia was being over-run by people who looked like me—and defeated her to retain his Queensland Senate seat, again relegating the far Right to the political wilderness.


That was a time when many in the then Howard government were countenancing accommodating these perspectives. Senator Boswell instead took a principled stand against what Ms Hanson stood for. As a senator who represented Ms Hanson's home state of Queensland, and as a National Party senator with a particular connection to many of the constituencies that Ms Hanson sought to influence, this really did take political courage. I can recall that there were backbenchers, and even some frontbenchers, in his coalition party at the time who did not rule out doing preference deals. Senator Boswell faced defeat at the hands of Pauline Hanson herself in the Senate race of 2001 but he said that he would refuse, point blank, to swap preferences with a One Nation leader.


I say to you, Senator Boswell, that for this principled stand you deserve not only my thanks but the thanks of the parliament and of the Australian people. At a time when debates about racism and freedom of speech are still present in this country I think all of us would do well to remember Senator Boswell's position. I wish him well in his retirement.


I again turn to my friend and colleague Mark Bishop. I wish you and your family all the very best for the future.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-06-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:27):  I rise tonight to wish our colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator Bishop all the very best for the next phase of their lives. Often those in this place think a lot about the sacrifices that people make in order to serve the country. We all, from our various perspectives, reflect upon the things we miss. I share the concern you have, Senator Bishop, about missing some important occasions that you would have liked to be at. I hope you enjoy the graduation that you will attend and the time that you are able to spend away. 


I thank you for the work that you have done on committees over the years. Chairing committees is a skill that takes a while to develop and I think you have shown what it means to be an effective and diligent chair. So thank you for your work and good luck with your future.


Senator Boswell, you and I will disagree to the end on the environment, on the need to address sustainability and on global warming. But I do want to acknowledge the work that we have done together, particularly on biosecurity 


That is something on which Senator Boswell and I have shared a number of Senate committee inquiries in the rural and regional committee over many years. As I said to Senator Boswell, we worked together on bananas, on ginger and on a range of issues through that committee, and Senator Boswell and I shared a common view about the absolute need to protect Australia from incursions of pests and disease coming from elsewhere and the incredible damage that it will do not only to our primary industry sector but to the natural environment when we see these incursions get away from us. I think I can speak for both Senator Boswell when I say that we have had extreme frustration about how this has continued to get away from us in some cases. The rust that is now spreading across national parks in Queensland, in particular, is one that I feel very strongly about. I know Senator Boswell will continue to have a passion about biosecurity, as will we, because we will not look after our environment in Australia nor protect our primary producers without it. So I wish you all the very best, Senator Boswell, for your future. I hope you really do enjoy the time with your family and community henceforth, and the same to you Senator Bishop.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2014-06-17,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (18:30):  Firstly—and briefly—to Senator Bishop, I have not served with you here for any length of time. But, as your name has been mentioned amongst colleagues, they have treated your character with great respect. It is often when those conversations happen without you—and particularly in this place in opposition—that you can take that with you. You are very well regarded, and I wish you and your wife the very best. I can see that your service to this nation will continue through another prism, and I wish you the very best in your retirement.


Whilst I have so much to say about Senator Boswell, I realised that time would not allow that. So I have afforded my chance to speak to Senator Boswell's beautiful wife, Leita. Whilst it is my voice, it is Leita's words that we will hear for the next couple of minutes:


""Love"" was the instigator of Ron's life into politics spreading across some 50 years. It was our love for one another and our marriage that started the journey.


My father, Bill Beattie, was a fruit and vegetable grower, later becoming the then Chairman of the Fruit and Vegetable Growers. He was an active member of the then Country Party.


The very first political activity that Ron and I attended together was when Dad was awarded Life Membership of the then Country Party.


It was Dad and I who mentored Ron into the understanding, ethos and structure of the then Country Party. Now it is Ron who mentors others.


Ron joined the Country Party in 1974 and like everything he does became fully involved at every level. We both remain committed to the Party—although with a changed name, some 40 years on.


His passion outside of his immediate family, Cathy, Stephen and me and competitive yachting, was to advocate the needs of small business and fruit and vegetable growers to government.


With our blessing, he was a candidate for the 1982 Senate election, taking his seat in 1983 when Cathy was 15 and Stephen 13. Since then we've supported him on 6 separate occasions as a candidate for the Senate, and more generally with 15 Federal campaigns and 14 State campaigns. We truly were and are his ""true believers"", his cheer squad, and unofficial advisers.


Stephen as a young lawyer had a big role in helping Ron with his advocacy for small business. He explained to his father, the intricacies of the then Trade Practices Act—particularly Section 45 D—and the meaning of 'unconscionable conduct' in the context of small businesses.


Across the 31 years, we have not measured Ron's political life in the number of speeches, deputations, meetings, visits to towns and communities or the extensive advocacy work but in terms of our family milestones—exams passed, graduations, jobs secured, yachting, birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, weddings, the birth of three darling grandchildren, Tom, Sophie and William, and, the tragic loss of our beloved Stephen to Heaven.


Like all husbands and fathers involved in the Parliamentary Service of our State and Nation, duty frequently calls them away at the time of special occasions. And, there have been many such occasions when Ron was elsewhere and we wished he was with us.


Although absent, we knew that wherever he was in rural and regional Australia, whatever he was doing, it was a worthwhile cause. Likewise, Ron knew that the family always stood firmly behind him.


The political journey is ending—and for us, it is with pride in Ron's role as a Senator for Queensland. We, Cathy, Kent, Tom, Sophie and William and I, proudly, lovingly and sweetly welcome Ron home.


But, I suspect, that the inner eye of the champion and competitive yachtsman will espy another challenge. In this case I will not be the instigator. Whatever it is, we will love and support him.


They are Leita's words, Ron.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-06-17,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (18:35):  I too rise to make a contribution this evening. I firstly also want to acknowledge Senator Bishop and concur with the remarks of our leader earlier that he certainly does have our respect, and I wish him very well for his future path. But I just wanted to make a few brief comments about Senator Boswell—or Bozzie. I first came into this place nearly nine years ago. As new senators would remember, you come in and you feel a bit like, well, where is the tuckshop and where do I put my schoolbag, and you are looking to those around you who have been here for a while for guidance as to how you do things. Bozzie was larger than life and we knew that he housed all of the knowledge of the world for us newbies—or that is certainly how it seemed anyway—and we very much looked to him.


I remember one particular day. When I came in, I think Bozzie sort of knew my name. I think for a while there I was 'the girl from New South Wales'. But there was one particular day after I had been here for quite some time. All you really want is some respect from Bozzie when you come into this place, and the day I really clearly remember was the day he called me 'mate'. That was when I knew I had really managed to get myself into the Nationals Senate team, and it really was a beautiful moment.


It is very, very hard to say no to Bozzie. Sorry, I am not using 'Senator Boswell'; it is very hard to say 'Senator Boswell'. It is very hard to say no to Bozzie. I remember one of my very, very early joint party meetings. I am not going to talk very much about what happened in there, but we were discussing an issue relating to ethanol. This was in my very early days. John Howard was Prime Minister. It was a big party room. This issue came up, and Bozzie said, 'You're going to have to speak on this,' and I remember being completely terrified. But you just cannot say no to Senator Boswell, so up I got, and it was the start of many a contribution.


Bozzie mentioned earlier that he was the first to speak out against the ETS, and he was absolutely right. I know because I was sitting there. It was during an MPI on a Wednesday, and I was sitting in front of him. Bozzie stood up and gave this great speech about the ETS—at that point, I had very little idea of what he was talking about—and that started a path that changed the course of history. For that, Bozzie, we all thank you for your leadership in knowing that what you were doing was right. We followed you, and we won. Thank you, Bozzie, for that.


Continuing on the theme of it being very hard to say no to Senator Boswell, it is hard to say no to him not only because he is like a steamroller—it is very hard to say no to Bozzie, as my colleagues know—but because he is very, very often right. We had an issue in the early days of being in opposition relating to some carbon sink legislation that was giving tax breaks to the big end of town. Bozzie understood this. We inherently, because of Bozzie's knowledge and understanding, came to learn very, very quickly that he was absolutely right. With that, we had a piece of legislation that was coming in here—I think it was a disallowable instrument. One of the phrases that has not been used that Bozzie used to use a lot was, 'I'm blowing the whistle; we're going over the top!' Bozzie said that and we all rapped with him—Senator Williams and I did—and we actually voted with the Greens against the other major parties. I subsequently got sacked from the front bench. Clearly it has been a long way back—thanks, Bozzie! But, while that had very serious consequences, it was absolutely the right thing to do. It was Bozzie that first pegged that that was the right thing to do. It was a wonderful thing to follow and walk with him when he blew that whistle and we went over the top.


Bozzie, we can only aspire to change the course of the nation's history in the way that you have. Even if we come some small way to changing the course of history in the way that you have, we will all have done very, very well. We love you. We will miss you. But your legacy and your spirit will be here with us always. Thank you.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:40):  Firstly, I would like to associate myself with comments of other colleagues across the chamber who have spoken in regard to the valedictories of both Senator Boswell and Senator Bishop—and of course with the words of Leita. Thank you for your words too, delivered so well by Senator O'Sullivan.


To Senator Bishop: this place takes you in different directions, sometimes of your own choosing and sometimes by appointment and the direction of this place, so I have not had the opportunity to spend a lot of time working with Senator Bishop, although I have done some committee work. His committee work has been mentioned by other speakers and should be recognised because he has been a really hard worker in committees. But I think the thing that I reflect on from his presentation tonight and my experience of him in this place is that he was always thoughtful. It was a very thoughtful speech that he delivered tonight. As he said, when he has made comments around even how he sees his own party, it has been a well-thought-out process. I wish him and his family all the very best into the future—I think he should be proud of his contribution over 18 years—and all the very best in the next phase of his life.


To Bozzie: like Senator Nash, it is hard for me to refer to him as Senator Boswell because basically he is Bozzie. That is how we all refer to Senator Boswell. My first meeting with Boz was in Tasmania in January 2002, after the 2001 election, where I was first elected. Bozzie was on his annual sojourn to Tassie, and he also had to turn the sod at the overpass to the Devonport Airport—a new overpass that was being constructed. Unfortunately, Bozzie got his days mixed up. He had to make a real rush from his place at Bicheno, in Tassie. There were a lot of frantic phone calls, and every time we phoned him he said he was about 30 minutes away. Deloraine must be a very big town, Boz! It took you two hours to get through it! When he arrived, he was busily arranging himself, being prepared. He was very gracious at the turning of the sod, where he acknowledged the new senator-elect from Tasmania in Senator-elect Robert Corbett! We have resolved those nomenclature issues.



A government senator interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  It was close! What it demonstrates is that Bozzie has his own way of doing things, and I think that has been demonstrated by the presentations made here tonight. There is a Bozzie way. He said in his speech that you need to have the power to endure, and that is certainly a feature of Senator Boswell. Once he had the bit between the teeth, once he had the destination in sight, there was very little that you could do to divert him from the purpose. And that is the conviction that all of us have recognised in Boz. If he wanted to talk to you about something, there was no escape. He always found a way to find you, even if it was by pressing the button, dialling 9, and saying, 'I want Senator Colbeck.' There was no hiding. But he was persistent in his perspectives and, as Senator Abetz said, if he wanted a question up, he got a question up.


It is that persistence and perseverance and conviction that actually gets results in this place. So, Boz, congratulations on that, over a distinguished career. Senator Nash is right: we all love you. In fact, you've gotta love Bozzie. You just gotta love Bozzie.


I have really enjoyed working with you on a number of issues that were important to both of us. It was great to get results on things that were important. That is why we are here, to do things that are important for us but, more importantly, for our constituencies. You were always a great radar on your constituency and the people you came here to represent. You were always about getting results for them around the sensible use of our natural resources. I think that is a really important point to make. You were not about doing anything that was going to cause damage, but you wanted sensible natural resource use. You wanted to account for the people who were in those industries and to ensure that they had a fair go, along with all of the other considerations. So congratulations on an extraordinary career and to you, Leita and your families: all the very best, Mate, for the future. I look forward to catching up on the south island occasionally or perhaps overlooking the river in Brisbane. You have made a significant contribution. All the very best for the future.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-06-17,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:46):  Can I just pay tribute to Senator Mark Bishop, who has chaired the current inquiry into ASIC, which will report next week. Senator Bishop has done a magnificent job. He really got his teeth into it. He has done an amazing job in righting a lot of wrongs, to make things better for each and every Australian in the future. I wish Mark all the best in his travels and his new life. There is no doubt that he has made a great contribution in this place in the 18 years he has spent here.


To you, Senator Boswell: what an inspiration you have been. I had only been here for about three weeks of a sitting of parliament and I was made whip. I said to Bozzie, 'Bozzie, how long did it take you to learn the running of the Senate?' He said, 'I've been here 25 years and I still don't understand how it runs.' Those were great words of advice and it really filled me with confidence to take on the whip's job.


Senator Abetz made a point about when Bozzie wanted a question up. I was the whip and had to go to question time meetings. There was many a time that we had to jump the list and do what we could do for Bozzie to get his question up. And Bozzie was often very forceful when he requested a question. Others would agree. 


He had some great sayings. One day, I was sitting on the opposition bench and he said to me, 'Listen here, Wacka, you've got to lift your game. I've carried you longer than your mother has carried you.' I turned around and said, 'That is absolutely wrong. I've been here eight months and my mother carried me for nine months.'


To sum up Bozzie: true grit. He is like a bull terrier when he sees a problem. He takes it in his teeth and he will not let it go until that problem has disappeared for those people in rural Australia, whom he has represented so strongly. He is a man of morals and principles. All I can say, Bozzie, is I wish you and Leita and your family well. Thanks for your great contribution to this nation. The first thing I am going to do, Mr Acting Deputy President, is change my mobile phone number because I think that, when Bozzie gets out of here, I will still get plenty of phone calls. Good luck, Mate, and congratulations on a wonderful career.

 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:49):  My contribution will also be short because I know others want to talk and Bozzie has a jug presentation to get to in the National Party party room. I first met Senator Ron Boswell over a decade ago, whilst lobbying about higher education reforms. He will not remember this very naive National Party student president, trying to convince him of the ills of the coalition policy back then. However, I will never forget him waving his finger at me and giving me the rules of the land. And nothing has really changed! A decade later I arrive and I still get the finger in the face and a lecture every now and again, which is probably a good thing. 


As a daughter of a small business man, I did feel the negative impact of the big end of town. Thank you for all the work you have done for us and our kind. I, too, look forward to a positive outcome of our review of the Competition and Consumer Act.


To add to Senator Williams' comments, trying to whip Senator Boswell is like trying to whip fat-free cream. I had to get the dairy industry in there—I am from Victoria. A lot of effort, sweat and tears, no cream, no results at the end of it. But I guess after this time, he has actually earned it.


In addition to the question time no-show—it is in The Australian; I have to get it up—there was a no-show today, despite several requests to his office, 'Where is Senator Boswell?' When Senator Williams was whip, he would continually be on the back bench over there—he and I, making up the Nats back bench—doing the numbers on Wacka. If he did not get the question up, Wacka was going to be rolled and I was going to be inserted as whip. That threat was continually rolled out.


Another saying that I remember and you will probably understand the complete blank look on my face when he told me, a Victorian senator: 'McKenzie, you've got to pack in tight and ruck hard.' I had no idea what he was talking about and I know sport. I do now, because he has demonstrated it time and time again. A lot of the advice has been similar. Bozzie, you put the stake in the ground—that is what you have tried to teach all of us to do. 


I respect and honour your faith in God, your faith in your family and your faith in our nation. It has been repaid in spades, because I think many outside this place in Boswell they trust. We will miss you. We will miss your rants about policy, how the cake should have been better, our lack of courage and the carrying time taken to make me a senator. It is a job not yet done; I understand that. The other advice that you have given me, I will keep close to my heart and hopefully be able to fulfil over my time here. I thank you. I was listening. And God bless.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:52):  In my three minutes I will try to pay tribute to a collective 49 years of parliamentary service—firstly, to Senator Mark Bishop, who I knew at law school. He was involved in the Young Labor Club and at that time I was involved in the Liberal Club. It was a youthful indiscretion. Some people do drugs when they are young; I just did the Young Liberals. We had a mutual friend, the late Terry Connolly, who was then a brilliant law student and a great Australian who went on to become the ACT Attorney-General in a Labor government and passed away all too suddenly a number of years ago when he was a Supreme Court judge. That was our connection.


I got to be reacquainted with Mark Bishop some 25 years later in this place, not realising that he was in the Senate and not realising that it was 'the' Mark Bishop I went to law school with. I have enjoyed our many discourses on public policy. I particularly enjoyed a session during estimates when he called 'Order', which I think became a YouTube sensation, when he banged the table so hard that Senator Doug Cameron's cup of coffee or tea just flew off the table. That was a magnificent effort. I think it was the most watched estimates session in the history of this parliament. It was a great effort. I do not think it is fair to say that Mark will be retiring. He has too much to offer in terms of good, common sense advice. I wish him and his family all the very best for the future.


Now to Bozzie. I did not have much to do with this bloke for the first five years here, until we were bonded as a result of an issue, and the issue was the way that licensed post offices were being treated both in the bush and in the city. I have to say—and, Bozzie, I hope I can get away with this—that I thought, 'He's past his prime. There's not much there. He is lobbying me about issues.' That was until I got to know him. Bozzie, you were and are magnificent in your advocacy for those small businesses—in your passion and tenacity. You have lost none of it in terms of your sharpness and fighting for those individuals. It is great that Angela and Phil Cramp, who run a licensed post office, are in the visitors gallery today. I think it is a tribute. They came down from Wollongong, because you are fighting for them.


Bozzie, I do have some bad news for you. You are not going to change your number, because I am going to harangue you about competition law. There is some unfinished business, and this person on the crossbenches will be following that through. It has been an absolute privilege to work with you. I have actually learned quite a few things from you in the last few months. I wish that I had got to know you better earlier on. I have thoroughly enjoyed working together and the friendship we have developed. I wish you and your loving family—the family that you love very much—all the very best.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (18:55):  I often find valedictories are rather sad and I often do not like them. But I am happy and, indeed, honoured to be saying just a few words about two fine Senate colleagues this evening. Senator Mark Bishop combines an astute intellect and a high force of personality with a great sense of purpose. Whether it is speaking eloquently about Fromelles or a more pointed debate on the economy, Mark Bishop is a very, very fine parliamentarian. I have to say that he is such a fine parliamentarian that, if I were persuaded to join the Australian Labor Party—and, thankfully, for everyone perhaps I will not be—I would be on his side. He has been a marvellous contributor to this place for as long as I have served in it. I will miss Mark, his contribution, his passion and his force of personality.


That brings me to my coalition colleague Senator Ron Boswell. I will really miss Ron Boswell. I have learned a big lesson knowing Ron Boswell, and that is: do not judge a book by its cover. I had heard a lot about Ron Boswell before I ever met him. I had heard a lot about Bozzie in the way you have heard about the Abominable Snowman or the Yeti. I thought he was some sort of mythical ogre for a while—until finally he turned up, more than 15 years ago. I was quite taken aback. I am not sure how to put this. He has a rather well-worn look. Whether it be his hair or his ties or his personal demeanour, he is unusual for a politician.


But I soon learned that appearances can be very, very deceptive. Behind this ruffled, teddy bear look and this sort of bucolic bonhomie that he effects so beautifully lurks a committed, cunning and sometimes very curmudgeonly political operative. He knows how the game works. He said it before that he is not pretty but he is pretty effective. Anyone who worked with Ron Boswell—as you did, Acting Deputy President Bernardi in late 2009 to force a change in the coalition's policy on the ETS—knows how truly persuasive and effective he can be.


I want to join this rhapsody of regret at Bozzie's departure with just a very quick story. In the 2010 federal election it looked for a long time as though I would not win. About four or five weeks out from the election I received a phone call from Bozzie. He said, 'Brett, it's hopeless, mate. You're not going to win. You're shot,' and then he hung up on me and all I could hear was beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. About two weeks later—I suppose about three weeks before the election—I received another phone call from him. Bozzie said, 'Look you're hopeless and you probably don't even deserve to be re-elected, Brett; however, I might just have saved your bacon. I did it because at least you are probably a bit better than the Greens. I may have saved the day.'


Then, about three weeks later, on the Sunday morning after the 2010 election, I woke up—and I think it is fair to say I was 'tired and emotional'—and I looked at my phone and there were five missed calls. This was at quarter to seven on a Sunday morning, and I was not at my best. I thought, 'My God; who's rung?' It was Bozzie, five times. He had started ringing at a bit after six in the morning. I rang Ron back and I said, 'Bozzie, what is up? It's quarter to seven in the morning.' He said, 'Did you get elected? Did you win? Did you win? Did you win?' I said, 'Well, the ABC has projected that I will win.' He said, 'That's terrific. What happened?' I said, 'I got re-elected, Bozzie, on the final distribution of preferences, on Sex Party preferences.' I said, 'You worked pretty hard for those, Bozzie, didn't you?' He said, 'God, Brett, don't tell anyone!' I said, 'Well, it is all over the ABC website, Bozzie.' He said, 'Brett, there are only two things for it. You've got to do two things right away.' I said, 'What's that?' He said, 'You've got to ring up your mother right now and tell her you've been re-elected as a senator for Queensland, and then, when you've done that, you've got to go straight to church and beg God for forgiveness.'


Can I finish on this note. After 30 years of hard work on behalf of the people of Queensland, fighting for what is right, Bozzie said tonight the words that St Paul said to Timothy: 'I have fought the good fight to the end; I have run the race to the finish; I have kept the faith.' And the good Lord will surely nod and say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' Thanks, mate, and thanks too from a very, very grateful country.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-06-17,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (19:02):  I rise tonight to pay my respects to Senator Mark Bishop, whom I do not know all that well, but I have watched him and how he conducts himself, and I believe he has been a credit to himself and to the ALP.


I know Senator Ron Boswell a bit better than I know Senator Bishop, and I rise also to add my voice to the chorus of voices congratulating Senator Boswell on his time as a senator. For the past 30 years, Senator Boswell has been an enduring fixture in this place. He began his parliamentary career in the old Parliament House and has become this place's longest serving senator. The people of Queensland have elected him again and again—a ringing endorsement in what is the ever-changing game of politics. Thirty years of service, dedication and representation cannot be summed up or glossed over in a few minutes. I believe Senator Boswell can leave this place with his head held high, knowing he has made a contribution to the past, the present and the future of our country.


I do not agree with Senator Boswell or the National Party on everything, but we do share some common ground. I applaud Senator Boswell for his work seeking statistics on the number of abortions in Australia and for his fight to uphold the traditional definition of marriage, amongst other things. I applaud his efforts to expose the financial fraud of the wind industry. I applaud his work defending farmers, fishermen and Australia Post LPOs amongst others. The banana industry comes to mind, and his support and advocacy for it in the face of overseas imports, as does his work to establish clarity around product labelling and his work in the horticulture industry to secure a commitment to a mandatory code of conduct. With Senator Boswell's departure, small businesses, co-ops and farmers have lost an ally and a voice for those who have not got a voice.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  On indulgence, before we move to the next item of business, I would just like to take the opportunity to associate myself with the remarks about Senator Boswell. I have not had the opportunity to contribute to this debate. He is a fine exponent of the art of making the impossible possible.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-06-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (19:09):  I rise this evening to pay tribute to a fine South Australian who, sadly, is no longer with us. Mr Allen Bolaffi would be known to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, as he would be to Senator Farrell and to many other South Australians in this place.




Senator Farrell:
  I was to have lunch with him this week.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  As Senator Farrell notes, he was due to see him just this week. Allen's passing a couple of weeks ago was a most untimely event for a man who was living life to the full and had much still to give and to live for. Allen was a proud South Australian, a prominent businessman and community leader. He is rightly mourned and missed by many in South Australia and right around Australia. Like so many first-generation Australians, Allen worked hard and gave back to the community had became a part of. He was educated in Adelaide at Plympton High School in the western suburbs and then at the University of South Australia where he gained his accounting qualifications. 


Allen sought to give back. He worked hard and served as a multicultural leader in the Portuguese community of South Australia and, notably in particular, in the Jewish community in South Australia. He was involved in numerous Jewish organisations in Adelaide and across Australia. Allen can be proud of his family and he certainly can be proud of the role he played in establishing Adelaide's Jewish Museum, which provides an opportunity for all to explore and celebrate the rich history of Adelaide's relatively small Jewish community. 


Allen was a founding member of the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce, serving as its president in South Australia for the past 20 years. It was in this role that he became a particularly prominent South Australian, building the chamber to be one of the largest business organisations in Australia. It is notable that despite, as I said before, the small Jewish community in South Australia, he was able to build the chamber. It is a testament to his ability to connect and to establish the rapport across many different South Australian businesses and so many leaders in South Australia.


As I alluded to earlier, Allen was an accountant. My wife's late father, John Morcombe, worked with Allen when he was young. Courtney, my wife, pays particular tribute to and has fond memories of Allen, as does the whole Morcombe family, for his role in the early days of his accounting career. He went on to be managing partner of UHY Haines Norton Chartered Accountants. He was a director of a number of prominent South Australian companies. He was renowned for his generosity and involvement in many nongovernment organisations, in charities and in sporting organisations, and in his engagement with the political world to advance his policies and the beliefs he fought for and believed in so deeply.


Allen's passing was a deep shock to us all. It came very suddenly and all too early at the young age of just 57. He died from an unknown illness. His death came as a bolt out of the blue for his family and for those who knew him. He was fittingly buried according to Jewish tradition, in a humble burial at Adelaide's Centennial Park. The funeral was attended by hundreds of family members, friends and colleagues, many flying in from interstate to pay their respects to Allen.


In conveying my sympathies and those of my family to Allen's family tonight, I particularly want to extend our condolences to his mother, Yvette. As we have seen already in the Senate this afternoon, it is difficult for any parent to see their child predecease them. I also extend our condolences to his wife, Vivienne, to his children Reuben, Amie and Kate, to his grandson, Leo, and to another grandchild soon to arrive. I was pleased to visit them during the Shivah morning period. I know what a proud dad and grandad Allen was. I conversed with him over twitter, no less, after his son Reuben had been admitted to the bar. 


Alav ha-shalom, Allen. May you rest in peace.
