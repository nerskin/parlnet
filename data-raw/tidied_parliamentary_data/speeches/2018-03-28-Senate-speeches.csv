Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:31):  I table a document relating to the order for the production of documents concerning funding for the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. As minister representing the Attorney-General, I wish to advise the Senate of the government's position in relation to Senate motion No. 733. This is an order for the production of documents requesting the tabling of the KPMG report into the funding of the federal courts and the Ernst & Young costings in response to the KPMG report. You'd be aware that I have now tabled a response in relation to this motion whereby the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity over these documents. That is set out in detail in the response provided by the Attorney-General.


I can advise the Senate in summary, however, that public interest immunity has been claimed on the following basis by the Attorney-General. The reports have been and will continue to be relied on in future government decision-making processes on court structure, administration and financial arrangements, and their continued utility relies on them being treated with a degree of confidentiality. Input and advice to these reports from stakeholders, especially the federal courts, was provided on the basis of assurances that information provided, including sensitive and specific staffing information, would be treated confidentially. Disclosure of the reports would be expected to limit the extent to which stakeholders, in particular the federal courts, would engage fully future reports of this kind even if given assurances of confidentiality over information provided. This would result in future reports not being fully informed by full and frank advice and the government would not receive the most comprehensive advice from its portfolio departments and agencies. For these reasons, the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity over the documents requested and I refer honourable senators to the Attorney-General's correspondence to the Senate President as tabled.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:33):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's response.


I must say I have never, in the time I've been here, seen a government rely on public interest immunity as much as this government and this minister, who is just leaving the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I remind you not to reflect on when senators leave the chamber.




Senator CAMERON:
  I withdraw that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator CAMERON:
  That must be a new one! In relation to this position, we have a government that is, I think, clearly making a mockery of democracy and making a mockery of this chamber. They are refusing to be held accountable, and Minister Cash is a minister who has used public interest immunity more than any other minister I have seen in the decade that I've been in this place. This is a minister who, in a previous portfolio, has presided over an absolute disgrace of an administration—a minister who comes in here and is always prepared to use question time to attack union officials without any evidence, attack the trade union movement without any evidence and smear and use innuendo about ordinary Australians looking after working people day after day, doing the hard yards against the Business Council of Australia, who are trying to get tax cuts at the expense of working people. That's where this minister owes her allegiance. That's where this minister goes. This is a minister who turned a blind eye to the illegality of her former commissioner for the Australian Building and Construction Commission, Nigel Hadgkiss—a commissioner who ended up in disgrace, a commissioner who used $400,000 of public money, authorised by Minister Cash, to defend an illegality. 


Senator Cash has got no credibility in this place. She has got no credibility as a minister. She has got absolutely no credibility in doing the right thing as a minister in this government. She misled the Prime Minister when she appointed Nigel Hadgkiss because she should have told the Prime Minister that Nigel Hadgkiss had breached the legislation that he was supposed to uphold. This is a minister with no credibility—absolutely none. If she were to do the right thing, she would resign from the frontbench and deal with the issues that she is facing. But all she is prepared to do, and all this government is prepared to do, is spend more and more public money to defend the indefensible. She is an absolute disgrace as a minister, and all the posturing, all the nonsense—




Senator Payne:
  Deputy President, can I seek your guidance as to whether there is any requirement for the senator to be relevant to the matter before the chair?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  In all debates there is that question of relevance. I believe that Senator Cameron is setting a wide example, and I'm sure he will come to the substance of the matter in his speech. I have been listening—he's five minutes in at this point.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thanks for that, Madam Deputy President. I don't think anything could be more relevant. What could be more relevant than a minister coming in here, once again, claiming public interest immunity on behalf of another minister? I think it's appropriate for me to point out that the minister who is in here representing the other minister is one of the greatest abusers of public interest immunity in this place. This is a minister who misled the Prime Minister, as I said, and re-appointed Nigel Hadgkiss when she knew that Nigel Hadgkiss had breached the law. All she had to do was look at what this public servant was doing and she would have understood that he had no case to defend the indefensible that he had participated in. 


This is a minister who uses her political power to interfere in other government instrumentalities—the ABCC, the Registered Organisations Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman. This is a minister who has got a web of advisers—former advisers, former mates, former Liberal cronies—in these so-called independent organisations to attack the trade union movement, to attack working people. This minister has misused her power as a minister. I've said it before: I watched a BBC Panorama program about the interference by Putin against his political opponents in Russia. I tell you, he could learn a lot from Minister Cash. He could learn a lot from this minister. To use your political power to misrepresent positions in this place, to use your political power to ensconce your mates in individual instrumentalities and then to use them to attack the trade union movement and working people in this country is an absolute disgrace. 


The abuse of power by Minister Cash is, I think, just outrageous. This is a minister who, in my view, instigated the leak of the AFP raid. That's why she is so determined to use public interest immunity in this place. Is it feasible? It beggars belief that a senior person in Minister Cash's office tips off the media about the raid by the AFP that was instigated by Minister Cash using the Registered Organisations Commission, her creation, to attack the AWU. We know what it was all about. It was about attacking the Leader of the Opposition. It's a complete misuse of political power in this place. This minister misled parliament on five occasions. Then she had to come in and throw her staff under the bus, sacrifice her own staff, to save her own political skin. That's what this minister did. Everyone knows that that could not have happened without this minister knowing what was going on. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson.




Senator CAMERON:
  This will be good. 




Senator Hanson:
  A point of order. This has no relevance to what is before the house. This is about KPMG. I draw it back to the relevance of what's before the house. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hanson. I do remind Senator Cameron that this is about a report to be tabled today. I note that the minister has claimed public immunity, and I would just remind Senator Cameron of the need to remain with the topic. 




Senator CAMERON:
  I believe I am right on topic. This is about an order for the production of documents that Minister Cash has been asked to produce in this place. She hasn't produced them. She has hidden behind public interest immunity. Isn't it great that the so-called defender of the working class in this country, Senator Hanson, is in there defending this minister? You may as well just join the Liberal Party. This is where Senator Hanson came from. She came from the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party knew that they had some credibility and kicked her out because of her outrageous, racist views. They kicked her out, and now we've got the Liberal Party cuddling up to her. And we'll get Senator Hanson cuddling up to the Liberal Party. It's absolutely outrageous! What an obnoxious position this member takes every day in this place. 


I am right on issue in relation to this. This is about the misuse of public interest immunity. This is about not providing documents so that this parliament and this Senate can do what they are designed to do: to scrutinise the actions of ministers and the actions of government and to hold government to account. That's our job. All they do is hide behind public interest immunity and get their puppets to stand up and try to deflect when they're under pressure. Well, Senator Hanson, it's no use being a puppet in here; you actually should stand up for something other than racism and attacking people in this country. It's just absolutely outrageous.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. Senator Hanson.




Senator Hanson:
  I want Senator Cameron to withdraw that comment about my racism, because that is not the point in any way whatsoever, and I find that offensive.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, would you withdraw that remark, please.




Senator CAMERON:
  Yes, if it assists the Senate, I'll withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  But everyone knows what Senator Hanson is about. Everyone knows her form. Anyone that could stoop to doing what she's done in this place really can't hide behind parliamentary procedures. That's the bottom line. We all know what she's like. You know, Senator Hanson and Senator Cash are a good pair, a really good pair. We see them—Senator Hanson standing up here to defend a minister.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, please resume your seat. Senator Hanson.




Senator Hanson:
  I call on Senator Cameron to bring it back to relevance to the issue, which is a KPMG report. That is what this is about. There's no discussion about this. I haven't heard him refer to the KPMG report. He just keeps referring to another matter to do with Senator Cash. Bring it back to what this is about.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hanson. I believe that Senator Cameron is being relevant. One of the points the minister made was public interest immunity, and that is where Senator Cameron has directed most of his remarks. Please resume, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thanks, Madam Deputy President. Again I repeat: I am absolutely on point about a government using public interest immunity to hide the misbehaviour of ministers. That's exactly what we're seeing here this morning. Nothing could be clearer, and nothing could be clearer about how much of a puppet Senator Hanson is to this government than her behaviour this morning—absolutely terrible.


This government has got a terrible record on funding for courts and essential services. Not only did it ignore the call in the KPMG report for an emergency injection of $5 million in funding, but the Abbott government cut $30 million in funding from the Family Court in the first year. This is a government that cut funding for the Family Court and increased funding for the ABCC. It increased funding for Nigel Hadgkiss and his cronies in the ABCC to attack working people in this country.


As I've said, Minister Cash, who is in here defending the government's position this morning, is the worst of them all in the coalition: misleading this parliament on five occasions, a ministerial office in chaos and revolving doors in her office. People are moving out of her office as soon as they come under any scrutiny. As soon as they come under any scrutiny, off they go to get a job working for the Hotels Association, assisted by the minister or by the government in Western Australia. All the links are there. We know how this mob works: if you're in trouble, throw your adviser under the bus. Off he goes to get a job with the Hotels Association, and then you try to hide from the misbehaviour that you've carried out. The web of influence that this minister has created in so-called independent organisations is a disgrace. It's a disgrace for democracy and it's a disgrace for the coalition—an absolute disgrace. Minister Cash comes in here and she attacks refugees, attacks working people and uses question time to simply make assertions that are not true. Then, when she is in trouble, she wants to hide behind public interest immunity to avoid scrutiny, failing to comply with orders to produce answers to the estimates questions. She just treats the Senate with absolute disdain.


It's not just Senator Cash that treats the Senate with disdain; the coalition treats the Senate with disdain. I'd have thought any Independent worth their salt, who wants to make sure a government is held to account, wouldn't be in here defending the government, wouldn't be in here defending Senator Cash, as Senator Hanson has done on every occasion she got the opportunity to this morning. What an absolute disgrace for One Nation to be in here trying to defend Senator Cash, trying to defend this rabble of a government. Pauline Hanson's One Nation should just actually sign up to the coalition—because you're just part of the coalition. You're just part of the coalition.


Senator Cash is a minister who has failed to deal with the fundamental part of her job, and that was to make sure that working people in this country were not ripped off. She just didn't ever go there. It was always an attack on the unions, using independent bodies to attack the union movement: put her mates, put her allies, put her plants into independent organisations and then use them to attack the trade union movement and use them to attack the Leader of the Opposition. That's what this was all about.


As I've said, Putin would be proud of what Minister Cash has done. I know Putin is one of Senator Hanson's heroes. She thinks he's great. Well, nobody else in the world seems to think he's great. When you're out here defending Senator Cash, I know why you're doing it—because you like what Putin is doing in Russia, and you think that this is worth defending here. What a disgrace Pauline Hanson's One Nation is. What a disgrace Pauline Hanson is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I remind you to refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator CAMERON:
  I thought I did. I said 'Pauline Hanson's One Nation'. Isn't that the name of the party?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is, and then you referenced the senator.




Senator CAMERON:
  I accept that.




Senator Ruston:
  On a point of order, following Senator Cameron's comment: he actually referred to the senator as 'a disgrace'. I think he probably should withdraw.




Senator CAMERON:
  I certainly think the defence is truth—surely?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ruston?




Senator Ruston:
  I would draw the chair's attention to the last comment by Senator Cameron. I asked if you would ask Senator Cameron to withdraw—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Ruston.




Senator Ruston:
  and he has just continued to be rude.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, it's not appropriate to reflect personally on a senator. I'd just ask you to withdraw.




Senator CAMERON:
  If it assists the chair, I withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  This is a minister, in Minister Cash, who failed to act on employers ripping off workers. We have Senator Hanson in here defending a minister who fails to defend workers getting ripped off. What is this about? We know what it's about. Senator Hanson is nothing more than a right-wing Liberal. That's what she is. She's a right-wing Liberal. I don't often say this, but at least John Howard had the courage and conviction to throw her out of the party for her disgraceful conduct. Now we've got other former prime ministers like Tony Abbott cuddling up to her. What a disgrace this party is. The coalition have just lost the plot—absolutely lost the plot.


Minister Cash comes in here and defends wage theft, does nothing about workers getting their superannuation ripped off and does nothing about apprentices getting ripped off. There have been two reports from the Fair Work Ombudsman about apprentices getting ripped off—not a word said. 


Yet what we get from Senator Hanson is a dirty deal with the coalition to give massive wage cuts to the Business Council of Australia in return for a thousand apprentices. I've never heard Senator Hanson mention apprentices in this place since she's been here. I've never heard Senator Hanson or any One Nation member come to an estimates committee and ask about the welfare of apprentices. They've never cared about apprentices, yet, when it suits them, they'll do a dirty deal with the government to try and cover up their capitulation to the government, to hand over $65 billion to big business.


Coming back to Senator Cash: Senator Cash should have a good look at herself. She is a minister who has misled this place on five occasions, thrown her staff under the bus to protect her own position and refused to deal with the issues for working people in this country when she was the minister for industrial relations. She has refused to act honourably in her position in this place. She is an absolute disgrace. She should resign. She should talk to the Federal Police, tell the Federal Police exactly what happened and save the Federal Police the investigation that they are undertaking, save the public money and do the right thing. Senator Cash should resign. She can hide behind public interest immunity all she likes, but she will be found out, because her position is untenable. She is a disgrace of a minister. She has misled this place at least five times. She should just fess up. (Time expired)

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (09:56):  I also rise to take note of Senator Cash's statement to this chamber this morning. We had, yet again, an occurrence of Senator Cash using either the chamber of the Senate or its committees to refuse to answer legitimate questions about her behaviour and the behaviour of her ministerial colleagues. This time around, it's in relation to an order to produce documents that was passed by the Senate last week.


I acknowledge that it was on the motion of crossbench senators, Senators Griff, Hanson and Hinch. It's actually the first time that I have noticed that Senator Hanson was one of the co-signatories to this motion, so I'm a little surprised that she is one of the people running interference to protect her Liberal mate Senator Cash this morning. I would have thought that, if Senator Hanson were so interested to get these documents—which I'll go into in a moment—she would actually want to see it through and would want to put some pressure on the government to produce the documents that she sought. But of course that would involve going against her Liberal mates, and in particular her best mate, Senator Cash, so she has backed down on her own request to produce documents.


I suppose that we're not really that surprised to see Senator Hanson backing down when it comes to taking on the Liberals. It's always a lot easier for her to just vote with them, as she does—it's got to be more than 85 per cent of the time. Are you keeping a running total, Senator Hanson? It's got to be getting towards 90 per cent now.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, address your comments to the Chair.




Senator WATT:
  I'm sorry to see you go, Senator Hanson. It's always a pleasure to have—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, again, don't reflect on a senator leaving the chamber.




Senator WATT:
  Okay. The subject matter of this particular notice to produce concerns something that Senator Hanson has been very vocal about, along with a number of other senators, and that is the funding crisis that we see in the family courts in Australia and the backlog in family law cases that that funding crisis is producing.


While Labor did not move this motion seeking the production of documents—so no accusation can be made that this is some sort of partisan exercise from the opposition; it was moved by a number of crossbench senators—we share the concerns of a number of crossbench senators about the funding crisis that is enveloping the family courts and the backlogs that that funding crisis is causing for many Australians who want to see their family law disputes resolved. This order to produce simply sought the production of documents that the government has in its possession.


Not long after they were elected, under the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, the government commissioned a review into the funding of the federal courts and the family courts. They are sitting on a March 2014 report from KPMG, a report into the funding of federal courts, and they're also sitting on some costings that were prepared by Ernst & Young in response to that report from KPMG.


The motion that was moved last week and passed by the Senate was an entirely reasonable motion that sought to get access to these documents so that the Senate can better understand the rationale behind this government's continued refusal to properly fund the family courts. I think we can understand why the government is so keen to keep these reports secret, because, under this government, the Federal Circuit Court, which handles many family law matters, and also the Family Court have been driven to crisis. This government has now been sitting on this report for four years. You would really think that it would want to get that report out there in the public domain to help explain its own decisions about funding the family courts, but instead, four years later, we are still trying to obtain access to this report.


Why is the government sitting on this report four years on? It's pretty obvious that it's because it must reveal that there is a $75 million shortfall in court funding which this government has refused to fix. Fortunately, we are now rid of the former Attorney-General, the man who I think we're now to refer to as Mr Brandis. Fortunately, we're now rid of him.




Senator Payne:
  Or His Excellency.




Senator WATT:
  I know that Senator Payne and a number of other government senators want us to refer to him as His Excellency. I know you weren't there, but during estimates we had some interchange with bureaucrats from the Attorney-General's Department and we settled on 'Mr Brandis'—at least, that that's what I would say.



Senator Payne interjecting—




Senator WATT:
  It probably is my most courteous description of former senator, His Excellency, His Worship, His Grace, Mr Brandis. And I say hello to Mr Brandis out there if he's watching us on TV, as I'm sure that he is. Fortunately, we are rid of Mr Brandis from this chamber, the man who deprived the family courts of fair funding, the funding that was required by Australians to have their family disputes settled. I would have thought that now is an opportune time for the government to finally come forward and table these reports that they continue to sit on. But, no, the secrecy goes on.


Under this government, employees of the Family Court—it's not just about providing funding to employ more judges and to employ more registrars to keep up with the delays and get through the backlog of cases—continue to be deprived of a fair pay rise. Employees in the Family Court have not had a pay rise for four years. How is that fair? But I suppose we can't be surprised that this government is depriving its own workforce of pay rises when we know that the policies that it has for all workers in Australia are to keep wages low while it provides big company tax cuts to its mates at the big end of town. Judicial positions have been left vacant for a number of months, and this, as I say, has been contributing to case backlogs. Families who are going through extremely difficult circumstances through relationship breakdowns are kept waiting years to get a hearing.


There is no question that this government should properly fund the family courts. It should put the resources that are required into the courts to make sure that families going through relationship breakdowns are able to resolve their disputes, whether they be about property, contact with children or any other matters. But this government refuses to provide that funding, and now it refuses to provide a report that it received four years ago that presumably recommends an increase to funding to fix these problems.


I recently participated in a Senate inquiry which clearly was only required as a result of this government's funding shortfalls. Because of the fact that everyone knows the Family Court is overloaded and people are having to wait far too long to have their matters heard, the government has commissioned a review of the family law system, something that Labor supports, but, in the meantime, before the review has been handed down, the government has come up with the notion of parenting management hearings as a way of trying to cut through this backlog. These parenting management hearings are the subject of some legislation that is currently before the Senate and that a Senate committee has recently, just this week, handed down a report on.


I'm very pleased that Labor senators lodged a dissenting report in that inquiry, because we don't believe that the parenting management hearings are the way that family disputes should be dealt with, especially while a much broader review of the family law system is being undertaken. The only reason the government have put forward the parenting management hearings as an alternative to the Family Court is that they're not prepared to put the money into the Family Court to properly resolve disputes.


One of the key problems with parenting management hearings, in the view of Labor senators, is that litigants and family members going through breakdowns are not able to be represented by legal representatives and there is a very clear problem if you have a relationship where there's a power imbalance. Typically, it would be a woman in a less powerful situation than her former partner or spouse. Very often, matters that go before the Family Court involve, unfortunately, circumstances of domestic violence. Labor believes that it is important that people in those situations have access to legal representation to ensure that their position can be fairly and adequately put. Unfortunately, these parenting management hearings do not provide for legal representation. They're basically a way of trying to resolve family disputes on the cheap. The better way to go would be for the government to provide the funding that is required to make sure that the Family Court can get through its backlog of cases rather than having to create a new structure, while it's in the middle of a review, to try to overcome the backlog it has created.


I was interested that, during Senator Cameron's speech in this debate, we saw Senator Hanson repeatedly jump to the defence of Senator Cash. It was notable that—with the exception of Senator Payne, who, I think, once jumped up during Senator Cameron's contribution—no other government senator jumped to Senator Cash's defence, but the person she could rely on over and over again in that speech was Senator Hanson. As we know, Senator Hanson has now got a very long-term deal underway with the government, the Liberals, her own former party. But I was very surprised, as I say, that it was Senator Hanson who kept jumping up, because not only was she one of the signatories to this motion requiring Senator Cash to produce these documents—and, as I say, you would have thought she would have had an interest in actually receiving them—but one of the issues Senator Hanson has been quite vocal on since she was elected is problems with the Family Court that stem from underfunding. So I would have thought that, quite apart from the fact that Senator Hanson was one of the co-signatories to this motion, if she were actually serious about wanting to fix the problems of underfunding in the Family Court, as she says she is, she would actually want to get some answers from Senator Cash. But no.


We know—whether it be on this issue, on penalty rates, on cuts to pensions or on company tax cuts—that what Senator Hanson says when she's outside this chamber and out touring regional Queensland or anywhere else that she goes is very different to what she actually does when she comes to Canberra and votes in the chamber. On penalty rates, she has twice voted with the government to support penalty rate cuts going through and hurting poorer workers in our community. She has repeatedly voted with the government to cut pensions, she has repeatedly voted with the government to cut apprenticeships, and she has even voted with the government to make it easier for construction companies to bring in temporary overseas workers, something that she says that she's against. This is just another example today of something we repeatedly see from Senator Hanson, where she says that she's in favour of one thing when she's out there courting votes, particularly in regional Queensland, but every single time she comes into this chamber she not only votes with her former party, the Liberal Party, but stands up and tries to protect Senator Cash from facing legitimate questions about Senator Cash's own behaviour.


One of these days Senator Hanson is going to realise that she's been caught out. It's one of the reasons that she wasn't successful in the Queensland election and managed only one seat when she and James Ashby were out there claiming at one point that they were going to hold the balance of power, and then they were going to hold 12 seats and then they were going to hold 10 seats. It actually ended up being one, and that's because people in regional Queensland have worked out that Senator Hanson doesn't tell the truth and doesn't back up her words with her actions when she comes down to Canberra.


Having dealt with the Family Court matters that are the subject of this motion, I want to turn to what we are seeing in Senator Cash refusing to comply with this order. It is a continuation of a pattern of behaviour, in particular from Senator Cash but also from other ministers in this government. As Senator Cameron said this morning—Senator Cameron has been here a lot longer than me—he can't remember seeing a government that has so frequently used claims of public interest immunity in order to avoid answering questions and producing documents that are the legitimate subject of questions from this chamber.


Senator Cash is the prime culprit when it comes to this. We all know, and I think everyone in Australia knows, that Senator Cash is in a huge amount of trouble over her office's involvement, potentially her involvement and potentially other ministers' involvement in the scandal around the police raid on union offices that occurred late last year. We know that that is still the subject of an investigation by the Federal Police. What we saw—and what we continue to see—from Senator Cash about that police raid was her continued use of public interest immunity and other mechanisms to avoid answering any questions about her involvement, her office's involvement or the involvement of other ministerial offices in that scandal. It's not going to work. We know that the truth is going to come out, and already the truth is starting to leak out. I have no doubt that, at the end of that police investigation, we will have the full truth, so all that Senator Cash is doing in refusing to answer questions is delaying the inevitable and, frankly, pushing that scandal closer to an election, whenever that might be. I would've thought the government would have wanted to get this as far away from an election as possible, but, in fact, by delaying, all they're doing is making sure that it remains fresh in people's minds, whenever that election might be.


What we saw from Senator Cash during Senate estimates in October last year, when this scandal first broke, was that she used public interest immunity in order to avoid answering questions of senators at Senate estimates. Very conveniently, as soon as the scandal broke, she organised for her friends at the Registered Organisations Commission who had launched this raid to write to the Federal Police and essentially ask whether it was going to be okay to answer questions now that a police investigation was underway, and, dutifully—I'm not impugning the Federal Police—as expected, the Federal Police wrote back and said that these matters would not be the subject of comment by the Federal Police. Of course, Senator Cash and the man now known as Mr Brandis got together and worked out that the best way to avoid these questions was for Senator Cash to say that a police investigation was underway and that she was now not able to comment on the police investigation or any matters connected to it.


Anyone who bothered to read the email that the Federal Police supplied in response to the Registered Organisations Commission and in response to the Senate estimates committee would have noted that what the Federal Police were saying was that they couldn't comment on the investigation. There was nothing in there that said that Senator Cash and other ministers couldn't comment on it. But, of course, we had the man now known as Mr Brandis doing his usual tricks of interpreting words in ways that suit his ends. I'm a lawyer; I've seen people do that, and Mr Brandis, to give him credit, is an expert at exaggerating words to suit his own legal arguments. What they came up with was that Senator Cash was now not able to answer questions about the matters that were under investigation by the Federal Police.


I was shocked to see Senator Cash turn to this as a way of avoiding questions, because what it basically said was that she thought it was better to be under investigation from the Federal Police than it was to answer questions in a Senate estimates committee. I would have thought that any minister would want to be transparent in answering questions, if they had nothing to hide. The last thing you want to do in politics is say that you're under investigation by the police, but Senator Cash chose to argue that she and her office were under investigation by the Federal Police and that that meant that they couldn't answer questions. What a way to look guilty! If you want to look guilty in the eyes of the public, say that you're under investigation by the Federal Police. That's the route Senator Cash chose and continues to take to this day.


We tried to ask questions about it again in estimates recently, at the end of February, and, again, the response was, 'We'd love to tell you what went on there, but the police are still investigating us.' If Senator Cash wants to keep going down the route of arguing to the Australian public that she can't talk about something because the police are investigating her, let her go ahead. Our case is basically proven.


One of the issues that we're still trying to get to the bottom of is other ministerial offices and their involvement in the scandal. We've had the very interesting and Brandisesque, if I might call them that, answers from the now Minister for Human Services, Mr Keenan. Mr Keenan was the Minister for Justice at the time of this raid. He was the minister overseeing the Federal Police. He has been very careful in the answers that he has given in the House of Representatives to questions about the involvement of his office in this. What he has said up until now is that no member of his office was involved in the leak of the information. What he means by that is that no current member of his office was involved in that. Everyone knows that, just like Senator Cash, Minister Keenan has had resignations from his office—people who no longer even work in the government—and he has been very careful to say that no former member of his office was involved in that leak. It won't take us long to work out—there has already been reporting on this—that it was not only Minister Cash's office who were involved in this leak but also Minister Keenan's office, and maybe other ministers' offices as well. 


As long as Senator Cash and other ministers claim to use public interest immunity as a way of avoiding questions about their involvement in this scandal, these questions won't stop. We will keep asking them and we will get to the bottom of it. Minister Cash might decide to use the fact that she and her office are under police investigation as a way of avoiding answering these questions, but it won't work. There is going to come a time when that police investigation is concluded. I have no doubt that it is going to find that this scandal went a lot further than just one member of Senator Cash's office. It is going to find, without doubt, that other ministers' offices were involved and that questions about Senator Cash's own involvement will continue. Senator Cash should stop using public interest immunity to avoid answering questions about the Family Court or her office's involvement in this scandal.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",CA,2018-03-28,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (10:16):  How can it be that the entirety of these documents is damaging to the public interest? The Australian already has a copy of the KPMG report. Excerpts and summaries of the report have been published in the paper. Consequently, they are already in the public domain, and the government's ability to support the court does not appear to have been undermined by that publication. The minister representing the Attorney-General's response shows a complete disregard for families navigating their way through the family law system—a system that, in the words of the former Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, is 'letting the people down'. The former Chief Justice went on to say:


The whole system suffers from a lack of resources to get through the work in a satisfactory way.


Those statements were made in 2017, and now, in 2018, very little, if anything, has changed. Only last week, in a ceremonial listing for senior Family Court Judge, Justice Thackray, His Honour said: 


… I've been burning to say these things for years.


His final address to the profession was a searing indictment of this government's continued failure to provide the court with the funding it needs to do its job properly. His Honour called out the government for taking years to replace retiring judges and added his voice to the deafening chorus of calls for an urgent injection of funds to deal with the growing case load and inordinate delays. So we have a senior judge and the former Chief Justice publicly voicing their long-held and very real concerns about the parlous state of the Family Court's funding. How is it then that this government can continue to ignore the repeated calls for funding? How is it that this government thinks that all will be fixed with piecemeal and tokenistic gestures? 


Let's take the extra funding allocated to the court for registrars announced in the 2017 budget: three registrars across three courts and seven states and territory—only three registrars for all three courts. That hasn't even scratched the surface. In the words of former Chief Justice Diana Bryant, matters continue to:


… just sit in the list. That's appalling.


Those are not my words. Those are the words of the former and highly respected Chief Justice of the Family Court, who, in October 2017, called the delays 'appalling'. Barely six months ago, the then Chief Justice of the Family Court was pleading for more funding for a system that is overworked and underresourced—but I don't want to reduce this debate to balance sheets and budgets.


Let's just pause here for a moment and actually think about what is at stake. Let's think about the children and the parents who spend years having their most intimate details laid bare for social scientists, lawyers and judges to dissect and determine. We're not talking about large multinationals crossing swords over abstract contractual principles. These are desperate families dealing with a breakdown in the family unit and all the emotional, financial and logistical complications that flow from that. Delays in the system due to the lack of sufficient resources can only serve to further inflame the conflict. 


Family law disputes are necessarily the consequence of failed hopes, dreams and plans for a shared life. The legal profession and the judiciary, including the former Chief Justice, have all identified the government's failure to replace judges quickly—or, indeed, at all—as a significant factor in the current delays. Let's take Adelaide, my home capital city, as an example. Following the retirement of Justice Dawe, South Australian families have been waiting for over 12 months for a replacement judge. So there is now only one judge available to decide the state's most complex matters—one judge. 


Last week, the Attorney-General confirmed that there was a full complement of judges in the court for the first time in years. How do you then explain to the people of South Australia what one judge will actually do when there used to be two? How do you explain to the people of South Australia that they will have to wait twice as long to get before a judge? Or does the government simply expect the one remaining judge in Adelaide to work twice as hard? Remember, these are complex cases often involving intractable parenting disputes, including allegations of serious physical, sexual and psychological harm or complex property settlements where mum is barely scraping by on welfare payments and child support while she waits for the property settlement to be determined by the next available judge. 


The government needs to acknowledge the failure to replace judges quickly and that the continued failure to replace Justice Dawe has had a snowball effect on separating families. I know this because I've heard too many stories of South Australian families suffering financially and emotionally while they wait and wait and wait on the list. It is not uncommon for matters to spend two years on the Federal Circuit Court waiting for their trial only to be kicked upstairs to the Family Court where they must start once more at the bottom of a very long queue. This is occurring because of the limitations of the FCC and the complexity of certain matters. With only one judge now sitting in the Family Court in Adelaide, matters are taking well over three years to determine. 


We know from the various state and territory law societies and the Law Council of Australia that these stories are not unique to Adelaide. For example, in the Sydney and Parramatta courts, families can wait over three years to get to the final hearing. And what is so frustrating is that we absolutely know that this is not a new problem because, unlike the Senate, TheAustralian actually managed to get a copy of the 2014 KPMG report. What was reported paints a sobering picture of the nation's three federal courts. In an article published on 29 August 2014, The Australian reported an expected $75 million budget as a consequence of the court's structures and complex and increasing caseload. The article said:


The 127-page report, which was handed to the government in March, reveals court costs are rising faster than the money set aside to pay for them, and not enough potential savings remain to cover the shortfall.


""The current challenge now lies in that the pool of potential 'efficiencies' has already been tapped and that it does not appear possible to continue to produce them at the same pace ... without a significant restructure or decline in service levels …


That report was completed four years ago, and there is no indication that the service levels have improved in the meantime. Remember, this is not a customer satisfaction survey for a retail chain. The court is providing a service to separating families. That service is to hear and determine their matter in a fair, efficient and cost-efficient manner.


Our attention then turns to the term 'restructure'. We know the government amalgamated the administrative functions of all three federal courts in order to claw back costs, but what other changes is the government planning? We know from Senate estimates that the Attorney-General has met with the courts to discuss reform. Are the proposed parenting management hearings just the first part of a broader reform that was proposed back in 2014, or is this a quick-fix idea, a last-ditch attempt by the government to salvage a broken system after years of repeatedly ignoring pleas for funding? Remember that these calls for funding are not the disgruntled murmurings of the few; sustained calls for more funding have come from the judiciary, the legal profession, legal aid centres, academics and social workers. And they are based on the limited information available to us from KPMG. 


This is not the first attempt that has been made to seek a copy of the report. We heard during the recent Senate estimates that there was, at that time, an FOI request pending, and, during question time in November 2016, Senator Hanson requested a copy of the report. In response, the then Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, made two points that I'd like to highlight. The first was that the department had relied on these documents to achieve useful efficiencies, and the second was that he would consult with the secretary of his department to see what he could make available. So, here we are, 18 months later, and we must now all surely be questioning what impact, if any, the so-called useful efficiencies have had on the current logjam in the courts. 


But that is the point: we simply do not know. We don't have the full picture, and the government does not want us to know. So, how can we be expected to consider the Family Law Amendment (Parenting Management Hearings) Bill in a vacuum, when the government has sold this bill to the Senate as a new justice model, promising swift and cost-effective dispute resolution for all? And it is for all, notwithstanding Senator Brandis's response to my question in December 2017: these parenting management hearings will in fact be used in cases of family violence. 


The government's proposal is a significant departure from existing family court procedures. It is an untested social experiment being thrust upon unsuspecting participants that is binding on them and their children. These are people who will have to deal with the consequences for many years to come. It may be a pilot program for the government, but make no mistake: for the estimated 500 families and the 1,000 children affected, it will be permanent. It also comes at a significant cost of over $12 million—just for a pilot program. 


I asked the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, about the timing of the reforms in December 2017, and yet again I find myself asking: why is the government choosing to legislate now, before the Australian Law Reform Commission has completed the long-awaited review into the family law system? If the government were serious about the review and about helping vulnerable Australians through one of the worst periods of their lives, it would wait for the recommendations of the ALRC before thrusting yet another layer of complexity on an already overburdened system, especially when we know that, as part of its terms of references, the ALRC will be looking at 'the appropriate, early and cost-effective resolution of all family law disputes' and 'the pressures, including, in particular, financial pressures, on courts exercising family law jurisdiction'. I would expect that, as part of that investigation into financial pressures facing the courts, the government will ensure that the KPMG and Ernst & Young reports are provided to the ALRC. 


The government has available to it two presumably comprehensive reports which set out the financial pressures the Family Court is facing, and presumably the range of possible options that were available to the government at the time. The time has now come for the government to produce the reports: first, to the Senate, to enable a proper consideration of the merits of the parenting management hearings bill, and, second, to the ALRC, to better enable the commission to consider the financial pressures facing the family law system pursuant to its terms of reference.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:29):  I've had a quick look at the minister's response to the OPD and I will express a preliminarily view. But, before I express that view, I want to make it clear that there is no constitutional impediment to this chamber making an inquiry into the administration of the courts. We must of course respect the need to steer clear of matters related to legal proceedings, but the issue of appropriate resourcing for the courts is fairly and squarely within the purview of this chamber. The letter tabled seems to make a claim that does not fit within the accepted public interest immunity claims—and I refer the Senate to pages 662 and 667 of Odgers—but it does fall within the grounds that are not accepted by the Senate, again on pages 667 and 669. I will look at this letter, consider it and come back to the chamber in due course, but I do want to state that it is for the Senate to accept or not accept a public interest immunity. If it does not accept it then it can use its powers to enforce the order. This may become a test for both the government and the Senate in this instance.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-03-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:30):  Governments should be of the people and for the people; that is a fundamental democratic principle. Part of that fundamental democratic principle is respecting the right of the people to have access to information that underpins government decision making. This government uses public interest immunity claims almost reflexively to deny not only this chamber and members of the Senate but the Australian people the capacity to hold them to account and to more fully understand information on which the government's decisions are made. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the immigration portfolio around what the government describes as 'on-water matters'. The government also regularly uses public interest immunity claims to draw a veil of secrecy over the horrors of what is happening to people on Manus Island and Nauru who remain in Australia's duty of care.


We've had a quick look at the letter provided to the Senate today by Minister Cash. The Greens, on face value, do not accept the claim of public interest immunity made in that letter. It is quite clearly outside the grounds laid out in Odgers, as Senator Patrick has stated, and in fact—again, as Senator Patrick has stated—falls clearly within the grounds that ought not, under precedents set by this chamber in the past and advice from the Clerk to this chamber in the past, be accepted by this chamber. We stand ready to work with this Senate to ensure that the information that the government is continually trying to keep secret is made public, and we do that on behalf of our democracy, on behalf of the people who put us into this place with their votes and on behalf of the supremacy of the parliament over the executive government. We will work across party lines to ensure that claims like this are tested and to ensure that, where the Senate does not accept claims of public interest immunity, further action is taken on behalf of the right of the Australian people to have the capacity to more fully understand decisions the government makes.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-28,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:31):  I table a document relating to the order for the production of documents concerning funding for the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. As minister representing the Attorney-General, I wish to advise the Senate of the government's position in relation to Senate motion No. 733. This is an order for the production of documents requesting the tabling of the KPMG report into the funding of the federal courts and the Ernst & Young costings in response to the KPMG report. You'd be aware that I have now tabled a response in relation to this motion whereby the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity over these documents. That is set out in detail in the response provided by the Attorney-General.


I can advise the Senate in summary, however, that public interest immunity has been claimed on the following basis by the Attorney-General. The reports have been and will continue to be relied on in future government decision-making processes on court structure, administration and financial arrangements, and their continued utility relies on them being treated with a degree of confidentiality. Input and advice to these reports from stakeholders, especially the federal courts, was provided on the basis of assurances that information provided, including sensitive and specific staffing information, would be treated confidentially. Disclosure of the reports would be expected to limit the extent to which stakeholders, in particular the federal courts, would engage fully future reports of this kind even if given assurances of confidentiality over information provided. This would result in future reports not being fully informed by full and frank advice and the government would not receive the most comprehensive advice from its portfolio departments and agencies. For these reasons, the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity over the documents requested and I refer honourable senators to the Attorney-General's correspondence to the Senate President as tabled.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:33):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's response.


I must say I have never, in the time I've been here, seen a government rely on public interest immunity as much as this government and this minister, who is just leaving the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I remind you not to reflect on when senators leave the chamber.




Senator CAMERON:
  I withdraw that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator CAMERON:
  That must be a new one! In relation to this position, we have a government that is, I think, clearly making a mockery of democracy and making a mockery of this chamber. They are refusing to be held accountable, and Minister Cash is a minister who has used public interest immunity more than any other minister I have seen in the decade that I've been in this place. This is a minister who, in a previous portfolio, has presided over an absolute disgrace of an administration—a minister who comes in here and is always prepared to use question time to attack union officials without any evidence, attack the trade union movement without any evidence and smear and use innuendo about ordinary Australians looking after working people day after day, doing the hard yards against the Business Council of Australia, who are trying to get tax cuts at the expense of working people. That's where this minister owes her allegiance. That's where this minister goes. This is a minister who turned a blind eye to the illegality of her former commissioner for the Australian Building and Construction Commission, Nigel Hadgkiss—a commissioner who ended up in disgrace, a commissioner who used $400,000 of public money, authorised by Minister Cash, to defend an illegality. 


Senator Cash has got no credibility in this place. She has got no credibility as a minister. She has got absolutely no credibility in doing the right thing as a minister in this government. She misled the Prime Minister when she appointed Nigel Hadgkiss because she should have told the Prime Minister that Nigel Hadgkiss had breached the legislation that he was supposed to uphold. This is a minister with no credibility—absolutely none. If she were to do the right thing, she would resign from the frontbench and deal with the issues that she is facing. But all she is prepared to do, and all this government is prepared to do, is spend more and more public money to defend the indefensible. She is an absolute disgrace as a minister, and all the posturing, all the nonsense—




Senator Payne:
  Deputy President, can I seek your guidance as to whether there is any requirement for the senator to be relevant to the matter before the chair?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  In all debates there is that question of relevance. I believe that Senator Cameron is setting a wide example, and I'm sure he will come to the substance of the matter in his speech. I have been listening—he's five minutes in at this point.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thanks for that, Madam Deputy President. I don't think anything could be more relevant. What could be more relevant than a minister coming in here, once again, claiming public interest immunity on behalf of another minister? I think it's appropriate for me to point out that the minister who is in here representing the other minister is one of the greatest abusers of public interest immunity in this place. This is a minister who misled the Prime Minister, as I said, and re-appointed Nigel Hadgkiss when she knew that Nigel Hadgkiss had breached the law. All she had to do was look at what this public servant was doing and she would have understood that he had no case to defend the indefensible that he had participated in. 


This is a minister who uses her political power to interfere in other government instrumentalities—the ABCC, the Registered Organisations Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman. This is a minister who has got a web of advisers—former advisers, former mates, former Liberal cronies—in these so-called independent organisations to attack the trade union movement, to attack working people. This minister has misused her power as a minister. I've said it before: I watched a BBC Panorama program about the interference by Putin against his political opponents in Russia. I tell you, he could learn a lot from Minister Cash. He could learn a lot from this minister. To use your political power to misrepresent positions in this place, to use your political power to ensconce your mates in individual instrumentalities and then to use them to attack the trade union movement and working people in this country is an absolute disgrace. 


The abuse of power by Minister Cash is, I think, just outrageous. This is a minister who, in my view, instigated the leak of the AFP raid. That's why she is so determined to use public interest immunity in this place. Is it feasible? It beggars belief that a senior person in Minister Cash's office tips off the media about the raid by the AFP that was instigated by Minister Cash using the Registered Organisations Commission, her creation, to attack the AWU. We know what it was all about. It was about attacking the Leader of the Opposition. It's a complete misuse of political power in this place. This minister misled parliament on five occasions. Then she had to come in and throw her staff under the bus, sacrifice her own staff, to save her own political skin. That's what this minister did. Everyone knows that that could not have happened without this minister knowing what was going on. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson.




Senator CAMERON:
  This will be good. 




Senator Hanson:
  A point of order. This has no relevance to what is before the house. This is about KPMG. I draw it back to the relevance of what's before the house. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hanson. I do remind Senator Cameron that this is about a report to be tabled today. I note that the minister has claimed public immunity, and I would just remind Senator Cameron of the need to remain with the topic. 




Senator CAMERON:
  I believe I am right on topic. This is about an order for the production of documents that Minister Cash has been asked to produce in this place. She hasn't produced them. She has hidden behind public interest immunity. Isn't it great that the so-called defender of the working class in this country, Senator Hanson, is in there defending this minister? You may as well just join the Liberal Party. This is where Senator Hanson came from. She came from the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party knew that they had some credibility and kicked her out because of her outrageous, racist views. They kicked her out, and now we've got the Liberal Party cuddling up to her. And we'll get Senator Hanson cuddling up to the Liberal Party. It's absolutely outrageous! What an obnoxious position this member takes every day in this place. 


I am right on issue in relation to this. This is about the misuse of public interest immunity. This is about not providing documents so that this parliament and this Senate can do what they are designed to do: to scrutinise the actions of ministers and the actions of government and to hold government to account. That's our job. All they do is hide behind public interest immunity and get their puppets to stand up and try to deflect when they're under pressure. Well, Senator Hanson, it's no use being a puppet in here; you actually should stand up for something other than racism and attacking people in this country. It's just absolutely outrageous.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. Senator Hanson.




Senator Hanson:
  I want Senator Cameron to withdraw that comment about my racism, because that is not the point in any way whatsoever, and I find that offensive.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, would you withdraw that remark, please.




Senator CAMERON:
  Yes, if it assists the Senate, I'll withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  But everyone knows what Senator Hanson is about. Everyone knows her form. Anyone that could stoop to doing what she's done in this place really can't hide behind parliamentary procedures. That's the bottom line. We all know what she's like. You know, Senator Hanson and Senator Cash are a good pair, a really good pair. We see them—Senator Hanson standing up here to defend a minister.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, please resume your seat. Senator Hanson.




Senator Hanson:
  I call on Senator Cameron to bring it back to relevance to the issue, which is a KPMG report. That is what this is about. There's no discussion about this. I haven't heard him refer to the KPMG report. He just keeps referring to another matter to do with Senator Cash. Bring it back to what this is about.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hanson. I believe that Senator Cameron is being relevant. One of the points the minister made was public interest immunity, and that is where Senator Cameron has directed most of his remarks. Please resume, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thanks, Madam Deputy President. Again I repeat: I am absolutely on point about a government using public interest immunity to hide the misbehaviour of ministers. That's exactly what we're seeing here this morning. Nothing could be clearer, and nothing could be clearer about how much of a puppet Senator Hanson is to this government than her behaviour this morning—absolutely terrible.


This government has got a terrible record on funding for courts and essential services. Not only did it ignore the call in the KPMG report for an emergency injection of $5 million in funding, but the Abbott government cut $30 million in funding from the Family Court in the first year. This is a government that cut funding for the Family Court and increased funding for the ABCC. It increased funding for Nigel Hadgkiss and his cronies in the ABCC to attack working people in this country.


As I've said, Minister Cash, who is in here defending the government's position this morning, is the worst of them all in the coalition: misleading this parliament on five occasions, a ministerial office in chaos and revolving doors in her office. People are moving out of her office as soon as they come under any scrutiny. As soon as they come under any scrutiny, off they go to get a job working for the Hotels Association, assisted by the minister or by the government in Western Australia. All the links are there. We know how this mob works: if you're in trouble, throw your adviser under the bus. Off he goes to get a job with the Hotels Association, and then you try to hide from the misbehaviour that you've carried out. The web of influence that this minister has created in so-called independent organisations is a disgrace. It's a disgrace for democracy and it's a disgrace for the coalition—an absolute disgrace. Minister Cash comes in here and she attacks refugees, attacks working people and uses question time to simply make assertions that are not true. Then, when she is in trouble, she wants to hide behind public interest immunity to avoid scrutiny, failing to comply with orders to produce answers to the estimates questions. She just treats the Senate with absolute disdain.


It's not just Senator Cash that treats the Senate with disdain; the coalition treats the Senate with disdain. I'd have thought any Independent worth their salt, who wants to make sure a government is held to account, wouldn't be in here defending the government, wouldn't be in here defending Senator Cash, as Senator Hanson has done on every occasion she got the opportunity to this morning. What an absolute disgrace for One Nation to be in here trying to defend Senator Cash, trying to defend this rabble of a government. Pauline Hanson's One Nation should just actually sign up to the coalition—because you're just part of the coalition. You're just part of the coalition.


Senator Cash is a minister who has failed to deal with the fundamental part of her job, and that was to make sure that working people in this country were not ripped off. She just didn't ever go there. It was always an attack on the unions, using independent bodies to attack the union movement: put her mates, put her allies, put her plants into independent organisations and then use them to attack the trade union movement and use them to attack the Leader of the Opposition. That's what this was all about.


As I've said, Putin would be proud of what Minister Cash has done. I know Putin is one of Senator Hanson's heroes. She thinks he's great. Well, nobody else in the world seems to think he's great. When you're out here defending Senator Cash, I know why you're doing it—because you like what Putin is doing in Russia, and you think that this is worth defending here. What a disgrace Pauline Hanson's One Nation is. What a disgrace Pauline Hanson is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I remind you to refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator CAMERON:
  I thought I did. I said 'Pauline Hanson's One Nation'. Isn't that the name of the party?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is, and then you referenced the senator.




Senator CAMERON:
  I accept that.




Senator Ruston:
  On a point of order, following Senator Cameron's comment: he actually referred to the senator as 'a disgrace'. I think he probably should withdraw.




Senator CAMERON:
  I certainly think the defence is truth—surely?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ruston?




Senator Ruston:
  I would draw the chair's attention to the last comment by Senator Cameron. I asked if you would ask Senator Cameron to withdraw—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Ruston.




Senator Ruston:
  and he has just continued to be rude.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, it's not appropriate to reflect personally on a senator. I'd just ask you to withdraw.




Senator CAMERON:
  If it assists the chair, I withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  This is a minister, in Minister Cash, who failed to act on employers ripping off workers. We have Senator Hanson in here defending a minister who fails to defend workers getting ripped off. What is this about? We know what it's about. Senator Hanson is nothing more than a right-wing Liberal. That's what she is. She's a right-wing Liberal. I don't often say this, but at least John Howard had the courage and conviction to throw her out of the party for her disgraceful conduct. Now we've got other former prime ministers like Tony Abbott cuddling up to her. What a disgrace this party is. The coalition have just lost the plot—absolutely lost the plot.


Minister Cash comes in here and defends wage theft, does nothing about workers getting their superannuation ripped off and does nothing about apprentices getting ripped off. There have been two reports from the Fair Work Ombudsman about apprentices getting ripped off—not a word said. 


Yet what we get from Senator Hanson is a dirty deal with the coalition to give massive wage cuts to the Business Council of Australia in return for a thousand apprentices. I've never heard Senator Hanson mention apprentices in this place since she's been here. I've never heard Senator Hanson or any One Nation member come to an estimates committee and ask about the welfare of apprentices. They've never cared about apprentices, yet, when it suits them, they'll do a dirty deal with the government to try and cover up their capitulation to the government, to hand over $65 billion to big business.


Coming back to Senator Cash: Senator Cash should have a good look at herself. She is a minister who has misled this place on five occasions, thrown her staff under the bus to protect her own position and refused to deal with the issues for working people in this country when she was the minister for industrial relations. She has refused to act honourably in her position in this place. She is an absolute disgrace. She should resign. She should talk to the Federal Police, tell the Federal Police exactly what happened and save the Federal Police the investigation that they are undertaking, save the public money and do the right thing. Senator Cash should resign. She can hide behind public interest immunity all she likes, but she will be found out, because her position is untenable. She is a disgrace of a minister. She has misled this place at least five times. She should just fess up. (Time expired)

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (09:56):  I also rise to take note of Senator Cash's statement to this chamber this morning. We had, yet again, an occurrence of Senator Cash using either the chamber of the Senate or its committees to refuse to answer legitimate questions about her behaviour and the behaviour of her ministerial colleagues. This time around, it's in relation to an order to produce documents that was passed by the Senate last week.


I acknowledge that it was on the motion of crossbench senators, Senators Griff, Hanson and Hinch. It's actually the first time that I have noticed that Senator Hanson was one of the co-signatories to this motion, so I'm a little surprised that she is one of the people running interference to protect her Liberal mate Senator Cash this morning. I would have thought that, if Senator Hanson were so interested to get these documents—which I'll go into in a moment—she would actually want to see it through and would want to put some pressure on the government to produce the documents that she sought. But of course that would involve going against her Liberal mates, and in particular her best mate, Senator Cash, so she has backed down on her own request to produce documents.


I suppose that we're not really that surprised to see Senator Hanson backing down when it comes to taking on the Liberals. It's always a lot easier for her to just vote with them, as she does—it's got to be more than 85 per cent of the time. Are you keeping a running total, Senator Hanson? It's got to be getting towards 90 per cent now.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, address your comments to the Chair.




Senator WATT:
  I'm sorry to see you go, Senator Hanson. It's always a pleasure to have—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, again, don't reflect on a senator leaving the chamber.




Senator WATT:
  Okay. The subject matter of this particular notice to produce concerns something that Senator Hanson has been very vocal about, along with a number of other senators, and that is the funding crisis that we see in the family courts in Australia and the backlog in family law cases that that funding crisis is producing.


While Labor did not move this motion seeking the production of documents—so no accusation can be made that this is some sort of partisan exercise from the opposition; it was moved by a number of crossbench senators—we share the concerns of a number of crossbench senators about the funding crisis that is enveloping the family courts and the backlogs that that funding crisis is causing for many Australians who want to see their family law disputes resolved. This order to produce simply sought the production of documents that the government has in its possession.


Not long after they were elected, under the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, the government commissioned a review into the funding of the federal courts and the family courts. They are sitting on a March 2014 report from KPMG, a report into the funding of federal courts, and they're also sitting on some costings that were prepared by Ernst & Young in response to that report from KPMG.


The motion that was moved last week and passed by the Senate was an entirely reasonable motion that sought to get access to these documents so that the Senate can better understand the rationale behind this government's continued refusal to properly fund the family courts. I think we can understand why the government is so keen to keep these reports secret, because, under this government, the Federal Circuit Court, which handles many family law matters, and also the Family Court have been driven to crisis. This government has now been sitting on this report for four years. You would really think that it would want to get that report out there in the public domain to help explain its own decisions about funding the family courts, but instead, four years later, we are still trying to obtain access to this report.


Why is the government sitting on this report four years on? It's pretty obvious that it's because it must reveal that there is a $75 million shortfall in court funding which this government has refused to fix. Fortunately, we are now rid of the former Attorney-General, the man who I think we're now to refer to as Mr Brandis. Fortunately, we're now rid of him.




Senator Payne:
  Or His Excellency.




Senator WATT:
  I know that Senator Payne and a number of other government senators want us to refer to him as His Excellency. I know you weren't there, but during estimates we had some interchange with bureaucrats from the Attorney-General's Department and we settled on 'Mr Brandis'—at least, that that's what I would say.



Senator Payne interjecting—




Senator WATT:
  It probably is my most courteous description of former senator, His Excellency, His Worship, His Grace, Mr Brandis. And I say hello to Mr Brandis out there if he's watching us on TV, as I'm sure that he is. Fortunately, we are rid of Mr Brandis from this chamber, the man who deprived the family courts of fair funding, the funding that was required by Australians to have their family disputes settled. I would have thought that now is an opportune time for the government to finally come forward and table these reports that they continue to sit on. But, no, the secrecy goes on.


Under this government, employees of the Family Court—it's not just about providing funding to employ more judges and to employ more registrars to keep up with the delays and get through the backlog of cases—continue to be deprived of a fair pay rise. Employees in the Family Court have not had a pay rise for four years. How is that fair? But I suppose we can't be surprised that this government is depriving its own workforce of pay rises when we know that the policies that it has for all workers in Australia are to keep wages low while it provides big company tax cuts to its mates at the big end of town. Judicial positions have been left vacant for a number of months, and this, as I say, has been contributing to case backlogs. Families who are going through extremely difficult circumstances through relationship breakdowns are kept waiting years to get a hearing.


There is no question that this government should properly fund the family courts. It should put the resources that are required into the courts to make sure that families going through relationship breakdowns are able to resolve their disputes, whether they be about property, contact with children or any other matters. But this government refuses to provide that funding, and now it refuses to provide a report that it received four years ago that presumably recommends an increase to funding to fix these problems.


I recently participated in a Senate inquiry which clearly was only required as a result of this government's funding shortfalls. Because of the fact that everyone knows the Family Court is overloaded and people are having to wait far too long to have their matters heard, the government has commissioned a review of the family law system, something that Labor supports, but, in the meantime, before the review has been handed down, the government has come up with the notion of parenting management hearings as a way of trying to cut through this backlog. These parenting management hearings are the subject of some legislation that is currently before the Senate and that a Senate committee has recently, just this week, handed down a report on.


I'm very pleased that Labor senators lodged a dissenting report in that inquiry, because we don't believe that the parenting management hearings are the way that family disputes should be dealt with, especially while a much broader review of the family law system is being undertaken. The only reason the government have put forward the parenting management hearings as an alternative to the Family Court is that they're not prepared to put the money into the Family Court to properly resolve disputes.


One of the key problems with parenting management hearings, in the view of Labor senators, is that litigants and family members going through breakdowns are not able to be represented by legal representatives and there is a very clear problem if you have a relationship where there's a power imbalance. Typically, it would be a woman in a less powerful situation than her former partner or spouse. Very often, matters that go before the Family Court involve, unfortunately, circumstances of domestic violence. Labor believes that it is important that people in those situations have access to legal representation to ensure that their position can be fairly and adequately put. Unfortunately, these parenting management hearings do not provide for legal representation. They're basically a way of trying to resolve family disputes on the cheap. The better way to go would be for the government to provide the funding that is required to make sure that the Family Court can get through its backlog of cases rather than having to create a new structure, while it's in the middle of a review, to try to overcome the backlog it has created.


I was interested that, during Senator Cameron's speech in this debate, we saw Senator Hanson repeatedly jump to the defence of Senator Cash. It was notable that—with the exception of Senator Payne, who, I think, once jumped up during Senator Cameron's contribution—no other government senator jumped to Senator Cash's defence, but the person she could rely on over and over again in that speech was Senator Hanson. As we know, Senator Hanson has now got a very long-term deal underway with the government, the Liberals, her own former party. But I was very surprised, as I say, that it was Senator Hanson who kept jumping up, because not only was she one of the signatories to this motion requiring Senator Cash to produce these documents—and, as I say, you would have thought she would have had an interest in actually receiving them—but one of the issues Senator Hanson has been quite vocal on since she was elected is problems with the Family Court that stem from underfunding. So I would have thought that, quite apart from the fact that Senator Hanson was one of the co-signatories to this motion, if she were actually serious about wanting to fix the problems of underfunding in the Family Court, as she says she is, she would actually want to get some answers from Senator Cash. But no.


We know—whether it be on this issue, on penalty rates, on cuts to pensions or on company tax cuts—that what Senator Hanson says when she's outside this chamber and out touring regional Queensland or anywhere else that she goes is very different to what she actually does when she comes to Canberra and votes in the chamber. On penalty rates, she has twice voted with the government to support penalty rate cuts going through and hurting poorer workers in our community. She has repeatedly voted with the government to cut pensions, she has repeatedly voted with the government to cut apprenticeships, and she has even voted with the government to make it easier for construction companies to bring in temporary overseas workers, something that she says that she's against. This is just another example today of something we repeatedly see from Senator Hanson, where she says that she's in favour of one thing when she's out there courting votes, particularly in regional Queensland, but every single time she comes into this chamber she not only votes with her former party, the Liberal Party, but stands up and tries to protect Senator Cash from facing legitimate questions about Senator Cash's own behaviour.


One of these days Senator Hanson is going to realise that she's been caught out. It's one of the reasons that she wasn't successful in the Queensland election and managed only one seat when she and James Ashby were out there claiming at one point that they were going to hold the balance of power, and then they were going to hold 12 seats and then they were going to hold 10 seats. It actually ended up being one, and that's because people in regional Queensland have worked out that Senator Hanson doesn't tell the truth and doesn't back up her words with her actions when she comes down to Canberra.


Having dealt with the Family Court matters that are the subject of this motion, I want to turn to what we are seeing in Senator Cash refusing to comply with this order. It is a continuation of a pattern of behaviour, in particular from Senator Cash but also from other ministers in this government. As Senator Cameron said this morning—Senator Cameron has been here a lot longer than me—he can't remember seeing a government that has so frequently used claims of public interest immunity in order to avoid answering questions and producing documents that are the legitimate subject of questions from this chamber.


Senator Cash is the prime culprit when it comes to this. We all know, and I think everyone in Australia knows, that Senator Cash is in a huge amount of trouble over her office's involvement, potentially her involvement and potentially other ministers' involvement in the scandal around the police raid on union offices that occurred late last year. We know that that is still the subject of an investigation by the Federal Police. What we saw—and what we continue to see—from Senator Cash about that police raid was her continued use of public interest immunity and other mechanisms to avoid answering any questions about her involvement, her office's involvement or the involvement of other ministerial offices in that scandal. It's not going to work. We know that the truth is going to come out, and already the truth is starting to leak out. I have no doubt that, at the end of that police investigation, we will have the full truth, so all that Senator Cash is doing in refusing to answer questions is delaying the inevitable and, frankly, pushing that scandal closer to an election, whenever that might be. I would've thought the government would have wanted to get this as far away from an election as possible, but, in fact, by delaying, all they're doing is making sure that it remains fresh in people's minds, whenever that election might be.


What we saw from Senator Cash during Senate estimates in October last year, when this scandal first broke, was that she used public interest immunity in order to avoid answering questions of senators at Senate estimates. Very conveniently, as soon as the scandal broke, she organised for her friends at the Registered Organisations Commission who had launched this raid to write to the Federal Police and essentially ask whether it was going to be okay to answer questions now that a police investigation was underway, and, dutifully—I'm not impugning the Federal Police—as expected, the Federal Police wrote back and said that these matters would not be the subject of comment by the Federal Police. Of course, Senator Cash and the man now known as Mr Brandis got together and worked out that the best way to avoid these questions was for Senator Cash to say that a police investigation was underway and that she was now not able to comment on the police investigation or any matters connected to it.


Anyone who bothered to read the email that the Federal Police supplied in response to the Registered Organisations Commission and in response to the Senate estimates committee would have noted that what the Federal Police were saying was that they couldn't comment on the investigation. There was nothing in there that said that Senator Cash and other ministers couldn't comment on it. But, of course, we had the man now known as Mr Brandis doing his usual tricks of interpreting words in ways that suit his ends. I'm a lawyer; I've seen people do that, and Mr Brandis, to give him credit, is an expert at exaggerating words to suit his own legal arguments. What they came up with was that Senator Cash was now not able to answer questions about the matters that were under investigation by the Federal Police.


I was shocked to see Senator Cash turn to this as a way of avoiding questions, because what it basically said was that she thought it was better to be under investigation from the Federal Police than it was to answer questions in a Senate estimates committee. I would have thought that any minister would want to be transparent in answering questions, if they had nothing to hide. The last thing you want to do in politics is say that you're under investigation by the police, but Senator Cash chose to argue that she and her office were under investigation by the Federal Police and that that meant that they couldn't answer questions. What a way to look guilty! If you want to look guilty in the eyes of the public, say that you're under investigation by the Federal Police. That's the route Senator Cash chose and continues to take to this day.


We tried to ask questions about it again in estimates recently, at the end of February, and, again, the response was, 'We'd love to tell you what went on there, but the police are still investigating us.' If Senator Cash wants to keep going down the route of arguing to the Australian public that she can't talk about something because the police are investigating her, let her go ahead. Our case is basically proven.


One of the issues that we're still trying to get to the bottom of is other ministerial offices and their involvement in the scandal. We've had the very interesting and Brandisesque, if I might call them that, answers from the now Minister for Human Services, Mr Keenan. Mr Keenan was the Minister for Justice at the time of this raid. He was the minister overseeing the Federal Police. He has been very careful in the answers that he has given in the House of Representatives to questions about the involvement of his office in this. What he has said up until now is that no member of his office was involved in the leak of the information. What he means by that is that no current member of his office was involved in that. Everyone knows that, just like Senator Cash, Minister Keenan has had resignations from his office—people who no longer even work in the government—and he has been very careful to say that no former member of his office was involved in that leak. It won't take us long to work out—there has already been reporting on this—that it was not only Minister Cash's office who were involved in this leak but also Minister Keenan's office, and maybe other ministers' offices as well. 


As long as Senator Cash and other ministers claim to use public interest immunity as a way of avoiding questions about their involvement in this scandal, these questions won't stop. We will keep asking them and we will get to the bottom of it. Minister Cash might decide to use the fact that she and her office are under police investigation as a way of avoiding answering these questions, but it won't work. There is going to come a time when that police investigation is concluded. I have no doubt that it is going to find that this scandal went a lot further than just one member of Senator Cash's office. It is going to find, without doubt, that other ministers' offices were involved and that questions about Senator Cash's own involvement will continue. Senator Cash should stop using public interest immunity to avoid answering questions about the Family Court or her office's involvement in this scandal. 

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Order for the Production of Documents</title>,DOCUMENTS,2,2
"Griff, Sen Stirling",CA,2018-03-28,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (10:16):  How can it be that the entirety of these documents is damaging to the public interest? The Australian already has a copy of the KPMG report. Excerpts and summaries of the report have been published in the paper. Consequently, they are already in the public domain, and the government's ability to support the court does not appear to have been undermined by that publication. The minister representing the Attorney-General's response shows a complete disregard for families navigating their way through the family law system—a system that, in the words of the former Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, is 'letting the people down'. The former Chief Justice went on to say:


The whole system suffers from a lack of resources to get through the work in a satisfactory way.


Those statements were made in 2017, and now, in 2018, very little, if anything, has changed. Only last week, in a ceremonial listing for senior Family Court Judge, Justice Thackray, His Honour said: 


… I've been burning to say these things for years.


His final address to the profession was a searing indictment of this government's continued failure to provide the court with the funding it needs to do its job properly. His Honour called out the government for taking years to replace retiring judges and added his voice to the deafening chorus of calls for an urgent injection of funds to deal with the growing case load and inordinate delays. So we have a senior judge and the former Chief Justice publicly voicing their long-held and very real concerns about the parlous state of the Family Court's funding. How is it then that this government can continue to ignore the repeated calls for funding? How is it that this government thinks that all will be fixed with piecemeal and tokenistic gestures? 


Let's take the extra funding allocated to the court for registrars announced in the 2017 budget: three registrars across three courts and seven states and territory—only three registrars for all three courts. That hasn't even scratched the surface. In the words of former Chief Justice Diana Bryant, matters continue to:


… just sit in the list. That's appalling.


Those are not my words. Those are the words of the former and highly respected Chief Justice of the Family Court, who, in October 2017, called the delays 'appalling'. Barely six months ago, the then Chief Justice of the Family Court was pleading for more funding for a system that is overworked and underresourced—but I don't want to reduce this debate to balance sheets and budgets.


Let's just pause here for a moment and actually think about what is at stake. Let's think about the children and the parents who spend years having their most intimate details laid bare for social scientists, lawyers and judges to dissect and determine. We're not talking about large multinationals crossing swords over abstract contractual principles. These are desperate families dealing with a breakdown in the family unit and all the emotional, financial and logistical complications that flow from that. Delays in the system due to the lack of sufficient resources can only serve to further inflame the conflict. 


Family law disputes are necessarily the consequence of failed hopes, dreams and plans for a shared life. The legal profession and the judiciary, including the former Chief Justice, have all identified the government's failure to replace judges quickly—or, indeed, at all—as a significant factor in the current delays. Let's take Adelaide, my home capital city, as an example. Following the retirement of Justice Dawe, South Australian families have been waiting for over 12 months for a replacement judge. So there is now only one judge available to decide the state's most complex matters—one judge. 


Last week, the Attorney-General confirmed that there was a full complement of judges in the court for the first time in years. How do you then explain to the people of South Australia what one judge will actually do when there used to be two? How do you explain to the people of South Australia that they will have to wait twice as long to get before a judge? Or does the government simply expect the one remaining judge in Adelaide to work twice as hard? Remember, these are complex cases often involving intractable parenting disputes, including allegations of serious physical, sexual and psychological harm or complex property settlements where mum is barely scraping by on welfare payments and child support while she waits for the property settlement to be determined by the next available judge. 


The government needs to acknowledge the failure to replace judges quickly and that the continued failure to replace Justice Dawe has had a snowball effect on separating families. I know this because I've heard too many stories of South Australian families suffering financially and emotionally while they wait and wait and wait on the list. It is not uncommon for matters to spend two years on the Federal Circuit Court waiting for their trial only to be kicked upstairs to the Family Court where they must start once more at the bottom of a very long queue. This is occurring because of the limitations of the FCC and the complexity of certain matters. With only one judge now sitting in the Family Court in Adelaide, matters are taking well over three years to determine. 


We know from the various state and territory law societies and the Law Council of Australia that these stories are not unique to Adelaide. For example, in the Sydney and Parramatta courts, families can wait over three years to get to the final hearing. And what is so frustrating is that we absolutely know that this is not a new problem because, unlike the Senate, TheAustralian actually managed to get a copy of the 2014 KPMG report. What was reported paints a sobering picture of the nation's three federal courts. In an article published on 29 August 2014, The Australian reported an expected $75 million budget as a consequence of the court's structures and complex and increasing caseload. The article said:


The 127-page report, which was handed to the government in March, reveals court costs are rising faster than the money set aside to pay for them, and not enough potential savings remain to cover the shortfall.


""The current challenge now lies in that the pool of potential 'efficiencies' has already been tapped and that it does not appear possible to continue to produce them at the same pace ... without a significant restructure or decline in service levels …


That report was completed four years ago, and there is no indication that the service levels have improved in the meantime. Remember, this is not a customer satisfaction survey for a retail chain. The court is providing a service to separating families. That service is to hear and determine their matter in a fair, efficient and cost-efficient manner.


Our attention then turns to the term 'restructure'. We know the government amalgamated the administrative functions of all three federal courts in order to claw back costs, but what other changes is the government planning? We know from Senate estimates that the Attorney-General has met with the courts to discuss reform. Are the proposed parenting management hearings just the first part of a broader reform that was proposed back in 2014, or is this a quick-fix idea, a last-ditch attempt by the government to salvage a broken system after years of repeatedly ignoring pleas for funding? Remember that these calls for funding are not the disgruntled murmurings of the few; sustained calls for more funding have come from the judiciary, the legal profession, legal aid centres, academics and social workers. And they are based on the limited information available to us from KPMG. 


This is not the first attempt that has been made to seek a copy of the report. We heard during the recent Senate estimates that there was, at that time, an FOI request pending, and, during question time in November 2016, Senator Hanson requested a copy of the report. In response, the then Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, made two points that I'd like to highlight. The first was that the department had relied on these documents to achieve useful efficiencies, and the second was that he would consult with the secretary of his department to see what he could make available. So, here we are, 18 months later, and we must now all surely be questioning what impact, if any, the so-called useful efficiencies have had on the current logjam in the courts. 


But that is the point: we simply do not know. We don't have the full picture, and the government does not want us to know. So, how can we be expected to consider the Family Law Amendment (Parenting Management Hearings) Bill in a vacuum, when the government has sold this bill to the Senate as a new justice model, promising swift and cost-effective dispute resolution for all? And it is for all, notwithstanding Senator Brandis's response to my question in December 2017: these parenting management hearings will in fact be used in cases of family violence. 


The government's proposal is a significant departure from existing family court procedures. It is an untested social experiment being thrust upon unsuspecting participants that is binding on them and their children. These are people who will have to deal with the consequences for many years to come. It may be a pilot program for the government, but make no mistake: for the estimated 500 families and the 1,000 children affected, it will be permanent. It also comes at a significant cost of over $12 million—just for a pilot program. 


I asked the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, about the timing of the reforms in December 2017, and yet again I find myself asking: why is the government choosing to legislate now, before the Australian Law Reform Commission has completed the long-awaited review into the family law system? If the government were serious about the review and about helping vulnerable Australians through one of the worst periods of their lives, it would wait for the recommendations of the ALRC before thrusting yet another layer of complexity on an already overburdened system, especially when we know that, as part of its terms of references, the ALRC will be looking at 'the appropriate, early and cost-effective resolution of all family law disputes' and 'the pressures, including, in particular, financial pressures, on courts exercising family law jurisdiction'. I would expect that, as part of that investigation into financial pressures facing the courts, the government will ensure that the KPMG and Ernst & Young reports are provided to the ALRC. 


The government has available to it two presumably comprehensive reports which set out the financial pressures the Family Court is facing, and presumably the range of possible options that were available to the government at the time. The time has now come for the government to produce the reports: first, to the Senate, to enable a proper consideration of the merits of the parenting management hearings bill, and, second, to the ALRC, to better enable the commission to consider the financial pressures facing the family law system pursuant to its terms of reference.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:29):  I've had a quick look at the minister's response to the OPD and I will express a preliminarily view. But, before I express that view, I want to make it clear that there is no constitutional impediment to this chamber making an inquiry into the administration of the courts. We must of course respect the need to steer clear of matters related to legal proceedings, but the issue of appropriate resourcing for the courts is fairly and squarely within the purview of this chamber. The letter tabled seems to make a claim that does not fit within the accepted public interest immunity claims—and I refer the Senate to pages 662 and 667 of Odgers—but it does fall within the grounds that are not accepted by the Senate, again on pages 667 and 669. I will look at this letter, consider it and come back to the chamber in due course, but I do want to state that it is for the Senate to accept or not accept a public interest immunity. If it does not accept it then it can use its powers to enforce the order. This may become a test for both the government and the Senate in this instance.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-03-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:30):  Governments should be of the people and for the people; that is a fundamental democratic principle. Part of that fundamental democratic principle is respecting the right of the people to have access to information that underpins government decision making. This government uses public interest immunity claims almost reflexively to deny not only this chamber and members of the Senate but the Australian people the capacity to hold them to account and to more fully understand information on which the government's decisions are made. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the immigration portfolio around what the government describes as 'on-water matters'. The government also regularly uses public interest immunity claims to draw a veil of secrecy over the horrors of what is happening to people on Manus Island and Nauru who remain in Australia's duty of care.


We've had a quick look at the letter provided to the Senate today by Minister Cash. The Greens, on face value, do not accept the claim of public interest immunity made in that letter. It is quite clearly outside the grounds laid out in Odgers, as Senator Patrick has stated, and in fact—again, as Senator Patrick has stated—falls clearly within the grounds that ought not, under precedents set by this chamber in the past and advice from the Clerk to this chamber in the past, be accepted by this chamber. We stand ready to work with this Senate to ensure that the information that the government is continually trying to keep secret is made public, and we do that on behalf of our democracy, on behalf of the people who put us into this place with their votes and on behalf of the supremacy of the parliament over the executive government. We will work across party lines to ensure that claims like this are tested and to ensure that, where the Senate does not accept claims of public interest immunity, further action is taken on behalf of the right of the Australian people to have the capacity to more fully understand decisions the government makes.

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order! It being 10.33, the time for this debate has expired. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Cameron be agreed to.


Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Order for the Production of Documents</title>,DOCUMENTS,2,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-03-28,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:33):  I am pleased to speak briefly in relation to this bill, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. As senators are aware, the bill follows the 2017Independent intelligence review that was commissioned by the government to examine the roles of the Office of National Assessments, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Signals Directorate, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. The review further examined the relationship and engagement between those agencies and other members of the broader national intelligence community, including the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.


The review made a number of recommendations, including that the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD, become a statutory authority within the Defence portfolio, that ASD's priority role of supporting the Australian Defence Force capabilities be clearly reaffirmed, that ASD's legislative mandate be amended to explicitly recognise its national responsibilities for cybersecurity, including the provision of advice to the private sector, and that ASD take formal responsibility for the Australian Cyber Security Centre.


The bill broadly serves to implement these recommendations. It will establish ASD as an independent statutory authority within the Defence portfolio, reporting directly to the Minister for Defence. ASD will continue to play a vital role in supporting both the ADF capabilities and the national intelligence collection requirements. ASD's functions will be expanded to include the Australian Cyber Security Centre and allow the ACSC to cooperate with persons and bodies listed in the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and, significantly, to advise and assist businesses and the community directly.


The bill will also enable the transfer of the Computer Emergency Response Team and its functions relating to cyber policy and security from the Attorney-General's Department to ASD. Significantly, the bill establishes new functions for the ASD, including to prevent and disrupt, by electronic or similar means, cybercrimes by people or organisations outside of Australia and to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions.


The bill has been examined by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, which has recommended that the bill be passed. I and my NXT colleague Senator Griff are pleased to support the bill as a necessary and desirable measure to strengthen a vital national intelligence collection agency. However, dealing as it does with amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001, this bill also provides an opportunity for me to foreshadow a major issue that we intend to pursue when the Senate debates further elements of the government's latest tranche of national security reforms.


I've spoken previously about the importance of a well-resourced and capable intelligence community to protect Australia's national interests and the importance of improving parliamentary oversight. As those agencies are given more resources, more power and more responsibility the mechanisms of oversight should be similarly reinforced. In a speech to the Senate last December I highlighted the need for parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence community to extend beyond questions of administration and finance to matters of policy, effectiveness and, as necessary from time to time, operational matters.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is currently severely limited in the scope of its oversight role, which is largely limited to questions of administration and finance, as I've suggested. Specifically, the committee is prohibited from reviewing intelligence-gathering and assessment priorities of the Australian intelligence community. It is barred from examining sources of information, other operational assistance, operational methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by the Australian intelligence community.


The PJCIS may not review the content of or conclusions reached in assessments or reports made by the Defence Intelligence Organisation or the Office of National Assessments, nor may it review the coordination and evaluation activities undertaken by the ONA. The committee is prohibited from reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been or are proposed to be undertaken by the Australian Federal Police. Significantly, the PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by the minister under section 15 of the Intelligence Services Act, which are the written rules regulating the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons.


These limitations of the extent of parliamentary oversight are very extensive and reflect an underlying bureaucratic mindset that MPs and senators, elected representatives of the people, cannot be trusted with our nation's most sensitive national security information. This is not the approach taken in other countries, including Australia's intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the US intelligence community as necessary and appropriate.


No doubt there are details of intelligence operations, especially human intelligence operations, involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. There may well be cases for a ministerial veto on the PJCIS's access to some specific operational information. As I pointed out to the Senate in December, in Canada, the new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is able to review any activity carried out by a department or intelligence agency that relates to national security or intelligence unless that activity is an ongoing operation and the appropriate minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security. If the appropriate Canadian minister determines that a review would be injurious to national security, he or she must inform the committee of his or her determination and the reasons for it. If the appropriate minister determines that the review would no longer be injurious to national security, or if the appropriate minister is informed that the activity is no longer ongoing, he or she must inform the committee that the review may be conducted.


The Canadian parliamentary intelligence oversight arrangements have considerable merit. They have been adopted by a so-called Five Eyes partner with an intelligence community and parliamentary system very similar to our own. The Canadian approach could provide an enhanced framework for the PJCIS's oversight of our intelligence agencies, with the added provision that any ministerial veto over review of an operational matter should be referred to the IJIS for review and a report to both the PJCIS and the Prime Minister. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then something is wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it ultimately means to serve.


The Senate will in due course debate further legislation to give effect to the government's further responses to the intelligence review's recommendations and to strengthen our laws to protect Australia against espionage and covert foreign interference. The government will be seeking the support of the opposition and the crossbenchers. That legislation should be subject to rigorous scrutiny and debate by the Senate. NXT will consider that legislation on its merits, but we will push hard for operational oversight of the intelligence services by the parliament because the time for such scrutiny is both necessary and long overdue. We will take the opportunity to press for amendments to the Intelligence Services Act to provide for an expanded PJCIS oversight of all intelligence activities including operational matters. If the government want to increase the powers and the responsibilities of our intelligence agencies, which, again, I and my colleagues broadly support, then they must be prepared to strengthen the role of the parliament in overseeing those agencies to ensure they are truly defenders of our national interest and, indeed, the Australian people.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2018-03-28,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (10:43):  I'd like to thank senators for their contribution to the debate and their support for the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. I would also like to thank the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for their consideration and recommendation in support of the bill and also acknowledge those who provided submissions to the committee expressing their support for the bill.


The Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018 implements the recommendations of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review. That review recommended that ASD be established as an independent statutory agency within the Defence portfolio reporting directly to the Minister for Defence. This was endorsed by government. The report of the intelligence review was very clear in its views in ensuring that ASD is best structured into the future to meet its responsibilities and the requirements of government. In this context, the review noted:


… ASD will be better placed if it remains in the Defence portfolio but if it is in a position to operate with greater independence from the Department’s requirements, especially those in relation to its capacity to recruit, retain, train, develop and remunerate its specialist staff.


The review continued:


For ASD, the option of continuing to operate within the Department of Defence’s employment framework, even with some specific exemptions, is not the most effective way forward. It would increase the risk of losing additional critical talent, skills and capabilities. ASD needs to be more in control of its own destiny.


Noting those comments, it is also important that I make this point: the bill does not seek to alter the indispensable relationship that ASD has with the Department of Defence and, in particular, with the Australian Defence Force. Underpinning the closeness and the enduring nature of the relationship between ASD and the ADF—and consistent with recommendation 6(c) of the intelligence review—the agency now has for the first time a principal deputy director, who will become the principal deputy director-general with the passage of this bill, position that is filled by a three-star military officer. The creation of this position will ensure that, after 1 July 2018, ASD's primary support to the ADF continues.


The bill does not alter the primacy of ASD's foreign signals intelligence responsibilities as well as the use of its offensive cyberwar fighting capabilities and cybersecurity expertise in its critical support of military operations. Through the implementation of the recommendations of the intelligence review, ASD's functions to provide this support to military operations remain unchanged.


In relation to the employment of staff, ASD will operate outside the Public Service Act framework. This will provide ASD with greater flexibility to recognise the skills of its specialised workforce and to retain those with highly sought after skills, such as those with science, technology, engineering and maths qualifications in particular. While operating outside the Public Service Act framework, ASD will adopt the principles of the Public Service Act with regard to its employees to the extent that the Director-General of ASD considers they are consistent with the effective performance of the functions of the directorate.


I would like to briefly touch on a matter raised by the committee with regard to providing greater clarity to staff around employment conditions. I can assure the Senate and the staff of ASD that workplace agreements and staff entitlements, including mobility rights and maternity leave benefits, will not be adversely affected by the establishment of ASD as a statutory agency. In particular, the incoming Director-General of ASD will work with the Australian Public Service Commissioner to make sure that the redeployment register continues to be available to excess ASD employees. To ensure that employees will retain access to maternity leave entitlements, the government and ASD are working towards amending the regulations in the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973, with ASD actively working towards the necessary changes occurring before it becomes an independent statutory agency on 1 July.


The bill also includes an additional function for ASD to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions. ASD can't perform its important functions without being able to protect its tools to ensure their ongoing utility, which ultimately helps to protect Australia's national interests. The bill also makes a number of transitional provisions to ensure that the good governance of ASD continues during the implementation of the new arrangements.


Importantly, the bill also strengthens the oversight and transparency arrangements for ASD. As an independent statutory agency, ASD will have new corporate reporting obligations, in particular through meeting the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. In turn, ASD will have its own component of the Defence portfolio budget statements, and officers will attend Senate estimates hearings not as part of the Department of Defence but as a separate statutory entity. ASD will be required to publicly report on its performance through the release of an annual report.


The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is a critically important element of Australia's oversight arrangements for the intelligence community to ensure that all relevant agencies are operating legally and with propriety. Through the implementation of recommendation 22 of the Independent intelligence review, the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have its resourcing significantly increased to ensure that it can continue its important work as the scale and complexity of the operations of agencies like ASD increases.


The establishment of ASD as a statutory authority puts the agency on a similar footing to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as a national security and intelligence asset. Given the critical operational support that ASD provides to the Australian Defence Force, and its increased national responsibilities in relation to cybersecurity, ASD will now have the appropriate statutory functions to ensure it is well placed to support ADF operations as well as its responsibilities for combatting cybercrime, including the provision of advice to the private sector into the future. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:33):  I am pleased to speak briefly in relation to this bill, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. As senators are aware, the bill follows the 2017Independent intelligence review that was commissioned by the government to examine the roles of the Office of National Assessments, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Signals Directorate, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. The review further examined the relationship and engagement between those agencies and other members of the broader national intelligence community, including the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.


The review made a number of recommendations, including that the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD, become a statutory authority within the Defence portfolio, that ASD's priority role of supporting the Australian Defence Force capabilities be clearly reaffirmed, that ASD's legislative mandate be amended to explicitly recognise its national responsibilities for cybersecurity, including the provision of advice to the private sector, and that ASD take formal responsibility for the Australian Cyber Security Centre.


The bill broadly serves to implement these recommendations. It will establish ASD as an independent statutory authority within the Defence portfolio, reporting directly to the Minister for Defence. ASD will continue to play a vital role in supporting both the ADF capabilities and the national intelligence collection requirements. ASD's functions will be expanded to include the Australian Cyber Security Centre and allow the ACSC to cooperate with persons and bodies listed in the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and, significantly, to advise and assist businesses and the community directly.


The bill will also enable the transfer of the Computer Emergency Response Team and its functions relating to cyber policy and security from the Attorney-General's Department to ASD. Significantly, the bill establishes new functions for the ASD, including to prevent and disrupt, by electronic or similar means, cybercrimes by people or organisations outside of Australia and to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions.


The bill has been examined by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, which has recommended that the bill be passed. I and my NXT colleague Senator Griff are pleased to support the bill as a necessary and desirable measure to strengthen a vital national intelligence collection agency. However, dealing as it does with amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001, this bill also provides an opportunity for me to foreshadow a major issue that we intend to pursue when the Senate debates further elements of the government's latest tranche of national security reforms.


I've spoken previously about the importance of a well-resourced and capable intelligence community to protect Australia's national interests and the importance of improving parliamentary oversight. As those agencies are given more resources, more power and more responsibility the mechanisms of oversight should be similarly reinforced. In a speech to the Senate last December I highlighted the need for parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence community to extend beyond questions of administration and finance to matters of policy, effectiveness and, as necessary from time to time, operational matters.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is currently severely limited in the scope of its oversight role, which is largely limited to questions of administration and finance, as I've suggested. Specifically, the committee is prohibited from reviewing intelligence-gathering and assessment priorities of the Australian intelligence community. It is barred from examining sources of information, other operational assistance, operational methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by the Australian intelligence community.


The PJCIS may not review the content of or conclusions reached in assessments or reports made by the Defence Intelligence Organisation or the Office of National Assessments, nor may it review the coordination and evaluation activities undertaken by the ONA. The committee is prohibited from reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been or are proposed to be undertaken by the Australian Federal Police. Significantly, the PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by the minister under section 15 of the Intelligence Services Act, which are the written rules regulating the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons.


These limitations of the extent of parliamentary oversight are very extensive and reflect an underlying bureaucratic mindset that MPs and senators, elected representatives of the people, cannot be trusted with our nation's most sensitive national security information. This is not the approach taken in other countries, including Australia's intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the US intelligence community as necessary and appropriate.


No doubt there are details of intelligence operations, especially human intelligence operations, involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. There may well be cases for a ministerial veto on the PJCIS's access to some specific operational information. As I pointed out to the Senate in December, in Canada, the new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is able to review any activity carried out by a department or intelligence agency that relates to national security or intelligence unless that activity is an ongoing operation and the appropriate minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security. If the appropriate Canadian minister determines that a review would be injurious to national security, he or she must inform the committee of his or her determination and the reasons for it. If the appropriate minister determines that the review would no longer be injurious to national security, or if the appropriate minister is informed that the activity is no longer ongoing, he or she must inform the committee that the review may be conducted.


The Canadian parliamentary intelligence oversight arrangements have considerable merit. They have been adopted by a so-called Five Eyes partner with an intelligence community and parliamentary system very similar to our own. The Canadian approach could provide an enhanced framework for the PJCIS's oversight of our intelligence agencies, with the added provision that any ministerial veto over review of an operational matter should be referred to the IJIS for review and a report to both the PJCIS and the Prime Minister. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then something is wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it ultimately means to serve.

 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:50):  I present the government’s response to the advisory report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on its inquiry into the Security and Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
'
s Advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017





Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs, in consultation with the Department of Defence and the Department of the Environment and Energy, review and develop measures to ensure that Australia has a continuous supply of fuel to meet its national security priorities. As part of developed measures, the Department should consider whether critical fuel assets should be subject to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017.


The Committee considers that the Department should conclude this review within 6 months.


The Department should brief the Committee on the outcomes of the review following its conclusion.


The Government accepts this recommendation in-principle


The risk of espionage, sabotage and coercive influence in Australia's domestic liquid fuel refinement part of the supply chain has been assessed as relatively low, due to the sector's diversity and the resilience of the market system to respond to any disruption at a particular location. However, the sector is heavily reliant on imports, and critical port infrastructure. The infrastructure at ports that support imports of liquid fuel was a key factor in determining which ports are captured by the Bill. The critical ports captured by the Bill provide 92% of total liquid fuels imports.


The Department of Defence has significant operational and strategic fuel holdings compared to most commercial organisations, and has sufficient fuel to meet our current and expected commitments in the present strategic circumstances.


Notwithstanding these factors, the Government agrees that fuel supply is a critical issue. As such, the Committee's concerns, including whether liquid fuel assets should be covered by the Bill, will be considered in the next National Energy Security Assessment. This work will be led by the Department of the Environment and Energy, in close consultation with the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Defence.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs examine the viability of developing a common data entry portal for use across Commonwealth, state and territory databases that require information from the same reporting entities.


The Government accepts this recommendation in-principle.


The Department of Home Affairs will consider options to streamline the provision of information required for the Bill where that information is already provided by industry to government for other purposes. The Department notes legislative restrictions on how information can be obtained and shared, including across jurisdictions, may limit the extent to which data collection may be streamlined.


Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017




Recommendations 3 and 5




Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs develop guidelines for entities subject to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017. The guidelines should:


enable an entity to determine whether it is a reporting entity, and


provide the entity with an understanding of the specific information it is required to report. These guidelines should be made available prior to the end of the three-month transition period.



Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs include in guidelines to be developed for entities subject to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017, information regarding:


the high-level criteria by which the Department will assess risk, and


the process and the engagement that entities should reasonably expect from the Department as part of a risk


assessment.


The Government accepts these recommendations.


The Government is committed to developing and releasing guidance to support the implementation of the Bill to ensure stakeholders understand their obligations and responsibilities. Specifically, these guidelines will:


ensure stakeholders understand the operation, functions and processes of the Bill


enable an entity to determine whether it is the reporting entity


assist a reporting entity with registering on the Register of Critical Infrastructure Assets by providing step-by-step guidance, including detailing the specific information required to be reported


provide high-level criteria by which the Critical Infrastructure Centre will assess foreign involvement risks in critical infrastructure assets, including the process and the engagement entities should reasonably expect as part of a risk assessment, and


provide best practice guidance to assist entities to proactively safeguard their assets from national security risks.


These guidance documents will be available to stakeholders prior to the end of the three-month period before the Bill's commencement.




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to more appropriately define direct interest holder in order to capture the intended full range of ownership arrangements.


Further, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Bill should clarify that:


moneylenders are not direct interest holders, where they hold an interest in a critical infrastructure asset through a financing arrangement, and


intermediate and ultimate holding entities are not direct interest holders.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will move amendments to the Bill to ensure it more clearly requires a direct interest holder to report on the Register of Critical Infrastructure Assets information relating to all intermediate and other holding entities who are in a position to directly or indirectly influence and control the direct interest holder. The Government will move amendments to the Bill to explicitly


Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017


define the term 'influence or control' based on the existing guidance in the Explanatory Memorandum.


The Government will also move amendments to clause 8 in the Bill to include a limited carve-out of moneylenders as direct interest holders. The carve-out will apply where the moneylender's interest in the asset is:


held solely by way of security for the purposes of a moneylending agreement, and


the moneylender is not in a position to directly or indirectly influence or control the asset.


The exemption will not apply if the moneylender, by taking security or by enforcing that security, acquires the ability to influence or control a critical infrastructure asset.


The Government will provide further detailed guidance and examples in the Explanatory Memorandum to demonstrate how the amended provisions are intended to operate.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to list the factors that the Secretary must have regard to, when deciding whether to disclose protected information under sections 42 and 43 of the Bill. Factors should include:


whether the disclosure is consistent with the objects of the Bill, and


whether the purpose of the disclosure is proportionate to the sensitivity of the information being disclosed.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will clarify in the Addendum Explanatory Memorandum that when determining whether to disclosure protected information under clause 42 and 43, the Secretary should have regard to whether the disclosure is consistent with the objects of the Bill and is proportionate to the sensitivity of the information disclosed.




Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to clarify that the Bill does not affect the operation of existing privacy obligations.


In particular, the Explanatory Memorandum should clarify that section 39 does not affect the operation of Australian Privacy Principle 11.2 and the Department of Home Affairs, as the administering agency, would need to destroy personal information if it was no longer necessary.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will provide further clarity in the Addendum Explanatory Memorandum to specify that once the Secretary deems that information provided under clause 37 is no longer required for the purpose for which it was provided, reasonable steps will be required to be taken to destroy that information or ensure the information is de-identified. Specifically, the explanatory memorandum will be amended to state the Secretary must have consideration for the Australian Privacy Principle 11 in determining if it is appropriate to retain personal information, and, accordingly, if reasonable steps are required to be taken to destroy that information or ensure the information is de-identified.


Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to require the relevant Minister to provide, to the subject entity, notice of an adverse security assessment given in connection to the Bill and merits review rights.



The Committee considers that the Bill should be amended to align with requirements under section 38A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will move amendments to the Security of Critical infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017 to ensure the notification requirements in section 38A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1975 also apply to an adverse security assessment given in connection with clause 32(2) of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill. This amendment aligns the notice requirements for an adverse security assessment relating to the directions power in the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill with similar requirements to be included in the Telecommunications Act 1997. Specifically it will require the Minister, within 14 days of receiving the adverse security assessment, to provide the assessed person with written notice of the assessment (including a copy of the assessment) and information on his or her right to apply for merits review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Notice of the adverse security assessment will not be able to be withheld from the assessed person, only parts of the assessment itself may be withheld or redacted if disclosure of that part would be prejudicial to the interests of security.




Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to require the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the reforms, commencing within three years of the Bill receiving Royal Assent.


The review should consider the appropriateness of a unified scheme to cover all critical infrastructure assets, including telecommunications assets.


The review should also consider circumstances that the Minister has used the private declaration power under section 51.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will move amendments to include a review mechanism requiring the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the Bill, commencing within three years of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. The proposed review provision will specifically require the Committee to consider the:


operation, effectiveness and implications of the Bill


appropriateness of a unified scheme to cover all critical infrastructure assets, including telecommunications assets, and


circumstances that the Minister has used the private declaration power under section 51.

As such, the Committee's concerns, including whether liquid fuel assets should be covered by the Bill, will be considered in the next National Energy Security Assessment. This work will be led by the Department of the Environment and Energy, in close consultation with the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Defence.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs examine the viability of developing a common data entry portal for use across Commonwealth, state and territory databases that require information from the same reporting entities.


The Government accepts this recommendation in-principle.


The Department of Home Affairs will consider options to streamline the provision of information required for the Bill where that information is already provided by industry to government for other purposes. The Department notes legislative restrictions on how information can be obtained and shared, including across jurisdictions, may limit the extent to which data collection may be streamlined.

Recommendations 3 and 5




Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs develop guidelines for entities subject to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017. The guidelines should:


enable an entity to determine whether it is a reporting entity, and


provide the entity with an understanding of the specific information it is required to report. These guidelines should be made available prior to the end of the three-month transition period.



Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that the Department of Home Affairs include in guidelines to be developed for entities subject to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017, information regarding:


the high-level criteria by which the Department will assess risk, and


the process and the engagement that entities should reasonably expect from the Department as part of a risk


assessment.


The Government accepts these recommendations.


The Government is committed to developing and releasing guidance to support the implementation of the Bill to ensure stakeholders understand their obligations and responsibilities. Specifically, these guidelines will:


ensure stakeholders understand the operation, functions and processes of the Bill


enable an entity to determine whether it is the reporting entity


assist a reporting entity with registering on the Register of Critical Infrastructure Assets by providing step-by-step guidance, including detailing the specific information required to be reported


provide high-level criteria by which the Critical Infrastructure Centre will assess foreign involvement risks in critical infrastructure assets, including the process and the engagement entities should reasonably expect as part of a risk assessment, and


provide best practice guidance to assist entities to proactively safeguard their assets from national security risks.


These guidance documents will be available to stakeholders prior to the end of the three-month period before the Bill's commencement.




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to more appropriately define direct interest holder in order to capture the intended full range of ownership arrangements.


Further, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Bill should clarify that:


moneylenders are not direct interest holders, where they hold an interest in a critical infrastructure asset through a financing arrangement, and


intermediate and ultimate holding entities are not direct interest holders.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will move amendments to the Bill to ensure it more clearly requires a direct interest holder to report on the Register of Critical Infrastructure Assets information relating to all intermediate and other holding entities who are in a position to directly or indirectly influence and control the direct interest holder. The Government will move amendments to the Bill to explicitly


Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017


define the term 'influence or control' based on the existing guidance in the Explanatory Memorandum.


The Government will also move amendments to clause 8 in the Bill to include a limited carve-out of moneylenders as direct interest holders. The carve-out will apply where the moneylender's interest in the asset is:


held solely by way of security for the purposes of a moneylending agreement, and


the moneylender is not in a position to directly or indirectly influence or control the asset.


The exemption will not apply if the moneylender, by taking security or by enforcing that security, acquires the ability to influence or control a critical infrastructure asset.


The Government will provide further detailed guidance and examples in the Explanatory Memorandum to demonstrate how the amended provisions are intended to operate.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to list the factors that the Secretary must have regard to, when deciding whether to disclose protected information under sections 42 and 43 of the Bill. Factors should include:


whether the disclosure is consistent with the objects of the Bill, and


whether the purpose of the disclosure is proportionate to the sensitivity of the information being disclosed.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will clarify in the Addendum Explanatory Memorandum that when determining whether to disclosure protected information under clause 42 and 43, the Secretary should have regard to whether the disclosure is consistent with the objects of the Bill and is proportionate to the sensitivity of the information disclosed.




Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to clarify that the Bill does not affect the operation of existing privacy obligations.


In particular, the Explanatory Memorandum should clarify that section 39 does not affect the operation of Australian Privacy Principle 11.2 and the Department of Home Affairs, as the administering agency, would need to destroy personal information if it was no longer necessary.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will provide further clarity in the Addendum Explanatory Memorandum to specify that once the Secretary deems that information provided under clause 37 is no longer required for the purpose for which it was provided, reasonable steps will be required to be taken to destroy that information or ensure the information is de-identified. Specifically, the explanatory memorandum will be amended to state the Secretary must have consideration for the Australian Privacy Principle 11 in determining if it is appropriate to retain personal information, and, accordingly, if reasonable steps are required to be taken to destroy that information or ensure the information is de-identified.


Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to require the relevant Minister to provide, to the subject entity, notice of an adverse security assessment given in connection to the Bill and merits review rights.



The Committee considers that the Bill should be amended to align with requirements under section 38A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will move amendments to the Security of Critical infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017 to ensure the notification requirements in section 38A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1975 also apply to an adverse security assessment given in connection with clause 32(2) of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill. This amendment aligns the notice requirements for an adverse security assessment relating to the directions power in the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill with similar requirements to be included in the Telecommunications Act 1997. Specifically it will require the Minister, within 14 days of receiving the adverse security assessment, to provide the assessed person with written notice of the assessment (including a copy of the assessment) and information on his or her right to apply for merits review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Notice of the adverse security assessment will not be able to be withheld from the assessed person, only parts of the assessment itself may be withheld or redacted if disclosure of that part would be prejudicial to the interests of security.




Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 be amended to require the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the reforms, commencing within three years of the Bill receiving Royal Assent.


The review should consider the appropriateness of a unified scheme to cover all critical infrastructure assets, including telecommunications assets.


The review should also consider circumstances that the Minister has used the private declaration power under section 51.


The Government accepts this recommendation.


The Government will move amendments to include a review mechanism requiring the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the Bill, commencing within three years of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. The proposed review provision will specifically require the Committee to consider the:


operation, effectiveness and implications of the Bill


appropriateness of a unified scheme to cover all critical infrastructure assets, including telecommunications assets, and


circumstances that the Minister has used the private declaration power under section 51.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:51):  Whether in government or in opposition, Labor has consistently worked to ensure that our security agencies have the powers and resources they need to keep our community safe and that our laws are adapted to meet the changing security threats that we face. Consistent with its commitment to national security, Labor supports the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017.


We support these bills because we recognise the need to manage national security risks arising from the possibility of malicious foreign involvement in our critical infrastructure. Labor believe that these bills strike an appropriate balance. They impose only the necessary and relatively minor regulatory requirements needed to improve the management of the national security risks that threats to our critical infrastructure pose. The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill provides a risk based regulatory framework to manage national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure. The bill focuses primarily on the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia's highest risk, critical infrastructure sectors of electricity, gas, ports and water.


Labor recognises that foreign involvement in the economy, and in Australian infrastructure, plays an important and beneficial role in supporting economic growth, creating employment opportunities, improving consumer choice and promoting healthy competition while increasing Australia's competitiveness in global markets. However, with increased privatisation, outsourcing and offshoring of supply chain arrangements, and the shift in Australia's international investment profile, critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion. This bill is an appropriate step to inhibit malicious conduct undertaken covertly which may have implications for Australian society.


Labor will always ensure that critical infrastructure assets, where they are partly owned by foreign entities, are still subject to control and direction by the Commonwealth. It is fundamental to the maintenance of the security, safety and prosperity of Australians that critical assets are required to provide relevant information to government and that, in times of emergency, they can be directed to ensure that the needs of Australian society are met. This was a sentiment shared by state and territory governments and industry and peak organisations who expressed support for the bill in submissions to the PJCIS.


The bill designates water, electricity, gas and ports above a certain threshold as critical assets. The bill defines a critical water asset under proposed section 5 as:


… a water or sewerage system or network that is used to ultimately deliver services to at least 100,000 water connections or 100,000 sewerage connections under the management of a water utility.


It is axiomatic that all Australians require a clean and reliable supply of water and that disruption to Australia's water supply or water treatment facilities could have major consequences for the health of citizens and the economy.


Similarly, the bill, in subclause 10(1)(a), establishes the test for criticality of an electricity asset as: 


(a) a network, system, or interconnector, for the transmission or distribution of electricity to … service at least 100,000 customers … 


Electricity generation is fundamental to the proper functioning of the economy and is a basic necessity for all Australians. It is clear that electricity assets which provide transmission and distribution services form a core part of the nation's critical infrastructure.


Clause 12 of the bill defines a critical gas asset as:


(a) a gas processing facility that has a capacity of at least 300 terajoules per day … 


(b) a gas storage facility that has a maximum daily quantity of 75 terajoules per day … 


(c) a network or system for the distribution of gas to ultimately service at least 100,000 customers or …


(d) a gas transmission pipeline that is critical to ensuring the security and reliability of a gas market …


It is self-evident that gas in Australia is an important energy source. It is an increasing export commodity and a required element for a wide range of industrial, commercial and residential uses. Gas is particularly important for gas-powered electricity generators, which account for 20 per cent of Australia's electricity, and manufacturing, which relies on gas for approximately 40 per cent of net energy. These are numbers that, as Australia transitions to a clean energy economy, we expect to grow. Accordingly, the protection of gas infrastructure as a critical asset will grow, not diminish, over time. By defining the level of criticality, the bill limits the regulatory burden to Australia's highest risk critical assets.


The bill will supplement the existing FIRB mechanism through which the Commonwealth can respond to risks. However, because the FIRB mechanism applies to foreign investment above certain thresholds at the time of the proposed transaction, it is not possible to use it as a mechanism to address risks in outsourcing or offshoring of assets owned by domestic entities or where sales fall outside of the FIRB's screening thresholds. Accordingly, the creation of the security of critical infrastructure framework will improve upon existing safeguards which protect critical assets.


In practice, the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill will add to the work currently undertaken by the Critical Infrastructure Centre, which collaborates with asset owners, asset operators and state and territory regulators to identify risks, implement asset-specific mitigation strategies and develop sector-wide best-practice guidelines. The CIC engages with asset owners and operators through the Trusted Information Sharing Network, TISN, and directly as needed. This is a welcome addition to the regulatory architecture that protects and maintains assets critical to Australia's security and continuing economic and social wellbeing.


The PJCIS conducted an inquiry into this bill. We spoke to a range of stakeholders and other interested parties. The committee made nine recommendations, the majority of which relate to the implementation of the bill rather than its design or intentions. I note that in the government's response to the committee's report, which was tabled just now, the government has accepted all of the committee's recommendations and has circulated amendments and a supplementary explanatory memorandum in the chamber to give effect to these recommendations. Labor too supports the recommendations of the committee.


Regulatory schemes such as that proposed in the bill work best in the presence of an active and productive dialogue between government and the affected industry participants. Industry, government and the community all benefit when asset owners know in advance what is required of them and therefore can take the necessary steps without government needing to resort to regulatory intervention. The PJCIS report recommends sensible steps to ensure that such a dialogue is established in the implementation of this bill. It responds to evidence that was provided to the committee from industry stakeholders. I would like to take the opportunity to thank those stakeholders for their contribution to the committee's work. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-03-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:59):  The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 introduces, in essence, two new measures: a register of critical infrastructure and ministerial directions powers. The bill will apply to approximately 140 assets in the high-risk electricity, water, gas and ports sectors. According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill focuses primarily on the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia's highest-risk critical infrastructure sectors and provides 'a risk based regulatory framework to manage national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure'.


The purpose of the register is to provide a more detailed understanding of who owns and controls critical infrastructure assets. I'll make some observations about ownership of critical infrastructure later in my speech. The register requires reporting entities who are either direct interest holders or the responsible entity of critical infrastructure assets to provide interest and control information and operational information within a certain time frame. The explanatory memorandum states:


This information will assist the Government to identify who owns and controls the asset, its board structure, ownership rights of interest holders, and operational, outsourcing and offshoring information.


I note the government has proposed several amendments to this bill that implement recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


In January 2017, the Australian government established the Critical Infrastructure Centre and stated that the centre was established in response to the complex and evolving national security risks to critical infrastructure. But it ought come as no surprise to the Australian people that the government has abjectly failed to meaningfully consider one of the biggest threats to critical infrastructure in this country, and that is climate change. It's not just the direct risk of increasing levels of climate risk that will be the problem in the future. In a submission to the Critical Infrastructure Centre in March 2017, the CSIRO wrote:


We provide the following comments to note that the discussion paper is silent on the potential effects of global environmental change, particularly climate change, in systematically altering the risks faced by critical infrastructure from the range of security-related sources …


The CSIRO went on to say in their submission:


… climate change may be exacerbating some of the drivers of the key security risks addressed in the current paper, for example, placing greater pressure on foreign interests to consider espionage, sabotage or even coercion, because of growing pressures on the resources of those foreign interests.


It's not only this bill that doesn't mention climate change as a risk; in fact, the government's Critical infrastructure resilience strategy: plan is astoundingly silent on climate change. Australia ought not, and the government ought not, ignore the risks to national security and the risks to infrastructure posed by the disruption of our planet's climate. The ARC's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes recently stated:


Australia lags behind the US and some European countries in examining, assessing and responding to climate change risks in terms of national security. Vulnerabilities associated with national security and climate change are already increasing and exist now. These are not ""future issues"" that can be left for a decade before strategies are considered. The creation of a high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security is urgent and overdue.


It is important to acknowledge that the 2016 Department of Defence white paper did identify climate change as one of the six key drivers in the development of Australia's security environment and as 'a major challenge for countries in Australia's immediate region'.


While that's the case, it appears the government has no plan and no appetite to do anything about our vulnerabilities in the areas of national security and infrastructure caused by climate disruption. Instead, it's been left to the Australian Greens, through the mechanisms available to us in this parliament, to establish two inquiries, which are currently running through Senate committees, into the impact of climate change and the threats posed by climate change to infrastructure and our national security.


I say to senators that we in the Australian Greens understand the political imperatives behind ramping up fear of attacks by terrorists or other hostile forces on the Australian people and on our infrastructure. We understand what has been a bipartisan approach, in effect, by the Labor and Liberal parties in this area. But I say to the Labor and Liberal parties: don't turn a blind eye to threats to national security and threats to our infrastructure posed by a disrupted climate that is caused by humans emitting greenhouse gases, which continue to rise and have been rising for the last couple of hundred years.


Climate change is one of the biggest threats to our country's way of life. It is a threat to everything we do. It is a threat to the way we work, live and play. It's a threat to our health system and our education system, the way we support people with disabilities, our transport systems, our energy systems, our road networks and our ports. It is a threat to our way of life. It's driving mass displacement of people around the world, and we're not immune to those displacements here in Australia. The displacement, for example, of the Syrian people was driven, at least in part, by an unprecedented drought between 2007 and 2013. It displaced a large number of Syrian people from the country in Syria to the cities, which made the cities unsustainable and ultimately led to a mass displacement of Syrian people, which caused Australia, under then Prime Minister Tony Abbott, under pressure from the Australian Greens, to create a special intake of 12,000 Syrian people. They were displaced in part by a drought that we know was more likely to have occurred as a result of climate change.


So, while the Australian Greens are comfortable with supporting this legislation and will be supporting it, we need to understand that this government has been putting the blinkers on and has effectively considered the threat posed to our country's infrastructure by terrorism and hostile forces as the only threat worthy of legislation of the type we're debating today. That paradigm, that mentality, lets down our country. It lets down our people and it lets down the very infrastructure that the government purports to want to protect.


The outcomes from the two Senate inquiries that are currently running, thanks to being advocated for and moved by the Australian Greens, will make very interesting reading. At some of the hearings, we've discovered that, within the departmental bureaucracy of this country, there is significant acknowledgement and concern about the threats and risks posed by climate change to our infrastructure and to our way of life. The problem we've got is that that acknowledgement does not seem to percolate through to the highest levels of government. That's a real problem for our country and it's something that the Australian Greens will continue to advocate for and will continue to drive debate on in this place. If we were to not do that, if we were to join the rest of the Senate in staying silent on the threats and risks caused by climate change, ultimately we would be letting the Australian people down.


This bill and the materials associated with it make it very clear that foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure creates risk. You can't read this bill, and the materials associated with it, in any other way. So I want to place on the record that this is one of the reasons—certainly not the only one—that the Australian Greens are proposing the nationalisation of some infrastructure assets that are currently in private hands. For example, we need to start returning Australia's electricity grid to public hands The privatisation of much of our energy generation infrastructure and much of our electricity transmission infrastructure has been an abject failure. It's failed to deliver system reliability, it's failed to play a meaningful role to date in bringing Australia's emissions down and it's failed to deliver reliable electricity at the lowest possible cost to the Australian people. That's why we're proposing to begin returning some of our energy infrastructure assets into public hands by nationalising the five privately owned interconnectors.


As a senator from Tasmania, where we've learned in just the last few days that the state government is engaged in legal action against the owners of Basslink over the outage a couple of years ago that's been discussed at length in debate in the Senate, I say that Basslink, being privately owned, has not delivered for Tasmania. Senators would be aware that, when Basslink was first proposed by Hydro Tasmania back in the late nineties and ultimately the early 2000s, the Greens advocated against Basslink. We said we should be investing in making Tasmania energy self-sufficient. Having 100 per cent renewable energy was a legitimate aspiration for Tasmania prior to Basslink, which, of course, just provided another lifeline and another market opportunity for the dirty brown coal generators of the Latrobe Valley. We said that if we could embed 100 per cent renewable energy into all the goods and services that we produce in Tasmania it would give us a massive competitive advantage over the rest of the country and the rest of the world. We didn't support that investment and the $90 million-plus per annum that Hydro Tasmania is still paying as a facility fee.


If we'd been heeded back then, we wouldn't have had the energy crisis that Tasmania has had. The batteries nearly ran flat and the dams nearly ran empty because of the incompetence of the Hodgman Liberal government and the then energy minister, Matthew Groom. Instead, we could have shown Australia and the rest of the world what leadership on renewable energy looks like. Of course, history shows that Hydro Tasmania, despite some internal contention, went ahead and recommended to government that Basslink be put in place—and, as I said, that threw a much-needed lifeline to the dirty brown coal generators of the Latrobe Valley. That drove Australia's emissions profile up and it drove Tasmania's emissions profile up—when we have the best network of hydro-electric power in the country, renewable energy and ultra-low emissions that we could have actually used to drive prosperity, wellbeing and competitive advantage for our state.


So we make no bones about it. We want to see the five privately owned interconnectors in Australia nationalised, returned to public hands, because neo-liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism have abjectly failed the people they purport to serve. That failure is for a number of reasons but ultimately one of the key drivers has been a failure to price in the environmental and social impacts that are delivered by the private companies who own infrastructure and other assets under the current system of laissez-faire capitalism. Of course we need to price in things like carbon, environmental toxins and social harm, and the Australian Greens are very determined to keep working and advocating for those things to happen. 


As part of that, as I said, we want to make sure that we begin renationalising, or, in some cases, simply nationalising, many of the energy assets that exist in this country. If the government is so concerned about the foreign ownership of and foreign influence on infrastructure assets, perhaps the government needs to ask itself whether or not it, on behalf of the Australian people, would be better off owning those assets itself. We in the Australian Greens have asked ourselves that question, and we have answered that question with a resounding yes. 


Many pieces of infrastructure in this country that are currently in private hands would deliver far better returns for the Australian people if they were put back into public hands and public ownership. The infrastructure in this country was created by the blood, sweat and tears of Australian workers, and its privatisation has abjectly failed to deliver for the people that it was supposed to serve. It's time for a mature debate in this country about the ownership of our infrastructure, the risks to that infrastructure of foreign ownership—which this legislation, in some ways, is designed to mitigate—and, most crucially, whether or not that infrastructure would be better off in public hands. 


We call on the government and the Labor Party—who, to date, to my knowledge, haven't intervened or participated in this debate—to get on board with the discussion, because it's beyond time that we had this conversation in Australia; it's beyond time that we had this conversation in this parliament. As with so many other things, like the issues of a royal commission into banks and a federal anticorruption authority, it will be the Australian Greens that will drive the debate and, in having that debate, will ensure that we consider the ultimate public good. 


If we can remove the interests of corporations and other vested interests that impact so grievously on our political conversation in this country, if we can remove consideration of corporate profits and consideration for the people who are the corporate mates of so many Labor and Liberal people in this country—and that, I acknowledge will be a very hard ask—if we can do the job we're supposed to do, which is to act in the interests of the greater public good, if we can have a respectful conversation and bring the Australian people along with us, then I have no doubt that we will land in a place where we will see much of the infrastructure that's been privatised over the last few decades returned to public hands.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-03-28,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:18):  Let me put it on the record: One Nation is totally opposed to any sale of our assets. I have said, for the last 22 years, that neither our infrastructure, such as water, sewage, telecommunications and electricity, nor our defence services should ever, in any way, shape or form, end up in the hands of foreigners; these services should always remain in the hands of the government and be produced at a reasonable cost for the people of Australia.


I find it amazing that we have before us the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017. It basically says that owners and operators of prescribed ports, electricity and water assets will be required to provide information detailing the operational and ownership control arrangements of their assets. The government may direct these owners and operators to do, or not do, certain things with respect to their asset when there is a perceived risk to national security. That beggars belief. I can't believe that—'a perceived risk to national security'—when we've allowed our most important assets to be sold to foreign ownership.


Let's go back here: 


Both Federal and state governments have put the issue of privatising government assets firmly on the agenda.


At the time it was former coalition federal Treasurer Joe Hockey who:


… indicated at the recent meeting of COAG that the states should look closely at privatising infrastructure …


It was not just the coalition but also the Labor Party in Queensland. Under a then Labor government, it:


… started the recent process by privatising the Port of Brisbane in 2010 (selling a 99-year lease for what is now a seemingly cheap $2.1 billion) in order to replenish its empty Treasury coffers.


That's what it comes down to, empty Treasury coffers, because neither side can actually manage the cheque book. When it gets to this point they say, 'Let's just sell off the assets.' That is clearly what happened with this selling off of our assets and the rising costs of electricity.


Apart from the renewable energy and the billions of dollars we're paying to prop it up, the cost is escalating, because these companies own the power plants, just like what happened in South Australia. A foreigner owned the power plant in South Australia. It has the highest cost, along with Queensland, in the world for electricity—privatisation.


Have a look at the recent article titled 'Australian port sold for $7.3 billion to consortium; China fund among backers'. It states:


A consortium of global and domestic funds, backed by investors including China Investment Corp, agreed to buy Australia's busiest port for a higher-than-expected A$9.7 billion … a sign that tough equity markets are helping fuel appetite for infrastructure.


We're selling stuff to Canada on the superannuation. It goes on to say:


The sell-off is part of Australia's more than A$100 billion privatization program, where state and federal governments are trying to cut debt and bankroll capital works by selling ""mature"" infrastructure assets—


that they will control. Let me tell you something: I'm not an economist, but the fact is that companies buy these infrastructure projects to make money out of them. It's not about providing a service and feeling good about it. It's all about what they can make out of it. A lot of the time they don't even pay tax in this country, but we're allowing them to take over important assets. What about the 99-year lease of the Darwin Port? This is where crucial product comes into our country, into our ports, and they own the ports. They can charge whatever they want from when they have ownership and we've got no control over it. More about ports:


New South Wales (under a Coalition Government) followed Queensland's lead by selling Port Botany and Port Kembla in 2012 and raking in a healthy $5.1 billion … The NSW Treasurer, Mike Baird, has also just announced that expressions of interest are open for a 98-year lease for the Port of Newcastle.


And you had the then Victorian opposition leader, Daniel Andrews—Labor—who proposed to 'sell a long-term lease of the Port of Melbourne as the cornerstone of their Project 10,000'. They can't manage money, so they're selling all the assets. These assets are owned by the people, and yet governments are selling them off.


This is what I was saying about Canada:


… The Future Fund, and Canada's Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System will each get a fifth of Port of Melbourne following the sale, which is packaged as a 50-year lease.


Everyone around the world thinks that Australia is a good investment but the Australian government itself. Then, just recently, didn't we hear the coalition government talking about using our trillion-dollar fund to go to America and buy infrastructure over there? We're investing over there but we're not investing in our own country with our dollars. What about us? People are screaming out for the infrastructure that we need here. These bills beggar belief.


You're selling off all our important assets. You allowed the sale of Cubbie Station—another important landmark owned by Australians—and it was sold to the Chinese. Cubbie Station is important for its water, and yet we've sold it. We've sold so much of our land to foreigners. Our public housing is being sold to foreigners, putting it out of the hands of Australians who want to own their own homes but can't afford to.


This is not just one side of politics; this is both sides. We have seen it for years and years. Both the coalition and Labor have done absolutely nothing about it. You keep speaking the same old rhetoric all the time. Once you're in opposition, you blame the other side as if they're the ones that have caused it. You're both to blame for this. You both have actually destroyed this country. You're getting rid of our important infrastructure. That's why electricity costs are going up and up and up. You're selling off our ports. You've sold off land in this country. You've put in place legislation to stop the foreign ownership of housing here, but you don't follow through. All you've done is to put more and more red tape on it, to make it look as if you're doing the right thing, but you don't follow through. You're tying us up so tightly in this country but you're not addressing the real concerns of the Australian people. So stop blaming each other and do something about it.


By introducing this bill, yes, you're calling for accountability. But the horse has bolted. Now what are we going to do about it? Well, we'd better address this for security reasons. Is that going to stop you from allowing foreign ownership of our most important assets in this country? I don't think so—because you're trying to catch up, because we're in so much debt. Look at where you are wasting the moneys, in a lot of these bureaucrats' wages, as I pointed out. You were paying the CEO of Australia Post $5.6 million a year, which was ridiculous. What a lot of these CEOs get paid is over the top. The number of public servants and all these consultants' fees that you've been paying are over the top. I cannot believe that you've got to the stage where you've got to sell our assets—the taxpayers' assets—to balance the books!


One Nation will be supporting this bill. But I had to have my say over this, because it beggars belief that you've allowed things to get to this stage. I'd suggest that you really have a good look at who is putting in to buy up our assets in this country, and say, 'No!' Start holding on to our assets for the Australian people. You've given so much control to other countries, it's an absolute disgrace!

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:28):  I thank colleagues for their contributions. We are all in agreement that critical infrastructure is integral to our prosperity. Secure and resilient infrastructure does underpin the effective functioning of our society. It ensures we have continuous access to essential services for everyday life, such as food, water, energy and communications. The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017 support the government's efforts to safeguard Australia's critical infrastructure. They will supplement existing federal, state and territory regulations and ensure that the government has the necessary powers to protect Australia from the national security risks of sabotage, espionage and coercion stemming from malicious foreign involvement in our critical infrastructure. The bills reflect consultation with states and territories and industry stakeholders. Importantly, they will also incorporate all nine recommendations made by the PJCIS. I thank members of the committee for their comprehensive review of the bills. Amendments have already been circulated to give effect to these. Earlier I also tabled the government's response to the committee report. We indicated in that that we accept all nine of the committee's recommendations. I'm pleased that the government, the opposition and the committee could work together to progress this important legislation.


The bills align with the government's clear intention to continue to cooperate and collaborate with all levels of government, regulators, owners and operators of critical infrastructure. They strike an appropriate regulatory balance by acknowledging the shared responsibility for managing national security risks while empowering the Commonwealth to intervene to mitigate a risk where existing regimes cannot be used. With these bills the government is taking the necessary steps to strengthen the security and resilience of Australia's critical infrastructure. I commend the bills to colleagues.


Question agreed to.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:31):  As foreshadowed, the government will be moving amendments to these bills. Again I thank the committee for their comprehensive and timely review of the bills. The government has accepted all nine recommendations made by the committee. The government will give effect to the committee's recommendations through these amendments: providing greater clarity and examples on how the legislation is intended to operate in an addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled; considering fuel security issues as part of the next national energy security assessment; and, upon passage, providing detailed guidance and support for industry on their obligations under the legislation. 


The amendments implementing the committee's recommendations will: amend the definition of 'direct interest holder' and introduce definitions of 'influence or control' and 'associates' to ensure that direct interest holders report on all entities who may be in a position to influence or control the asset or the direct interest holder; introduce an exemption from reporting for moneylenders where the moneylender arrangement does not put the lender, holding entity or subsidiary in a position to influence or control the asset; require that a person receives written notice if they are subject to an ASIO adverse security assessment as well as information on his or her right to apply for merits review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and include a requirement for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the bills within three years of the bills receiving royal assent. I have already tabled associated supplementary explanatory memorandums to provide details on these amendments.


The proposed amendments also address some minor technical issues, including refining the definition of 'critical water asset' to clarify that it applies to one or more systems managed by a utility where those systems ultimately service more than 100,000 connections, and ensuring the definition of 'protected information' applies to documents as well as information. I seek leave to move amendments (1) to (20) on sheet KE133 together.


Leave granted.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:34):  Before proceeding to deal with the amendments, I wish to place on record a response to some of the remarks made by Senator McKim in the second reading debate. Senator McKim made a series of remarks about climate change and the impact of climate change on infrastructure. He went on to make a very unrealistic, unreasonable and inaccurate characterisation of the Labor Party's position in relation to these issues, and that characterisation cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged.


I remind Senator McKim and others in the chamber that, in 2007, it was the Labor opposition, under Kevin Rudd, and the states and territories who commissioned Professor Garnaut to undertake a very significant examination of the impact of climate change on the Australian economy and society. Professor Garnaut did an incredibly detailed piece of work—which I actually had the great fortune to be part of in a very, very small way—which, amongst other things, examined the impact of climate change on assets, including the infrastructure sectors that are the subject of this bill. Upon coming to government, the Labor Party and the then Prime Minister committed the Commonwealth to participate in the Garnaut climate change review, and the Labor Party then established an entire department dedicated to prosecuting both climate change emissions reduction and climate change adaptation. That department had an entire division that dealt with climate change adaptation and it did extensive work with the infrastructure sector, engaging with that sector on how to deal with the impacts of climate change on its assets.


It happens that I also subsequently worked in the private sector with a range of businesses in the infrastructure sector, nearly all of whom were actively engaged in assessing climate change risks to their businesses. In fact, I've spoken about this in this chamber on many occasions. Senator McKim's claim that it is only the Greens political party that has any interest in this issue and that it is the Greens political party that has led on this issue is laughable. It is inconsistent with the historical record, and I rise to place that on record in this chamber.


The opposition is pleased to support the amendments moved by Senator Fifield. They reflect the recommendations of the PJCIS. I note in particular the amendments in relation to the review function for the PJCIS. The amendments provide that the committee will review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the act within three years and examine whether or not it would be appropriate to have a unified scheme that covers all infrastructure assets, including telecommunication assets. Telecommunication assets are presently the subject of a separate regulatory regime, and the PJCIS asked government to consider whether or not at some point in the future these two regimes might sensibly be merged. The amendments before the chamber give effect to that recommendation and I commend them to the house.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:37):  Senator McAllister often makes excellent, outstanding, thoughtful and intelligent contributions to this Senate, but the one she has just made does not fall into any of those categories. I'll check the Hansard, but I don't recall saying that the ALP hadn't participated in a debate around climate change. Clearly, the ALP has participated in that debate. It hasn't been some of their finest work, I might add.




Senator Cameron:
  You can talk!




Senator McKIM:
  They were dragged, kicking and screaming into action on a price on carbon by the Australian Greens, and both Senator Cameron and Senator McAllister know that full well. As I said, I'll check the Hansard, but the point that I recall making is that the ALP hasn't contributed to the debate around nationalising some infrastructure that is currently in private hands. If Senator McAllister or Senator Cameron or anyone else wants to correct me on that, I'm happy to be corrected, but I haven't noticed Labor out advocating for the nationalisation of transmission infrastructure, for example, as the Australian Greens have. That's the accusation that I recall making. I don't want to get into a tit for tat here, but I think you'll find that Senator McAllister has just engaged in what we should these days call a straw person argument and has torn down and trampled all over a straw person, because, in fact, the things she was objecting to that she claims I had said I actually didn't say. With regard to these amendments, I think it's an indication of maturity from the government to accept the recommendations of the joint standing committee, and these amendments will be supported by the Australian Greens.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,2
"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:51):  Whether in government or in opposition, Labor has consistently worked to ensure that our security agencies have the powers and resources they need to keep our community safe and that our laws are adapted to meet the changing security threats that we face. Consistent with its commitment to national security, Labor supports the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017.


We support these bills because we recognise the need to manage national security risks arising from the possibility of malicious foreign involvement in our critical infrastructure. Labor believe that these bills strike an appropriate balance. They impose only the necessary and relatively minor regulatory requirements needed to improve the management of the national security risks that threats to our critical infrastructure pose. The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill provides a risk based regulatory framework to manage national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure. The bill focuses primarily on the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia's highest risk, critical infrastructure sectors of electricity, gas, ports and water.


Labor recognises that foreign involvement in the economy, and in Australian infrastructure, plays an important and beneficial role in supporting economic growth, creating employment opportunities, improving consumer choice and promoting healthy competition while increasing Australia's competitiveness in global markets. However, with increased privatisation, outsourcing and offshoring of supply chain arrangements, and the shift in Australia's international investment profile, critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion. This bill is an appropriate step to inhibit malicious conduct undertaken covertly which may have implications for Australian society.


Labor will always ensure that critical infrastructure assets, where they are partly owned by foreign entities, are still subject to control and direction by the Commonwealth. It is fundamental to the maintenance of the security, safety and prosperity of Australians that critical assets are required to provide relevant information to government and that, in times of emergency, they can be directed to ensure that the needs of Australian society are met. This was a sentiment shared by state and territory governments and industry and peak organisations who expressed support for the bill in submissions to the PJCIS.


The bill designates water, electricity, gas and ports above a certain threshold as critical assets. The bill defines a critical water asset under proposed section 5 as:


… a water or sewerage system or network that is used to ultimately deliver services to at least 100,000 water connections or 100,000 sewerage connections under the management of a water utility.


It is axiomatic that all Australians require a clean and reliable supply of water and that disruption to Australia's water supply or water treatment facilities could have major consequences for the health of citizens and the economy.


Similarly, the bill, in subclause 10(1)(a), establishes the test for criticality of an electricity asset as: 


(a) a network, system, or interconnector, for the transmission or distribution of electricity to … service at least 100,000 customers … 


Electricity generation is fundamental to the proper functioning of the economy and is a basic necessity for all Australians. It is clear that electricity assets which provide transmission and distribution services form a core part of the nation's critical infrastructure.


Clause 12 of the bill defines a critical gas asset as:


(a) a gas processing facility that has a capacity of at least 300 terajoules per day … 


(b) a gas storage facility that has a maximum daily quantity of 75 terajoules per day … 


(c) a network or system for the distribution of gas to ultimately service at least 100,000 customers or …


(d) a gas transmission pipeline that is critical to ensuring the security and reliability of a gas market …


It is self-evident that gas in Australia is an important energy source. It is an increasing export commodity and a required element for a wide range of industrial, commercial and residential uses. Gas is particularly important for gas-powered electricity generators, which account for 20 per cent of Australia's electricity, and manufacturing, which relies on gas for approximately 40 per cent of net energy. These are numbers that, as Australia transitions to a clean energy economy, we expect to grow. Accordingly, the protection of gas infrastructure as a critical asset will grow, not diminish, over time. By defining the level of criticality, the bill limits the regulatory burden to Australia's highest risk critical assets.


The bill will supplement the existing FIRB mechanism through which the Commonwealth can respond to risks. However, because the FIRB mechanism applies to foreign investment above certain thresholds at the time of the proposed transaction, it is not possible to use it as a mechanism to address risks in outsourcing or offshoring of assets owned by domestic entities or where sales fall outside of the FIRB's screening thresholds. Accordingly, the creation of the security of critical infrastructure framework will improve upon existing safeguards which protect critical assets.


In practice, the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill will add to the work currently undertaken by the Critical Infrastructure Centre, which collaborates with asset owners, asset operators and state and territory regulators to identify risks, implement asset-specific mitigation strategies and develop sector-wide best-practice guidelines. The CIC engages with asset owners and operators through the Trusted Information Sharing Network, TISN, and directly as needed. This is a welcome addition to the regulatory architecture that protects and maintains assets critical to Australia's security and continuing economic and social wellbeing.


The PJCIS conducted an inquiry into this bill. We spoke to a range of stakeholders and other interested parties. The committee made nine recommendations, the majority of which relate to the implementation of the bill rather than its design or intentions. I note that in the government's response to the committee's report, which was tabled just now, the government has accepted all of the committee's recommendations and has circulated amendments and a supplementary explanatory memorandum in the chamber to give effect to these recommendations. Labor too supports the recommendations of the committee.


Regulatory schemes such as that proposed in the bill work best in the presence of an active and productive dialogue between government and the affected industry participants. Industry, government and the community all benefit when asset owners know in advance what is required of them and therefore can take the necessary steps without government needing to resort to regulatory intervention. The PJCIS report recommends sensible steps to ensure that such a dialogue is established in the implementation of this bill. It responds to evidence that was provided to the committee from industry stakeholders. I would like to take the opportunity to thank those stakeholders for their contribution to the committee's work. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:59):  The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 introduces, in essence, two new measures: a register of critical infrastructure and ministerial directions powers. The bill will apply to approximately 140 assets in the high-risk electricity, water, gas and ports sectors. According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill focuses primarily on the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia's highest-risk critical infrastructure sectors and provides 'a risk based regulatory framework to manage national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure'.


The purpose of the register is to provide a more detailed understanding of who owns and controls critical infrastructure assets. I'll make some observations about ownership of critical infrastructure later in my speech. The register requires reporting entities who are either direct interest holders or the responsible entity of critical infrastructure assets to provide interest and control information and operational information within a certain time frame. The explanatory memorandum states:


This information will assist the Government to identify who owns and controls the asset, its board structure, ownership rights of interest holders, and operational, outsourcing and offshoring information.


I note the government has proposed several amendments to this bill that implement recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


In January 2017, the Australian government established the Critical Infrastructure Centre and stated that the centre was established in response to the complex and evolving national security risks to critical infrastructure. But it ought come as no surprise to the Australian people that the government has abjectly failed to meaningfully consider one of the biggest threats to critical infrastructure in this country, and that is climate change. It's not just the direct risk of increasing levels of climate risk that will be the problem in the future. In a submission to the Critical Infrastructure Centre in March 2017, the CSIRO wrote:


We provide the following comments to note that the discussion paper is silent on the potential effects of global environmental change, particularly climate change, in systematically altering the risks faced by critical infrastructure from the range of security-related sources …


The CSIRO went on to say in their submission:


… climate change may be exacerbating some of the drivers of the key security risks addressed in the current paper, for example, placing greater pressure on foreign interests to consider espionage, sabotage or even coercion, because of growing pressures on the resources of those foreign interests.


It's not only this bill that doesn't mention climate change as a risk; in fact, the government's Critical infrastructure resilience strategy: plan is astoundingly silent on climate change. Australia ought not, and the government ought not, ignore the risks to national security and the risks to infrastructure posed by the disruption of our planet's climate. The ARC's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes recently stated:


Australia lags behind the US and some European countries in examining, assessing and responding to climate change risks in terms of national security. Vulnerabilities associated with national security and climate change are already increasing and exist now. These are not ""future issues"" that can be left for a decade before strategies are considered. The creation of a high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security is urgent and overdue.


It is important to acknowledge that the 2016 Department of Defence white paper did identify climate change as one of the six key drivers in the development of Australia's security environment and as 'a major challenge for countries in Australia's immediate region'.


While that's the case, it appears the government has no plan and no appetite to do anything about our vulnerabilities in the areas of national security and infrastructure caused by climate disruption. Instead, it's been left to the Australian Greens, through the mechanisms available to us in this parliament, to establish two inquiries, which are currently running through Senate committees, into the impact of climate change and the threats posed by climate change to infrastructure and our national security.


I say to senators that we in the Australian Greens understand the political imperatives behind ramping up fear of attacks by terrorists or other hostile forces on the Australian people and on our infrastructure. We understand what has been a bipartisan approach, in effect, by the Labor and Liberal parties in this area. But I say to the Labor and Liberal parties: don't turn a blind eye to threats to national security and threats to our infrastructure posed by a disrupted climate that is caused by humans emitting greenhouse gases, which continue to rise and have been rising for the last couple of hundred years.


Climate change is one of the biggest threats to our country's way of life. It is a threat to everything we do. It is a threat to the way we work, live and play. It's a threat to our health system and our education system, the way we support people with disabilities, our transport systems, our energy systems, our road networks and our ports. It is a threat to our way of life. It's driving mass displacement of people around the world, and we're not immune to those displacements here in Australia. The displacement, for example, of the Syrian people was driven, at least in part, by an unprecedented drought between 2007 and 2013. It displaced a large number of Syrian people from the country in Syria to the cities, which made the cities unsustainable and ultimately led to a mass displacement of Syrian people, which caused Australia, under then Prime Minister Tony Abbott, under pressure from the Australian Greens, to create a special intake of 12,000 Syrian people. They were displaced in part by a drought that we know was more likely to have occurred as a result of climate change.


So, while the Australian Greens are comfortable with supporting this legislation and will be supporting it, we need to understand that this government has been putting the blinkers on and has effectively considered the threat posed to our country's infrastructure by terrorism and hostile forces as the only threat worthy of legislation of the type we're debating today. That paradigm, that mentality, lets down our country. It lets down our people and it lets down the very infrastructure that the government purports to want to protect.


The outcomes from the two Senate inquiries that are currently running, thanks to being advocated for and moved by the Australian Greens, will make very interesting reading. At some of the hearings, we've discovered that, within the departmental bureaucracy of this country, there is significant acknowledgement and concern about the threats and risks posed by climate change to our infrastructure and to our way of life. The problem we've got is that that acknowledgement does not seem to percolate through to the highest levels of government. That's a real problem for our country and it's something that the Australian Greens will continue to advocate for and will continue to drive debate on in this place. If we were to not do that, if we were to join the rest of the Senate in staying silent on the threats and risks caused by climate change, ultimately we would be letting the Australian people down.


This bill and the materials associated with it make it very clear that foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure creates risk. You can't read this bill, and the materials associated with it, in any other way. So I want to place on the record that this is one of the reasons—certainly not the only one—that the Australian Greens are proposing the nationalisation of some infrastructure assets that are currently in private hands. For example, we need to start returning Australia's electricity grid to public hands The privatisation of much of our energy generation infrastructure and much of our electricity transmission infrastructure has been an abject failure. It's failed to deliver system reliability, it's failed to play a meaningful role to date in bringing Australia's emissions down and it's failed to deliver reliable electricity at the lowest possible cost to the Australian people. That's why we're proposing to begin returning some of our energy infrastructure assets into public hands by nationalising the five privately owned interconnectors.


As a senator from Tasmania, where we've learned in just the last few days that the state government is engaged in legal action against the owners of Basslink over the outage a couple of years ago that's been discussed at length in debate in the Senate, I say that Basslink, being privately owned, has not delivered for Tasmania. Senators would be aware that, when Basslink was first proposed by Hydro Tasmania back in the late nineties and ultimately the early 2000s, the Greens advocated against Basslink. We said we should be investing in making Tasmania energy self-sufficient. Having 100 per cent renewable energy was a legitimate aspiration for Tasmania prior to Basslink, which, of course, just provided another lifeline and another market opportunity for the dirty brown coal generators of the Latrobe Valley. We said that if we could embed 100 per cent renewable energy into all the goods and services that we produce in Tasmania it would give us a massive competitive advantage over the rest of the country and the rest of the world. We didn't support that investment and the $90 million-plus per annum that Hydro Tasmania is still paying as a facility fee.


If we'd been heeded back then, we wouldn't have had the energy crisis that Tasmania has had. The batteries nearly ran flat and the dams nearly ran empty because of the incompetence of the Hodgman Liberal government and the then energy minister, Matthew Groom. Instead, we could have shown Australia and the rest of the world what leadership on renewable energy looks like. Of course, history shows that Hydro Tasmania, despite some internal contention, went ahead and recommended to government that Basslink be put in place—and, as I said, that threw a much-needed lifeline to the dirty brown coal generators of the Latrobe Valley. That drove Australia's emissions profile up and it drove Tasmania's emissions profile up—when we have the best network of hydro-electric power in the country, renewable energy and ultra-low emissions that we could have actually used to drive prosperity, wellbeing and competitive advantage for our state.


So we make no bones about it. We want to see the five privately owned interconnectors in Australia nationalised, returned to public hands, because neo-liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism have abjectly failed the people they purport to serve. That failure is for a number of reasons but ultimately one of the key drivers has been a failure to price in the environmental and social impacts that are delivered by the private companies who own infrastructure and other assets under the current system of laissez-faire capitalism. Of course we need to price in things like carbon, environmental toxins and social harm, and the Australian Greens are very determined to keep working and advocating for those things to happen. 


As part of that, as I said, we want to make sure that we begin renationalising, or, in some cases, simply nationalising, many of the energy assets that exist in this country. If the government is so concerned about the foreign ownership of and foreign influence on infrastructure assets, perhaps the government needs to ask itself whether or not it, on behalf of the Australian people, would be better off owning those assets itself. We in the Australian Greens have asked ourselves that question, and we have answered that question with a resounding yes. 


Many pieces of infrastructure in this country that are currently in private hands would deliver far better returns for the Australian people if they were put back into public hands and public ownership. The infrastructure in this country was created by the blood, sweat and tears of Australian workers, and its privatisation has abjectly failed to deliver for the people that it was supposed to serve. It's time for a mature debate in this country about the ownership of our infrastructure, the risks to that infrastructure of foreign ownership—which this legislation, in some ways, is designed to mitigate—and, most crucially, whether or not that infrastructure would be better off in public hands. 


We call on the government and the Labor Party—who, to date, to my knowledge, haven't intervened or participated in this debate—to get on board with the discussion, because it's beyond time that we had this conversation in Australia; it's beyond time that we had this conversation in this parliament. As with so many other things, like the issues of a royal commission into banks and a federal anticorruption authority, it will be the Australian Greens that will drive the debate and, in having that debate, will ensure that we consider the ultimate public good. 


If we can remove the interests of corporations and other vested interests that impact so grievously on our political conversation in this country, if we can remove consideration of corporate profits and consideration for the people who are the corporate mates of so many Labor and Liberal people in this country—and that, I acknowledge will be a very hard ask—if we can do the job we're supposed to do, which is to act in the interests of the greater public good, if we can have a respectful conversation and bring the Australian people along with us, then I have no doubt that we will land in a place where we will see much of the infrastructure that's been privatised over the last few decades returned to public hands.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-03-28,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:18):  Let me put it on the record: One Nation is totally opposed to any sale of our assets. I have said, for the last 22 years, that neither our infrastructure, such as water, sewage, telecommunications and electricity, nor our defence services should ever, in any way, shape or form, end up in the hands of foreigners; these services should always remain in the hands of the government and be produced at a reasonable cost for the people of Australia.


I find it amazing that we have before us the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017. It basically says that owners and operators of prescribed ports, electricity and water assets will be required to provide information detailing the operational and ownership control arrangements of their assets. The government may direct these owners and operators to do, or not do, certain things with respect to their asset when there is a perceived risk to national security. That beggars belief. I can't believe that—'a perceived risk to national security'—when we've allowed our most important assets to be sold to foreign ownership.


Let's go back here: 


Both Federal and state governments have put the issue of privatising government assets firmly on the agenda.


At the time it was former coalition federal Treasurer Joe Hockey who:


… indicated at the recent meeting of COAG that the states should look closely at privatising infrastructure …


It was not just the coalition but also the Labor Party in Queensland. Under a then Labor government, it:


… started the recent process by privatising the Port of Brisbane in 2010 (selling a 99-year lease for what is now a seemingly cheap $2.1 billion) in order to replenish its empty Treasury coffers.


That's what it comes down to, empty Treasury coffers, because neither side can actually manage the cheque book. When it gets to this point they say, 'Let's just sell off the assets.' That is clearly what happened with this selling off of our assets and the rising costs of electricity.


Apart from the renewable energy and the billions of dollars we're paying to prop it up, the cost is escalating, because these companies own the power plants, just like what happened in South Australia. A foreigner owned the power plant in South Australia. It has the highest cost, along with Queensland, in the world for electricity—privatisation.


Have a look at the recent article titled 'Australian port sold for $7.3 billion to consortium; China fund among backers'. It states:


A consortium of global and domestic funds, backed by investors including China Investment Corp, agreed to buy Australia's busiest port for a higher-than-expected A$9.7 billion … a sign that tough equity markets are helping fuel appetite for infrastructure.


We're selling stuff to Canada on the superannuation. It goes on to say:


The sell-off is part of Australia's more than A$100 billion privatization program, where state and federal governments are trying to cut debt and bankroll capital works by selling ""mature"" infrastructure assets—


that they will control. Let me tell you something: I'm not an economist, but the fact is that companies buy these infrastructure projects to make money out of them. It's not about providing a service and feeling good about it. It's all about what they can make out of it. A lot of the time they don't even pay tax in this country, but we're allowing them to take over important assets. What about the 99-year lease of the Darwin Port? This is where crucial product comes into our country, into our ports, and they own the ports. They can charge whatever they want from when they have ownership and we've got no control over it. More about ports:


New South Wales (under a Coalition Government) followed Queensland's lead by selling Port Botany and Port Kembla in 2012 and raking in a healthy $5.1 billion … The NSW Treasurer, Mike Baird, has also just announced that expressions of interest are open for a 98-year lease for the Port of Newcastle.


And you had the then Victorian opposition leader, Daniel Andrews—Labor—who proposed to 'sell a long-term lease of the Port of Melbourne as the cornerstone of their Project 10,000'. They can't manage money, so they're selling all the assets. These assets are owned by the people, and yet governments are selling them off.


This is what I was saying about Canada:


… The Future Fund, and Canada's Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System will each get a fifth of Port of Melbourne following the sale, which is packaged as a 50-year lease.


Everyone around the world thinks that Australia is a good investment but the Australian government itself. Then, just recently, didn't we hear the coalition government talking about using our trillion-dollar fund to go to America and buy infrastructure over there? We're investing over there but we're not investing in our own country with our dollars. What about us? People are screaming out for the infrastructure that we need here. These bills beggar belief.


You're selling off all our important assets. You allowed the sale of Cubbie Station—another important landmark owned by Australians—and it was sold to the Chinese. Cubbie Station is important for its water, and yet we've sold it. We've sold so much of our land to foreigners. Our public housing is being sold to foreigners, putting it out of the hands of Australians who want to own their own homes but can't afford to.


This is not just one side of politics; this is both sides. We have seen it for years and years. Both the coalition and Labor have done absolutely nothing about it. You keep speaking the same old rhetoric all the time. Once you're in opposition, you blame the other side as if they're the ones that have caused it. You're both to blame for this. You both have actually destroyed this country. You're getting rid of our important infrastructure. That's why electricity costs are going up and up and up. You're selling off our ports. You've sold off land in this country. You've put in place legislation to stop the foreign ownership of housing here, but you don't follow through. All you've done is to put more and more red tape on it, to make it look as if you're doing the right thing, but you don't follow through. You're tying us up so tightly in this country but you're not addressing the real concerns of the Australian people. So stop blaming each other and do something about it.


By introducing this bill, yes, you're calling for accountability. But the horse has bolted. Now what are we going to do about it? Well, we'd better address this for security reasons. Is that going to stop you from allowing foreign ownership of our most important assets in this country? I don't think so—because you're trying to catch up, because we're in so much debt. Look at where you are wasting the moneys, in a lot of these bureaucrats' wages, as I pointed out. You were paying the CEO of Australia Post $5.6 million a year, which was ridiculous. What a lot of these CEOs get paid is over the top. The number of public servants and all these consultants' fees that you've been paying are over the top. I cannot believe that you've got to the stage where you've got to sell our assets—the taxpayers' assets—to balance the books!


One Nation will be supporting this bill. But I had to have my say over this, because it beggars belief that you've allowed things to get to this stage. I'd suggest that you really have a good look at who is putting in to buy up our assets in this country, and say, 'No!' Start holding on to our assets for the Australian people. You've given so much control to other countries, it's an absolute disgrace!

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:28):  I thank colleagues for their contributions. We are all in agreement that critical infrastructure is integral to our prosperity. Secure and resilient infrastructure does underpin the effective functioning of our society. It ensures we have continuous access to essential services for everyday life, such as food, water, energy and communications. The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017 support the government's efforts to safeguard Australia's critical infrastructure. They will supplement existing federal, state and territory regulations and ensure that the government has the necessary powers to protect Australia from the national security risks of sabotage, espionage and coercion stemming from malicious foreign involvement in our critical infrastructure. The bills reflect consultation with states and territories and industry stakeholders. Importantly, they will also incorporate all nine recommendations made by the PJCIS. I thank members of the committee for their comprehensive review of the bills. Amendments have already been circulated to give effect to these. Earlier I also tabled the government's response to the committee report. We indicated in that that we accept all nine of the committee's recommendations. I'm pleased that the government, the opposition and the committee could work together to progress this important legislation.


The bills align with the government's clear intention to continue to cooperate and collaborate with all levels of government, regulators, owners and operators of critical infrastructure. They strike an appropriate regulatory balance by acknowledging the shared responsibility for managing national security risks while empowering the Commonwealth to intervene to mitigate a risk where existing regimes cannot be used. With these bills the government is taking the necessary steps to strengthen the security and resilience of Australia's critical infrastructure. I commend the bills to colleagues.


Question agreed to.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (12:45):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. Please note that this is not my first speech. I wish to thank Senator Cormann and his staff for their respectful, patient and courteous dealings with me over the last month in my commencement as a senator. Sitting as an Independent senator for South Australia, it is my intention to review each bill on its merits, examining all the evidence available in a non-partisan manner. I believe this is what the South Australian people expect of me.


My focus in evaluating this bill has been on the impact on future prosperity and on fairness for all Australians—in particular, South Australians. I have undertaken an at-length, considered review of materials provided by many sources in relation to this bill, drawing on my business and economics background. I have held numerous meetings and received input from a wide range of stakeholders, including members of the public, South Australian businesses and business groups, leading economists, national welfare groups and national business councils and their members.


After undertaking that process, I remain to be convinced that, in isolation from a broader discussion and initiatives on enhancing the overall sustainability of our taxation system, I should support this bill in its current form. I believe this bill is a narrowly cast proposition of change to the overall tax and transfer system, a system which itself continues to be felt by some economists and business leaders to be unsustainable. In the significant reforms posited in the Henry tax review of 2010, the reduction in company tax to 25 per cent was only one of a number of principal feature reforms which have not been acted upon.


I have doubts that the decision to reduce company tax for all companies is prudent to undertake in the face of Australia's budget deficit and debt. Even without this tax cut, I doubt our present tax system is sufficiently robust to support a medium-term fiscal strategy of budget surpluses on average over the course of the economic cycle. Importantly, I see the strength and timing of the effect of this proposed tax cut to be modest relative to its cost. Australia has one of the highest rates of population growth in the developed world, and I am mindful of other uses of government revenue that can generate prosperity and enhance fairness for the Australian people, such as well-targeted social and economic programs aimed at supporting businesses with R&D, innovation and industrial transformation; funding of world-class education and health systems; harnessing the contribution potential of our youth and ageing populations; reducing inequality; and investing in public infrastructure.


On 31 January 2018, in an opinion piece in The Australian newspaper, the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities, the Hon. Paul Fletcher, noted that the Commonwealth's share of total public infrastructure spending rising to nearly 30 per cent would see a 0.5 to 0.7 per cent rise in GDP growth and jobs in the fiscal year 2018. He noted:


Investing in infrastructure results in long-lived assets which deliver benefits to the community for many decades—but it also stimulates economic growth as the investment occurs.


So, as stated before, I remain to be convinced that I should support this bill in its current form, in isolation from a broader discussion and initiatives on enhancing the overall sustainability of our taxation system and with alternative uses of government revenue that can generate prosperity and enhance fairness for the Australian people.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (15:02):  I would like to add to my response to Senator Hinch yesterday regarding dementia services in Victoria. Yesterday Senator Hinch stated that the in-home counselling services provided by Dementia Australia have 'always been a free service funded by the federal government'. I'm advised that, unfortunately, the information he has been provided with is not correct. Previously, until June 2016—I'm sorry, Senator Hinch can't hear.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think something has happened with the microphone, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I would ask senators who are leaving the chamber to do so promptly and quietly, and everyone else to listen politely and quietly to the response from the minister.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I will recommence. Yesterday, Senator Hinch, you asked me a question about in-home counselling services provided by Dementia Australia and you said that they'd 'always been a free service funded by the federal government'. I'm advised that that information is not correct. Previously, until June 2016, dementia services were funded through the Victorian government's Home and Community Care, HACC, program. In June 2016, the Victorian government transitioned their services under their Home and Community Care program to the federal government's Commonwealth Home Support Program. This included dementia services.


Further to this, I would like to clarify that the information that was provided by the Dementia Australia hotline that 'the government makes us charge that fee' is also not correct. Under the federal government's Commonwealth Home Support Program, the Commonwealth does not mandate specific fees. Fees are determined by the individual providers. In regard to your specific question about Australians who are unable to afford the fee, the federal government's Commonwealth Home Support Program clients are only expected to contribute if they can afford to do so. Those who cannot are not expected to contribute. This ensures that those who have the means contribute, while those most vulnerable are protected. In the 2017-18 budget, the Turnbull government announced a funding injection of $5.5 billion to extend the funding arrangements of the Commonwealth Home Support program from 2018-19 to 2019-20. This boost means that more senior Australians are receiving care.


Finally, in relation to your question, Senator Hinch, regarding waiting times, the latest advice provided to me from Dementia Australia is that there is currently no waiting list in places for services in Victoria. We will endeavour to continue to follow up about the six-week wait time, if you raise it again.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I just remind ministers that, if you are responding to questions that you've taken on notice, the convention is, if they're more than a couple of paragraphs, you would seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Wong today relating to proposed company tax cuts.


At the outset, I say that today we confirmed, again, the extent of the persistent and wilful misleading by the government about the so-called benefits of their $65 billion tax cut for big business. I want to emphasise that this debate for Labor has never been about whether or not we recognise the contribution that business makes to the economy, and neither has this debate been about any less recognition of the importance of growing the national economy, which is so crucial to the standard of living we all enjoy. Recall that it was Labor governments which engaged in the economic reforms that have enabled the extraordinary, unbroken period of economic growth to the benefit of the nation. We also understand business needs the right policy settings to grow and prosper, but it's not a one-way street.


The taxes paid by companies, and, indeed, all Australians, are what fund the education and training system for the workers they employ. Those taxes are what build the infrastructure that business needs to do business and to get its products to the world. In this country, unlike many others, it is those taxes, not business, that pay for the health care of their workforce and that have given Australia amongst the best health outcomes in the world.


Remember the famous quote:


Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.


That is why it's been so disappointing to discover that so many in the business community are simply not prepared to be a part of this grand bargain. It is so disappointing to know that, when asked to sign a letter from the Business Council of Australia pledging that in return for the $65 billion in tax cuts they would increase wages, big business said no. When asked if, in return for the $65 billion in tax cuts, they would create more Australian jobs in the cities, suburbs, towns and bush, what did they say? No. When asked if, in return for those $65 billion in tax cuts, they would commit to paying their tax, they said no. In return for the $65 billion in tax cuts this government is proposing, we have big business refusing to commit to higher wages, refusing to commit to new jobs and refusing to even commit to paying their tax—a pretty extraordinary and a pretty disappointing response from business. I've got to say, I find it pretty disappointing on a personal level. I've always been one of the people on this side of the chamber who has sought to engage with the business community. I've worked with them in government and in opposition. But when those in the business community, who are urging this chamber and the Australian people to support this level of tax cut, are not prepared to live up to their side of the bargain in return for these tax cuts, they tell us all something quite important about the extent to which they are prepared to contribute to the national interest.


Even worse than the behaviour of business here has been the behaviour of this Prime Minister and his government. Frankly, their dishonesty and deceit in their case for the tax cut has been exposed. Time after time we have been assured this tax cut will drive up wages, create jobs and lead to business paying more tax. Remember that argument? I think it's the Laffer Curve argument. But we know it's not true, and that has been confirmed again today. There has never been any basis for making these claims. We shouldn't be surprised about this.


Remember the deceit that has surrounded this tax cut from day one? Remember in 2016 when this PM couldn't even tell Australians how much this tax cut would cost? Two days later we had to drag out of Treasury officials, I think in estimates, that it would cost $50 billion, and we now know, a year later, that the cost is $65 billion. I think Australians deserve more. They deserve a lot more than a government that's prepared to wilfully mislead them about the effect over the next decade of the single biggest handout plan by either side of politics. The honesty should begin now. It should begin today with the government abandoning the tax cut, recognising and admitting its argument is flawed and that the tax cut is unaffordable. That is why Labor says no at a time when the government has sent debt soaring above half a trillion dollars, has cut funding to schools and hospitals, and is hiking tax on middle Australia. Remember that: hiking tax on middle Australia. Our priority cannot be a $65 billion handout to Australia's powerful corporations. (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-03-28,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:10):  It's my great honour to have the opportunity to respond to Senator Wong's motion to take note. If we needed any more evidence at all that the Labor Party, which she represents in this chamber, has no plan whatsoever to stimulate investment, to stimulate growth, to create jobs and to increase wages, then that speech was evidence of it. It contained no ideas, it contained no proposals and it contained no measures from the alternative government of Australia. All it contained was rhetoric and criticism and complaint. There was not one constructive suggestion or proposal anywhere in that speech. It contained a number of what I would characterise as intellectual errors and sloppiness that I wouldn't expect to see from someone of the stature of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—herself a former finance minister. I particularly appreciated the emphasis that Senator Wong placed on the supposed letter from the Business Council of Australia and how they have seized upon this as evidence that, if company tax is cut in Australia, there will be no increase in investment, there will be no increase in employment, there will be no increase in wages and there will be no increase in tax revenue.


As Senator Wong would know well from her time as finance minister, businesses don't pay taxes in this country as part of some kind of bargain, as she characterised it, or because they've signed a letter to the Senate crossbench or anyone else for that matter. They pay tax because they are legally required to, and they pay tax when they make a profit. Anything that we can do to ensure that business is making a profit and is therefore paying tax is a very prudent and sensible thing to do, and that's exactly what the government's enterprise tax plan does. It will stimulate investment by increasing the return on that investment and will encourage investors, both domestic and foreign, to invest more of their scarce capital here in Australia—as opposed to other places in the world where they could invest it—by guaranteeing them a better return on that investment. They won't be investing because of goodwill and they won't be investing because they love Australia or our weather or our food or our furry animals; they'll be investing because they'll be able to get a better return than they once did and they'll be able to get a better return here relative to the alternative places they could invest.


The word 'backflip' is often abused in political commentary. Usually the word 'backflip' is applied to a party or a person who changes their position on something. But, of course, when you do a backflip, you're flipping around and falling exactly where you were before. In a funny way, that's what the Labor opposition has done this week. We know, as Senator Cormann quoted throughout question time today, that Senator Wong, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, have all been on the record in the past very eloquently supporting the case for business tax cuts in this country. They were then dragged, perhaps by the Greens or others, to oppose that position, and this week we have seen that they're on the way back to supporting them again.


Mr Shorten revealed this week that they may support the tax cut that has already been legislated for small and medium sized enterprises with up to $50 million in revenue. The backflip completed this week by the opposition is a real backflip indeed. They are back to a position that they used to hold a couple of years ago. It's good progress. I welcome it. There's only a little bit further for them to go. They should keep heading down the path that they're on. They should concede the argument, as they clearly have, that tax cuts for small and medium enterprise businesses are a good thing and the right thing to support, and they should follow that position to its logical conclusion. They should realise that supporting tax cuts for businesses with over $50 million in revenue will have the same beneficial impact as cutting taxes for businesses with under $50 million in revenue. In fact, as some economists argue, there is reason to believe that the beneficial impact of cutting taxes for businesses with over $50 million in revenue may be larger than the benefit from cutting taxes for small- and medium-sized businesses—though, no doubt, the impact will be positive for both.


I hope the sign this week is that the opposition are on a positive trajectory, a sensible trajectory. I hope they're reconsidering their previous populist opposition to company tax cuts. I hope they will do a real backflip in relation to the position they all held not that long ago, much as it might trouble some on their benches, Senator Cameron and Senator Carr included. Their own colleagues have very eloquently supported the case for business tax cuts in the past. I hope we will see them do so again. We've seen a ray of hope this week. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We may soon be able to see a much more sensible policy on business tax cuts from the opposition.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:15):  As I rise to take note of answers, I remind the good senator, Senator Paterson, that this debate is about taking note of an answer provided by a minister, in this case the Minister for Finance. A lot of Senator Paterson's contribution today was about attacking the Labor Party. I can see why he may have wanted to use up his time in the debate to do that, because I'm sure he would have been embarrassed by the answer that was given by the finance minister today to the question that was asked of him. It was an interesting answer that he gave today. He continued to persist with this belief that the government's $65 billion gift to big business will create jobs and lead to higher wages, despite all the evidence to the contrary. I simply can't understand how the members of the government continue with such complete certainty, when so much research and commentary and now even the Business Council's very own words—or, should I say, lack of words—contradict them.


The government tried to say that they are sure that their cash handout to big business will create jobs and result in higher wages, but do you know who isn't so sure? Big business. Surely, if you're going to go ahead and give away $65 billion of taxpayers' money, you'd want to make sure you get something in return. But, no, the government are pushing ahead anyway. They're determined to see this handout happen, no matter what the result. They're certain that $65 billion to big business will be good for the economy. But, if so, why wasn't the Business Council willing to make that commitment to the government? Why is it that the leaked letter that Senator Wong tabled here today—about which they shut down debate in the House of Representatives only hours ago—clearly shows us a before and an after? It shows a 'before letter', with a proposed commitment to create jobs, invest in Australia and pay tax, and an 'after letter', with none of those commitments included. It simply beggars belief that the government refuse to understand this.


After the leaking of a letter as plain as this, the finance minister should have been in front of the media, hat in hand, apologising to the Australian people and asking them to forget the whole thing and act like he'd never even tried to give away the public's money. Yet, somehow, the government continue to remain determined to legislate this corporate tax cut. Somehow, they're determined to push on. The government have been unable to get the numbers in the Senate today because this is bad policy. The leaked BCA letter today shows that.


As Fairfax media reported today, BCA members have apparently been negotiating on the terms of this letter for months, and good on them; they've got a right to be involved in public affairs. But, surely, during that time, a little bit of this government's certainty would have rubbed off on them.


Surely, if it's as plain as day that a tax cut is going to deliver more jobs, wages and taxes, this is exactly the kind of thing the BCA would've been able to get its members to sign on to. The government may be sure that a $65 billion gift to big business is going to lead to jobs, but apparently the BCA aren't. You'd think that, at a time when the OECD and the IMF are warning about the dangers of inequality to the economy, the government would be doing everything that it could do to see a pay rise for everyday Australians. But, only today, we've seen representatives of underpaid, early childhood educators here at Parliament House demanding better conditions. These educators are paid just $21 an hour, despite looking after Australia's future. How is it that this government could possibly be focused on gifting away cash to big business and they couldn't even meet with these workers today? I wish Senator Martin were here today to see this debate that is happening. (Time expired)

"Stoker, Sen Amanda",LP,2018-03-28,"



Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (15:21):  I rise to take note of the contribution of Senator Brown and of course the contributions made by Senator Cormann and particularly Senator Fierravanti-Wells in the course of today's debate.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Wong. Senator Stoker, in taking note, you're taking note of answers to questions. Senator Wong took note of answers provided by Senator Cormann, so that really needs to be the premise of your five-minute contribution.




Senator STOKER:
  Certainly. In the course of question time, Senator Cormann exposed Labor's complaint about the enterprise tax cuts that are before this parliament; he exposed that complaint for the misconception that it is. The policy to cut business tax rates doesn't work because the Business Council of Australia says it will or won't. It doesn't work because anybody else might write a letter expressing their opinion. It works, as Senator Cormann has explained, because it is basic economics. When we cut business tax rates, we attract capital and investment to this country. When we cut business tax rates, we empower businesses to reinvest in this country. We empower them to put more and more into growing their business. And what does that mean for Australians? It means the confidence to take on more staff, to create more jobs. It means that, as those jobs are created, unemployment reduces and competition for workers increases. It means that competition drives growing wages throughout the economy, and good employment opportunities and wages growth empower the confidence of Australian workers. It empowers them to spend. It empowers them to buy a home, to save for their retirement and to do all of the things that are so important to ordinary Australians reaching their potential.


This is good for the Australian economy, and, as Senator Cormann noted today, Labor knows it too. That's why Mr Shorten has expressed his firm support in the past for business tax cuts. He knows deep down that's what the Australian economy needs. He might be from the opposition, but I'll give him credit where it's due—he is right when he says so. But, when it became politically expedient, he abandoned that commitment. He abandoned common sense and he flip-flopped to now oppose what is a sensible measure to create growth in this economy. Mr Shorten, as Senator Cormann noted, flip-flopped like a pancake on the need to use business tax cuts to grow the Australian economy and create opportunities for Australians.


He did so just like he flipped on the need to invest in regional Queensland. He flipped just like he did on the importance of the Adani Carmichael mine in North Queensland, which will create desperately needed jobs for North Queenslanders. 


The coalition, in contrast, is absolutely committed to building opportunity and jobs in this country. All of the evidence that is before this parliament, including the Australian Treasury's modelling when it examined international trends in company tax rates and the implications for Australian company tax, shows that as these rates are reduced there is an enormous benefit to the Australian economy. All of it shows that, as company tax rates reduce, there is growth in the corporate sector, increased profitability and increased opportunity for Australians.


I want to turn to the answers given by Senator Fierravanti-Wells in the course of question time. She explained how important the Australian coalition's commitment is to providing support to our partners throughout the Asia-Pacific region. It's worth noting that aid has increased in this country. In 2017-18 it rose to $3.9 billion, which is a 2.2 per cent increase on the previous year. That program is committed to providing lifesaving assistance to those in need. We are giving $399.7 million in this financial year to humanitarian emergency and disaster relief. The government doesn't commit to prescriptive time-bound targets, but it will always remain focused on delivering results for the people in our region and security for this nation. (Time expired)

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:26):  It's a pleasure to follow on from Senator Stoker, but unfortunately, being a fellow Queensland senator, I'm going to have to disagree with the senator in this debate. I want to pick up on one word that the senator used, and that is 'exposed'. There is only one thing that has been exposed today and that's the hoax that Senator Cormann and their big business mates, in conjunction with their work with the Business Council of Australia, were purporting to have on the Australian people, Australian workers and Australian families. That's what was exposed in the question from Senator Wong. It has also been unravelling this week.


What we see in this debate around company tax is that it really is about priorities. Australian families know and understand that those on that side are on the side of big business and the banks, whereas we on this side are on the side of Australian families and Australian workers, and we are absolutely proud to be so. What we have seen exposed this week has been as a result of the desperation of Senator Cormann and his government to get a deal done with the crossbench. They will say and do anything to convince the crossbenchers to sign up with them and also to convince the Australian public. I'm very thankful that there are a number of crossbenchers who were prepared to hold out and ensure that the hoax those opposite were trying to purport was exposed. That's happened throughout this week because of what happened within the Business Council of Australia.


First, there was a survey that contradicted their public stance. This was exposed earlier in the week. It basically went to CEOs not actually investing the money into wages or further growth in Australia. It actually started with the survey. What we have seen exposed by Senator Wong through her question to Senator Cormann today is the letter they were touting to the crossbench. They were using this letter to convince the crossbenchers to sign up to support the big business tax breaks that the government has been supporting. It exposed that as a hoax as well.


Let me go through in detail what elements of that have been a hoax. First, they deleted a commitment to increase wages. That is one of the key selling points that those opposite have been using. It was in the draft letter that the BCA put together, but it was deleted from that. They also deleted the commitment in there that they would create more Australian jobs in the cities, suburbs, towns and bush.


That's very Churchillian, almost like it was from Senator Cormann yesterday. That came out. For those people out there who are looking for work or for those in areas where there is a depressed employment market, they deleted the comment that would have given those people some hope. And this, for me, is just gobsmacking: they deleted a commitment 'to pay our tax'. Rightly, Australians are sceptical about the hoax that has been put forward. What really is exposed here is that there's a public view that they put out to try and convince the crossbench senators and the public of what their position is, and then they've got a private view. That private view should be very concerning if you are an Australian worker or an Australian family out there, because they make no commitment, in private, to doing what they are saying in public, and that is what has been exposed through this process.


So, when we look at the consequences of what this big business tax cut would mean, what we on the Labor side know, and what Australian families know, is this will result in a cut to services—cuts to health, cuts to education. Where does this impact the most? In regional areas. So there are no commitments to jobs and no commitments to investment. That's all a public hoax. But, when we look up what they're privately committed to, it will mean cuts to health and cuts to education that will have a devastating impact on communities, particularly those in regional areas that most rely on this. These communities see no benefit; all they see is the downside. And they will absolutely hold this government to account.


We know, as I said at the start, that this is all about priorities. What the Australian public know is that those opposite are on the side of big business and the banks. Those on this side are on the side of Australian families and Australian workers, and I absolutely know where we will stay as we fight this until the next election.


Question agreed to.

That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


   (i) in March 2017, the United States of America (US) Full House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform heard that approximately half of adult Americans' photographs are in a Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) database—FRT has accuracy deficiencies leading to misidentifying female and African American individuals at a higher rate; human verification is often insufficient as a backup and can allow for racial bias; the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) accepts an error rate of 15% in its system, and that the FBI used FRT for years without first publishing a privacy impact assessment and went to great lengths to exempt itself from certain provisions of the Privacy Act,


   (ii) in June 2016, the US Government Accountability Office analysed the FBI's use of FRT and found it to be lacking in accountability, accuracy and oversight, with key concerns that the FBI system does not test for false positives or for racial bias,


   (iii) FRT is subject to biases based on the data sets provided and the conditions in which algorithms are created, and


   (iv) the National Facial Biometric Matching Capability, based on the FBI's Next Generation Identification program, is subject to the same risks of bias and error rates; and


(b) calls on the Federal Government to ensure that:


   (i) all steps are taken to minimise bias and error rates in government facial recognition systems, including testing for false positives and racial bias, and


   (ii) government agencies using facial recognition systems comply with the Privacy Act, and maintain transparency, accountability, accuracy and oversight.

   (iii) on 25 May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into effect, for all companies that hold data within or as a result of doing business with citizens of the European Union (EU),


   (iv) under the GDPR, consent must be explicit for data collected and for the purposes for which data is used, and individuals will have the right of access to their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed, a right to request erasure of personal data related to them, and a right to be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another,


   (v) the GDPR will include a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide turnover or 20 million Euro, whichever is higher, and


   (vi) the GDPR represents current best practice regarding standards for the protection of data and, as many Australian businesses will need to comply with the GDPR, implementing a similar regime in Australia would be the most cost-effective way to improve data protection standards; and

Senator McGRATH:
  In the Australian context, the collection, use, storage, access and disclosure of personal information by government agencies and certain private sector organisations is governed by the Privacy Act. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation includes requirements that resemble those in the Privacy Act. The government recently strengthened the protections under the Privacy Act by introducing a Notifiable Data Breaches scheme. This scheme requires notification to affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner where an entity that is subject to the Privacy Act experiences a data breach of personal information that poses a likely risk of serious harm to affected individuals.

One wants to ensure that all steps be taken to ensure that facial biometric recognition technology does not suffer from the same critical errors that we have seen in the US. This motion before us relates to enhancing to world's best practice the rights of Australians' data.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT

The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senator Hanson:


Dear Mr President,


Pursuant to standing order 75, I give notice today I propose to move that, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


In view of the overwhelming public and professional support for the use of whole plant medicinal cannabis, the need for it to be listed in schedule 4 of the Therapeutic Goods Act, so it may be prescribed by an authorised health professional and available for purchase from the pharmacy.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:00):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


In view of the overwhelming public and professional support for the use of whole plant medicinal cannabis, the need for it to be listed in schedule 4 of the Therapeutic Goods Act, so it may be prescribed by an authorised health professional and available for purchase from the pharmacy.


As all members of this house know, for more than five years I have been a very strong advocate for the use of whole plant medicinal cannabis. It came off the back of a woman I met who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Surgery was out of the question and conventional drugs had left her for dead. Imagine a doctor saying, 'Sorry darl, everything we've done just won't stop the cancer,' or, 'Sorry darl, I can't prescribe you anything stronger to deal with the pain you're suffering; you are already on the most potent,' or, 'Sorry darl, your child will have to be kept in a comatose-like state because there are no other drugs that will stop the seizures.'


Secretly, the majority of people in the Senate support the use of whole plant medicinal cannabis, as I do. The problem is that too many of you are too gutless to take the necessary steps to make any change and come into line with the thinking of most of the general public. Why? Because you fear what your pharmaceutical mates might come out and say or, worse still, you fear they'll pull your political donations.


You might ask yourself why One Nation would bring to this chamber a matter of public urgency regarding whole plant medicinal cannabis. The truth is that up to 100,000 Australians are being forced to break the law by sourcing medicinal cannabis oil from the black market. These people are our next-door neighbours, our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters or our uncles and aunts. They are everyday people caught in a world of pain and suffering. They are people who can't wait any longer. It's almost as if the cold weather down here in Canberra freezes the hearts of elected members. Unless you've suffered the effects of chemotherapy, epilepsy, tremors, PTSD or one of the dozens of other symptoms medicinal cannabis can assist you with, you really don't know what I'm talking about. I have no doubt you all know someone going through these symptoms, so I ask you all here today: why are you preventing the use of a natural drug?


In my home state of Queensland, the Labor government and the health department are denying medicinal cannabis oil to a nine-year-old girl by the name of Caitlin, and instead want to dope her up on oxycodone, OxyContin, tramadol and diazepam. Each and every time this girl is forced to take pharmaceutical drugs of this nature, her body shuts down. Medicinal cannabis oil is the only thing that gives her any quality of life. Right this minute, nine-year-old Caitlin needs an urgent operation to extend the growth rods in her back and the health department refused to allow her mother to administer medicinal cannabis oil while she's in the hospital. Even Caitlin's own doctor has written a letter of support to allow her to keep using cannabis oil, which the Labor government and the Queensland health department refuse to acknowledge. This is just one case of the 100,000 people forced to source illegal black-market medicinal cannabis oil.


Every day, my office, my website and my Facebook page receive contact from people asking why they cannot access this pain-relieving product. Why are we so behind the eight ball in Australia in this field compared to many other countries in the world? And, yet, this government went to the election on a platform of innovation and jobs. I'm telling you right now: medical cannabis oil is innovative. It will get people back to work sooner. It will stop so much suffering and mitigate the tears that flow every single day from helpless family members who sit and watch their loved ones in pain.


I have to highlight that there are very few people in politics willing to put their heads on the chopping block and fight so hard on this matter. I take my hat off to Steve Dickson, who did that just last year when he came to One Nation because of this very subject. No-one in his former party were willing to step up and speak out on this subject, and I want to thank Steve Dickson for continuously helping me keep this matter in the public arena and pushing for legislative reform.


We know that the Australian government has approved the growing, harvesting and manufacturing of whole-plant medicinal cannabis. So why can't everyday Australians get access? It is not because the product goes off, because it can be kept unrefrigerated for up to 12 months. I'll tell you why Aussies can't get access to medical cannabis—it's because of the onerous paperwork and bureaucracy. Every single one of us in this chamber today has the ability to change that. That's what we were elected to do—to make decisions for the greater good of everyday people. Bureaucrats weren't elected; we were. Pharmaceutical companies were not elected; we were. I'm not interested in synthetic products produced by greedy pharmaceutical companies, and neither are the public. We want access to the real deal. Please, no more excuses. No more telling me, 'We're doing our best to give sufferers access,' because the public are telling me they can't access it.


I'll leave you with one parting comment before we break for Easter. This weekend marks a time when Christ gave his life for the sake of ours. I'm not asking for any of you to give your lives today. I'm just asking you to give your vote to support medical cannabis oil and help save the lives of others.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:07):  Today I rise to speak on the urgency motion put forward in this place by Senator Hanson. I want to place on the record that Labor have consistently fought for improved access to medical cannabis in circumstances where it's clinically desirable for patients. We've been listening to patients. I've met with patients. I know that the shadow health minister Catherine King has also met with patients. We have put forward our own clear thoughts on these issues. But what we have seen coming from the government, on the other hand, is them very much dragging their heels on this issue. When they finally established a national scheme, it was so complicated and had so many barriers to access that people simply gave up. This goes some way to highlighting the kinds of issues that Senator Hanson has raised in the Senate today. Instead of prioritising access for patients, what the government did at that time—and still does—was stigmatise desperate Australians who were unwell, who were dying or who had serious conditions such as epilepsy and were trying to overcome the barriers in the system to access medical cannabis.


But I want to be clear about the motion that's before us today. It is simply a statement of opinion before this place. Being so, it's an attempt by Senator Hanson to try to hide her failure to stand up in this place for better medical access to cannabis.




Senator Hanson:
  You're pathetic! You're absolutely pathetic!




Senator PRATT:
  I'm happy for you to interject, Senator Hanson, but the critical matter is this: when, in May, this Senate voted to disallow the government's restrictions on access to medicinal cannabis, under category A of the Special Access Scheme, in recognition that access to category A has always been tightly restricted to people with a terminal illness, and only if it's clinically appropriate, Senator Hanson and her colleagues voted with the government against the disallowance. So Senator Hanson voted that medicinal cannabis should only be made available and tightly restricted to people with a terminal illness. Those are not the circumstances which you've brought to the parliament today. I'm very glad to hear you've had a change of heart. But I need to call you out on it because it was disappointing to advocates and families, at the time, when you voted against easier access to medicinal cannabis for those who needed it. So today's attempt, I think, from Senator Hanson, is an attempt to hide those failures.


Even though the Senate did successfully disallow the government's regulations—the government and One Nation voted together; the Greens, the Labor Party and others voted to disallow the regulations—the government has not responded appropriately, and I would call on Senator Hanson to use her close relationships with the government to put some real pressure on them. Terminally ill patients should, at that time, have been given easier access to a prescribed therapy to ease their suffering. But what we've seen instead from the government in the months since is an attempt to block the parliament's will and to continue to deny relief to dying Australians. Labor supports today's urgency motion and, indeed, the principle of urgency on this topic, because the government deserves to be sent a clear message that more needs to be done, and we want to send a message of support to all of those people who are suffering from their failure to act. We think the status quo is simply not good enough.


We know that there are people for whom access to medicinal cannabis is clinically desirable for their conditions. I spoke to a young woman with epilepsy in Western Australia. She buys her medicinal cannabis on the black market, because it's the only thing that gives her any respite from regular epileptic fits, but she has no clear pathway to purchase it in a legal manner.


It's important to note that, even if today's vote is successful, it won't actually change anything for people seeking improved access to medicinal cannabis. Senator Hanson's urgency motion fails to recognise some significant things about the way our system works currently, and things that simply have to be fixed properly for people to get access to medicinal cannabis. One thing I'd like to highlight to the chamber is Australia's international obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. What patients seek, as to access to medicinal cannabis, is a considered policy—that's what we need: to provide access, through a GP, to a regulated, quality supply of medicinal cannabis. And that is not what this motion before us puts forward today.




Senator Hanson:
  I think you'd better read what's on the sheet!




Senator PRATT:
  I can read the motion. It says that there's professional support for medicinal cannabis and that it needs to be listed on schedule 4 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. But let's be clear: there are different schedules, and, I'm not sure as to whether it belongs in schedule 4 or a different schedule. We have tightly controlled opiate drugs, which are also very desired on the black market for drug use, that are prescribed, and, as far as I understand, they don't belong on schedule 4, so we need to look very carefully at which schedule these drugs belong on.


We need to make sure that people have a clear, accessible pathway. I have spoken to patients in Western Australia who, despite the supposed process of the TGA and the supposed processes of state governments to give people access to medicinal cannabis, could still not find a prescribing doctor. And the paperwork attached to being a prescribing doctor and putting yourself out there and finding a supplier—which you can't find regularly through a pharmacy—has proven just too great for too many patients in getting access to the medicinal cannabis that would help them and their children and their families.


So Labor, in 2015, made a very clear commitment that we wanted to work with state and territory governments to ensure there were nationally consistent laws to allow successful access to medicinal cannabis for those who are terminally ill or who have other clinically identified medical conditions that medicinal cannabis may benefit. What we've seen in the Turnbull government is a government that is too slow in catching up and in adopting a similar policy to Labor's. And it's been even slower, I have to tell you, in implementing anything. You've been too focused on getting headlines and have forgotten about patients. Let's be clear: this is not about allowing free access to a drug for recreational use—although I would like to put on the record how proud I was to be part of the Gallop Labor government that back in the early 2000s decriminalised cannabis in small quantities because of the large social toll that it was taking on the community in terms of putting people on a criminal pathway.


But that's not what we are debating today. It is about ensuring that there is a legal and regulated market so that family members and carers aren't forced to rely on the black market to relieve the pain of their loved ones. We have seen in report after report that patients are facing barrier after barrier. It's almost impossible to find a prescribing doctor. When I spoke to patients in Western Australia, they could not identify any, despite the fact that doctors now have a right to prescribe this drug. So they've given up hope that things will become easier and they don't believe what the Turnbull government says. They've trusted them before and things have not improved. (Time expired)

 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:17):  I rise to speak to this urgency motion about access to medicinal cannabis. It's an issue which is a personal passion of mine and a key priority of the Australian Greens. It's long past time that Australians got access to medicinal cannabis treatments—treatments that we know work, treatments that have the potential to relieve pain and suffering, treatments that can prevent nausea, treatments that can ease the symptoms associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis, treatments which do have a role in pain management.


This government should be ashamed of its record when it comes to giving access to medicinal cannabis. For many years, we've seen people who have championed this cause—people like Dan and Lucy Haslam, who had to lobby the government about the unbearable suffering caused by Dan's chemotherapy. Dan had bowel cancer. He was having chemotherapy. He had nausea and it wasn't relieved by a range of anti-nausea agents. Medicinal cannabis was the only thing that provided him with some relief to allow him to continue to eat and have some quality of life while he was receiving treatment. Sadly, Dan has since passed away. Of course, the great tragedy is that, even if Dan were still alive, he would not be able to have a consistent legal supply of medicinal cannabis to ease his suffering—even now.


Several years ago, the Greens decided that we needed some action here. We introduced the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill, which was cross-party legislation. It was a clear example of how the community, working together with their parliamentary representatives—and, of course, the Greens were front and centre in that change—allowed us to put pressure on the government. 


The government, rather than accepting this as the most logical and rational approach to how we regulate cannabis—that is, to create a separate body to deal with many of the issues that are unique to medicinal cannabis—gave us their Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill. That has effectively been a regulatory nightmare. People have to jump through hoops. There are so many obstacles that one needs to pass before one can get access to medicinal cannabis. You only need to look at the number of people right now who are being prescribed medicinal cannabis by their medical practitioner, which is only several hundred, to know that this scheme isn't working. The TGA medicinal cannabis experiment has failed, and we need a new approach.


Of course, this parliament gave the government the benefit of the doubt when they said that they were serious about reform in this area. Instead, we've got this disaster of overregulation and red tape and the continuation of an ideology that stops people from getting access to this treatment. We've tried to modify the government's proposal. In fact, we've done it through a disallowance motion. Indeed, we were successful in our disallowance motion, through the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017, in the Senate last year.


I have to remind the Senate that it was Senator Hanson and One Nation who voted against that piece of legislation when it was put before the parliament. That was legislation that would have given compassionate access to people who needed medicinal cannabis. Of course, I'm pleased that after the Greens had that vote recommitted—thanks to former Senator Jacqui Lambie, who made it clear that she had been unable to vote on that legislation—One Nation changed their position and we were successful in getting that disallowance through the Senate. We have continued to advocate for a process that removes barriers to access to medicinal cannabis under Special Access Scheme category A, ending the duplication in the regulatory process and ensuring that clinicians are informed. But the bottom line is we need to overhaul the system.


We'll support this urgency motion, but, sadly, this is a motion that gives patients false hope. Even if this motion does pass, it won't have any effect. What we need to do is have this government change the law. That is the only way we'll start to see people getting access to medicinal cannabis. It's so clear that the only model is to create an independent pathway—one that's separate from the TGA—that says, 'If you are suffering from a terminal illness, indeed, if you are suffering from a range of other conditions for which the evidence base is clear, then a doctor will be able to prescribe you this medication, because we know it's effective and we know it works.'

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (16:22):  I support what the previous speakers have said. I suspect I'm probably the only person in this place who has been to medicinal cannabis conferences at Nimbin for the past two years. I never though I would be saying this, but I appreciate it that Senator Hanson, although she did vote against it, is now voting with us. I think she had been spooked by a last-minute scare that was sent through the government from the health minister at that time.


I won't go over all the old ground. I do agree with Senator Di Natale: the government has to change its law. We've got cannabis oil companies on the stock exchange. We've got the Victorian government supporting marijuana being grown in Victoria. I've had to forward a plan that Norfolk Island should become like Tasmania and do with medical marijuana what they do with poppies in Tasmania.


When you're in Nimbin you talk to people, you hear other cases. I talked to a woman whose daughter had 900 epileptic convulsions. She has to risk criminal prosecution to get oil for her child. I met a man in Nimbin, an elderly man with brain cancer, who risks criminal prosecution to get access to that product. That is why it is wrong. It is time for us to change. The government has been obstructionist. We did get disallowance motions through, but they are not following the spirit of the Senate. They are not following through with the spirit of the law. They don't care about people who are desperately in need of this treatment.


One of the last things I did before I jumped the shark was a big story on medicinal cannabis on a Sunday night television program. Some of the stories there were absolutely horrifying. I plead with the government and I plead with the health minister: go and look at that story. Go back there and see the sorts of cases we had of people and their children suffering. I met one man in Nimbin who'd been to jail because he grew marijuana and made cannabis oil for his neighbour. He did time in jail for it. I plead with the government: stop being obstructionist. Get on with it and change the bloody law.


Question agreed to.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:26):  I present the 168th report of the Standing Committee of Privileges entitled Parliamentary privilege and the use of intrusive powers, and I move:


That the report be adopted.


The Privileges Committee has reported on the inquiry referred to it on 28 November 2016 into the intersection between parliamentary privilege and the use of intrusive powers by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. At the time the committee received this reference, it was conducting another inquiry into claims of parliamentary privilege over documents seized from a senator's office and the home of a staff member. The committee was also examining a possible contempt which had arisen in the execution of a search warrant. These are—and indeed were—very important matters and subject of a previous report of the committee. 


During this inquiry, the committee considered the powers that allow access to telecommunications data or metadata as well as other intrusive powers which enable agencies to, for example, enter and search premises and seize evidential material with a search warrant, intercept live communications and conduct other electronic surveillance, and access stored and other communications and data. The committee also examined the oversight mechanisms established to ensure that such powers are exercised properly and whether the agencies using those powers are maintaining records in accordance with the law. Key questions included: what, if any, recognition is given to the work of parliamentarians, and whether claims of parliamentary privilege could be made, and, if so, how they could be resolved? 


Disturbingly, the evidence revealed no consideration of how questions of parliamentary privilege may be dealt with when intrusive powers are used, whether covert or not. In fact, the case presented was that the covert nature of intrusive powers meant that questions of parliamentary privilege were not considered to be relevant. The thinking seems to be that what is not seen or heard cannot possibly give rise to an improper interference with the work of the parliament and, therefore, a possible contempt. The Privileges Committee is concerned that this stems from the view that parliamentary privilege is limited simply to the 'use' immunity, which guarantees that the testimony of a witness will not be used against them as evidence in a court, rather than the clearly established systems of powers and immunities that the Commonwealth parliament inherited from the House of Commons in 1901. 


Law enforcement and intelligence agencies shared with the committee the importance of intrusive powers to their investigatory work and the need to preserve the flexibility and efficacy of their investigations. The committee acknowledged that.


There was also the suggestion that parliamentarians not be considered either above the law or immunised from the attention of foreign powers. The committee notes that the inquiry was not a reference to expand the powers and immunities of the parliament, which are jointly referred to as parliamentary privilege, but the committee did consider the purpose of parliamentary privilege, which is to enable the parliament to effectively carry out its functions. In the words of Odgers' Australian Senate Practice:


The primary functions of the Senate are to inquire, to debate and to legislate, and any analysis of parliamentary privilege must be related to the way in which it assists and protects those functions.


While the Australian Federal Police expressed some scepticism regarding the potential for its exercise of intrusive powers to have a chilling effect on the work of the parliament, the President of the New South Wales Legislative Council submitted that there was good cause to believe that any such covert powers had the potential to curtail the free and ready flow of information to members and the issues of privilege that may arise. The Australian Federal Police also argued that its use of covert intrusive powers is subject to robust oversight and accountability mechanisms, including external scrutiny by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, but the Ombudsman advised that it does not consider the implications of parliamentary privilege in performing its statutory compliance audits of law enforcement agencies.


The committee concluded that the lawful use of intrusive powers can have a chilling effect on the work of this parliament. Parliamentary privilege does not diminish because of the mechanism used to access material. How material related to the work of a parliamentarian is accessed should not determine whether parliamentary privilege exists. It is clear to the committee that this view is not held by those involved in using intrusive powers, whether covertly or otherwise, and so the Privileges Committee, therefore, examined possible remedies to this problem.


The committee sought a clear process for claims of parliamentary privilege to be made and assessed when such powers are used while at the same time allowing the investigation of serious criminal and intelligence matters to continue unimpeded. The committee examined the existing 2005 memorandum of understanding between the executive and the parliament, and the national guideline it underpins. These documents set out the processes to be followed by the Australian Federal Police when it seeks to execute a search warrant on premises occupied or used by a parliamentarian, including the Parliament House office, electorate office and residence.


The committee concluded that the memorandum of understanding provides a useful template and recommends that the Presiding Officers, in consultation with the executive, develop extra protocols that will set out agreed processes to be followed by law enforcement and intelligence agencies when exercising intrusive and other investigative powers. The effect of the motion I have moved today is for the Senate to adopt the committee's recommendations.


The committee's consideration of the memorandum of understanding also proved useful on another level, as it explored the issue of third-party assistance in the execution of search warrants. This was one amongst many new developments in this space. The Australian Federal Police gave evidence that the recent experience where a third party assisted in the execution of a search warrant, and the possible improper interference that occurred, was because the national guideline had not envisaged that such assistance might occur. The Australian Federal Police supported updating the national guideline to address the use of constables or third parties assisting in the execution of search warrants. The committee agrees and suggests that, until the necessary consultations to amend the national guideline can occur, the matter be dealt with administratively. If no other senator wishes to speak at this time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The answer read as follows—



Dear Mr President


I write with regard to a question I took on notice from Senator McAllister on Tuesday, 20 March 2018, on the matter of dividend imputation refunds.


The figures that Senator McAllister quoted are incorrect.


I note that the Tax Expenditures Statement (TES), released by Treasury on an annual basis, estimates revenue forgone where the actual tax treatment differs from the `benchmark'. As described in the 2017 TES:



""
The income tax benchmark incorporates a range of features of the tax system, including: ... Arrangements to reduce or eliminate double taxation — for example, the imputation system, which eliminates the double taxation of company profits distributed to resident shareholders.
""

(Pages 142 and 143)


The refundability of franking credits to Australian taxpayers is consistent with the income tax benchmark and as a result are not treated as a tax expenditure in the TES.


The Labor Party should release their costings, including the measure of their reliability, for public scrutiny.

The speeches read as follows—



HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT LOAN SUSTAINABILITY) BILL 2018


The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 amends education and other legislation that underpins student loans, in particular the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) and the Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS). 


It introduces a revised new set of repayment thresholds for student loans, changes indexation arrangements for repayment thresholds, amends the order of repayment of some student loan debts, and introduces a combined lifetime loan limit for HELP.


On 18 December last year, the Turnbull Government released its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO), including legislative measures affecting higher education that are the subject of this Bill.


The policy measures announced in MYEFO will ensure that Australia's world-leading, income-contingent student loan system can continue to be available to future generations of students.


Australia must face up to the task of putting our higher education system on a more sustainable, responsible path for the future. The measures in this Bill are proportionate and they help achieve that goal.


The government will not proceed with the previous legislative proposals from the 2017-18 Budget.


Instead, the measures in this Bill:


set a new schedule of repayment thresholds for HELP from 1 July 2018, with a lower minimum repayment threshold of $45,000 at a one per cent repayment rate, with smaller incremental rises in thresholds and repayment rates, up to a top threshold of $131,989 at which ten per cent of income is repayable;


align the indexation of the repayment thresholds to the Consumer Price Index (CPI); 


from 1 July 2019, bring repayment thresholds for the Student Financial Supplement Scheme - managed by the Social Services portfolio - into line with HELP repayment thresholds, and make corresponding changes to the order of repayment of student loan debts; and


introduce a new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP to cover their tuition fees. The combined limit is $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses, and $104,440 for other students. While the loan limit is not new, it will now apply to Commonwealth supported students borrowing through HECS-HELP as well as fee-paying students accessing FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and VET student loans.




The case for change



HELP lending has grown rapidly with the expansion of the demand driven system – the amount of HELP loans accessed has increased from 


$3 billion in 2009 to nearly $7 billion in 2016. 


Since 2009 funding for Commonwealth supported places has grown at twice the rate of the economy. There has been no limit on how many degrees a student could undertake, as long as they undertook this study in a Commonwealth supported place.


A small number of people have treated this as a blank cheque to a lifetime of university education, rather than as a stepping stone into a fulfilling career. The objective of public investment is to assist people to actively participate in the workforce, earning an income that enables them to pay back their debts. It's not to take their fellow taxpayer for a ride.


Some individuals have amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars of HELP debt – more than they will ever be able to repay in their lifetime. This is an unintended consequence of taxpayers' generosity.


This Bill extends the lifetime loan limit that is already in place for fee‑paying students accessing FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP or VET student loans to Commonwealth supported students receiving HECS‑HELP assistance.


HELP debt is not limited to the higher education system.


The expansion of HELP to the VET sector in 2008 led to VET FEE-HELP loan debt escalating to over $1 billion by 2016.


The Turnbull Government shut down the runaway VET FEE-HELP loan scheme at the end of 2016 and replaced it with VET student loans. This is a much more tightly controlled scheme, with caps on tuition amounts and extensive safeguards against rorting by unethical providers.


However, damage was done, both to the reputation of our student loan schemes and to the Budget bottom line, in terms of overall outstanding debt. 


As at 30 June 2017, outstanding HELP debt was $55.4 billion and the 'fair value' of HELP – the amount we may expect to be eventually repaid by borrowers – was valued by the actuary at $35.9 billion. 


The fiscal challenge for the Government is that HELP repayments have not kept pace with HELP lending growth. From 2010–11 to 2016–17, the level of new debt not expected to be repaid increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent.


It is no longer possible to ignore the long-term burden of this debt on the taxpayer.


And so, the measures in this Bill, in a number of sound, evidence-based ways, will achieve a more sustainable future for student loans.


Schedule 1 of the Bill proposes a new set of repayment thresholds commencing from 1 July this year.


There is a new minimum repayment income of $45,000 at which one per cent of income is repayable. The second threshold is $51,957 with a two per cent repayment rate.


Each progressive threshold increases by six per cent income amounts and by 0.5 per cent increments in repayment rates, which smooths repayment obligations. Importantly, this new schedule of thresholds will also reduce incentive for debtors to ""cluster"" below thresholds to avoid repayments as they do now.


There are increased repayment rates for those earning the highest incomes, who are best placed to repay their debts sooner – with those earning $131,989 or more paying at ten per cent of their income.


From 2019–20, the revised HELP thresholds will also apply to SFSS debts under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Assistance Act 1973. Currently, these debts are repaid concurrently with HELP debts but according to a subset of just three thresholds. 


To improve rates of repayment of SFSS debts, and to achieve consistency in debt administration, the current three-tier threshold approach applied to SFSS repayments will be replaced with the full range of HELP thresholds. There will be a transitional year in 2018–19 that maintains the three-tier threshold arrangement while systems changes are implemented, and to allow these debtors additional time for transition.


Schedule 1 of the Bill also implements new indexation arrangements for the HELP repayment thresholds, which are currently indexed according to Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).


For a number of years now, the HELP repayment thresholds have been rising relative to earnings. The higher growth in AWE has meant that people have dropped from a higher repayment threshold to a lower one, or have dropped out of the repayment stream altogether as the thresholds rise faster than their income growth. 


This Bill provides that the minimum and all subsequent thresholds will be indexed using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This will ensure repayment requirements are adjusted in line with the cost of living. It also streamlines indexation factors used throughout the Higher Education Support Act 2003, as all amounts will be indexed in the same way.


This amendment also reflects the National Commission of Audit's 2014 recommendation to improve the sustainability of HELP, in part, by indexing using this method.


Schedule 2 of the Bill amends the order of repayment of student loan debts by loan type.


Currently, student debts under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Assistance Act 1973 are repaid concurrently with HELP debts. 


From 2019–20, when the full schedule of HELP thresholds will start to apply, old debts from SFSS will be repaid after HELP debts are discharged rather than concurrently. This will avoid debtors under both schemes facing excessive repayment liabilities.


Student Start-up Loans will be repaid after HELP and Student Financial Supplement Scheme liabilities are extinguished.


Trade Support Loans will be repaid after all other student loan debt liabilities.


That is, from 2019–20, a person is not liable to repay their Trade Support Loan debt if they have repayment obligations under HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP, VET student loans, Student Financial Supplement Scheme or Student Start-up Loans.


To put it in the simplest terms, this Schedule of the Bill establishes that HELP debt takes priority over other student loan debts.


Schedule 3 of the Bill provides for the expansion of the lifetime loan limit to all HELP loans for which a student can defer their tuition fees.


Tertiary education students accessing FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and VET student loans have always been subject to a lifetime limit on the amount they can borrow.


This Schedule of the Bill:


sets new loan limits from 1 January 2019 onwards, including an increased loan limit for higher education students enrolled in medicine, dentistry or veterinary science courses;


applies the loan limit to Commonwealth supported students accessing HECS-HELP loans for the first time, meaning all new borrowing after 1 January 2019 will reduce a student's available HELP balance;


makes a number of consequential amendments to the Act to broaden the application of the existing FEE-HELP limit and FEE‑HELP balance to include HECS-HELP loans.




New loan limits



The new $150,000 loan limit for students undertaking medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses (as defined in the Act) is an increase on the estimated FEE-HELP limit of $130,552 for 2019. Students in these courses who had previously reached their FEE-HELP limit will, from 2019, have access to additional funds up to the new $150,000 limit. The new limit is considered more than sufficient to cover the Government‑subsidised tuition fees for these longer, and therefore more expensive courses.


Apart from annual indexation increases, the loan limit applying to students in other courses remains the same, with a base amount of $104,440 in 2019.


The combined lifetime loan limit is unlikely to present a financial obstacle for the vast majority of tertiary students, even if they undertake more than one course of study or undertake studies in both vocational education and higher education. 


This is because with the recently introduced VET student loans program, the Turnbull Government put in place loan caps on the amount of financial assistance available to be borrowed each year (from $5,075 up to a maximum of $15,225, depending on the course, for a year of full-time study in the 2018 academic year). 


VET courses are typically shorter in duration than higher education courses, and the amounts borrowed will tend to be lower.


Similarly, student contribution amounts under HECS-HELP are capped – and will continue to be capped (from $6,444 up to a maximum of $10,754, depending on the student contribution band, for a year of full-time study in 2018).


The new combined HELP tuition limit – from $104,440 to $150,000 – is more than adequate. In fact, it is sufficient to cover almost nine years of full-time study as a Commonwealth supported student in higher education — even in the most expensive courses. The loan limit is also sufficient to cover students who choose to undertake a mix of Commonwealth supported and fee-paying courses.


It is reasonable and fair that there is a limit on how much any one person can borrow from the taxpayer for their tertiary education. 


Commonwealth financial assistance through the HELP scheme is there to support students through their tertiary education. It exists to help them acquire the educational foundation for their working lives by removing the barrier of upfront tuition fees. 


It was never meant to be a lifelong buffet for ""all-you-can-study"".


To be clear, all new HECS-HELP borrowing will reduce a student's HELP balance – the amount that they can still borrow within the new lifetime loan limit. Previously accumulated HECS-HELP debt will not be counted but any new amounts deferred through a HECS-HELP loan from 1 January 2019 will count against a person's HELP balance.


Any FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP or VET student loans debt already accrued under the existing FEE-HELP limit will be transferred onto the new HELP tuition limit for that student. A person will only be able to borrow up to the new loan limit. 


A person's accumulated HELP debt will still, of course, need to be repaid in the same way as it is currently through the taxation system, including if they go overseas for a substantial period of time.


These reforms ensure our high quality higher education system can grow while meeting the global challenges it will increasingly face. It ensures that eligible students will continue to be able to access higher education and vocational education irrespective of their background or financial means. The focus of our higher education system is where it should be – on our students both now, and in the future. 


I commend the Bill.


MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT (RATES OF CHARGE) BILL 2017


I move that this bill be now read a second time.


The purpose of this bill is to amend the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997 (the charge act).


The amendments will ensure that a migration agent who originally applied for and had their registration as a non-commercial agent approved, but who at any point through that registration period becomes a commercial agent, becomes liable to pay a pro-rata commercial charge for the period in which they were a commercial agent.


This is one of a number of changes to portfolio legislation that are aimed at making the commercial registration application charge the default charge payable, and ensuring that the non-commercial charge can only be accessed by those applicants who will be genuinely be offering services on a non-profit basis and in association with a charitable organisation.


The charge amount payable is to be worked out in accordance with the formula within the legislation.


These amendments will complement those I have just discussed in relation to an agent's notification requirements should their registration status change from non-commercial to commercial at any point during their registration year.


The amendment will also complement those recently made to the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Regulations 1998. The amendments make the commercial registration application charge the default charge payable, unless an applicant can prove they meet all eligibility criteria that allows them to access the non-commercial charge.


Conclusion


In conclusion, this bill makes an important amendment in ensuring that only those agents who are providing genuinely non-commercial immigration assistance to the most vulnerable members of our community can access the non-commercial registration charge.


I commend the bill to the Chamber.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

We noted that, in relation to banking disputes, the bill was basically a rebadging exercise and the name 'authority' was a misnomer. This amendment seeks to include valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers in the AFCA scheme. However, stakeholders, including the Institute of Public Accountants, in their reply to the Ramsey review, raised a number of technical issues with regard to including such third parties in the AFCA framework. While we cannot support this amendment today, we acknowledge concerns about the conduct of banks, which is why we have fought so hard for a royal commission.

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-03-28,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (17:36):  This amendment includes valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers in the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, scheme. Bank appointed valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers act in a largely unsupervised environment. Misconduct in this sector has been raised in numerous past government and Senate inquiries. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has recommended changes, and so have various other inquiries.


If we are serious about stopping white-collar and banking misconduct in Australia, we should support these changes, and we call for your support to do this with us. The problem is that the new AFCA, in its current form, will not investigate misconduct by bank appointed valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers. The Financial Ombudsman Service, FOS, will not investigate cases of misconduct by valuers or accountants or receivers, even when the bank is aware that there has been misconduct. AFCA will be the same under the existing proposals. So, in some respects, it is a toothless tiger. As an example, I have a letter from FOS showing they will not investigate because, once the receiver is appointed, the receiver acts as an agent for the company and not the person who appointed it. In other words, the bank could appoint the most corrupt and incompetent receiver and be aware of misconduct and yet be totally unaccountable. The ombudsman cannot help unless the bank gives the regulator permission to investigate the crime. In the example submitted, Bankwest informed FOS that it is not prepared to waive the issues that may exist to enable a fresh dispute to be considered by FOS. So, if the bank wants to prevent an investigation, it can do so with a loophole in the legislation.


To add insult to injury, if the damage caused by the misconduct is greater than the limit of FOS, it can fall outside the jurisdiction. This limit could encourage greater misconduct. To avoid investigation, a bank or the agent has to ensure that they create a level of damage above the limit. With the banking royal commission now underway and further cases of misconduct being exposed, now is the time to strengthen legislation and regulate this troubled industry. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has confirmed in discussions that there is very little regulation on these banks and appointed entities. They admit that, in some cases, receivers just refuse to provide details of their work to the owners of companies they are appointed over. They often charge hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for their work, with no accountability for what they have done. We have seen cases where receivers have employed the same lawyers the banks employed and then they act for the companies they are the receiver over—a conflict of interest in itself—and then they refuse to disclose to the owners and companies what the lawyers have done.


I refer to a letter from the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to Senator Jane Hume, Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, dated 29 September 2017. It reads: 'Despite the welcome step of establishing AFCA, we believe there are important considerations which are still missing from the jurisdiction of the proposed authority, namely the role of third party agents such as valuers, investigating accountants and receivers.' The ombudsman's inquiry report into small-business loans dated 12 December 2016 made a series of recommendations, including recommendation 13 that:


External dispute resolution schemes must be expanded to include disputes with third parties that have been appointed by the bank, such as valuers, investigative accountants and receivers …


Current state


The jurisdiction of the FOS does not allow consideration of disputes:


(a) between a small business and a third party such as valuers, investigative accountants and receivers appointed by the bank


…   …   …


The only alternative for small business in these cases is the court system, yet:


small businesses do not have the expertise to challenge banks through the court system


there is a substantial asymmetry of power between banks and small businesses


small businesses do not have the financial capacity to hire expert legal advice to help them balance this asymmetry of power.


Recommended change


That the independent EDR—


external dispute resolution


one-stop-shop—


that is, AFCA—


have jurisdiction to consider disputes between small businesses and banks, where disputes relate to the conduct of third parties appointed by banks.


This clearly indicates that our amendments need to be supported. The Australian small business ombudsman said:


Many problems identified during the Inquiry relate to the conduct of third parties appointed by banks.


Currently, there is no realistic way to seek redress for these actions. ASIC does not take action on behalf of individuals and the court system is not a viable alternative.


The lack of accountability must be addressed.


The Australian small business ombudsman would support legislative changes to the AFCA to make banks responsible for the conduct of their appointed valuers, investigative accountants and receivers.


The LNP have argued that these changes are unconstitutional. However, the Senate Procedure Office have said they can't see any constitutional problems with this amendment and they believe it is compatible with corporations law. Also under section 51, heads of power, banks, financial institutions and service providers are covered federally. We have run this by the Parliamentary Library. They have advised that our amendment is a solution to the issues raised by the ombudsman and they cannot see any constitutional reason why it can't work. The government objects to this amendment on the basis that it is unconstitutional. We have repeatedly asked the government to identify any reasons that this amendment may be unconstitutional and they have failed or refused to clarify these reasons. The only explanation can be that this amendment in fact is constitutional.


This amendment needs to be supported if we want to help those affected by bank misconduct. Given the bank and receiver misconduct covered by numerous past government inquiries and the misconduct now being revealed by the banking royal commission, we request the Senate support the proposed constructive changes to bring this largely unregulated sector under control. This chamber should take the word of the Parliamentary Library, the ombudsman and the Senate Procedure Office ahead of a government who would rather protect their banking mates.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:44):  Everyone has been calling for a royal commission into the banking sector, and the coalition government have actually instigated that. Labor say they've been calling for a royal commission into the banking sector, as have the Greens and One Nation and, I believe, Senator Hinch and others, and we were very pleased to see it happen. Now we are talking about the valuers and liquidators involved in this. In the Senate inquiry that One Nation had last year, it came out that they played a very big role in the devastation that shut down a lot of people in the farming sector who lost their properties, yet nothing was done about it.


We are now proposing an amendment to include those people in this bill. We have confirmation that it can be done under this bill. If Labor are so much for all the battlers out there, why don't they want some accountability to ensure that these people are taken to task for their actions? Why aren't Labor prepared to stand up for this? This is an amendment that calls for accountability, so that they cannot just do what they want to do and destroy people's lives. The government, from the minister's office, is saying that this is unconstitutional. We have asked: which part of the Constitution? Absolute silence! Nothing has come back to us. They can make a comment like that, but they can't back it up with evidence.


They come under the Corporations Act—and that's fine—but there is no reason why either side cannot pass this amendment. Do you really want to stand up and ensure accountability in this country from the banking sector? They hire these liquidators and receivers. They don't pay for them, though; it's the people who are going under who have to pay the bills for this. They rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's why people lose their properties. But you sit here in deafening silence and you're not prepared to make them accountability to the public. You sit there and say that you're for the battlers and you call for a royal commission into the banking sector. Is this Labor? Is this what you really want?


Labor constantly accuses One Nation of being out there grandstanding and not being prepared to stand up for the battlers and the farmers. Yet, here we are, moving an amendment to legislation that is going to be so beneficial to people in this country. It will make them accountable, and Labor just sits there and does absolutely nothing about it. You know who's really fighting for the people of this country, the battlers. It's One Nation.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (17:56):  I just want to note that the opposition will not be proceeding with amendment (1) on sheet 8382, dealing with the question of indigeneity. The government has wisely made the decision to omit the definition of 'Indigenous person' in the bill, on the basis that the administrative definition, as it's known, is the one that's widely used. I don't think there's much more I need to say in relation to that. 


On the longer-term question of how Indigenous peoples want to be defined and how they want to be known—this is a matter that we should be consulting First Nations peoples about, rather than retaining the colonial process of attributing definitions to First Nations peoples that go way back to the old 'stud book', as it was called, or the various other ways in which derogatory language was used in relation to First Nations people. I'm not going to embark on a history lesson in relation to that tonight, but, as my colleague Senator Macdonald said earlier, there is a need for us as a parliament to come to terms with this and to engage with First Nations peoples on how they wish to be identified. Secondly, we have to remove the concept of race. It's a big exercise—I understand that—and a huge legacy, but, as a mature nation that seeks to uphold international standards, we ought to be moving further towards a recognition of the common nature of our humanity, rather than distinguishing people on the basis of race.

They come under the Corporations Act—and that's fine—but there is no reason why either side cannot pass this amendment. Do you really want to stand up and ensure accountability in this country from the banking sector? They hire these liquidators and receivers. They don't pay for them, though; it's the people who are going under who have to pay the bills for this. They rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's why people lose their properties. But you sit here in deafening silence and you're not prepared to make them accountability to the public. You sit there and say that you're for the battlers and you call for a royal commission into the banking sector. Is this Labor? Is this what you really want?


Labor constantly accuses One Nation of being out there grandstanding and not being prepared to stand up for the battlers and the farmers. Yet, here we are, moving an amendment to legislation that is going to be so beneficial to people in this country. It will make them accountable, and Labor just sits there and does absolutely nothing about it. You know who's really fighting for the people of this country, the battlers. It's One Nation.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (17:56):  I just want to note that the opposition will not be proceeding with amendment (1) on sheet 8382, dealing with the question of indigeneity. The government has wisely made the decision to omit the definition of 'Indigenous person' in the bill, on the basis that the administrative definition, as it's known, is the one that's widely used. I don't think there's much more I need to say in relation to that. 


On the longer-term question of how Indigenous peoples want to be defined and how they want to be known—this is a matter that we should be consulting First Nations peoples about, rather than retaining the colonial process of attributing definitions to First Nations peoples that go way back to the old 'stud book', as it was called, or the various other ways in which derogatory language was used in relation to First Nations people. I'm not going to embark on a history lesson in relation to that tonight, but, as my colleague Senator Macdonald said earlier, there is a need for us as a parliament to come to terms with this and to engage with First Nations peoples on how they wish to be identified. Secondly, we have to remove the concept of race. It's a big exercise—I understand that—and a huge legacy, but, as a mature nation that seeks to uphold international standards, we ought to be moving further towards a recognition of the common nature of our humanity, rather than distinguishing people on the basis of race.


Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017, as amended, agreed to; ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017 agreed to.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:29):  I rise tonight to talk about Labor's commitment to the federal electorate of Flynn. It's one of my duty electorates and a region for which I have a great passion. I was fortunate to be able to host a town hall meeting in Gladstone last week, on 20 March, with the federal Labor leader, Mr Shorten, and newly preselected candidate for Flynn, Zac Beers. The Gladstone Entertainment Convention Centre was packed with families, individuals, local workers and small-business owners. There were great questions on a broad range of topics and there was constructive political discussion. There was a lot of support for Zac's candidacy. He's a great candidate. I am a great champion of Zac. I was proud to support him in the lead up to the 2016 election, and I will be working hard to support him in the next election, whenever that is.


For the benefit of those listening to this broadcast, I want to talk a little bit about Zac. He's a Central Queenslander through and through. Growing up in Gladstone, Zac was the school captain at Tannum Sands State High School. After graduating school, Zac went on to work as a painter and a scaffolder at the local alumina refinery. Following a stint working for Chris Trevor, the now deputy mayor of Gladstone, Zac went on to work as an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union, following his passion for standing up for workers rights. Zac loves his footy; he is a life member of the Tannum Sands Seagulls, where he likes to have a run.


Zac will always stand up and fight for Central Queensland. He will fight for jobs for locals, better pay and more job security. He's helped to launch federal Labor's campaign to crack down on dodgy labour hire arrangements—an issue which is also particularly close to my heart. I note there was an article in the Gladstone Observer where Mr Shorten stood alongside Zac and identified that there are a number of labour hire companies undercutting workers wages and offering little job security. We know that labour hire strips workers of all their rights and protections. Workers who are employed through dodgy labour hire arrangements find themselves in a position where they can't speak up about anything at work because the minute they do they risk losing their job. These are the things that Zac is passionate about, and he will fight on these issues.


Zac also helped Mr Shorten and shadow health minister, Ms Catherine King, launch federal Labor's Fix Our Hospitals campaign in Gladstone on 21 March. It is concerning to me that we have a situation where there are cuts to our hospitals. In Gladstone, Mr Shorten said the federal government's funding of 45 per cent of state hospital budgets until 2020 amounted to $6.1 million less reaching Central Queensland hospitals than what would have been provided under the last agreement reached with the states.


For the benefit of any voters from the electorate of Flynn tuning in or reading this speech, I want to go through some of the choices you have at the next federal election. If Nationals member Mr O'Dowd is re-elected, we're going to get the same old coalition in-fighting, the same old talking the talk about infrastructure but still no action on the Port Access Road, $6.1 million less funding for Central Queensland hospitals and $17.1 billion less funding for Australian schools. Examples of local schools cut over the next two years include $1.35 million less for Gladstone State High School, $870,000 less for Toolooa State High School, $300,000 less for Gladstone Central State School, $220,000 less for Gladstone South State School and $570,000 less for Gladstone West State School. By contrast, if Zac Beers and Labor are elected, Flynn residents will have a united government and shared values between state and federal governments, leading to better outcomes for regional Queenslanders; $17.1 billion back into the education budget; an end to the fight on healthcare funding; $100 million for the stage 2 of the Gladstone Port Access Road, which will create around 200 jobs; and a plan for real jobs in regional Queensland, investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, mining, agriculture and energy. Zac Beers understands industry. He understands the need for jobs.


I will be up in Gladstone again next week with Zac. We will be hosting the shadow minister for communication, Ms Michelle Rowland, for a forum on the National Broadband Network. No doubt, local residents in Gladstone have concerns about the length of time the rollout has taken to come to Gladstone, but this means there's still time for the government to see sense and implement fibre-to-the-premises or at least fibre-to-the-curb across the region. Labor is committed to regional Queensland. We can prove it: we're on the ground listening and developing policies for regional Queenslanders. The contrast is clear.
