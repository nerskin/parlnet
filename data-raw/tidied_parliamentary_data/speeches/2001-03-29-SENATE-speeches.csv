"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-03-29,"—I just want to reiterate what I concluded with last night, and that was that in the Lyne electorate the shortage of nursing home beds is such a problem that elderly bedridden patients who require full-time care are being kept in the Manning Base Hospital in Taree. There are people in the Taree district who are awaiting surgery. They need the 30 beds these patients are taking up in the hospital but, due to the government's ongoing neglect of aged care, they are being forced to wait as bedridden patients who really should be in nursing homes take up the hospital beds that they need.
I would like to refer to a report that was released earlier this week by Labor's shadow spokesperson on aged care, Senator Chris Evans. Projections done by Senator Evans on figures from the department of aged care and the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that, in 2001, the government will fall 3,685 aged care beds short of its own estimate on the number of beds needed in New South Wales. Even though the government has recently allocated a series of new beds, there will still be a massive shortfall of 2,130 aged care beds by 2002.
In the area covered by the member for Lyne's electorate, the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, it has been projected in Senator Evans's report that aged care bed shortages will reach around 946 this year and 766 in 2002. On the Central Coast, where the silent member for Robertson's electorate is located, shortages will reach around 1,158 aged care beds this year and 921 in 2002. And in the Nepean region, in the member for Lindsay's electorate, shortages will be around 154 aged care beds this year and 101 in 2002. In 1997 the average wait for an aged care bed in New South Wales was 41 days; in 1999 this figure had blown out to 61 days. With these projected bed shortages, how long an elderly person in New South Wales is going to have to wait for a nursing home bed in the future is anyone's guess.
I also noticed in the report that, while these areas like the Mid North Coast, the Central Coast and the Nepean region are suffering bed shortages, the region of northern Sydney actually has an excess in aged care beds. That is right—over there on Sydney's rich and leafy North Shore, where they have big houses, harbour views and BMWs, they also have an excess of aged care beds.
—You might need them one day, Senator Heffernan. In June 2000 they had an excess of 1,190 beds; by June this year it is projected that they will have an excess of 1,114 aged care beds, and in 2002 they will have an excess of around 1,076 beds. So while elderly people in less advantaged areas like the Mid North Coast, the Central Coast and the Nepean region have to wait for aged care beds due to shortages, on Sydney's leafy North Shore they have more beds than they need.
After all the attacks this government has made on elderly Australians, I find it puzzling that it would still be throwing around millions of dollars to fix the GST and only a pittance towards helping out our senior citizens in our most disadvantaged areas. Once again, elderly Australians, especially elderly battlers, have been ignored by this government. Australia's elderly citizens have a right to be better served by their government and not be abandoned as they have been under this legislation.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-03-29,"—These bills comprise the additional estimates for the year 2000-01. Through these bills, according to the Minister for Finance and Administration, the parliament is being asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures from the consolidated revenue fund. This is an interesting comment in the light of what we have seen from this government in recent months.
There is now a growing list of major expenditures—and we will be discussing such expenditures when we debate the excise tariff bill later today—such as cutting the excise on fuel and even ending indexation that not long ago were considered by the Prime Minister to be economically irresponsible. As the results of the elections in Western Australia and Queensland and now the by-election in the seat of Ryan have dawned upon the government, what was once economically irresponsible is now essential and unavoidable. The cost of the Prime Minister's decision on fuel excise, for example, will be $2.6 billion over the next four years. The Prime Minister tried first to placate Australian motorists, who are, rightly, hostile about the price of fuel and the government's GST tax—a tax on a tax in this case, a rip-off. The government tried to placate the motorists with a new roads package worth $1.6 billion. That did not work. The Prime Minister was then forced to try to mend a broken promise, and it is clear that that has not worked either. This petrol tax backflip caused considerable embarrassment for the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who sat glum faced in the joint party room when Mr Howard announced the decision.
—How do you know?
—Senator Heffernan, you can come and correct the record.
—It wasn't me, cobber!
—Oh, it was not you; it was Senator Calvert.
—As you would have read in the paper, Senator Calvert, your party room leaks like a sieve. I understand that the Prime Minister had earlier given the Treasurer a dressing-down in a private meeting—I heard that through another leak. He told the Treasurer that it was about time that he started running the Treasury, rather than allowing the Treasury to run him.
The failure to get even 50 per cent of what the government had factored into the budget from the third generation spectrum sale was another significant blow to the economic credentials of both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. This $1 billion-plus overestimate of the value of this spectrum might have been yet another mistake by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, but it will be the Australian economy which will have to pay in the end.
The Prime Minister recently sought to paint the Labor Party as gloom and doom merchants when it comes to the state of the economy. He said on the eve of the Ryan by-election that Mr Beazley was behaving irresponsibly by entertaining the notion that there might be a recession. But what did Mr Howard say in 1995 when he was Leader of the Opposition? When he was madly talking down the economy and attacking the then Labor government about the health of the Australian economy, he said:
When somebody punctures that with a bit of market-based reality, they shout foul, they play the patriotic card and say `Oh dreadful fellow, he's talking down the economy'.
The then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, went on and said:
That is not talking down the economy, it is telling the truth.
Mr Howard's claim at that time was not correct. During the lead-up to the 1996 election, he rightly earned the nickname of Chicken Little, because the sky was always falling in according to him. Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell, while Mr Howard's claims about the economy were at best misplaced in 1995—because after the election, as you will recall, he said he inherited an economy that was basically sound—they fit perfectly with the current state of the Australian economy. Let me go through some economic facts. The value of the Australian dollar has dropped by 26 per cent since January 2000. It has been as low as in the 48c range. This slump in the dollar has not simply been in response to the strengthening US dollar, as the government would have us believe. On a trade weighted basis, the Australian dollar has fallen by around 19 per cent since January last year. Nor is a very low dollar a good thing for the economy. I note the comment by Stephen Koukoulas in the Australian Financial Review on 16 March when he said:
But the reality is that well-run, well-managed, dynamic economies tend to have strong currencies, while staid, fractured economies without policy direction have the opposite.
It is the actual state of the economy that is the problem, not the view that we on this side of the chamber have expressed.
The latest set of national accounts shows that the economy actually shrank by 0.6 per cent over the final three months of last year, a fall in activity way outside even the most pessimistic prediction from economic commentators and the financial markets. The evidence of the sad state of the Australian economy is also reflected in a number of industry surveys. It is worth noting the views of the members of the Australian Industry Group that represent some 800 manufacturers with a combined annual turnover of $50 billion and with around one million employees. That survey found that, while the tough times in the manufacturing sector appeared to have bottomed in the December quarter, the problems had widened across more sectors. In fact, 11 out of 12 sectors surveyed reported worsening conditions. The survey showed the downturn had also spread across the states, including very sharp downturns in the country's biggest manufacturing states, Victoria and Queensland. This is how the head of the Australian Industry Group, Helen Ridout, summed up the findings of this research:
... very tough conditions, very tough trading conditions, weak demand, weak investment intentions and a worrying weakening, but still positive, export performance.
So it also appears that a key driver of the Australian economy, the export sector, is weakening. This weakening in demand for our exports is flowing from a global economy facing its weakest year since the Asian crisis of 1998. Last month, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics forecast that commodity exports will grow by just 3.5 per cent in the year 2001-02. I remind the Senate that this is well down from a prediction of a 20 per cent surge in growth for the current financial year. The employment front is also looking increasingly difficult. Ms Ridout also pointed to weakening demand for labour, and I again quote her: 
Unemployment is going up in the industry and will go up in the economy.
The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey released on 14 March showed that consumer confidence had fallen 15.4 per cent in March—the lowest level since the recession in the early 1990s. In fact, it was the biggest drop in the 25-year history of the survey. Recent economic data shows that unemployment has risen by 3,000 jobs a week since September last year. 
The potential for jobs growth in the coming months appears limited—and this is further damning proof of the government's economic mismanagement—because the number of job advertisements in metropolitan newspapers in February measured through the ANZ job advertisement survey fell by 10 per cent. That figure was down a massive 27 per cent on February 2000, the biggest annual fall since the recession of 1991. The ANZ job advertisement survey rightly has a reputation as being a relatively accurate forward indicator of employment outcomes. ANZ economist Mr Saul Eslake predicted that employment would fall by around 5,000 jobs a month for the next few months. That will push unemployment to well over seven per cent. 
Turning to another area of the economy, the level of national debt is also reaching alarming proportions. Australian foreign debt is now over $300 billion—that is right, over $300 billion. That is a record 46 per cent of gross domestic product, and many in this chamber will be asking government senators, `Where is the debt truck?' It apparently collapsed under the weight, because foreign debt has jumped $6.2 billion in the December quarter and the debt's equivalent is something approaching $16,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. If that were not bad enough, private capital expenditure—a key influence on the growth of the economy—dropped 5.2 per cent over the three months ending December 2000. These are not the gloomy views of the Labor Party; this is the actual state of the Australian economy.
If we go beyond the statistics and look at business conditions according to business operators, the situation does not get any better. In a recent interview on the 7.30 Report a trucking contractor, Peter Mikelat, said:
It feels like we are really and truly in a recession. Industry is just so slow there is not much turnover. Customers are becoming slower payers. 
And the reason, according to Mr Mikelat, was the GST. Let me quote him again:
... the fundamental problem is because of the GST. I think it is the flow-on effect it has had on industry. 
That is what a small business operator has to say. What about the big end of town? On the same program, Ray Horsburgh from Smorgon Steel said:
Our people believe it is as bad as we have had ... We did budgets last May. We just miscalculated. We budgeted for an 8 percent drop in the market and we have had 20 percent. Effectively two and a half times the target.
What was the reason? The impact of the GST on smaller customers. Mr Horsburg said that the GST had created confusion and he told the 7.30 Report—and he was referring to business:
They don't know how to handle the GST.
From all of that, senators would recall the view of the Treasurer on suggestions from this side of the chamber that the business activity statement was creating chaos in the small business sector. I am sure that everyone recalls how Mr Costello said there was nothing wrong with the system and, anyway, nothing could be done to change the system in the short-term, even if there were a problem. I am sure that everyone recalls the perfect backflip he then performed under the watchful eye of that great exponent of the art of diving, Mr Howard. Senators would recall some recent great performances by Mr Howard, including the backflip on plans to control the use of trusts for tax avoidance. Mr Costello announced the decision but, in that case, it would be misplaced if credit for the decision were given to the Treasurer, because the backflip on trusts was very much the work of the Prime Minister.
It should not be forgotten that the current Prime Minister, who was the Treasurer in the Fraser government, has form when it comes to the question of tax avoidance—and I do not mean personally. For five years as Treasurer, Mr Howard failed to deal with an explosion of tax avoidance schemes in this country. He acknowledged in 1980 that he had been aware of the bottom of the harbour schemes for two years but had failed to apply the full force of the law to fix that problem. The McCabe-Lanfranchi report, which was tabled in the Victorian parliament in May 1982, revealed a massive fraud of Commonwealth revenue, in the order of about $200 million—in terms of that day's prices, and not today's, of course. The Costigan royal commission was then established to investigate the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. At the time, Mr Howard acknowledged that the Australian Taxation Office had raised with him in 1978 the need for criminal penalties to deal with these practices. He said in a statement:
I had an examination carried out by officers of the Taxation Department, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and Attorney-General's Department. Their advice to me was that the schemes could not effectively be countered by the application of existing laws which they found to be deficient for the purpose for one reason or another.
But what did he do? He did nothing. Now we see another opportunity to tighten up tax laws in this country so that more people are forced to meet their tax obligation being abandoned by Mr Howard and this government. I am not sure that everyone would recall the commitment given by Mr Howard and Mr Costello in 1996, which was to cut red tape for small business by 50 per cent. Rather than cutting red tape by 50 per cent, the Howard government, through the introduction of the GST, has made over two million businesses become tax collectors, with all the compliance implications that that entails. It has therefore increased that red tape by at least 50 per cent. So no cut; a rise. If you do not believe me on that, just listen to what the Minister for Small Business, Mr Macfarlane, had to say. He was actually forced to apologise to the small business sector. Let me quote him. He said:
We had increased paper work and red tape to a point where we felt that we weren't able to maintain our election promise.
They are his words, not mine. Let me say this: the simplification of the BAS has made things worse. Under the new arrangements, businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million that do not put in a quarterly BAS will have their tax bill calculated on past returns plus whatever the GDP is increasing by at the time. Any shortfall that flows from this mechanism will then have to be made up at the end of the taxation year. If these calculations are out by more than 15 per cent, I understand that extra interest will be added the bill.
There was a further small business survey released last weekend. It was undertaken by Australian Business Ltd, who surveyed 775 companies: 65 respondents reported that the GST was having a negative effect on their cash flow. The problem was more evident in businesses employing 100 people or less—small business, in other words—and the data from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission shows a 139 per cent increase in the appointment of receiver-managers in the past 12 months. But the government can quote one business sector that claims to be making hay under the GST cloud, because the executive director of the Insolvency Practitioners Association, Mr Hugh Parsons, says that the workload of his members was up 30 per cent. He said:
... we are looking at a very, very busy next 18 months.
Some praise, but I expect the government will not be quoting that. This is the economic reality imposed on Australia by this government. Rather than let them have the last word, the last word should go to the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Stephen Grenville, who said:
What was not foreseen was, first, the size of this fall—the fall in housing construction—and, second, the degree of confidence sapping annoyance with the administration of the GST.
So that is it. If Mr Clinton were an Australian politician in the government and he were being realistic, he would be saying to his colleagues, `It's the GST, stupid.'",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-03-29,"—I wish to discuss the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and I begin—appropriately so, given that the minister is in the chamber—by referring to the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio. Before Senator Alston gets concerned, I am actually acknowledging, drawing to the Senate's attention, and congratulating the government on—he looks surprised—the appropriation of money to support the National Museum of Australia. The aim of that, as contained in the appropriation bill, is that Australians have access to the National Museum's collections and public programs to `encourage awareness and understanding of Australia's history and culture'. The new National Museum is a wonderful celebration of Australia's diversity, our humour, loss, quirkiness, pain, triumph and ingenuity. One striking feature of the collection is the extraordinary scope of the imaginative ways and means by which Australians have identified and tackled problems. Whether it be rabbit fences, buffalo catchers, improvised medical techniques or the diversity of contributions by women in science, you cannot but be struck by a rich heritage of innovation, from the making-do to the cutting edge. Sadly, experiencing the museum simply serves to highlight the deep frustration that is felt by so many Australians that, in many other areas, this government is not fully committed to nurturing and enhancing an innovation culture.
The government's innovation statement, Backing Australia's Ability, represents a long overdue but fragmentary recognition that innovation is fundamental to our future social, cultural and economic prosperity. I do not think anyone denies that this is an important plank of our economic platform in this country and that everyone realises that underpinning this is a commitment to education, training, research and development and a backing of science. While I think most people have used the rhetoric and have acknowledged that, it has been a belated recognition by government in the form of additional resources to actually back up that particular rhetoric. However, we welcome that belated backflip, or whatever you want to call it. But in doing so we must never forget that the innovation statement comes five years after this government has gutted universities and CSIRO funding and has precipitated declining private investment in innovation by reducing the R&D tax concessions, specifically. So it is not just a lack of commitment that is the problem but the dangerously narrow understanding of innovation that underpins the government's agenda.
The Innovation Summit report gives us some hints as to what is required, with its emphasis on culture, creativity, ideas and the value of human capital. Successful innovation requires taking risks, so we must expect and accept failures. However, this means we must spread our nets widely and accept that policy will only be effective if it explicitly recognises innovation and R&D and feeds on a diversity of inputs. Strategic focus is sensible but only if it is built upon and connected to a broad base of different modes of education and research and development. So it is of particular and deep concern to the Democrats that the government does not appear to have understood this necessity for breadth and diversity, as the proposed changes to the R&D concession demonstrate. The government intends to severely curtail the scope of the concession by, firstly, requiring all claims meet both the innovation and high technical risk criteria, whereas currently claims only need to satisfy one of these criteria; secondly, extending the R&D exclusion list; and, thirdly, narrowing the definition of research and development activities. The Democrats are most concerned that it is possible that up to 90 per cent of currently eligible projects will not meet the new criteria. It is not just that most companies will be losers but that the losers will be concentrated in so many of our mature industries, including agriculture and mining and manufacturing. Innovation in these areas may not be as glamorous as in the biotechnology fields but innovations that lead to greater energy and resource efficiency, for example, are vital to our prosperity, economically as well as environmentally. Do not get me wrong; I am the first to talk about the potential dazzling benefits from biotechnology, but I do not think we can afford to ignore our traditional and mature industries.
The net effect of the changes that have been proposed by the government under Backing Australia's Ability is certain to be a further reduction of private investment in innovation and research and development, which has to be the worst possible outcome. Nurturing and developing an innovation society requires a healthy, robust education and research capability. This is crucial and is well understood in other countries—Ireland, the USA, Canada, Israel and Singapore, for instance. The governments of these countries have massively invested in their education and research capability over the past few years. That contrasts greatly with what has happened in our country over the past 15 years, but particularly since 1996 when this government came to power. Is there anyone who does not believe that our universities are under extreme financial duress? I expect that Dr David Kemp might make a valiant attempt to argue that they are not experiencing difficulties, but even leaked cabinet documents indicate that Dr Kemp believes there are some difficulties in a number of institutions. The Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee certainly believe that an extreme period of duress is being experienced by our universities, and they urge an immediate increase in funds for teaching and learning to complement the government's partial backflip on funding for R&D.
The stripping of public resources from universities by this government is unprecedented in the history of Commonwealth involvement in university funding, leading to a crisis in the accessibility and quality of higher education. I do not ignore the deleterious effects of policy under the former government in relation to increased fees and charges and a diminution in operating grants. Certainly the 1983 peak operating grants or per EFTSU funding was a high point but it was not achieved consistently throughout the rest of the Labor Party's period in office, so I do not want to let them get away scot-free either. But certainly the changes under this government are unprecedented in the history of our nation.
As a consequence of the implementation of differential HECS introduced by this government and the significant lowering of the repayment threshold, undergraduate applications in 2000 were 8,408 below 1996 levels. Preliminary figures provided by the Senate estimates committee in December 2000 suggest that applications in 2001 were 10,518 or 5.3 per cent further below the 2000 figures. Does the government seriously believe therefore that falling demand bodes well for Australia? I know that people—especially in this government—are quite quick to talk about increased numbers of students accessing university. But we are not fooled by those figures in the sense that those increasing numbers of students are not being matched with EFTSU funding; they are not being matched with a commitment to appropriate resources and money in the form of operating grants.
OECD data indicates that between 1990 and 1997 participation in tertiary education—at 31 per cent—rose slower in Australia than the average in OECD nations, which was at 49 per cent. I emphasise that the Australian figure is significantly inflated because it includes international students. So, if you remove international students, the figure is 25 per cent, and most of that is in the first half of the last decade. The decline in domestic enrolments last year will only exacerbate this picture.
Potential students are less interested in undertaking higher education, because this government keeps stacking up the barriers. It keeps putting obstacles in the path of students, especially those who are traditionally unrepresented or underrepresented in higher education—and, as an obvious example, I use those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In fact, only 30 per cent of current students can now access the common youth allowance, and we know one thing for sure: income support does have an impact on people's ability to participate in and enter into education at all levels, but specifically higher education. Yet those income support measures have been whittled away.
I place on the agenda yet again the fact that the Democrats will continue to argue for, and move amendments to try and achieve, an age of independence for the accessing of the common youth allowance and income support for students that reflects the reality: the fact that people are independent—certainly they are under most other government legislation—at the latest, at the age of 18. Yet in Australia we have a situation where students are deemed to be independent from the age of 25, which I think most of the community recognises is farcical.
One measure of the success or otherwise of government policy in higher education is its accessibility for disadvantaged groups. So, clearly, the government's record on this is lamentable. The proportion of students from rural and regional Australia has declined since the early 1990s. In 1998, 18.6 per cent of domestic students were from rural, regional and isolated backgrounds. But the reference figure, taken from the 1996 census, was 29.8 per cent, so there is continuing underrepresentation of those students in the higher education sector. Between 1999 and 2000 alone, the number of indigenous students fell from 8,001 to 7,350. The government must accept significant blame for this with their changes to Abstudy—mean-spirited changes implemented by this government and enforced at the time by Senator Amanda Vanstone, then the higher education minister.
A Deakin University analysis of the changes to Abstudy and their effects on the 1998 cohort showed that only 5.7 per cent of students would benefit and an appalling 94.3 per cent would be significantly disadvantaged. Judging quality, of course, is always difficult, but one clear indicator that tells a sorry tale is the change in the student to teaching staff ratio. AVCC data shows a damning trend. In 1990, the staff-student ratio was 1 to 3.17. This rose under the previous government from 1 to 15.68 in 1996, but it has leapt to 1 to 18.3 under the 1999 figures, under this particular government. The higher education report, which has been referred to in this place on a number of occasions—that is, the 2001-03 triennium report—makes it clear that, without a significant change in policy, things will only get worse. In fact, student numbers are estimated to rise 27 per cent between 1995 and 2003 but in the same period revenues will increase by only 21.5 per cent. That is, of course, a further decline in funding per student.
So this government's significant disinvestment in our universities is substantially responsible for the crisis in our universities. The series of cutbacks between 1997 and 1999 notionally total six per cent, but in real terms it is much higher. In the absence of salary supplementation, the First Assistant Secretary of the Higher Education Division of DETYA, Michael Gallagher, estimates the gap between operating grant indexation and the actual salary outcomes has risen to around 15 per cent over the past five years. If the effects of a declining Australian dollar are factored in to the costs of universities—for example, costs for essential journals, books and laboratory equipment—the unfunded shift in the cost of universities is considerably higher.
Lord Deering, who headed the UK equivalent of the West review and was a member of the University of Melbourne Council, has estimated that under this government real cuts to universities are much closer to 30 per cent. Just one consequence of this is Australian academic salaries becoming increasingly uncompetitive. We have been hearing about this in our Senate inquiry into higher education. In 1980-81 an Australian professorial salary was just over 97 per cent of the American counterpart; in 1999-2000 it was 65 per cent. A very similar story applies at lower levels of academic appointment. Is it any wonder that Australian academics are heading overseas in the `brain drain', as it is referred to. Universities are complaining that it is increasingly difficult to hold their good academics and even harder to replace them, as our best and brightest are fleeing overseas. In this election year, it is essential that both the old parties, the coalition and the Labor Party, demonstrate a real commitment to Australia's future by embracing policy settings that reverse the funding crisis and once again make quality and accessibility hallmarks of the Australian higher education system. That means appropriation bills of a very different hue from those that we are examining today.
I would like to refer to another element of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000: the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio. I note the additional appropriation of roughly $20 million to ANSTO—in particular, outcomes 1 and 2, which go to the new reactor for Lucas Heights and the removal of spent fuel rods from the ANSTO site, which are described as `in line with stringent safety arrangements and community views'. If there is one defining characteristic of this government in relation to the new Lucas Heights reactor and community concerns it is wilful complacency. Senators would be well aware of the recent French court action banning the unloading of Australian nuclear waste at Cherbourg. This action has exposed serious technical and legal flaws in the secret agreement between ANSTO and Cogema, the French firm specialising in the reprocessing of nuclear waste. This decision means there is no reliable reprocessing capability for the current or any replacement reactor. Thus it makes a nonsense of the government's assertions that a proper nuclear waste strategy exists for nuclear waste created in Australia.
The picture became distinctly murkier after Minister Minchin's response to my question without notice the day before yesterday. While Minister Minchin's French strategy is exposed as deeply flawed, ultimately relying on a wing and a prayer that the French government will change the law if the court finding is upheld—and I understand that the court finding is under appeal and that we will probably have a decision on 3 April—Minister Downer was forced to acknowledge publicly that he had just initialled a nuclear cooperation and safeguards agreement with Argentina. I remind the chamber that as recently as 22 February the First Assistant Secretary of the DFAT International Security Division, Bill Paterson, told a Senate committee that negotiations on a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement with Argentina would begin some time this year and were expected to take six months. At that time he indicated that discussions were not under way. It was not as if we were two or three months into discussions—or not that we know of, anyway, because this process has not exactly been characterised by transparency or openness or accountability. But barely a month after Mr Paterson made that comment on 22 February to a Senate committee, we find Minister Downer has initialled the agreement.
It is not just the residents of the Sutherland Shire who demand to know. Their mayor, Councillor Tracie Sonda, apparently read about this in the news headlines and is very keen to know about what impact this will have on the residents of her region. She is not the only one demanding to know things such as the following. Why was this treaty rushed? Why was it so hasty? Why is it `the two-minute treaty'? Why didn't it take six months of negotiation? Or, if it did, tell us that there have been negotiations taking place behind the scenes. What aspects have been catered for in this treaty in relation to proper waste management? The Senate has a responsibility to investigate a range of other areas so that not only members of this place but also the residents of the region about to get a new nuclear reactor have some guarantee that this has taken place in an accountable and open manner. Note that it is in addition to the reactor they have currently got; it is not going to be a replacement reactor. We still do not know the details as to what is going to happen there. The community deserves some explanation from the government. Secrecy and complacency will be a sorry legacy to take to voters later this year.
I noticed one other aspect of this appropriations bill, in relation to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio, referring to money for the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency—in fact there are no output expenses or totals listed there. That item reminded me of the figures released this week, on 27 March, demonstrating that women continue to fall further behind men in the pay stakes. The fact that women continue to trail men in that area, the fact that women continue to receive lower wages for equal work, is something that all Australians should be fundamentally concerned with—business and industry right through to legislators and of course those women who are doing equivalent work and not receiving equivalent pay.
The average weekly pay packet for a woman in full-time work in May 2000 was $717.70, up from $666.80 two years earlier, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But this is still way behind the $883.80 per week men in full-time work received on average, which was up from $825.20 two years earlier. That means the gap between male and female full-time workers had stretched to $166.10 per week by May 2000, from $158.40 in May 1998. There is work to be done there so that equal pay for equal work is not a mantra that has no meaning in Australia—not the empty rhetoric that it currently is. I hope that all Australians will commit to this particular cause. Governments should be monitoring the rights and entitlements and opportunities for women not just in the workplace but more broadly in Australia today.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2001-03-29,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001. In looking at where these appropriations are being allocated, it is interesting to see what the government should list as being its desired outcome in delivering aged care services in the Health and Aged Care portfolio. Outcome 3, for which additional appropriations are sought, pertains to: 
Support for healthy ageing for older Australians and quality and cost-effective care for frail older people and support for their carers.
This is indeed interesting because it is demonstrably clear that the government has not delivered on this important outcome in the Health and Aged Care portfolio. The government has certainly made much of its past and future commitment towards the provision of aged care services in Australia. Unfortunately, while this government has devoted a great deal of time to talking about the importance of providing adequate protection for the almost 135,000 Australians who live in nursing homes, the Howard government has little to show for how it has actually improved or even maintained conditions in nursing homes and aged care facilities generally.
However, unlike the coalition government, the release of Labor's policy on quality aged care is evidence that we are doing much more than just talking about our commitment in this area. We are actually laying out on the table a set of clear directions on how a Labor government will deliver quality aged care outcomes for older Australians. It also establishes the means by which we will correct the utterly disgraceful situation in aged care at present—which will ultimately be the legacy of Mrs Bishop and, indeed, of the Howard government. Since the coalition came to office just over five years ago, older Australians have suffered badly at the hands of this government. Their treatment, living standards and basic quality of life have gradually deteriorated under the direction of the Howard government when effort should have been taken to ensure that things only got better. 
As we have seen over the past few years, waiting times for nursing home beds have increased. It is a sad state of affairs when the average waiting time for a nursing home bed has increased from an average of 29 days to 55 days, an increase of almost 90 per cent. In 1997-98 older Australians spent an astounding 1.14 million days in public hospital beds waiting for a nursing home bed because there was not one available. Even more astounding for this government is that, as noted in the Productivity Commission's report, many of those people who were waiting for a nursing home bed live in rural and regional areas where nursing home beds are obviously scarce. In any case, the real commitment of this government in delivering on quality outcomes in the Health and Aged Care portfolio is defined by the pathetic statistics that ultimately speak volumes about this government's record. It is little wonder that the elderly have lost faith in the Howard government's ability to oversee and maintain the highest standards of care. 
In saying that, of course, I do not wish to be accused of scaremongering. I acknowledge that the majority of aged care facilities in this country provide a quality service. However, as this government maintains its backward approach in aged care and persists with its funding cutbacks, the ability of aged care facilities to maintain this level of service becomes harder and harder to realise. In discussing these matters, let me clearly illustrate to the Senate what happens when you mix utter neglect in monitoring and maintenance of standards with severe funding cutbacks. The result is the likes of scandals such as the one we saw at Riverside.
In 1998 the Riverside Nursing Home owed the Commonwealth a substantial debt. The Howard government's answer to debt recovery here was to reduce care subsidies by up to $25,000 per month. Now it would not take a rocket scientist to predict that the only people to suffer under these conditions would be the residents, and unfortunately that is what happened. As subsidies fell the quality of care fell dramatically. But it gets worse. Despite being inspected in early 1999, the problems that were reported then still remained when the Riverside Nursing Home was inspected yet again later that year. Riverside had failed on all accounts—on clinical care, on pain management and infection control.
But did it stop there? No, it did not. In January last year Riverside residents were given kerosene baths because the provider refused to buy the appropriate medication for an outbreak of scabies. Did the government then act—no, they did not. Although nursing staff did lodge a complaint with the government's Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme the next day, the complaint was deemed to have lacked substance and the facility went unchecked again. As if that was not horrific enough, as we all now know the standard of care further deteriorated in the weeks that followed. Maggots were found in an infected wound of a resident and complaints continued to flow in. Thirty-one days passed before Riverside was checked by officials. Did the government act immediately? No, they did not. An immediate investigation was judged to be unnecessary and, in fact, the provider was warned a fortnight in advance that an inspection would be carried out. 
Following an inspection in February last year, the same failed standards reported at Riverside in 1999 were still found to be in existence following the investigation—a whole year later. To compound matters even further, the provider was then given 14 days to appoint an administrator of his choice and, although Minister Bishop promised that residents would be protected, a second inspection two weeks later found that residents remained at risk. The situation at Riverside is a terrible example of this government's utterly disgraceful record on aged care and their total disregard for the lives of aged care residents and their families.
There are indeed many more cases of mistreatment and maladministration. I remind the Senate of the situation at the Alchera Park Nursing Home near Gladstone in Queensland. Many will recall the tragedy at Alchera, where three residents had to be admitted to hospital in an appalling condition with gangrenous sores, a large number of mouth ulcers and severe dehydration. Sadly, these three residents later died, but not before several complaints were received—and an inspection had been made months before. What should enrage the community even further is that the Howard government have not learned. They are still heading for another policy and administrative train wreck in aged care. As noted in a report released this week by my colleague Senator Evans, the shadow minister for aged care, the aged care bed crisis in this country is set to continue past 2002.
In my home state of Queensland alone, the situation is indeed dire. In Caboolture, for example, there is a projected shortage of 460 beds. On the Sunshine Coast, there is a projected shortage of 406 beds. In the Wide Bay region, there is a projected shortage of 171 beds. Finally, on the Gold Coast, the projected shortage for next year is 515 beds. Overall, taking into account excesses and shortages across the state, there is a projected shortage in Queensland of a massive 711 beds by 2002. And who are the people from Queensland who come into this chamber and are only too happy to sign off on such a damning state of affairs? Who else but the good Queensland Liberal and National Party senators, who are here to represent the interests of their state but who have clearly failed to deliver.
Let us not forget Senator Ian Macdonald—ironically the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government—who still saw fit to deprive regional areas of the aged care services which they desperately needed and who comes into this chamber and attacks Labor Party senators for not being interested in rural and regional Australia and rural and regional Queensland. It is an absolute disgrace. I should also make mention of Senator Macdonald's Liberal and National Party colleagues in the House of Representatives, who have sat back whilst the situation has worsened. These are elected members of parliament who purport to represent Queenslanders and Queensland, yet they have clearly demonstrated their complete disregard and contempt for the plight of Queenslanders by allowing this disgraceful situation in aged care to develop. That is why the voters of Queensland and indeed the rest of Australia are deserting the uncaring coalition and voting Labor. Many of them have done so only recently for the first time in their lives. We saw this in the Queensland and Western Australian state elections, and we certainly saw it in the by-election in the ultra blue-ribbon seat of Ryan in Brisbane's leafy inner west.
Alternatively, there is now a strong and growing recognition of Labor's plans and its real commitment to quality aged care in this country. Whilst the government's approach seems intent on destroying the quality of life for those in aged care facilities, Labor's approach is aimed at actually putting the `care' back into aged care. Labor's five-point plan—which my colleague Senator Evans, together with the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, launched last month—puts words into action. Labor's five-point plan on quality aged care will ensure that all older Australians will have access to high quality aged care and will safeguard against a repeat of the numerous scandals in this sector at the hands of this government, as I mentioned previously.
The people of this country owe a great debt of gratitude to the elderly. These are the people who have fought in wars, raised families and paid their taxes for much longer than any of us. They have built this country, and in return they deserve, and should expect to receive, the highest standard of care if and when they need it. This plan provides clear and real solutions to many of the community's concerns about the system currently in place under this government—a system that has clearly failed to implement and maintain appropriate standards of care in nursing homes around Australia.
The first initiative under Labor's plan is designed to provide for a guarantee of high quality care through a national benchmark of care. Under this initiative, Labor will set the level and quality of care to be delivered for all Australians in any nursing home in the country. As I have mentioned previously, frail older Australians deserve the best of care, and a national benchmark of care under a Labor government will ensure that they receive it.
The second point in Labor's plan addresses the importance of minimum staffing guidelines in aged care facilities. Labor will seek to ensure that there are enough qualified nurses and carers in place to deliver on the set benchmark of care. While the Howard government has not seen fit to set minimum staffing levels, Labor's plan means that nurses and carers will have the time to offer the care which they are trained to provide and which our elderly rightly deserve.
The third point of Labor's plan involves more surprise inspections. Under this strategy, every single nursing home and hostel will be inspected at least once annually. This means there will be no warnings, and those homes with a record of substandard care will be targeted in particular. Such inspections could come at any time of the day or night, because—let us face it—aged care is a 24-hour business; it is not just between the hours of nine to five.
The appointment of an aged care ombudsman is the fourth plank of Labor's plan for quality aged care. The aged care ombudsman will be put in place to ensure that complaints received regarding abuse or mistreatment are not swept under the carpet but will be investigated without delay. The ombudsman will also be an important foundation for the maintenance and protection of the rights and freedoms of this frail section of our community.
Finally, the fifth initiative in Labor's plan will be to implement tougher penalties for substandard nursing homes. The system of aged care under a Labor government has no room for aged care facilities that are not willing to provide the highest quality of care. Harsher penalties will ensure that substandard nursing homes will quickly abide by the appropriate standards. As we have seen in Riverside and Alchera Park, the Howard government's attitude to the provision of aged care has meant that those we should be protecting have been left to suffer in substandard care. Labor's plan for quality aged care will ensure that all homes are up to scratch and that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will have access to the best.
In conclusion, we cannot afford to lose sight of the duty and obligation that the government has in protecting and providing for adequate care of frail older Australians. In addition, we must recognise the difficulty for the families of those who require care and who are often the ones responsible for deciding whether or not to place their loved ones into a nursing home. The decision to place a loved one in an aged care facility can be extremely distressing and difficult. Given this, the government has a significant obligation in giving confidence to those families that, by placing a relative into a nursing home, they are making the right decision. They need to know and be reassured that the health and wellbeing of their loved ones will be best maintained in an aged care facility. It is despicable that the government has been unable to provide older Australians and their families with such confidence.
Certainly, there are good facilities employing many hardworking and professional nurses and carers that make them so. But the Howard government's record on aged care has been wanting from the start of its term in office. When the time comes, the people should and will remember the coalition's record when they cast their vote at the next federal election. Only a Labor government can truly deliver quality outcomes in aged care, and our five-point plan on quality aged care lays the foundation for the positive outcomes that can be expected in aged care under a Beazley Labor government.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2001-03-29,"—In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001 today, I want to pick up on some critically important issues that have been a part of my concerns for a long time but in particular since reading articles this year in the Australian and the Age, which have very succinctly addressed the question of workplace death—and the cost of that death—and injury. 
In the Age on Thursday, 22 March, a mother writes about what happened when her 18-year-old son was killed on his first day at work. I do not believe I can say it any better than she does, so I will quote from this article:
Anthony was on his first day at work at Drybulk Pty Ltd in Coode Road, Footscray. Drybulk operates a bulk store for livestock feed, and the grain is dumped in big sheds and then loaded into trucks by front-end loaders. Around the perimeter of the building stood five-tonne concrete panels, designed to stop damage to the shed walls. The panels were free-standing—despite at least one panel having fallen about a year earlier and concerns about the panels vibrating as trucks went past on the road outside.
It was one of these panels that crushed my son to death ...
The company and the manager were charged with breaches of the occupational health and safety act, which has maximum penalties of some $250,000. This woman writes:
All my hopes for any form of justice for Anthony were crushed on Friday, March 9, when Judge John Barnett of the County Court gave his finding: fines of $50,000 for Drybulk, $10,000 for the managing director and $5,000 for the supervisor.
The heading of this article is `My son's bosses paid just $65,000 for his life'. 
There are a number of terribly important issues in this whole question. First of all is the number of people who die at work each year—to say nothing of the number of people who are injured and then suffer permanent, long-term or even short-term loss. I will come back to the cost of those later. The second thing that is raised so importantly and passionately by this article is the impact of a death at work—the loss of life for that person and the family, in this case: `My 18-year-old son had been killed on his first day on the job.' He went to work looking forward to all sorts of things ahead of him. 
A young man of 18, on his first day at work, was crushed to death—something that should never have happened—by a slab of concrete about which there had already been safety concerns raised. One had fallen before yet still nothing much was done. At the least that should have been a warning. That should have probably been evidence of negligence or whatever. But in the end, for whatever reasons, these people were fined. The price of a son at 18 on his first day of work, with his whole adult life ahead of him, was $65,000. 
It is no comfort to the woman who writes this article, Ms Jan Carrick, that I know of other stories, and she does too. A young man lost his life when he was asked to go out the back and help empty the acid from batteries with no instructions about any hazards, no warnings about safe practices or anything. That is also the case in this particular situation I am reading about here. There were no instructions and no warnings. The life of the young man who was working with batteries was valued at $1,000. This is an appalling state of affairs, when people can actually understand one measure of the value of a life in the workplace. In this article, it is $65,000 from three people. In others I know of, some were $1,000 and some were as low as $500.
There have been efforts over the years to try to address this question of safe practices in the workplace. Indeed, I have here from the library the Bills Digest research on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I do not want to speak to that because I do not think it is on the Notice Paper yet, although I think it will be very soon. In the preamble there is a list of a number of articles addressing this topic produced by people like the Productivity Commission, the Heads of Workers' Compensation Authorities and the Workplace Relations Ministers' Council. We have reports from 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 1999-2000. When I first arrived in this place—and that is a while back—
—It was a good day.
—Thank you very much, Senator. I will take that as a praiseworthy interjection.
—There's a better day coming.
—You are unkind at this hour of the morning. I am talking about something like the cost of death in the workplace, Senator. I do not mind a little flippancy, but let us get back to being serious about this. When I arrived here, the minister with responsibility for this issue was one Ian McPhee, whom your side paid out powerfully during his life in this parliament; you never paid him any justice. He was one of those `wet' Liberals you took no notice of. He would tell us that, in those days, the figures were something like 300 deaths at workplaces during the year, at a cost of some $4 billion. In no time at all Ralph Willis took over the portfolio and looked at this same important area, and the figures more or less doubled—to about $9 billion to $11 billion, as a crude assessment. 
There was some doubt about how many people had died in the workplace—New South Wales said they had 300 deaths each year and Victoria said they had 300 deaths each year. Most of us would say that you add up when you get to the Murray and that that would be 600 people who had died in the workplace each year. Still nobody knows, accurately, what those figures are. The latest figures I could find state that there are something like 597 deaths, and that includes people dying while commuting to or from work. Between 1989 and 1992, 2,389 people died in Australia while working or while commuting to or from work. That is an average of 597 deaths per year, or 11 people per week. There were 1,781 people who were killed while working; 541 people who were killed in motor vehicle accidents relating to their work—that is, as truck drivers, taxi drivers, loader drivers or whatever; and 628 people who were killed commuting to or from work.
These figures mean that something like 600 people per year in Australia are killed at work or while commuting to or from work. The latest figures are no longer the $4 billion or $5 billion that Ian McPhee used; the figures from the Productivity Commission report in 1995 are—and this is about how accurate we are with the numbers of people who have died—somewhere between $21 billion and $29 billion. I am not making this up; the figures of between $21 billion and $29 billion are the Productivity Commission's figures—about $25 billion. We know that those costs include the cost of insurance premiums and payouts, the opportunity costs of the loss of workers and the finding and retraining of new workers.
If I were involved—and people seriously are—in having a look at these costs, I would see that the figures are there and that the evidence is there, so why is it that we still have more or less the same number of people dying in the workplace as 20 years ago, or thereabouts? I can say to the Senate that the number of people dying may be the same but that what they are dying from is different. There has been a long-term decline in the number of people dying from injury at work. That has had to do with a long campaign to make workplaces safer and also the changing nature of work. What is happening, though, is that more people are now dying from the poisons from associated things—from disease, I suppose, may be a better way of saying it—although that is a matter for debate in the forthcoming legislation. There has been a shift in the causes of death of people in the workplace. The figures from the Productivity Commission are pretty grim: the cost to industry is something like $25 billion—let us go for the middle of the range. An article in the Weekend Australian of Saturday 17 March 2001, written by David Uren, entitled `Cost of workplace accidents soon adds up' states:
Prevention is a better option than huge payouts.
For every $1 million paid in wages by Alcoa World Alumina at its Victorian operations last year, it spent $47,500 in claims for work-related injuries. That is almost 5 per cent of its wages bill.
Can you imagine what Mr Abbott might want to say if that were not due to injury, if you actually had those costs of five per cent of your wages bill and you were not seriously addressing it if that were due to some other area? I can see the minister going ape over it. But here are the figures: the equivalent amount of five per cent of the wages bill is actually being spent on claims for work related injuries. I think it is not unreasonable to say that a large amount of that money could be saved by preventing accidents and death in the workplace. There are very different figures for different industries: by contrast, BHP paid out less than one quarter of this amount, while Shell paid less than a tenth. The article further states:
Corporate performance on health and safety varies enormously. Although some industries are inherently more hazardous than others, this does not explain the range. Several years ago, BHP conducted an internal review of its health and safety performance and found that while some of its coal mines had the worst records, they were matched by some of their administration offices. At the same time, both coal mines and offices were among the best performers.
That is reasonable evidence that it is not just in dangerous workplaces that there will be accidents and injuries of workers. Numbers add up, as this article says:
Data from companies that self-insure for worker injury in Victoria show Woolworths has $58.7 million in outstanding claims, while Coles Myer has $42.6 million. In the three months to June 30, 2000, Coles Myer was making weekly compensation payments to 599 employees while Woolworths was making payments to 351.
I raise these points because this is an area that, for me, is mainly focused on the pain and suffering, the awful loss, when a person dies in the workplace. Equally, if a person is injured in the workplace, our focus must be on the rights of that worker, the safety of that worker, the assistance for the family and addressing the pain and suffering. But not long behind that come the cost to industry and, as I have already said, the insultingly small payouts against the cost of a human life.
One of the major problems here is the fact that this is another Commonwealth-state problem. A large amount of the compensation and worker safety issues are a state government matter. But we do have a National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and we also have the Commonwealth with its rehabilitation service and its own workers equally involved in this area, which leads to the usual messiness between Commonwealth and states and, so far, to dragging the chain on doing the sorts of things that would make a difference here.
There are some very important points in an article by Michael Bachelard in the Weekend Australian on Saturday, 13 January 2001. This article starts with a report of a man who fell to his death at a building site in the Melbourne CBD. Bachelard goes on to say:
WorkCover authorities keep figures of the deaths they compensate, but those figures exclude self-employed people, those without dependants, those who make no claim for whatever reason.
Coroners' courts keep the files on traumatic deaths, but they do not extract the figures of how many of those deaths happen at work. A long-promised database, the National Coronial Information System, is still not up and running. The National Occupation Health and Safety Council has done two surveys of those coroners' records, but the most recent relates to figures 10 years old. It estimated an average of 597 traumatic workplace deaths a year in Australia—11 per week.
So at least we are getting some kind of consistency with those figures—they are the same as those I read earlier. The article goes on:
Men are 10 times more likely to die than women—
that is, in largest part, because they are working in the higher risk areas by far—
alcohol contributes to 4 per cent of fatalities and, in construction at least, Christmas-New Year is the most dangerous time—
That is because there is no adequate guarantee that people who leave the workplace to attend a Christmas party do not return to the site. Indeed, there is some considerable evidence that they do and that lack of safety supervision in the workplace may contribute to those deaths.
A woman called Liz Mobayad took action after her father died in a construction accident five years ago. She set up Industrial Deaths Support and Advocacy Inc. She has done this with no government funding but by raising money by selling books, videos, et cetera. Her group attends accidents, counsels workmates and families, and lobbies hard for inquests. One of the things she reports is the shock to other workers when they see somebody who has had a violent death in the workplace. Any death is shocking, but if you are working in the construction industry, for example, and—as this article reports—somebody drops 12 storeys to their death, it is not just the shocking death of that worker; it is the shocking impact of that death on all the fellow workers, to the point where some of them are unable to return to work for many months. Liz Mobayad does all the interesting things I mentioned to support people in getting some kind of justice after an injury or death in the workplace. She has some proposals which I would like to read from this article onto the record, because they are very constructive. The article states:
She wants courts to issue fines to negligent companies that properly reflect the value of a human life. Fines have gone as low as $500, she says, and average an unacceptable $22,000 ...
Mobayad wants Victorian WorkCover to reinstate the inspectors with experience in the construction industry who were sacked by the Kennett government to save money.
She wants it made illegal for companies who cause a death to go bankrupt then re-emerge days later under a different company name, having escaped liability.
The article goes on to say:
A West Australian company went bankrupt a week after one of its workers died on site, and started up the next day under another name, doing another job in Perth. Three years later the contractor pleaded guilty to an unsafe site, and was fined $7000.
Mobayad wants inquests so families will have some sense of closure. And she wants employers to stop dangerously overworking employees to meet unrealistic deadlines.
I think they are very reasonable recommendations. It will be interesting to see whether any of them are picked up. In the article in the Age on Thursday, 22 March, Jan Carrick—the person I first quoted—says:
I applaud the Bracks Government's plan to introduce a bill that will include a new crime of industrial manslaughter and to lift maximum fines for corporations from $250,000 to $600,000.
I started in this place talking about occupational health and safety because that was one of the major areas of concern where I worked, in a community health centre amongst small factories in South Australia. It has been a continuing issue of mine and I find it very shocking that after this length of time the figures are really no better. People still die from fairly preventable causes in the workplace. But what has happened is that the cost to industry, to families, to the taxpayers, to this country, has blown out massively. It is time, I believe, that all those reports to government were acted on or more seriously addressed. What is the point of writing reports with recommendations if they are not acted on and implemented, if we do not see some changes in the workplace instead of blaming the workers and going into court to argue that their claims for wage justice are too much? Maybe this government would do much better by actually campaigning for occupational health and safety in the workplace, saving itself massive dollars, saving industry massive dollars and saving the lives of workers. Then the government will not be seen—as they are—as a mean, spare, unkind government.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-03-29,"—I thank Senator Crowley for that speech because I think it really does raise serious issues about occupational health and safety. It is interesting that I actually want to follow on about another occupational health and safety issue, an issue that is to do with aircraft. For the purpose of doing that, I want to make my speech against an item in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. This bill provides for the winding up of the Australian National Railway Commission. It underlines the policy vacuum that we have in this country in the area of transport, in the sense that we have no overall transport policy from any of the political parties. It is a vacuum and one that ought to be filled as quickly as possible. Neither this government nor this nation has an overall transport policy and that is a very serious lack indeed.
But there is also a vacuum in the delivery of transport safety and that is what I really want to address today—in this case, not simply safety in terms of railways but safety in terms of air transport. I note that the appropriation bill is about winding up the Australian National Railway Commission, something which the Democrats were always strongly opposed to. I note also that moves to build the railway from Alice Springs to Darwin are now foundering and clearly—without an overall national transport policy that involves road, rail, air and sea—we are going to have these one-off projects which do not fit into any kind of overall policy at all and of course we are going to have difficulty in getting support for building transport infrastructure which, in a sense, seems to go nowhere.
Let me return to what I believe is an even more pressing transport issue, the issue of air safety—in particular, the issue of cabin air quality on the BAe 146 aircraft. Most Australians would know by now, because of the media and the publicity given to the Senate inquiry into this, that these British Aerospace 70-seater jets—of which there about 30 in Australia and hundreds more overseas—have got a design flaw. This flaw is in the engines and the air-conditioning system and this flaw means that toxic oil fumes from the engines are leaking into the air-conditioning and being inhaled by flight crew and passengers.
The Democrats initiated—and were very well supported by the other parties in this place in conducting it—a two-year Senate inquiry into this issue which found that the contaminated air was causing short, medium and possibly long-term illness among flight crew, that there was also a safety issue due to crew being incapacitated and that the planes needed to be fixed. There was huge amount of disturbing evidence to the inquiry that several pilots had become incapacitated by the contaminated air while flying planes and that hundreds of flight crew were ill from inhaling the fumes. CASA, disturbingly, said there was no problem. British Aerospace and the two major airlines, predictably, said there was not a serious problem. So far, the minister for transport, alarmingly, has said nothing.
The Senate report, which had cross party support and unanimous recommendations, found that there was a major problem and made a range of recommendations to fix it. Just to recap, the committee recommended that CASA reassess its requirements for monitoring the operations and cabin and cockpit air quality of the BAe 146 aircraft operating in Australia and, where necessary, introduce regulations under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 specifying a number of things, including that there should be a specific national standard for checking and monitoring the engine seals and air quality in all passenger commercial jet aircraft and that they should put in place operational procedures for the BAe 146 which pay particular attention to the need to ensure aircraft are withdrawn from operational flying and serviced to ensure any operating faults resulting in oil leaks, fumes or smoke are immediately repaired. CASA was called on to review the registration of BAe 146 aircraft operating in Australia, and it was recommended that renewal of air operating certificates and registration of the BAe 146 be subject to completion of those recommended modifications as a condition for continued registration of the aircraft.
The committee also recommended that the minister for transport request the Strategic Research Development Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council to set up and undertake an appropriate research program on the effect of exposure to aircraft cabin air on air crew and passengers. The committee noted that several flight crew lost employment due to ill health which they attribute to fumes exposure and that their employers have opposed and may have unnecessarily delayed the settlement of employees' compensation and insurance claims. It also recommended that the issue of cabin air quality be reviewed by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission with a view to including aerotoxic syndrome in appropriate codes as a matter of reference for future workers compensation and other insurance cases. The minister for transport has had months to respond to this report but sadly, despite being assured that work was being done, the Australian flying public has heard nothing. The deadline for the government to respond to the Senate report came and went in February but still there is nothing.
This is not good enough. The Democrats understand that the government is working in good faith to implement the recommendations of the Senate inquiry, but we are now past any reasonable deadline. This is a matter of air safety and passenger and crew health and must be addressed urgently. While the government has been delaying its response to the report, incidents of fume contamination on the BAe 146 aircraft continue. Flight crew continue to be laid off due to ill health without workers compensation and passengers are being affected.
This is an appalling situation. The government has neglected its duty to protect air travellers. The airlines are neglecting their duty to protect crew and passengers. The manufacturer has neglected its duty to fix the problem. Most seriously, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has neglected its duty to fix this safety problem. I am informed by my contacts in the aviation industry that the aviation authorities of both the United Kingdom and Canada have issued official communiques to flight crew on the fumes problem in aircraft. The communique of the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK said:
There have been incidents where smoke or fumes have entered aircraft and pilots have been affected to the extent that their ability to operate the aircraft may have been impaired. The first action in the event of smoke or fumes in the flight deck should be for flight crew to don oxygen masks.
An interim air safety recommendation from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said:
In situations where odor/smoke from an unknown source occurs, the decision to initiate a diversion and a potential emergency landing must be made quickly.
On the other hand, what do we have from CASA here in Australia? We had denials that there was a problem. We do not have any warnings to crew or passengers. Shouldn't CASA be telling Australian aircrew to use oxygen in the event of fume contamination? And what about passengers? These questions must be answered.
In the meantime, I have been informed by flight crew that the incidents continue to occur. This year an Australian flight attendant was diagnosed with chemical burns to her lungs after being exposed to fumes in an aircraft cabin. I have also been informed by one medical practitioner that this doctor is treating 20 flight attendants and two pilots who are gravely ill as a result of their exposure to fumes but continue to work because they cannot get employment elsewhere. Some are too sick to work and are on leave without pay. And I have been informed that one regular passenger on these planes is also gravely ill but cannot get insurance because the problem of aerotoxic syndrome has not been recognised. I have also seen statements from the airlines that the Senate report was not directed at them, so therefore they will not be taking action.
The fact that the airlines and the aviation authorities have known about and covered up this problem for decades and continue to selectively use doctors and insurance companies to cover up the problem and deny compensation to flight crew is an outrage. This is an international problem, and Australia is being left behind in terms of fixing it up. We have a good air safety record in this country, but we must not put it in jeopardy by not addressing problems such as these. And that is not to mention the injustice suffered by hundreds of flight crew affected by these toxic fumes.
So I am here today to say to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, and to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to the airlines, `Shame on you. Australian people are being injured while you deny the problem and dither around.' I call on all those responsible to take action now and to respond to the Senate report. It lays out what needs to be done. It should be done. I will continue to monitor this situation, and we will continue to publicly raise incidents of air contamination in aeroplanes. There is a higher public awareness of these issues now that the problem of deep vein thrombosis has been given so much publicity. You cannot bury your heads in the sand any longer. We need to face the problem and take action.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-03-29,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001, which cover additional expenditures, planned expenditures, additional appropriations and, indeed, additional revenues for agencies to meet. In doing so, I want to comment on some of the consequences of government expenditure. They are affected obviously—and it is an obvious point—by the revenue expectations of government. Unless those revenue expectations are fulfilled, appropriations, if adhered to, result in deficit funding. I do not think that is going to be a consequence of these bills, and that is the theme I really want to pick up on today. I make no apology for repeating some ideas and themes I have used before because they are still relevant.
The pressure is on for the government to spend more money on education, training, research, health, the environment, infrastructure, industry programs, tax relief, defence and many other issues. Unfortunately, we are in a position of limited knowledge as to what extra is affordable. The ABS—the Australian Bureau of Statistics—and other statistical sources have real lags in providing this key information. The ATO—the Australian Taxation Office—however, do know from income tax returns and from the second set of BAS returns what the government can expect in revenue. But the parliament, the public and the media are still in the dark. An indication of what the new tax system and the Ralph reforms, such of those that have been introduced, mean in terms of actual revenue expectations is needed. We have simply had massive changes in the revenue design by the government and we really are in the dark as to the true picture.
Just about every tax paying entity has now given in a return of one sort or another: a business activity statement, an instalment activity statement or an income tax return. Based on other countries' experiences, the Democrats do expect a GST windfall, which could remove the requirement of the Commonwealth to top up all or some of the states, depending on the size of the windfall. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth would get money back. The current Commonwealth-states agreement, which includes the top up, is based on a conservative forecast of GST. Why do I say it is conservative, when the Treasurer and everybody else are trying to deny that it is anything other than realistic? I say it is conservative because it is the tradition of Treasury not to overstate revenue. What is more, there are precedents where Treasury have understated the effect of large tax changes. Famously, they massively understated the expected income from fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax. So on precedent, it is quite likely they have done the same with regard to the GST and other components of the new tax system. 
On current budget forecasts, New South Wales will not be better off until 2007, but if the GST did, for instance, raise 15 per cent more than forecast, New South Wales along with all other states would be better off in this financial year. Why might GST revenue be higher? GST registrations were 35 per cent higher than forecast. Australian business number registrations have pulled hundreds of thousands of new tax targets into the net. In Canada and New Zealand—the most recent additions to the two-thirds of all countries that have a GST—the GST forecasts were between 20 and 40 per cent less than realised. They too had very conservative forecasts.
A 20 per cent underestimate of GST in Australia would mean a budget boost of $2.7 billion to the Commonwealth government saved from the top up that they are required to give to the states, and an extra $2.1 billion to the states. A 30 per cent underestimate of GST revenues would leave the states $4.5 billion better off, which would allow for significant extra expenditure by the states on education or infrastructure. One of the reasons that the states are so pleased with the new tax system is that it will deliver to them a certain revenue flow which will enable them at last to start spending in areas which they were forced under previous taxation regimes to ignore. At last they will be able to spend the money that is needed by our society and our communities.
Surpluses result when revenue realised is greater than government expenditure. Surpluses are the new sign of orthodox fiscal responsibility. Surpluses now represent the higher bar. It is a higher bar because a balanced budget means getting expenditure and income to balance, while surpluses require income to exceed expenditure. There are a few good reasons for supporting the new orthodoxy of surpluses. Firstly, a surplus means the government is on top of its revenue stream and is prudently ahead of government expenditure expectations. However, as Labor have rightly pointed out and as other Democrats have said in the past, you should as far as possible look at the issue of surpluses over a cycle and not necessarily the immediate financial year. That does allow, in times of lower economic activity or lower economic growth, for the use of prudent deficit funding. However, deficit funding which is significant and cannot be recovered ultimately ends up in a black hole. So you have to be careful about advocating and using deficit funding.
Secondly, even with the best will and techniques, Treasury just cannot estimate expenditure and income accurately, and a standard error of a few per cent will always make a balanced budget hard to achieve. In a budget Australia's size, the standard error will mean at least a couple of billion dollars, and that might be on the downside. So prudent budgeting needs to err on the income side and budget for a surplus. Anyway, as this government knows and as the previous government found out, there are always unexpected costs, and surpluses can act as a contingency reserve. 
Thirdly, the arrival of accrual accounting in government finances brings with it a private sector perspective. In private sector parlance, a successful company produces profits; for governments read surpluses. Ergo, the financial markets like surpluses for successful governments, and that matters from the perspective of our international credit rating, particularly if there are large current account deficits to account for.
However, while industry sectors have established benchmarks for what is an acceptable, good or excellent profit picture for companies, the markets have not done the same for governments. So the Treasurer gets little guidance as to what size of surplus is desirable. At the lower end it is obvious: a surplus should at least cover the standard error expected in budgeting, so it should be at least a few billion dollars. What about the upper end? Some help can be gained from private sector analysis. It depends on what you want profits or surpluses for. It depends on how you will spend your profits or surpluses. Using the company analogy, companies separate capital expenditure budgets from operating budgets; operating budgets are catered for by the profit and loss statement, and capital expenditure budgets are usually catered for by a judicious mix of equity, debt and reserves adjudicated by the gearing ratio and adjusted for cash flow.
When companies make profits, they distribute some as dividends, or if they are awash with cash, they might repay capital to their shareholders or reduce their debt. The government equivalent of these activities is debt reductions, income tax cuts, payments in kind as a greater than expected expenditure on essential services, or there may be a mix of all three. Prudent companies put aside a portion of profits on a cumulative basis as reserves. They do this for balance sheet health, for acquisitions or for lumpy expenditure—that is, large expenditures which come around every so many years, such as periodic and expensive replacement of expensive plant. Governments have the same needs, with high periodic investment required in areas such as infrastructure or defence.
In arguing the case for the size of surpluses for this financial year and for future federal budgets and what is to be done with them, we need the media in particular, but also politicians, to exercise commonsense. Apart from the not inconsiderable merit of showing good fiscal managerial skills through the maintenance and regular achievement of a modest budget surplus, what should we be doing with any surplus that is not modest? We already have the fourth lowest level of public sector debt in the OECD, so in the Democrats' view lowering our debt is not a high priority. Our gearing as a country is not at risk from a public sector perspective. If there are large surpluses in prospect, the question would be: do we spend them or keep them? In the Democrats' view, we badly need to lift our level of ongoing investment in key areas such as education and the environment. On the latter, global warming and salinity are scaring many, many Australians. Then there are the periodic, big ticket, lumpy expenditures, such as defence or rail. Rail, in particular in this country, badly needs additional investment. We have heavy contingent liabilities, such as Commonwealth superannuation, which may need a prudent level of reserves to be set aside instead of being funded from current income.
If we look set, as a result of tax reform, to deliver permanently big surpluses in the future, then we should look at how those surpluses should be dealt with. One of the ways you can use those excessive revenues is to give further tax cuts. If that were to happen, the Democrats would stress that those tax cuts should go to those at the bottom and that a $1 cut to the threshold tax level benefits rich and poor by the same amount but has far more impact on the poor. If Australia does achieve a substantial surplus—and I recognise it is an `if', especially in view of a softening economy—the Democrats have put in their bids over the last year; but of course the government of the day will be making the decisions. Our bids over the past year included, in education, to reverse federal higher education cuts by $1 billion and to improve government schools by another $1 billion. I remind you that to restore Australia to the level of GDP expenditure that they enjoyed briefly under Labor, you would need to lift expenditure on education by $3 billion.
Democrats are also interested in bringing forward the abolition of the bank accounts debit tax from its planned year 2005 start to 2002. That would cost $1 billion. The Democrats are interested in investing in urgently needed infrastructure and upgrading for public hospitals and for dental programs. Democrats are interested in having the states absorb the GST on public transport fares rather than passing it on—and that cost is half a billion dollars—or invest in environmental repair to expand Landcare and to fund the retention of existing vegetation to prevent further land degradation, which cost is another half a billion dollars.
We reflect, in our views on expenditure, the reasonable needs of Australians as expressed in budget submissions and other submissions to government. Revenue from government is of no use unless it is either used for the common good or repatriated back to Australians themselves. We think there are substantial areas of expenditure in the common good which are still absent from this government's activities and which, in any government's activities, can only be afforded if the tax system in fact delivers that revenue—but delivers it by a system which lowers the rates, broadens the base and fulfils the essential elements of equity, simplicity and efficiency. There are huge arguments in the parliament about that and about where the emphasis should lie, and there will continue to be. But the fundamental issue is always the same: can Australia afford the programs that its citizens and residents want, and how will it afford them? We believe we need to generate as far as possible the affordability from internal revenues rather than from deficits.
So we will need to hear from the government what they believe we can afford, now that the new tax system is in place. I sense from their willingness to spend money that they are not under the pressure they would like us to believe they are under. I sense that they have a cushion; and they would only know they have a cushion because of the ATO telling them what the income tax returns, the BAS returns and the IAS returns are looking like. So we are all hanging out to hear the news too, but I suspect that the government will keep us in the dark and wait until the May budget to tell us. I hope, as I am sure Senator Cook does, that they will tell us before that.
At the back of all things, when I look at the body language of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer when they have been spending additional money in various areas—some of them demanded by the opposition and by us—and responding to community pressures, I get the impression that these are people who know that they have a bit in reserve and therefore have been able to afford what they have done so far. What I want to know is how much more is there, because then we need to put in our bids to really get education back up to five per cent of GDP and to get expenditure in the prime areas that this community needs it. With that, I conclude my views on these appropriation bills.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-03-29,"—We are debating Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001. The program had us down to debate the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, but the program has been switched this morning by the government. Those excise bills are matters of major public controversy because, as the front page of the Sydney Daily Telegraph reported yesterday and again today, they contain the Prime Minister's backflip in reducing the excise payments on petrol but, at the same time, they include the Prime Minister's determination to push ahead with indexing excise on beer and alcoholic drinks. He had put these two things together in the same bill. The government said to the House yesterday, `You have to vote for both of them; you can't separate them.' We were to debate that today, and we had foreshadowed that we wanted a separate vote on each issue. We wanted to vote for what we have campaigned for—a reduction in excise payments on petrol, because petrol prices are just too high; they are hurting ordinary Australians and hurting country Australians most of all, and this is not the time for the government to take an extra rake-off from petrol.
We had a private member's bill, moved both in the House by Kim Beazley and in this chamber by me, to achieve that result. So we want to vote for that when that bill gets here. But we also believe that the excise adjustment should not be made to beer, because the Prime Minister promised that ordinary beer would not increase by more than 1.9 per cent because of the GST—and he said that on the John Laws program before the last election and on the Alan Jones program before the last election. Before the last election, according to Eoin Cameron, the Liberal member for Stirling in Western Australia defeated at the last election, the Prime Minister said that in the party room as well. Beer has gone up not by 1.9 per cent but by more than 10 per cent.
We believe that we should be entitled in this chamber to vote not to increase the tax on beer further; and the government bill which proposes to do that is now tied up in some sort of backroom discussion with, we understand, the Australian Democrats. As I said earlier today, there is an element of deja vu in this. We remember vividly that last year the GST was being opposed in this chamber, the Democrats were supporting the opposition of it, there was a backroom meeting between the Prime Minister and Senator Meg Lees, and she emerged from that meeting shaking hands with the Prime Minister and delivering a GST on the Australian community. I hope that this backroom meeting does not result in a backdown on the determination that the Democrats have publicly expressed to join us in curbing unnecessary price increases for beer drinkers in Australia.
But that is a debate that we will come to a little later in the day or, if time does not permit, in the next sitting week. Let me address some remarks to the appropriation bills. These are bills that provide funds to the government departments in order for the government to function and they are bills that we will vote for. But it is important in considering these bills to turn our attention to the wider state of the Australian economy. All Australians have recently heard the Prime Minister say that the Australian economy is fundamentally sound, or they have heard the Treasurer say that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. If only you could believe them. We would wish it were true. If it were so, fewer people would be facing unemployment, fewer businesses would be facing bankruptcy and the general economic downturn we are going through would not exist.
The fundamentals of the Australian economy are not sound. That is unfortunate; we would rather not see that. But it is the case that this government has delivered the lowest Australian dollar on record, trading below 50c to the US dollar. That is a fundamental of the economy. That is also a record in the history of this country and it is not sound. It is not a good sign for the economy. We also now face the highest level of foreign debt that Australia ever has had to shoulder. We recall before the last election the Prime Minister had the debt truck running around the country trying to highlight that foreign debt under Labor was too high. Foreign debt under Labor, prior to the federal election when Labor was defeated, peaked at $185 billion. What is foreign debt now? It is $301 billion. When the Prime Minister complained about the level of foreign debt in campaigning against the Keating government, it was $185 billion. Now he says the fundamentals of the economy are sound and it is $301 billion—$15,000 per man, woman and child in this country! That is one question that we can nail him on.
But I go to another issue that I think most Australians have a perfect personal knowledge about; that is, the level of taxation they pay and, in particular, the impact of the GST on household budgets—on spending patterns of families—and the cost impost that is imposed. The government is fond of saying in question time in response to any question on the economy, `We'—that is, the government—`are a small taxing party; you'—Labor—`are a big taxing and big spending party.' In politics I guess the truth is what people believe, not what the facts are. If people believe it, then that is the truth. This is the image that the government is trying to spread: Labor is a big taxing, big spending party; the government is a small taxing, small spending party. The absolute lie to that was put in the Bulletin on 13 March this year, just prior to the Ryan by-election, by Max Walsh a well-known, longstanding conservative economic commentator in Australia and the editor of the Bulletin magazine. His article was headlined `The tax-and-spend Liberals'. The subheading was an excerpt from his article, and I will read it:
`By the time Costello brings down his budget ... we will see that Howard is not only the largest taxer in history but also the biggest spender'
He starts this article—the article `The tax-and-spend Liberals'—by saying:
If the voters in the Brisbane electorate of Ryan behave rationally, they will vote Labor next weekend. The Howard-Costello government has treated them very poorly.
Their loyalty in perpetually returning a Liberal to Canberra has been repaid with fiscal policies which have actually—and, in one notorious case at least, downright stupidly—discriminated against them.
In this article, Walsh—I repeat, a conservative economic commentator, not someone traditionally known to be a Labor supporter; certainly not a Labor supporter—goes on to say:
In fact the Howard-Costello government is the highest taxing government in Australian history. The chart pictured is derived from data collected by Jim Hoggett, the director of economic policy at the Institute of Public Affairs and records the growth of all government spending—as a percentage of GDP—over the past four decades.
If we look specifically at the Commonwealth, then its tax collections this year (including the GST) will reach 25.7% of GDP.
He goes on to say:
The Hawke government's biggest tax grab occurred in 1986-87 when it went into its anti-Banana Republic strategy. That amounted to 24.4% of GDP. As for the profligate Gough Whitlam, well, in 1974-75 he managed to lift taxation collection to 21.1% of GDP.
The image: Whitlam was a big taxer, big spender. Under Whitlam, tax reached 21.1 per cent of GDP. On the figures provided by Max Walsh, under Howard it is at 25.7 per cent of GDP. This article concludes, referring to the Howard government:
Its expansion in expenditure will almost certainly match and probably top the Whitlam years.
This is a significant point: in growth terms, it is much bigger than Whitlam ever achieved but, in terms of how quickly it has increased, it will outscore the Whitlam government as well. If the Whitlam government is supposed to be what the Liberals mean when they say that Labor is a `big taxing party', then, on the facts by a conservative economic think tank, and by a table reproduced in the Bulletin magazine showing what the tax share has been from 1959-1960 through to the year 2001, the biggest taxing government in Australian history is—as Max Walsh, the conservative economic commentator, says—this government. Why? Mostly because of the GST—not exclusively, but mostly because of the GST.
It is worthwhile going back to prior to the 1998 election, in the period of the lead-up to the enactment of the GST tax itself, recalling what the promises were that the GST would do for the Australian economy and, now that we have had two quarters of experience of the GST, seeing what the outcome has been. Let me do a little compare and contrast between promise and outcome to get an idea of what the picture is.
The first—and, in my judgment, the most fraudulent—allegation about the GST was that it would be good for the Australian economy. In the last quarter, the three months ending the year 2000—the December quarter, for statistical purposes—the Australian economy contracted by 0.6 per cent. That was the second quarter after the introduction of the GST. The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, a noted economist in Australia and a responsible officer of the central bank, in a speech in Tokyo last week, blamed the GST for that contraction. The figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that the building industry has gone south, dragging a lot of other industries with it, and that the Australian economy has shrunk—a direct consequence of the GST. It is possible now, as we stand here today, that the Australian economy is in actual recession. You require two quarters of negative growth, and we are in the second quarter. The state of the economies of the US and Japan, major trading partners of Australia, suggests—60 per cent of economists believe—that we most likely are in actual recession now. Was the GST good for the economy? No, not on those figures.
The other statement was that the GST would be good for jobs. Since July, the number of people in full-time employment in Australia has actually fallen. Good for jobs? Not if are you seeking full-time employment; there are fewer jobs. The GST would boost investment, the government said. In the first six months after the introduction of the GST, the last six months of last year, business investment in Australia underwent its biggest fall since 1983. The government said that the GST would be good for the Australian dollar. I should just rest my case. The dollar is below US50c. Is that good for the Australian dollar? No, it is not, and it imposes higher costs on imports and infuses inflation into the economy.
—Good for exports.
—`The GST was good for exports' is the allegation from the government. The national accounts show exports from Australia fell by 2.2 per cent for the December quarter. That was the second quarter of the GST. Good for exports? Not good for exports. Exports fell, when the dollar was low and the prices of Australian goods in foreign markets were cheaper. At a time when exports ought to have gone up, they actually fell. The GST good for exports? Not at all—not on the figures.
We were told that the GST would not cause an increase in petrol prices. Everyone is entitled to a hollow laugh right now, because petrol prices have gone through the roof. Because the GST is a 10 per cent tax on the final price, the higher the cost of petrol, the bigger the tax rake-off. That erodes household budgets. People planning their normal expenditure are now paying much more tax on the GST than the government budgeted for. The GST has pushed petrol prices higher.
This government promised to cut red tape. Just mention to any businessman in Australia three letters: B-A-S, the business activity statement. They will tell you that this government has botched this entirely. Small business have become tax collectors for the government with no time to conduct their own business. They are mired in red tape and unable to burst out of it. The Prime Minister's backflip adopting Labor policy on the business activity statement had one significant flaw: it did not adopt all of the Labor policy. If it had, the problems in simplifying the business activity statement would have been substantially behind it. There are still problems in the business activity statement. To the promise that red tape would be less, the response is `not true'.
The government said that the GST would reduce the cost of banking. They said that the cost of banking would go down by $600 million a year. The cost of banking has actually gone up by $430 million a year and that has caused a rise in fees and charges imposed by the banks. In some cases, those fees and charges have gone up by 10 per cent. No-one would put their prices up by more than 10 per cent? You tell that to the banks! Fees and charges have gone up by a full 10 per cent, and in some cases more.
The government said nobody would be worse off, except tax cheats. Yesterday, in question time in the other place, the Prime Minister said the average Australian would not be worse off. A funny modulation of language here—from `nobody' to `the average'. Of the people responding to a popular opinion poll, 70 per cent said they believed they were worse off under the GST. This 70 per cent of Australians is a majority by my count. If that 70 per cent of Australians hold that firm view, they are entitled to be believed, and 70 per cent of Australians are not tax cheats. This `70 per cent of Australians' covers the Prime Minister's definition of `average Australians'. They believe they are worse off under the GST.
One of the greatest furphies of all time is that the GST would remove hidden taxes. The government published a little red book of hidden taxes saying, `These are the taxes that will be removed.' What they did not tell anyone is that excise is a hidden tax. That was not in the little red book. Excise, as a hidden tax, has gone through the roof. Go to page 5-13 of Budget Paper No. 1 from the last budget and you will see a massive increase in excises, of some 40 per cent. Excise taxes have gone up by some $6 billion annually, or $300 per Australian, and that is a hidden tax under this government. A hidden tax, not abolished. A hidden tax, growing, and a hidden tax that if the beer bill goes through will increase the rake-off more. What are the components of that extra $6,000 million? Excise tax went up 13 per cent on fuel, 61 per cent on beer and spirits and 194 per cent on tobacco. That is the hidden tax they have raked off. The government said they do not agree with the principle of a tax on a tax—and nor do we. But there is a tax on a tax: you pay excise on beer and you pay a tax on the top; you pay excise on petrol and you pay the GST on the top. It is a principle of taxation that taxation lawyers and taxation accountants say you should not do: taxing a tax. That is what the government have done. The tax, the GST, is a growth tax because it is a percentage tax.
The government says the fundamentals of the economy are fine. Tell it to the dollar! Tell it to our foreign debt! Tell it to Australians who are concerned about the impact of the GST. Just quietly, do a compare and contrast of what the government promised and what are the outcomes. Be conservative in assessing the outcomes. Do not try and make a case. Be objective and conservative. You will find the government has misled Australians massively.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-03-29,"—We have heard a very elegant and very forceful speech by Senator Cook. He was talking about the need to ensure that the economy is right and that the wellbeing of Australians is looked to. I have heard you, Mr Acting Deputy President George Campbell, argue many a time in this chamber on the economy and I must say you have always made sense—a lot more sense than certain other speeches that are made in this chamber. The economy is essential for the wellbeing of Australians but the economy is not all that goes to the issue of the wellbeing of Australians. We argue at times as if the fundamentals of the economy are all that matter—if we can shift certain levers, put certain things in place, get the interest rates right, get the balance of trade right, get the gross national product right, we will all be happy.
I am not sure that follows, because the soundness of the economy does not necessarily mean that the wellbeing of the nation is going to be assured. There are other elements. The integrity of the economic system—and all those sorts of things that go to make it up—is essential. I was speaking last night to Mr Ralph Jacobi. Mr Jacobi was a member from South Australia when I first got here. He was a very good and notable member of parliament. He had what could almost be called an obsession that companies and the instruments that determine the economy for the people on the ground should be looked at. Their integrity was absolutely essential for the wellbeing of the people of Australia. In this speech I would just like to pay tribute to Mr Jacobi because I think he was a person who left a great legacy to this parliamentary institution.
We have recently had an example of what Mr Jacobi talked about when he said we ought to have a society where everything is conducted according to the utmost integrity and, if that cannot be done without regulation, we ought to have regulation. There is an argument—and a good argument at that—which says that it should be left up to people to act in accordance with their conscience, there is no need for regulation and, if there is a non-regulatory system, everything will operate well. Mr Jacobi was against that approach. I must confess that a recent example of what has happened in the insurance world bears out what Mr Jacobi has to say. I talk here about HIH Insurance Group and its collapse.
I had a phone call just before I came in here from a policyholder who held a policy from HIH in respect of professional indemnity. Proceedings have been taken against her for professional negligence. From what she tells me there is no real worry that the case will be successful. Nevertheless, the case has been taken; she looks to HIH Insurance to back her up to conduct the case and proceedings, and it has gone broke. In fact, she got on to HIH Insurance through very big brokers, AON. They say there is no responsibility for them because they thought it was a very reputable insurance company. No doubt it was—at one stage at least—but now it has gone broke they are not concerned in any way to help her out. Here we have a situation where a person has gone to a very big broker who has had her insured through HIH Insurance, HIH Insurance has collapsed and everybody has said, `Bad luck, fight your professional negligence claim on your own.'
It is bad enough that a private company—AON, the brokers—should abandon her; it is perhaps worse still when the regulatory authority set up to look at the sort of situation as the one created by HIH Insurance should also fail in its duty. I refer to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The woman who rang me is one of many people who have now been left without proper insurance. These people who have, in a very responsible way, insured themselves against all sorts of things are now to be left bereft of the protection that they were entitled to think they had but which, in fact, they did not have. I think the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ought to be explaining to this parliament how this sort of thing was allowed to happen. Why do we have people like the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority when this sort of disaster is allowed to happen? When people go about their work industriously, with skill and dedication, if they are confronted by someone saying they are going to sue them, why should they then be left, as this person is, bereft of that protection?
What sort of financial system have we got when a disaster like this can occur and the body that we have in place to supposedly protect against this does nothing? From what I can gather from the talk about town—if I can use that expression—in Melbourne, this sort of thing was known about for some months before it occurred. Not only have the policyholders been affected; people who did work for this insurance group have also been affected. They have been left owed millions of dollars. I think this is a very bad situation, and some sort of action should be taken by the government and the parliament. I think it is proper—and perhaps it does not occur often enough—that this parliament supervise things more than it does. The estimates committee system is an excellent system. We are about to reduce—if we have not already reduced—the number of estimates committees we have. I think there ought to be more committees because things like the HIH Insurance collapse bring home to you just how necessary it is for this parliament to see how the administration is going. 
It is important to look at this whole area of parliamentary supervision. I was looking last night at some government documents that were brought in, two of which I spoke to for five minutes. We get five minutes to speak to these documents. I sometimes think that is not enough, but at least there is some opportunity for parliament to look at issues which are of great importance to the people of this country. The first of the two documents brought in last night was about a person who had some problems at work because of her age. Some justice was done, because the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Professor Alice Tay, made a decision which the employer—a private employer in these circumstances—accepted, and the employer paid money to the applicant in accordance with that decision. On the other hand, in another case involving two people, Mr Chris Sidoti, who was the predecessor of Professor Tay, made a series of findings against the government in the form of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. He made a finding against it, but it failed to comply with the decision. I think it is proper that the parliament take note of what is going on with both of those cases.
The other document that I would like to refer to that came up last night was the report on the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, a report for the year ending 30 June 2000. That sets out, amongst other things, an audit of the phone tapping that has been carried out by those authorities that are entitled to phone tap. That is a very significant point in terms of the civil rights that we enjoy in this country. We can only continue to enjoy them if we watch how they have been affected by various acts of parliament and by the people who are supposed to be administering those acts of parliament, the Public Service. If we do not have annual reports and if we do not take notice of annual reports, our liberties can be set back. Unless we look at the rights that we all say we prize so strongly and unless we keep our eyes on these things, we could be in trouble. You can have a bad system, and if you let that bad system continue then you are not adding to the wellbeing of the people of Australia. Although we might save the people of Australia an extra $100 or even $1,000 a year by some action we take, if we have left them with less freedom than they should have had and left them worse off than they should have been in terms of the things that are essential for the human spirit, then we have failed.
It is important to look at whether our structures are correct. You can have the most wonderful structures in the world, but unless you have the right people in charge of those structures then things fail. I think we have quite excellent systems, whether they are policing systems, systems that see that people's pensions are paid or systems that see people are paid in the armed services, for example. We have systems that give resources to people who are getting older, and we have systems to help education in Australia. We can have all those systems and they can be the most perfect systems in the world, but if we have not got the right people in charge of them then again we have real problems in ensuring we have the wellbeing that we all say we need.
It is important, therefore, that we look not only at the tests of how the economy is going but also at the state of the community we are living in. There is some excellent work done by the committee system in this parliament, and I think it is important that that be preserved. As I said before, I would like more rather than fewer estimates committees. I would like to talk about my own excellent committee, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which tests against a series of criteria whether legislation is in accordance with what is human, what is proper and what is right and in accordance with the true spirit of people. A committee which is aligned and very closely related to that in many ways is the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I see Mr Bessell in the chamber. He is one of the great figures in that area. He is presently the secretary, but he has been working in this area for some years now. Before that, he was with another excellent committee, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, where he saw that many a great report was published. Those reports put out into the public domain the ideas that are oftentimes adopted in legislation. They should be adopted more often in legislation than they are; nevertheless, they are in many cases adopted in legislation, and they make for the wellbeing of this community.
These bills deal with the appropriation of the money that is taken from the people, in effect, to pay for a whole variety of government services—and that is right. Any decent community will see that services are provided by government—by parliament—because, unless those services are provided, our wellbeing will be very much impaired. So it is very important to see that that money is collected and that people do pay what they should pay as citizens. But once that has been paid, once that money has been collected, it is very important that it be spent in a way that helps us all as members of the community.
There is a perception—and again, if you look at it, this perception is correct—that the distribution of resources in this community is not as good as it should be. I do not know whether this ill distribution of resources has become more marked since you left the union movement, Mr Acting Deputy President George Campbell. If it has, you owe the people a bigger obligation while you are in here to ensure that that balance is in some way restored. There are all sorts of arguments that prevent us from doing that. 
We have the fear that, if we tax companies, for example, companies will go overseas. They might. But, in the end, if we have this fear and we are not willing to take on large corporations, we get less resources into the community so that the community as a whole can enjoy them. We will get less than we should and we will get the sorts of results that we have had, and which I have talked about today with HIH Insurance. We have to look at these powerful forces through which the economy is conducted and our corporations are, in most cases, conducted magnificently. We need to remember that it is the wellbeing of the community rather than the theory of economic purity that counts.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-03-29,"—Today we are discussing the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001. As one would know, the appropriation bills give honourable senators an opportunity to discuss virtually anything that is in the realm of federal government and national politics in particular. Therefore, I sought to speak today because I—like many other people in this country—am getting very tired and somewhat angered at the way in which the Labor opposition is now simply exploiting everything that happens in the most vicious and downright dishonourable way. I want to look at issues today such as fuel, child care, pensions, the BAS and aged care—there are so many areas. Unfortunately, I have only 20 minutes in which to do so. Had I had longer, I am sure that I would be able to go much further into where the dishonesty and the deception is being perpetrated on the Australian people. 
We hear—and we heard it even last night—that the Labor Party are going to refuse the retrospective indexation for beer excise. It is just unbelievable. This comes from a party that, when in government, continued to increase excise at the most phenomenal rate. They do not care what they do to the bottom line of the budget of this government. Similarly, they did not care what they did to the bottom line of their own budgets. That is why we were left with a $10 billion, $11 billion or $12 billion deficit when Mr Beazley left us the chequebook.
We will be confronted in the next few days with the Labor Party, who had the most disgraceful economic record in government, making a further dent in somebody else's budget. They are not content to do it to just their own; they have to do it to another government's budget. One can only ask: how irresponsible is that? The people of Australia have to say, `If that is what they are prepared to do to another government's budget to try and win a few quick, cheap votes, what are they going to do to their own budgets to do likewise?' 
It is the same with the fuel excise. They have bleated long and loud and hard about how obscene and absurd the indexation on fuel excise is. As I said in this place a few weeks ago, it is their excise. They are the ones who introduced it and they are the ones who increased it to the tune of 450 per cent while they were in government. They are the ones who increased it to the point where it was costing Australian motorists $3.7 million a day. And yet one would think, from listening to the current debate and the current utterances from the Labor Party, that they had no truck whatsoever with fuel excise—that they had no truck with automatic indexation. That is not so. At no stage did they ever seek to do what the current government is now doing: freezing it on fuel and removing it forever. They just increased it by 450 per cent.
As I say, the Labor Party introduced fuel excise indexation in August 1983. The way in which that grew is just amazing. At that stage in 1983, excise was 6.155c per litre. When the Labor Party walked out 13 years later, with the books well and truly in the red to the tune of $11 billion to $12 billion, the excise had gone from 6.155c per litre to 34.183c per litre. I hardly think it is fair for the opposition to go out on the airwaves of this country and pretend that they have clean hands on the subject of fuel excise indexation. The situation is quite the reverse. Do you know what they have done ever since the government's announcement that the government was going to remove that indexation? They have complained about it.
I want to focus on Labor's record of the number of times they sought to increase excise over and above the inflation adjustment. I have already said that it was increased by 450 per cent but, worse than that—if you could possibly get anything worse than that—on five separate occasions the former Labor government sought, and managed, to increase the fuel excise over and above the inflation adjustment. That was after they had promised they would not do so. It is a bit like the tax cuts of 1993, isn't it? If I remember rightly, it was about the end of 1992 that the coalition released its Fightback package, and contained within that package were substantial tax cuts. 
The then Keating-Beazley government came rushing into the parliament with proposed tax cuts, trying to match the coalition's promise. They rushed them in, got them through and then Mr Beazley went running out there to talk about the tax cuts they would be delivering if they won the 1993 election. We will all remember forever the way in which Mr Beazley described those tax cuts: l-a-w. What happened after the 1993 election, after the total Fightback package had been completely and utterly misrepresented in every way possible? Mr Beazley came into the parliament and said, `Sorry, the l-a-w tax cuts are no longer l-a-w because we can't afford them.' We knew they could not afford them in the first place, but that did not stop the deception.
We are seeing the same type of deception here on a daily basis. On no occasion did they ever compensate motorists for the CPI indexation or for the discretionary increases in fuel excise—never. There were never any tax cuts associated with them. They said, `We'll just jack up taxes or jack up all the wholesale sales taxes that we've abolished. We'll forget about that; they've all gone. We'll jack them up to the 10 per cent level, the 30 per cent level and the 40-odd per cent level—we'll jack them all up,' which they did. Did they ever give a tax cut commensurate with those tax increases? Never. Not once. I think the following figures help to show the picture even more clearly: for instance, the former Labor government petrol tax hikes in 1993 raised an extra $3.7 million a day, from the time they increased it to the time they were kicked out of office in 1996.
It is also very hypocritical of Mr Beazley to publicly bemoan the pain of motorists when it is they who opposed the original fuel cuts that the coalition proposed with the introduction of the new tax system. I have lost count, as everyone would have, of the number of times the Labor Party have said, `You promised that fuel wouldn't go up in price as a result of the new tax system.' It is just like the parrot sitting on the fence. Yet it was they who actually voted against it. It is thanks to the Democrats that those cuts actually went ahead. I would be hanging my head in shame if I were a member of this opposition going out there and blatantly misinforming the people of Australia. Why aren't they going out there and saying, `We actually voted to keep your fuel prices higher'? Additionally, they are blaming this government for decisions that are made in Vienna. Excuse me, but I thought that federal parliament was sitting in Canberra, not in Vienna! So if OPEC decides to cut the production of oil, thus pushing up the price of oil, somehow this government is responsible! It just defies logic but, more importantly, it defies any degree of honesty.
I would like to turn to the issue of pensioners because, equally, that defies any degree of honesty. Every day of the week we have someone coming in here to talk about the poor pensioners being short-changed by the coalition government. Once again, let us look at what the Labor government did in comparison with what this government has done: the Labor government increased indirect taxes. It did not matter whether it was the excise level on fuel going up—and pensioners, would you believe, actually use fuel. It did not matter whether it was the increase in wholesale sales taxes—and pensioners actually paid wholesale sales tax; they might not have been too aware of what they paid but they paid levels of up to 40 per cent. The Labor government continually increased those taxes, just to name a few. Prices would then go up, the CPI would then be calculated and, retrospectively, the Labor government would then give pensioners a rise in line with the CPI, but they would not pay it retrospectively. So it was calculated after the increases, when the pensioners had had to pay the increased amount, and then they would be paid the amount from then on—after the calculation, not from the time of the increase.
Let us look at the contrast. When this government brought in the new tax system, it paid compensation up front, before any increases, and continues to pay compensation two per cent ahead of inflation. If some of the people who purport to speak for pensioner groups—and admittedly they are not all pensioners, because some of them realise they are being used as political pawns in this exercise—put aside their political proclivities and their blind support of the Labor Party and actually started telling the truth, then they would understand that the group known as `pensioners', whatever pension they might be on, are in fact better off today than they ever were under 13 years of Labor. Again, I am only speaking in this debate in the chamber today because I am so frustrated and annoyed at the dishonesty with which Her Majesty's opposition is treating the people of Australia. Pensioners, as I said, got an indexation increase on 2 March 2001 and there was a two per cent adjustment to the CPI indexation around that time to allow for the July 2000 advance. But, as we see in a whole range of areas, this vulnerable group of Australians are being used, frightened and terrified about their future so a political party can try and force them into support based on a set of lies. That is just appalling behaviour.
I was talking to a lady in my office this morning about politics in general. I said, `One thing I used to be able to do prior to 1996 was to say to schoolchildren that, no matter what you see on television from the bearpit of question time, that does not reflect what is happening in the chambers later on in the day or, more particularly, in committee deliberations, because people actually stop and think about what is best for the country and all political parties come together to try and achieve what is best for the country.' I can no longer go to schoolchildren and say that. Since this government has been office, and more particularly since this opposition has been the opposition, the goodwill has gone. Every single solitary committee inquiry is politicised. Even legislation that the opposition has already voted for in one chamber is politicised in this chamber and sent off to an inquiry and misrepresented. It is an appalling standard when people cannot go out and say that Her Majesty's opposition are prepared to get the best outcome for the people of Australia. It is not happening—everything is now politicised, misrepresented and plainly lied about. That is just disgusting. No longer is the truth told by this opposition.
Let us have a look at the issue of child care. They have been saying for some years now that the number of child-care places has fallen. They have not: 151,300 child-care places have been created since June 1996. There is a record number of 700,000 children in care. And, since July 2000, fees for child-care centres are down 15 per cent. Yet the Labor Party constantly come in here and say that we have increased the cost of child care. Not only is that dishonest on one score, it is dishonest on two: (1) the fees have gone down by 15 per cent and (2) the government do not set the fees; the centres set the fees. Here we have the opposition coming in here and saying there are fewer child-care places. There are not—there are over 151,000 more child-care places than there were when we came into government. We have had a 15 per cent reduction in fees and the opposition blame this government, who do not set the fees, for increasing them. Somewhere along the line this dishonesty has to be challenged. I hope that somewhere, some time, between now and the election, the opposition will be seriously questioned not only about the policies they clearly do not have—
 (Senator Bartlett)—Excuse me, Senator, I have been asked if you would mind continuing your remarks later so that a minister can table something before the lunch break.
—Can I finish my sentence? I only have two minutes to go.
—We have only a few seconds to go before lunch and the tabling needs to be done before then.
—I just want this opposition to be seriously challenged on policy and to be forced to start explaining why they are deceiving the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2001-03-29,"—On 26 February of this year the Senate passed a return to order motion seeking the tabling by no later than 4 p.m. 27 March 2001 of documents relating to the listing of the drugs celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the appointment of the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee announced by the Minister for Health and Aged Care on 1 February 2001.
Yesterday in the chamber the documents requested by the motion in relation to celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) were tabled. I now table the documents relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Honourable senators should note that the only documents that are not being released in part or in full are: those that are cabinet in confidence, personal information such as the private addresses and contact details of individuals or information forming part of the deliberative processes of government the release of which would be contrary to the public interest.",SENATE,<title>PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS ADVISORY COMMITTEE</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-03-29,"—The opposition will be supporting the Remuneration Tribunal Amendment Bill 2000. The bill will establish a more rigorous framework for the classification and remuneration of public sector principal executive offices. It gives an expanded role to both the Remuneration Tribunal and the Minister for Finance and Administration. The minister is given the powers to: create principal executive offices by declaration; declare the employing body at a classification band or level in the principal executive office classification structure to which the office will be assigned; set the commencing remuneration for the office; and assign an office into a particular classification temporarily and/or identify a level of commencing remuneration which is person specific. 
We note that before exercising any of these powers the minister must seek advice from the Remuneration Tribunal and take that advice into account, and that all ministerial declarations are to be published in the Gazette. The Remuneration Tribunal's role in this process is enhanced by allowing the tribunal to make recommendations to the minister on the classification and commencing remuneration to apply to which principal executive office and specifying that the employing body of a principal executive office may determine terms and conditions for the office only in a manner that is consistent with the Remuneration Tribunal's classification structure for principal executive officers or in accordance with specific written advice received from the tribunal. 
Currently, it is the Governor-General who has the power to create a principal executive office by regulation and the Remuneration Tribunal which determines a classification structure for principal executive officers. But neither have the power to determine the level of remuneration. This is done by the governing board of the employing body. We consider the measures set out in this bill to be an improvement on the current system. We note that the arrangements for transparency and accountability are similar to those that the opposition agreed to in the context of the Public Service Bill for determining the remuneration of secretaries to government departments.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-03-29,"—I thank Senator Bishop for his short and succinct contribution. The Remuneration Tribunal Amendment Bill 2000 clarifies the respective roles of the tribunal and the responsible minister, currently the Minister for Finance and Administration, in relation to principal executive offices. The bill amends the Remuneration Tribunal's role relating to principal executive offices by allowing the Remuneration Tribunal to make recommendations to the minister on the classification and commencing remuneration to apply to each principal executive officer, specifying that the employing body of a principal executive office may determine terms and conditions for the officer only in a manner that is consistent with the Remuneration Tribunal's classification structure for principal executive officers or in accordance with the specific written advice received from the Remuneration Tribunal and allowing for transitional arrangements for offices that were declared by regulation to be a principal executive office before the drafting of this bill commenced. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2001-03-29,"—I rise today to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001. I would like to turn our attention to the lack of government spending on health care and, in particular, on health care in rural and remote areas of Australia. There needs to be much more government spending on rural and remote health care. That can be seen by the regular reports in the media and the regular complaints to our office by those living in remote areas about the lack of services they have and the lack of amenities for the doctors who, in decreasing numbers, are going to the outback, to regional and rural areas and to regional cities to practise their profession. The rural areas have a number of barriers in relation to health care and the money needs to be directed at those barriers. 
The programs that are being run by regional medical centres do not equate to those programs of care that can be run in major cities and in metropolitan areas. There are a number of reasons for this, including the tyranny of distance, the great expense and the time that is required to travel for those in the non-metropolitan areas. It is difficult for us to understand some of these problems when we live in areas that are well serviced by general practitioners and, indeed, when we have ready access to specialist care. Those in outlying areas do not have this, and it is not necessarily just country towns that I am referring to, as some major cities within some states do not have adequate health care and specialist care for their citizens.
From the information available to us from the medical profession itself, we see that two-thirds of the GPs in country areas practise as solo practitioners. They find it particularly difficult to attract locums who can give them adequate relief from the work that they are undertaking. It was not too long ago that some of us attended a breakfast where we were addressed by the AMA. At that breakfast we were advised that it was not only the rural areas that were finding it difficult to attract locums but also major city practices. As I said earlier, I really want to concentrate on the difficulties that are confronted by the regions.
—You are better on industrial relations.
—We may address that at some future time, Senator. We are talking here about something that is particularly important to people who live in regions, and I would think that the good senator opposite, as he pretends to be one who cares for country people, would understand that. 
The difficulties that we face in South Australia, my home state, are compounded by the vast distances that are travelled by patients to see professional medical practitioners—that is, the specialist services—and on occasions to see GPs. People from the Aboriginal community in the Pit lands do not have very much in the way of medical care at all. They are serviced by the Flying Doctor Service, which is reasonably well funded, but it cannot be everywhere all the time. It can only do some of those things that need to be done to treat those living in areas such as the Pit lands and in other outlying communities.
Let us have a look at some of the situations that face those living in communities that are much larger and have well serviced hospitals but do not have doctors to practise in them. For example, Roxby Downs is a new town with a good population and with people on good incomes, but it faces a crisis. The Advertiser on 14 February this year said:
Mothers in Roxby Downs, Ceduna and Meningie are the first affected in what the Australian Medical Association says could be the beginning of a rural crisis in obstetrics.
It went on to say:
Roxby Downs has 150 pregnant women who will have to leave the mining town soon to have their babies because obstetric services have been suspended until a doctor with anaesthetics skills can be recruited to the region. Roxby Downs mother-of-three Rachel Lange ... has had to travel large distances for the births of each of her three children.
That situation is common throughout regional South Australia. It is a common practice—to travel to a capital city to have a child—for those living in places like Roxby Downs and Ceduna, and in the south-east and in the Mallee. Without adequate funding and without adequate incentives for doctors with the necessary skills to go to remote areas, we are correct to assume that we are facing a crisis of medical services in non-metropolitan Australia. And this situation is not unique to South Australia; it is reflected in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. It is a situation that we should be ashamed of.
But some of the problems we have go beyond the patients alone having to travel to see their medical carers. Consideration has to be given to the difficulties facing the medical profession if they make that choice to move to a regional or remote area. They too are faced with tyranny of distance. They are faced with isolation from their peers. We could say to them, `Pick up the telephone, it is not particularly difficult.' That is right, but any call they make is STD, which is an added cost to their practice. And these practices are those where the doctor, the general practitioner, is a family doctor and their skills requirements go beyond those of general practitioners' duties of looking to see whether you have got a cold, a broken leg, a broken arm or whatever it may be. They need to have a clear understanding of the psychological make-up of the human being as well.
My understanding is that that is not taught in any depth at medical school. I am not a medical practitioner, have not attempted to pursue such a career and in fact would be quite awful at it if I did. But country doctors are spending more time dealing with the difficulties of the mind than the difficulties of the body—something that they are trained for. And so they have a small community, they have fewer patients than those doctors practising in the city, and they do not have access to the professional care of psychologists and psychiatrists, physiotherapists and other specialists. They have to do it themselves, and there is a greater call today on the community for these counselling type services from the family doctor in the country than ever before. With the downturn in the economy, with less country employment available and with the sheer isolation of so many people, the doctor is the one who is leaned upon to provide some relief in body and mind.
But the doctors in these communities, if they decide to go to them, have to face the fact that their income cannot be as great as it would be in the city—and that is understandable for most people—because their clientele or their patient numbers will be much less and will be more isolated and their practice will include more travel for both parties to have care provided.
The doctors, to get their skills upgraded, need to be conscious all of the time of how they will do that when they cannot get a locum to relieve them, and yet the country doctors are continually called upon to provide those additional services. Doctors need to have regular retraining and training in a greater number of skills within their profession. We know, from the report I referred to, that we have a crisis in South Australia and, I suggest, elsewhere in relation to obstetrics. Larger cities like Port Pirie, Port Lincoln, Port Augusta and Mount Gambier are also not immune from having a need to send pregnant women to Adelaide for the delivery of a child. And what do we do about that? It is the total disruption to the family of having to leave for that type of care that needs to be considered. And unless the money is directed to providing services to assist in this area, we stand damned for our lack of attention.
The government cannot run away from its lack of care in this field. The government is responsible and the government cannot say that it has done enough to stem the crisis that exists today. If we continue with the report from the Advertiser of 14 February, Mrs Lange went on to say that having a baby by leaving your home might be manageable for the first child, but almost impossible when you have more than one child to care for.
It does become particularly difficult, because in small communities there are no child-care facilities. Quite often a young family are living isolated from their parents. They do not have other family members in the community and they do not have sufficient people to look after the family while they are absent. Take the case of Mrs Lange in Roxby Downs: if she has a husband working there it might not be practicable for him to take time off work so that she can go to Adelaide and he can stay there and look after the other children. It might not be practicable for him to take time off work as annual leave. He might not have that provision available to him at the time. So you have mother and newborn child in one city, and you have the remainder of the family, disrupted somewhat, living in isolation in the country, or someone has to take time off without an income to take the whole family to the capital city to get care.
We also have a crisis in these regional areas with the older generation, those who are looking at nursing home care. They, too, need specialised services as they get older. Many older people like to retire to small rural communities or to beach or coastal communities where they do not even have a doctor, and they need to travel large distances to see their doctor. But what occurs? As one lady from the Yorke Peninsula only last week said to me, `What happens if my car breaks down? I do not have a doctor here. How do I get to my doctor, which is 80 kilometres hence?' She is 87 years old and lives in Ardrossan. So you have that crisis looming on our doorstep as well, all because there is a lack of forethought into how we deal with what is now a known crisis in regional health care. The government has not addressed the issue of attracting doctors and retaining doctors away from capital city situations. Something has to be done so that the doctors who practise in those areas can get fair recompense for the work that they do, so that they can get access readily to their peers and to professional training through universities and other sources, and so that they can better serve the communities in which they live.
This government has not addressed those problems. This government seems to think that, if you live on the eastern seaboard or in one of the other capital cities, you are okay, but if you do not, you have to look after yourself. Doctors will not go to a country area when they know that their income will be lower—and who can blame them?—when they know that they cannot get access to training, and when they know that they cannot have regular contact with their peers. I do not blame them for one moment. These doctors do need incentive, and it is the government's responsibility to develop that incentive for them so that all of Australia can have equal health care and all Australians can be proud of the work that they are doing.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-03-29,"—This set of appropriation bills—Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001—provides us with an excellent opportunity to scorecard the coalition government's economic performance and in particular to look at the so-called famous strength of this government, which is meant to be their economic management. Since 1996, when the coalition got into government, they have traded on what they believe are their strong economic credentials. How often have we heard the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talk up this government's economic performance? For instance, in a speech to the Liberal Party Federal Convention on 15 April 2000 the Prime Minister had this to say:
We are now experiencing the longest period of continual economic growth since the 1960s... And ... in this environment it is important particularly for the Liberal Party as it quite properly focuses on the goals it has in Government. There is a need to remind ourselves of the need for ongoing economic reform.
Again, around about the same time, the Treasurer was saying on ABC television:
I see an economy which is exceptionally strong. The last growth figures showed we're still growing at about 4 per cent. Since the Government was elected, we've averaged 4 per cent growth per year... If you continued for the next four years with growth at 4 per cent and you got jobs growing at about 2 per cent per annum, you would eat into Australia's unemployment. We ought to try and grow at 4 per cent per annum. If we did that, we could provide jobs for people who wanted to work. Now that's going to take a lot of good policy. And 4 per cent per annum would mean we'd probably have to be about the strongest performing economy in the world, but we were the strongest performing economy in the world, at 4 per cent per annum, over the last three years.
Isn't it interesting how times have changed? Economic hardship, born from poor economic management, is costing them electoral support all over the place. We have seen the Western Australian election, we have seen the Queensland election and we have seen the by-election in the seat of Ryan. Executive salaries may be increasing, but in rural and regional Australia, for working Australia, for Howard's so-called battlers, life is very different. Now the government's precious economic credentials have virtually evaporated before their own eyes.
The last period of negative economic growth—minus 0.6 per cent of GDP—has certainly blown out of the water those meagre credentials and claims of good economic management. So much for the Treasurer's goal of four per cent growth per year for the next three years. We, in fact, are going backwards. On the government's own growth scorecard, they are already failing the exam. The cause, as we all know, is the GST and the petrol excise, a goods and services tax which this government introduced and which has become a baseball bat on the economy. It is no coincidence that a downturn in the housing sector and in construction, the reduction in consumer spending, the building up of business inventories and the drop in business confidence surveys are the first areas affected by the GST. Meanwhile, small businesses are going to the wall while this government ignores their pleas.
Business investment shows that, since the GST came in, capital expenditure fell by 5.2 per cent in the December quarter, with plant and equipment falling 3.6 per cent and buildings and structures falling 10.5 per cent. The average annual growth in business investment has now fallen to minus five per cent. Compare this with Labor's performance. In the last three years of the Labor government, business investment was at 15 per cent. Business investment in plant and equipment has fallen in the last eight out of 12 quarters. Business expectations are very gloomy. Applying the five-year realisation ratio to the fifth estimate for 2001 implies a nominal decrease in new private capital expenditure of 4.7 per cent in 2000-01. In the construction sector, building work done in Australia fell by 10.2 per cent in December. For the year 2000-01, it has fallen by 23.6 per cent. This is the biggest annual decline since the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was the Treasurer in 1983. Back to the future!
What do the Prime Minister and the Treasurer now say about their economic performance? They say, `It's not so bad; things could be worse,' which is akin to saying, `You should always look on the bright side of life.' We should be singing the song Always look on the bright side of life to the Australian community. Prime Minister Howard stated on the Today show that they were:
... continuing to provide this country with good Government. And in a year when economic management will be more challenging than it has been for the past two or three years ...providing an experienced group of people to manage those economic challenges a lot more effectively than our opponents.
The Prime Minister makes it sound like the deterioration in the economic performance is an accident. The reality is that this so-called group of economic managers in this government engineered these challenging economic times by implementing the GST and whacking a petrol excise on top of it. What does the Treasurer have to say about these economic tough times? I quote:
I think the picture of the Australian economy is slowing as we forecast it would. It is still growing at rates which years ago we would have thought were exceptionally high.
This is head-in-the-sand stuff. This so-called slowdown is very different from the midyear economic performance forecasts. It is a quarter of negative economic growth. This government has traded on its economic credentials and now finds that these credentials are in tatters.
The government's economic mismanagement is far worse across the board. It is worth going back and comparing the tradition of economic mismanagement that Howard has brought to this country with other governments. The PM talks up his government's credentials on the budget outcome, which delivered a series of surpluses at the expense of funding to universities and a raft of other programs that help keep us competitive in a global economy. But we should not forget that, when the PM was Treasurer in the outgoing Fraser government in 1983, he left Labor with a massive budget deficit of minus 3.4 per cent of GDP. When the now Prime Minister Howard left government as Treasurer of this country in 1983, he left Labor a $6.8 billion deficit, which on 1998-99 figures is in the region of $12 billion. Only two years earlier the budget was in surplus to the tune of $0.9 billion. And he calls himself a good economic manager! People should not forget to look at his performance when he was the Treasurer and at the state he left the economy in when he was thrown out of office in 1983. This government's memory, conveniently, cannot get beyond the period of 1991. 
Now a new trend is emerging. With the introduction of the GST and all the problems with the petrol excise, this is now the biggest taxing government in Australia's economic history. In the words of Max Walsh, in the Bulletin, on 13 March 2001:
By the time Costello brings down his budget, we will see that Howard not only is the largest taxer in history but also the biggest spender.
In Treasurer Costello's first budget he increased the Medicare levy and he imposed a 15 per cent  surcharge on superannuation contributions, which discourages savings but does provide money for the government's coffers. Then came the GST and 10 per cent on everything but basic foods. And on top of that came the fuel excise windfall creating a GST feedback each time it was indexed for inflation, the end result being that the Howard government is the biggest taxer ever with total taxes amounting to 32 per cent of GDP in comparison to PM Keating's period of 29 per cent of GDP and the period under Prime Minister Hawke when it was 27 per cent of GDP.
They have been frittering away money all over the place, knowing that the economy's downturn is going to have an impact on their budget outcome but pretending that it is simply not happening. And what do we see in the current circumstances? We see a Prime Minister who just wants to keep on spending in order to buy himself votes and will do anything to hold on to the trappings of power: $140 million on petrol excise relief; $500 million on defence; flood relief; $159 million on innovation policy; $30 million, $60 million and $90 million on the Alice to Darwin railroad; calls for changes to the BAS—of which we do not know at this stage the financial impact; the Centenary of Federation slush fund; advertising awareness campaigns on the BAS; increasing the housing rebate for first home buyers; an ineffective Tough on Drugs publicity campaign; and the private health insurance rebate. And the list goes on and on.
That is a cut to the MYEFO forward estimates of something in the order of half their forecast, an underlying surplus of which was to be around $2 billion to $2.5 billion. What happens then if the economy continues on its downward trend? They raise this revenue, the result being that we will effectively, I think, see that the surplus has been halved again and that by the end of this financial year we will be looking at a surplus of around $1 billion to $1.5 billion. That is not good economic management. That is economic incompetence. That is absolute economic incompetence by this government.
Let us look at some other areas. Let us look at the issue of debt and foreign debt. Turning to indebtedness and foreign debt, Prime Minister Howard has had a long and chequered history with his performance scorecard. When he left government as Treasurer back in 1983 the current account deficit was minus 3.5 per cent and net foreign debt was 7.4 per cent. He had helped blow this debt out by increasing Commonwealth general government net debt in his years as Treasurer from one per cent of GDP up to 7.9 per cent of GDP when they were thrown out of office. And now foreign debt has hit an all-time record under the Howard government. It is $301 billion and has risen nearly 60 per cent since Peter Costello became Treasurer.
In the nation's first 95 years since Federation foreign debt rose by $190 billion. Just five years on to the Howard government and Treasurer Costello has added nearly 60 per cent to that. And who can forget the debt truck? Who can forget the coalition partners, when they were in opposition, taking around this country the debt truck, parading it around the nation at that particular time? And what did Prime Minister Howard say about the debt truck at that time? In a speech to the Real Estate Institute on 17 October 1985 he had this to say:
The debt truck has helped heighten in the eyes of the Australian community the link between our level of overseas debt and the high level of interest rates ... obviously if one has to borrow money from a situation where one is already in debt, when one is heavily mortgaged ... obviously one is going to be charged a premium ... The same thing applies for a nation.
Under the Howard government's economic management that debt truck has become a road train and it is now parked in the driveway of every household in this nation.
In 1995 Treasurer Costello, then in opposition, estimated that foreign debt accounted for $10,000 for each man, woman and child. That was on the World Today on 30 August 1995. Using the Treasurer's own formula, today's figures have increased the debt burden on every man, woman and child in this country to $15,696. Under Treasurer Costello, credit card debt is up nearly 160 per cent, and Australian households on average now owe more than they earn, with gross household debt to gross income now over 100 per cent. Meanwhile, the household savings ratio has fallen to its lowest level ever, at 2.2 per cent. 
Prime Minister Howard has talked up his government's credentials on inflation, but the GST has seen inflation leap in the last two economic quarters. In the September quarter 2001, inflation had jumped to 6.1 per cent, and the December quarter followed this up with a 5.8 per cent increase. What is more, this government has engineered its inflation spike and then profited from it—again, the massive petrol excise windfall. Only after the electoral backlash that has occurred has the government attempted to try to do something about that. Prime Minister Howard has a long history on inflation. When he was Treasurer in the Fraser government, inflation leapt up to 16 per cent, and by the end of the Fraser government it was still 11.5 per cent. Throughout that period inflation averaged 10.3 per cent. Compare this with the entire period of the Labor government, when inflation averaged 5.2 per cent and was down to 1.8 per cent by the late 1990s.
I will now turn to employment and the government's scorecard in this area. It is clear that it is another F for fail for the coalition in this area. We can safely say that employment growth has been far worse under the coalition than in the last three years of the Labor government. The average growth in employment under the coalition has been 1.79 per cent. Compare that to the last three years under Labor, when it grew at something like 3.1 per cent. Average monthly job creation under the coalition has been 12,875, while under the last three years of Labor it was 20,273. And what has the GST done for employment growth? It has killed it. The year-on-year employment growth rate peaked at 3.7 per cent in July 2000 and, since the GST was introduced, it has fallen to 1.6 per cent in the latest figures that were available in February this year. What about employment growth when Prime Minister Howard was the last Treasurer in the Fraser government? His performance then was even worse, at 0.7 per cent. Compare that to the entire period of the Hawke-Keating governments, when employment grew on average 2.2 per cent over 13 years. But Prime Minister Howard has never been good at creating jobs and keeping people in the work force. When he was Treasurer, the labour force participation was the lowest it had been since 1975, at 61.2 per cent.  
But let us move on and have a look at the exchange rate. What can you say about the Australian dollar, except that it is only worth US49.7c? I think that was what it was when we were putting these figures together.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Where is it at the moment? It could be even lower. When the Howard government came to power the dollar was around US73c. So what does Treasurer Costello think about the falling Australian dollar? On 30 January 1996, when the dollar was worth US74c, he said:
A falling Australian dollar reduces living standards by making imports more expensive—we have to export greater quantities of goods and services to acquire any given amount of imports. With each fall of the Australian dollar Australians have to work longer and harder to acquire any given amount of imports.
And what did he say when the dollar was worth US71c on 30 June 1995? He said:
A nation's currency is a mark of how strong its economy is perceived in international markets. In international markets the mark that has been given to our currency and to this Prime Minister's economic management is a fail, an absolute fail.
Now that the Australian dollar is below US50c, we no longer hear the Treasurer making any comments. He is strangely silent on the issue. No more do we see the breast beating about what he has done for our economy and the value of our currency. You cannot even get him to comment. If US71c is a failure for the Australian currency, how do you rate a currency that is running at less than 50c in the dollar? Treasurer Costello should not even qualify to get into a mathematics class in an ordinary primary school, let alone be allowed to continue as the Treasurer of this country.
The reality is that this government has failed as an economic manager. Its scorecard is a disaster when you do an effective comparison. It is the biggest taxing government in the history of this country. It has failed on the issue of growth; it has failed on the issue of investment; it has failed on the issue of debt, particularly foreign debt; it has failed on employment growth; it has failed on inflation; and it has failed to measure up to its claim of being good economic managers of this country.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-03-29,"—These appropriation bills give me and my colleagues the opportunity to highlight some of the impacts of the federal government's policies on constituents in this country. I want to particularly concentrate my comments on what has been happening in the Northern Territory. In writing a few points for this contribution, I tried to think of what had happened since 1996 when this government first came into office, and I could not think of one significant contribution or outcome that the federal government has delivered for the Northern Territory. When the election is called before the end of this year, there is not one particular item—not one particular infrastructure or any one particular project—that this government has achieved in this time.
—What about the railway?
—Senator Patterson asks about the railway. Well, what about it? Many years ago, then Prime Minister Hawke offered to contribute $600 million, which the CLP government in the Northern Territory rejected. At the last federal election, the opposition offered to contribute up to $300 million towards the railway. The railway is a bipartisan product, if you are not aware of that, and your comments indicate to me that you are not aware of it. There has not been one thing that this government has singularly contributed to the worth of the Territory. The only thing that the Northern Territory was promised out of last year's budget was a detention centre for migrants. We have been told, `It's still on the drawing board, and yet to be realised.' Was there ever a case that we needed a migrant detention centre in Darwin? I do not think so.
Let us turn to the GST. We were told that the GST would not have a significant impact on the economy. As we know, the GST has had a significant impact on the Australian economy and, in particular, the Territory economy. Unfortunately, that impact has been mainly negative—so negative that Australia appears to be heading into a GST induced recession. It should be pointed out that this is not Labor talking down the Australian economy but a verifiable fact. This federal government is single-handedly responsible for this.
The GST was always going to hit Territorians hard. It was an issue that Labor had predicted and campaigned hard on at the last election. The Territorians suspected they would be hit hard; that is why 52 per cent of them voted against the GST at the last election. Why did they do that? Because the GST is a retail tax calculated on top of the price of the goods being sold or the service being delivered. The Northern Territory, like many other parts of rural and regional Australia, already had a cost of living that was higher than in urban centres. 
You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realise that higher prices for goods and services would mean a 10 per cent GST would impact disproportionately on those people paying the higher prices. We warned people about that, but the Territory's own CLP government and its CLP senator, my colleague Grant Tambling, welcomed the GST with open arms. That is something that I know the voters will not forget come the elections this year. So what has the GST meant to Territorians?
We were promised all sorts of things. We were promised that it would give us a higher standard of living. We were also promised that the GST would result in cheaper fuel prices, which would indirectly mean lower food prices in the Territory given, we were told, that transport costs were a contributing factor to the high cost of our food. And we were told that the transport costs would reduce with a flow-on effect to our food and goods being reduced because there would be a reduced cost in the price of diesel. Well, there has not been; in fact, diesel fuel has gone up since 1 July last year, not been reduced.
Since the introduction of the GST almost eight months ago the issue of fuel prices has been a major contributing factor to the increase in the cost of living for Territorians. They have been calling for relief from the excessively high petrol prices during this time. It is true that a reason for those higher prices was what happened to the world price of oil, but what is also undeniable is that the other reason petrol prices were forced up more than they needed to be was that this government broke a promise in relation to the GST. This promise said the GST will not put up the price of petrol.
Let me turn to an interview of my colleague Senator Tambling and Fred McCue on the 8DDD morning program of 12 April 2000. This is the initial interview in which my colleague Senator Tambling had a bet with the ABC presenter. He bet a carton of beer that the price of fuel would not rise under the GST.
—Really?
—That is right, Senator Mackay. Guess what? He lost the bet at the end of the day, but we will get to that. He was a little bit uncertain at the start of this interview. First of all, he said that they need not rise and that he would be very surprised if that happened—that is what he said in the start of the interview. When pressed a little later by Fred McCue—and Fred asked, `So you are not willing to say that they will not rise under the GST?'—Senator Tambling said, `Oh, hang on, they won't rise because of the GST'. We are talking about fuel prices here. Then towards the end of the interview he said, `There will not be any effect of GST in petrol in our area.' It was in that interview that he bet Fred a carton of beer that the price of fuel would not rise after 1 July.
—Beer has gone up as a result as well.
—Guess what, if he ever does decide to give Fred his carton of beer—and I do not think he has actually done that yet—he will probably pay even more. That is right, Senator Mackay. He should have bought his carton of beer back in April and he would have got out of the bet a lot cheaper than if he paid up now, but he lost the bet. He significantly lost that bet. Further, the Treasurer said that the government would ensure that the excise on petrol would fall by the equivalent amount of what the GST would go up by.
But what happened when the government implemented this so-called policy? Following the announcement during the last federal election campaign which was that the price of petrol would not go up due to the GST, the Howard government said that they would reduce the excise by an equivalent amount. Let us look at what happened, particularly in relation to the Northern Territory. The GST put the price of petrol up 8.2c per litre, but the excise was reduced by only 6.7c a litre; so 1½c is being pocketed on every litre of petrol that is sold every day, every week and every month of the year in this country. But let me remind people that the calculation of the 6.7c a litre was not based on any price at the bowser in the Northern Territory; it was based on a Sydney pump price. So already people in the Northern Territory were at an immediate disadvantage and were misled by this government.
There has been a windfall for the government on this that was not budgeted for. Our argument always was that the relief should be given on petrol without affecting the budget because it was a figure never budgeted for. This was not a hit to the budget; it was a windfall that should have been given back to the Australian motorist. But the windfall does not stop there. Every time the cost of fuel increases, the government pockets one-eleventh of it. Why? Because the GST is a retail tax, as I said earlier. The excise tax used to be a flat rate, but the GST is a retail tax, so if the price goes above what the government was projecting, there is another windfall.
I should point out the petrol prices in the Territory. We are paying over $1 for a litre of unleaded fuel in Darwin, around $1.08 in Alice Springs and about $1.25 at Ti Tree, which is about 250 kilometres north of Alice Springs; but the doozey is Bathurst Island, where fuel costs around $1.80 a litre. People in Sydney at the moment who are paying around 90c a litre are actually paying half of what they are paying on Bathurst Island. So an excise reduction which was calculated at a Sydney pump price and which delivered a reduction of 6.7c a litre is not much good for people living on Bathurst Island or even for those living in Alice Springs or Ti Tree at this time. Meanwhile, there has not been any reduction in the differential in the cost of fuel between rural and regional Australia and urban Australia. So are we seeing this government treating petrol prices in a place like Bathurst Island any different to in Sydney? The answer is an emphatic no. So that is petrol.
Let us have a look at groceries. As a mother of four who sometimes shops more than once a week in the local supermarket, I have found that food prices have definitely not fallen. The price of food for Territorians was already substantially higher than for other people living in urban Australia. This evidence has been repeatedly demonstrated in this chamber, and no more so than from the Northern Territory government's own department of health survey about the price of fuel and the impact of the GST. I presented evidence from that survey in this chamber about two years ago.
Australia wide, the price of a trolley of groceries has risen sharply under the GST, and tax experts expect the bill will continue to grow. A report in last Sunday's Sun-Herald highlighted the impact of the GST on the cost of food, which is increasing. As their report showed, a trolley load of about 60 items, based on the same categories used to calculate the consumer price index, had increased in price by nearly $7.00 compared to a year ago. Ray Regan from the National Tax and Accountants Association said that, while major supermarkets had initially absorbed GST prices to avoid losing customers, they were now gradually recouping their losses leading to an increase in the cost of groceries.
Remember, this newspaper report is based on prices in Sydney. In the Northern Territory, prices are much higher. The country-city divide is widening under this government to the point now where people in regional Australia are paying more tax on their petrol than people in the city. They are paying more for their goods in the supermarket than people in the city. Why is this? Because we have a retail tax, as I said before. The GST is a tax on the retail price. So it is compounded where the margin is wider, and it is worse in rural and regional Australia. 
—Beer has gone up as well.
—That is absolutely correct, Senator Mackay. Everybody knows that people in rural and regional Australia pay bigger margins, not just on petrol but also on food. Under the old system, everybody paid the same amount of tax regardless of where they lived. 
But let us turn to the impact of the GST on small business. Most small business and self-employed people I have talked to mention the impact of the GST on themselves, the economy and other businesses. In the last month I have had the opportunity to speak with small business people in Katherine, Nhulunbuy and Alice Springs. Usually they volunteer information to me about how bad the Territory's economy is going as a result of the GST. They also talk to me about the other businesses around town that have closed down as a result of the GST or are planning to close down. Most small businesses complain about the extra paperwork involved in the GST and problems with their cash flow as a result of the GST. In the Jabiru Rag, which is the local Jabiru paper, on 8 February this year there were quotes from some of the local business owners. For the purposes of Hansard I will not name these people. One person who owns a company that is involved in the tourist trade said that her company was in the deepest despair of all. She said, `Just don't mention that GST word.' Her business is travel—commissions, percentages, every deal a different deal, no sweet simple 10 per cent for her. She tried to explain it to the reporter, but it was just too complex.
Another person, a small but very reputable private business operator with several small interests, said they have considerably more documentation and a lot of extra work to do for no gain to anyone. They have come to believe that it is all required just so the economic planners can see exactly what they are doing. They say, `It's a mess. It's just not clearly thought out yet. It's not what we wanted at all.' Let me give you another example. A report in last week's reputable journal of note, the Northern Territory News, detailed how at least six automotive businesses had closed in recent months, with at least two more repair businesses likely to close at the end of this month, due to the GST and high fuel prices. The heading of that newspaper article was `GST fuel sends six repair firms broke.' So, despite what the federal government claims, the business activity statement is not popular with small business owners or self-employed persons. Many businesses have closed, particularly in the Northern Territory, rather than deal with it, and they all blame the GST. 
We all know the impact the GST has had on the building construction industry—and it was not a surprise. Once again, Labor's research had predicted that the GST would have a major negative impact on the building sector. In the Territory, the once booming Territory economy has slowed to a standstill. The already high cost of building your own home in the Territory has become prohibitive to many people. In the 12 months to January, residential housing approvals in the Northern Territory fell a massive 42.4 per cent. There are not too many happy people connected to the building industry in the Northern Territory at the moment. It is also very telling that private consumption in the Territory fell from 6.9 per cent in the 12 months to December 1999 to 1.5 per cent in the 12 months to December 2000. That compares with a national private consumption of 2.5 per cent. The money is simply not there. People are not spending and the economy, particularly in the Northern Territory, is contracting. I could go on and on and talk about the negative impact of the GST on the Territory but I might, for the purpose of time, perhaps conclude my contribution this afternoon.
We know why the government has backflipped on petrol in recent weeks, and we know why the government has backflipped on the business activity statement for small business. It is not that the red light is suddenly flashing because of the impact the GST has had on food and fuel prices in the Northern Territory or on indigenous people who live in remote communities. It is not out of any concern for small business, which are swamped in red tape because they have to become unpaid tax collectors for the Australian government. It is not out of any deep social justice concern for indigenous Australians living in the Northern Territory but simply out of a desperate need by this government to try to save its hide. Instead of letting small business get on with what they want to do and what they are good at—running their businesses—and instead of considering what Australian motorists want and putting that windfall into an area that benefits motorists, this government is simply concerned with saving its own seats on the other side of this chamber.
This government is out of touch. It is arrogant. It is governing only for the top end of town and has no concerns for rural and remote Australia, particularly my constituents in the Northern Territory. The Australian economy grew for 9½ years and now it is in reverse. That is what the GST has achieved. The article in the Bulletin two weeks ago by Max Walsh, headed the `Tax and spend Liberals' is correct: this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-03-29,"—In the debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 and theAppropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001 I rise to speak about the very important issue of DIDS, the Defence integrated distribution system, which has been left in a state of suspension because of the inactivity and the malaise of this government. DIDS is the largest outsourcing contract offered under the Defence Commercial Support Program. It is a project for the commercial supply of warehousing and distribution for Defence over a period of 10 years.
It is a major contract, worth in the order of $1.059 billion, so it is nothing to be sneezed at or scoffed at. The letting of this contract seems to have run into a brick wall. The government's indecision on this particular project is causing instability and low morale for the work force. The commercial support program, under which this so-called initiative was undertaken by the government, has aims, goals and objectives. It is worth referring to those for just a few moments. One of the stated aims of the commercial support program—and I am quoting from a Defence document—is:
To transfer support activities to the civil sector where operationally feasible, practicable and providing better value for money than the in-house provider.
There has been much done by way of market testing in the commercial support program area in Defence, but it has to be operationally feasible and practical and has to provide better value for money than the in-house provider. There are a number of objectives and principles, which I will not go through. Suffice to say that, under the heading of `Principles', there are two important issues raised in the Defence document:
An in-house option is considered for each activity unless civilian employees and their representatives have made an informed decision not to develop an in-house option bid.
On this occasion, there is an in-house option bid, and the employees have been very diligent in pursuing that. The last dot point in this list says:
Bidders are short-listed and advised at the earliest opportunity.
The operative word there is `earliest'. If one looks at the tardiness of the government on this issue, one will see the dilemma faced by in-house bidders and commercial bidders while waiting for this government to come to a decision on this rather large outsourcing contract.
Headquarters Support Command Australia draft minute of February 1999 shows that this process commenced under a Defence directive of 29 July 1997. So it has now been in progress for some three years and at this stage there has been no result. This process was initiated and authorised to test the market—and that has been done. Everything has been complied with, but there is no result. It is ironic that, as part of the process, Defence set up a management review team. This was to be a consultative process whereby the employees and the military staff who work under Defence distribution through Headquarters Support Command would have some idea of progress that was being made in the outsourcing of the contract. One of the objectives was to include the employee representatives. The employee representatives were seen as an additional mechanism for the dissemination of DIDS project information to all affected staff. 
The last part of the draft minute of February 1999 was about the decision announcement. It was stated in that draft minute that the decision announcment was scheduled for March 2000. Of course, that has well and truly gone by the wayside. The draft minute said that amendments to this date may only be authorised by the Support Commander, Army. So here we have a $1 billion project that has just run into a brick wall. It should have been reported on, according to the draft minute, by March 2000. That date has been continually pushed out, and we now end up with a degree of consternation and concern about the fate of this particular initiative that the government and Defence have undertaken. Terms of reference were drafted for the management review team. In a document that was put out by Defence there is a rather convoluted flowchart which shows the importance of the management review team in the whole of the DIDS process. 
The DIDS process was meant to have the consultative initiative of the employees injected into the whole process so that there could be a statement of requirement put together before the request for tender went out. The program went along reasonably well to start with. In the first instance, a training course was convened for the members of staff who had been elected to the management review team. Nine staff were involved in one week's training in Melbourne to help them assist in the process, and they each received a certificate at the end of the training which qualified them to use the TF2 tool as the evaluation tool in the process of setting up the statement of requirement for the DIDS program. The participants in the MRT—that is, the management review team—claim that they have never been called upon to use those skills that they gained in that course. Undoubtedly, that course would have cost Defence a substantial amount of money. They did convene a meeting of those people after they had been trained, but the meeting was only ever convened once. The meeting was held on 10 November 1999. It was meant to be a vehicle by which the civilian employees in particular in Defence would be advised as to what was happening within the DIDS program. But while that may well have been the aim, it was never really achieved. It went by the wayside, as so many other things did in this whole DIDS project. I will continue my remarks on the DIDS project at some time in the future.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-29,"—My question is addressed to Minister Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I ask the minister: is he aware of comments by the White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, and I quote:
The President—
George Bush—
has been unequivocal. He does not support the Kyoto treaty. It is not in the United States' economic best interest.
I ask the minister: does the Australian government believe it will be able to convince President Bush to change such an unequivocal position? What representations has the Australian government made or does it plan to make to the United States on this announcement?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Kyoto Protocol</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-29,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister whether he recalls his comments in this place yesterday, when he stated:
The facts are that the Australian government supports the Kyoto protocol. ... In the meantime, we will work with our partners within the umbrella group to advance resolution of these issues, and I will be hosting a meeting of that group in a fortnight's time.
In light of previous statements by the Howard government that it will not ratify the protocol unless the US does, if the United States does not return to the negotiating table will the Australian government be participating in continuing negotiations on the Kyoto protocol?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Kyoto Protocol</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-03-29,"—Madam President, whether we will be able to persuade the United States of the merit of the Kyoto protocol as an instrument, I obviously do not know. The Kyoto protocol was a historic accord, in that it for the first time set a targeted reduction of greenhouse gases by the developed world—five per cent off 1990 levels. Most countries that signed that accord have since been implementing domestic programs towards achieving the targets that they agreed to at Kyoto. Certainly Australia has. In fact, we commenced our domestic response before signing the Kyoto protocol. Senator Bolkus might recall that in late 1997 the Prime Minister announced a program of domestic reforms for Australia and agreed to fund it to the extent of $180 million. Since then those programs have expanded and are being increasingly funded. Our total funding is now about $1 billion.
Australia is putting in place the domestic measures to achieve the reduction that we agreed to in Kyoto, a reduction that we thought would be difficult to achieve and has not been made any easier by our economic successes with high economic growth over the last five years. Nevertheless, we believe it represents Australia accepting a fair share of the cost of this particular global issue, and that is where we stand on it. What the United States will do, as I said, I do not know. They have been implementing some domestic responses. President Bush has announced a total review of United States energy policy and I have no doubt that that will include the issue of greenhouse gases.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Kyoto Protocol</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-03-29,"—Yes, of course we will. We believe, as I have just said, the Kyoto protocol was a mechanism to encourage a significant reduction of greenhouse gases which needs to be addressed because we are facing a serious global environmental problem. The meetings that I am intending to host will, I am assuming, go ahead as scheduled. It will be a good opportunity to discuss with American officials their then thoughts on this particular matter and how the United States might in the future meet its responsibility to contribute towards a reduction of global greenhouse gases.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Kyoto Protocol</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,answer
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2001-03-29,"—My question is addressed to Senator Vanstone, representing the Minister for Aged Care. Can the minister confirm that, according to the government's own targets, every rural South Australian region has a nursing home bed shortage and that these shortages total over 500 beds across the state? Why, then, did the Howard government recently allocate only 17 additional nursing home beds to rural South Australia and only 24 nursing home beds to the entire state? Why weren't enough beds allocated to meet the shortage in the minister's home state that even her own government admits exists?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Bed Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,question
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2001-03-29,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Thank you for your answer, Minister, but you highlight the point that there is a shortage of some 500 beds across the state. Won't the government's failure to address the shortage of nursing home beds in South Australia leave older Australians in those regions waiting longer and longer for aged care? Will the minister be approaching the Minister for Aged Care on behalf of those people in her home state to demand that something is done to address the chronic shortage of nursing home beds in South Australia, a state that once shone under previous Labor governments with adequate beds?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Bed Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-03-29,"—Senator Crowley, thank you for the question. But I do ask to you bear in mind that, in 1984, there were 100 beds for every 1,000 people over 70 years of age and that, under your government, the provision of beds for every 1,000 people over 70 years of age dropped to a figure of 93 or 91 beds. That is an indication—in smaller figures for you, Senator, to make it easy to understand—that your government did not do a good job in this area. 
I will not repeat all the details I gave to Senator Evans about the new places. I am sure you were listening to that. But, in particular, of the new places that I mentioned—the 22,000 new aged care places, including 14,000 places that were worth $156 million in a full year, and $30 million in capital grants—over 1,400 places, worth $15.2 million, were allocated to South Australia. South Australia will receive $1.8 million in capital grants, $1.1 million in restructuring grants and $400,000 in capital to establish community aged care packages.
These new places and grants are in addition to the $421 million spent by this government on aged care in South Australia in the last financial year. The last two approval rounds take the total allocated places for South Australia to over 108 places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over. That takes me back to the figure, Senator—100 beds was used as the benchmark figure when we left office but your government reduced that figure to the low 90s. There are now 108 places per 1,000 people aged 70 years and over in South Australia.
In the 2000 aged care approvals round, the metropolitan regions in South Australia were allocated a total of 878 packages, including 406 residential care places and 472 community aged care packages. As a whole, metropolitan South Australia is well supplied for aged care, with a ratio of 112 allocated places per 1,000 persons aged 70 and over. A small number of nursing homes in metropolitan South Australia have closed or have indicated to the government that they wish to restructure or sell their premises. Only 84 places are currently not operational as a result of these proposed restructures. These, however, have been offset by the allocation of 15 emergency bed allocations and 66 that have become operational since the new allocations were announced in January last year.
Senator, I will have a look at the detail of your question. That is the sum total of information I have in respect of South Australia.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-03-29,"—It is not often that Senator Crowley takes my breath away with audacious claims such as the one she just made. Senator Crowley knows that her own party did not do a good job in this area—despite, I might say, her own efforts. I repeat, Senator: I will look at your questions and—to the extent that they were not answered by the detail that I did give you—if there is more detail that can be provided I will ask Mrs Bishop to provide it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Bed Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,answer

The replacement sets utilise 3 to 5 watts in stand-by mode as I advised yesterday.
The stand-by consumption for the replacement sets would create some 20 kilograms or on average 20 kilowatt hours of green house emissions each per annum, rather than the 150 kg or on average 150 kilowatt hours of green house gas emissions the Australian Greenhouse Office advises could be saved by turning off a household set at the wall when not in use.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE'S REPORT FUNDING AUSTRA-LIA'S DEFENCE
The Government welcomes the Committee's inquiry into and report on the level of Defence funding required to provide for the defence of Australia. The report provided a valuable contribution to raising public awareness of issues in national security and informed public debate on defence funding.
Following the tabling of the Committee's report and the last federal election, the Government began a thorough review of Australia's defence needs. This review included an extensive community consultation program and an unprecedented level of ministerial involvement in defence policy formulation through the National Security Committee of Cabinet. 
Following this wide-ranging review, the Government tabled the Defence White Paper 2000 in Parliament on 6 December 2000. Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force presents the Government's decisions and commitments concerning the future of Australia's defence force, including the level of funding that will be provided to enable the Australian Defence Force to achieve Government-directed strategic objectives.
The commitments and plans made by the Government in the Defence White Paper, particularly in the sections on Capability and Funding, comprehensively address the current pressures and future demands on funding for the Australian Defence Force. These new plans and commitments build on earlier Government initiatives, particularly the Defence Reform Program, which sought, among other initiatives, to maximise the resources available for the sustainment and enhancement of Defence capability. The Government remains strongly committed to continuing improvements and reforms in Defence to ensure that money spent on defence is managed wisely and that funding Australia's defence is both affordable and sustainable over the long term.
The Recommendations of the Committee
1. The Committee recommends that the Government undertake to provide Defence with a five-year budget commitment, to provide Defence with a more secure basis for long term planning of resource allocations.
The Government has decided to provide Defence funding commitments covering the whole of the coming decade matched to the capability enhancements detailed in the Defence Capability Plan. This funding commitment is the most specific long-term defence funding projections provided by any Australian government in more than 25 years. This commitment will provide Defence with a secure basis for managing and planning the development of capability.
2. The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence be required to report to the Parliament annually, and in a report separate from the Defence Annual Report, specifically detailing the progress made in implementing major efficiency initiatives.
Separate reporting by the Department is considered unnecessary.  Defence already reports regularly to Parliament on progress in implementing major efficiency initiatives in Portfolio Budget Statements and Annual Reports.  This reporting is being expanded to cover all improvements as Defence migrates to a culture of continuous improvement.  This specific reporting together with the regular ministerial statements on efficiency initiatives to Parliament should obviate the need for separate reports. There will be a higher level of accountability attendant with the introduction of the classified Defence Financial and Management Plan, which will set annual targets for the delivery of savings and efficiency measures.
3. The Committee recommends that Defence funding should be increased in real terms, to enable the ADF to remain a well-equipped, highly-trained force relying on technologically advanced weapons and support systems
In the White Paper, the Government has committed itself to increasing Defence funding by an average of about three percent per annum in real terms over the next decade. The Government intends that funding for 2001-02 and 2002-03 will increase by $500 million and $1,000 million respectively, to provide substantial initial funding for a number of key capability initiatives that will ensure the ADF is equipped, trained and supported to the level necessary to enable it to perform the roles Government directs.
4. The Committee recommends that the mechanism of fixing a real rate of growth be adopted as a means of defining the increase in Defence spending.
The Government has determined the appropriate level of increase in Defence spending through a rational, structured approach. The Government has assessed Australia's strategic environment; confirmed Australia's strategic interests and objectives; and then developed and costed the capabilities required in the Australian Defence Force to ensure it is able to protect Australia's strategic interests and achieve our strategic objectives. This approach, coupled with a thorough evaluation of current Defence funding programs and pressures has enabled the Government to forecast an appropriate level of Defence funding over the next decade. The appropriate level of funding averages about three per cent per annum in real terms over the decade. It should be stressed that these Defence funding levels have been (and will in the future be) determined by reference to strategic objectives (ie outcomes and outputs) and budgetary and defence requirements in a given year.
5. Given that the recommendations made in this report can have no impact on the decisions taken in the 1998-99 Federal Budget, the Committee recommends that real growth in Defence funding should commence in FY 1999-00.
The Government intends that the first increase in Defence funding of $500 million will be provided in the 2001-02 Federal Budget. 
6. The Committee recommends that the current level of Defence funding be increased by a real growth rate of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent annually for the next five years.
As discussed above, the Government has estimated that the appropriate level of funding increase for Defence is initial increases of $500 million and $1,000 million  in financial years 2001-02 and 2002-03, respectively, with an average of about three per cent per annum growth in real terms over the decade.
7. The Committee is concerned about the substantial additional expenditure required to overcome block obsolescence in the 2010-15 period.  The Parliament and Expenditure Review Committees of successive Governments must be involved in the advance financial planning to overcome this problem.
The Government has addressed comprehensively the issue of block obsolescence in its consideration and development of the White Paper. It has made explicit funding provision for the life extension, refurbishment, upgrade or replacement of all current Defence platforms and weapon systems that are reaching the end of their service life over the next two decades through the Defence Capability Plan, which will be implemented through the classified Defence Financial and Management Plan (this document informs Government of the impact and options available for managing block obsolescence). Ongoing review and development of the Defence Capability Plan will occur through the annual Budget process, and it is through this established mechanism that the Government will manage long term Defence funding pressures. The Parliament and Expenditure Review Committees will have visibility and involvement in this planning through normal Defence reporting and Government accountability mechanisms - particularly the classified Defence Financial and Management Plan as well as Annual Reports, Portfolio Budget Reports, Additional Estimates and appearances before Parliamentary Committees by representatives from the Department of Defence.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STATUTORY COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS AND SECURITIES REPORT ON THE DRAFT FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL
Introduction
The Minister for Financial Services & Regulation, the Hon Joe Hockey MP, released the exposure draft Financial Services Reform Bill on 11 February 2000 for 3 months' public comment.  On 8 March 2000, the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities resolved to hold an inquiry into the draft Bill.  The Committee tabled its report on 14 August 2000.  In addition to 8 recommendations on the Bill made by the Committee, the report contains a minority report by Labor members.
The Government's response to the Committee's recommendations is as follows.
Committee recommendation: Final Bill should be passed.
Response: The Government welcomes this recommendation, and will seek to finalise the drafting of the legislation for early Parliamentary consideration as soon as practicable.
Committee recommendation: Amendment to address adverse effects of the draft Bill on the delivery of financial services in rural and regional Australia.  In particular, the Committee recommended that the draft Bill be amended to remove deposit products offered by authorised deposit taking institutions from the definition of financial product.
Response: The Government recognises the need for the Bill's requirements to apply flexibly to basic deposit products and to ensure regulatory proportionality.  Accordingly, the Government will amend the draft Bill so that deposit products offered by authorised deposit-taking institutions that are for a term of 2 years or less with no management or break fees will not be subject to the financial services guide requirements or requirements to provide statements of advice.  This will ensure that the Bill's requirements apply flexibly to basic deposit products recognising that they are generally well understood by retail consumers and that consumers can get their money back on demand.
Amendments are also proposed to the draft Bill's definitions of financial product advice and dealing to ensure the requirements for licensing and authorisation are more tightly focussed.  This will ensure that activities commonly engaged in by tellers such as the accepting of moneys for deposit or the giving out of moneys from deposit accounts will not be caught by the FSR regime. 
The Committee's report highlights some concerns about the Bill's competency requirements for representatives, such as tellers or employees of third party agents.  These concerns are unfounded and do not support arguments for the wholesale removal of deposits and means of payment from the draft Bill.  The intention with these requirements is not to force every representative to be competent to provide full financial planning services.  Rather, representatives will only have to be competent to provide the services they actually provide - no more and no less.  The Government does not expect industry participants who are adequately trained and competent to provide the services they now provide to have to undertake significant extra training to meet the draft Bill's competency requirements. 
The Government believes that the final form of the legislation will not hinder the operation of Rural Transaction Centres or distribution of deposit products through third-party agents such as newsagents or pharmacists in country Australia.  The Government is committed to ensuring that all Australian consumers of financial products receive the same level of protection, irrespective of where they live or how they access those products.  Hence, the draft Bill's requirements will ensure that consumers of financial services in the bush will get the same protections as consumers in cities.  In particular, they will require deposit-taking institutions to ensure that their staff and agents are competent to provide the services they offer consumers, whether those consumers live in rural, regional or city Australia.
Committee recommendation: Amendment to address the information economy and e - commerce. In particular, the Committee recommended that the draft Bill be amended to exclude information provided in certain circumstances from the definition of financial product advice.
Response: The Government welcomes the support for the information economy and e-commerce.  One of the underlying objectives of the draft Bill is to ensure that the regulatory regime is media-neutral and encourages innovation in the design, distribution and use of financial services and products.
The Government does not believe it needs to amend the definition of financial product advice in the way recommended by the Committee to address the concerns raised in evidence to the Committee on the information economy and e-commerce.  Rather, the Government is amending the draft Bill to clarify the application of its requirements in a range of e-commerce situations.  For example, the Bill will clarify that a person who merely provides a communication service through which a consumer makes a non-cash payment is not the provider of the non-cash payment facility.
Committee recommendation: Amendments to address issues concerning Australia as an international financial centre raised by Australian Stock Exchange Limited (the ASX).
Response: The Government is keen to enhance Australia's role as an international financial centre.  The Government also agrees that the Australian market needs to be able to respond quickly to change, domestic and international, in order to continue to remain relevant.  However, the Government is not convinced that the examples cited in evidence to the Committee by the ASX will have the effect of undermining the future of Australia's markets.  In particular  
·	the object of provisions relating to the regulation of foreign-based markets operating in Australia is facilitative - to ensure that those markets which are subject to an appropriate regulatory regime overseas are not, in addition, subject to the full rigours of the Australian regulatory regime.  The intention is that the regulation of such markets in Australia and overseas, when taken together, be equivalent to the regulation of a comparable market which is licensed only in Australia;
·	the purpose of requiring that Australian incorporated bodies which operate a market or clearing and settlement overseas be licensed in Australia is to ensure that Australia does not lend its name to doubtful operators who may mislead overseas investors by implying that, since they are incorporated in Australia, they are regulated in Australia.  Such a situation would adversely affect Australia's reputation as an international financial centre;
·	the Government remains committed to providing regulation of financial markets through a combination of self-regulation, and regulation by the Minister and ASIC.  A wide power of delegation to the regulator, ASIC, is necessary to ensure flexibility in the operation of the new legislation into the future, but it is expected that the Minister will continue to be the decision-maker in relation to the major markets.
The ASX also raised in evidence the issue of increasing the shareholder limitation in the Exchange from 5% to 15% in line with the banking sector, with the possibility of a larger proportion, subject to a fit and proper person test.  The ASX also pointed to the need for an even-handed competitive environment.
On 10 October 2000, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the Hon Joe Hockey MP, announced that the Government had decided that the shareholder limitation on the ASX would be changed to 15%, with the possibility of a larger shareholding being permitted if the acquisition is in the national interest.  The same limitations would apply to other financial markets and clearing and settlement facilities which are of national economic significance.  These changes are to be included in the draft Bill and will complement the 'fit and proper' person test which will apply to controllers and senior managers of Australian markets and clearing and settlement facilities.
Committee recommendation: Amendment to address the impact on small business.  In particular, the Committee recommended that the draft Bill be amended to remove the requirement for disclosure in the Statement of Advice of quantum of commission on risk insurance products.
Response: The Government does not accept the Committee's recommendation.  The draft Bill provides that, where personal advice is given to a client in relation to any financial product, the financial service provider must provide the client with a written copy of the advice including details of  
·	any benefit or advantage the financial service provider may receive in connection with the advice or the sale of a financial product, and
·	any other pecuniary or other benefits (including soft dollar arrangements) which may reasonably be expected to influence the financial service provider in giving the advice.
The purpose of disclosure at this stage is to help the consumer identify any potential influences on the advice given or any potential conflicts of interest which the adviser may have in recommending a specific product.  It is not to indicate the extent to which any return the consumer may receive on the product is reduced by such commissions.  Nor is it to identify the distribution costs associated with the product.
In requiring the disclosure of benefit or advantage at this stage, the draft Bill will ensure that consumers are provided with information that will help them make an informed choice about whether to purchase a product or not.  The disclosed information helps the consumer evaluate any possible influences on the adviser in recommending a particular product.  For example, if an insurance agent received commission, bonuses or soft dollar remunerations, this would need to be disclosed in the same way as a salaried bank employee disclosed the receipt of a performance bonus based on the number of products sold .
For a consumer to assess possible conflicts an adviser may have in recommending a product they need to know the quantum.  Conflicts of interest do not only occur where commission affects the return to the client.  For example, an adviser may have a conflict of interest where they receive a 25% commission on a risk product even though the amount of commission does not affect the payment to the consumer if or when the event which is insured against occurs.
Committee recommendation: Amendment to address co-regulation and the position of professional bodies.  In particular, the Committee recommended that the draft Bill be amended so that it does `not affect anyone whose involvement in financial services is incidental to their main activity'.
Response: The Government does not accept the Committee's recommendation.  From the consumer's perspective, the loss they might suffer from poor financial advice given by, for example, an accountant who provided that advice incidentally to accounting services is no less serious than the loss they would suffer if the poor advice had been given by someone whose main activity is the provision of financial advice, for example a financial planner.
The draft Bill requires that anyone who provides defined financial services be competent to do so and provides the same minimum consumer protections.  This requirement applies irrespective of whether the service provider calls themselves insurance agent, financial planner, accountant or lawyer.
Generally speaking, providers of financial advice will require an Australian Financial Services Licence.  The draft Bill provides an alternative mechanism for those wishing to provide financial advice in the form of the declared professional body mechanism.
In light of submissions on the draft Bill, amendments have been made to the definitions of financial product advice and dealing to ensure that it is clear what activities will attract the operation of the Bill.
Committee recommendation: Provide proper recognition of corporate structures and the retail/wholesale client definition.
Response: As a result of the consultation process on the draft Bill, amendments have been made to the Bill to accommodate conglomerate structures where staff are employed by a single corporate entity within the group.
In relation to the potential capital gains tax consequences for existing industry participants in moving to the new licensing regime contained in the draft Bill, consultations have been occurring on this issue since February 2000.  The Government will consider whether any legislation is necessary to deal with the tax consequences as a result of the FSR Bill.
In relation to the retail/wholesale client definition, as a result of the submissions received during the consultation process, the Government has amended this definition to align it more closely with the current definition in the Corporations Law and to clarify that Financial Services Licensees and prudentially regulated bodies are wholesale clients.
Committee recommendation: Amendment to start date of the Bill.
Response: The Government notes the Committee's recommendation that consideration be given to the timing of the FSR regime to allow industry sufficient time to comply with the new regime.  The Government is keen to finalise, introduce and secure passage of the draft Bill as soon as possible.  It will take account of the Committee's views, and those of the regulator and interested industry stakeholders, when determining when to commence the legislation.  The Government also notes that it proposes to include transitional provisions in the draft Bill under which existing industry participants will be able to comply with some current requirements rather than the new law for a period of up to 2 years.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY REPORT “STREET LEGAL: THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY IN CONTROLLED OPERATIONS”
The Government welcomes the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the involvement of the National Crime Authority in controlled operations. 
Controlled operations are an essential tool for investigating and combating serious criminal activity.  It is important that the provisions which provide for the conduct of controlled operations are framed both to enhance the effectiveness of controlled operations as an investigatory tool and ensure that private rights are protected and powers are exercised properly.
In recognition of the need for improved controlled operations provisions, the Government has formulated proposals to amend the controlled operations provisions in Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914.  The recommendations of the committee have been considered in this context.
Government Response to each of the Recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority 
Recommendation 1: That the Government recommend to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General that uniform controlled operations legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth, States and Territories in terms similar to the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW) subject to the foreshadowed amendments in the Finlay Review Report and the further recommendations in this report. (Paragraph 3.43) 
Government Response to Recommendation 1: Agree
The Government has decided to adopt an approach to enhancing drug law enforcement strategies that seeks national consistency and draws together existing disparate State and Territory practices. While it is proposed to pursue uniform Commonwealth, State and Territory controlled operations legislation in the medium term, the Government sees merit in pursuing the enhancement of Commonwealth provisions in the first instance.
Recommendation 2: That, if uniform controlled operations legislation cannot be secured then: 
(a) the Government call for those States and Territories that do not have controlled operations legislation, to enact such legislation as is necessary for the NCA to authorise and conduct controlled operations in each jurisdiction; 
(b) the Government call for those States and Territories that allow officers of a State or Territory agency (eg police service) to authorise controlled operations to amend their legislation to allow NCA members to authorise their own controlled operations. (Paragraph 3.43) 
Government Response to Recommendation 2: Agree
As discussed in relation to recommendation 1, the Government proposes to pursue uniformity.  The precise manner in which uniformity or consistency will be sought has not yet been determined.  The question of conferring powers on the NCA under State laws will be explored in that context.
Recommendation 3: That a two tiered approval process be established for the authorisation of controlled operations under Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914: 
(i) Applications for minor controlled operations should be subject to an in-house approval regime. That is, a law enforcement officer in charge of a controlled operation may apply to the Commissioner, a Deputy Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner of the AFP or to a member of the NCA for a certificate authorising a controlled operation. Minor controlled operations are to be defined as short-term investigations (not exceeding one month's duration) involving minimal contact between a covert operative and a suspect or suspects, where law enforcement officers are required to engage in activities involving unlawfulness of a technical nature. If a minor controlled operation exceeds one month's duration, it should be re-classified as a longer-term operation and subject to the external approval process set out in paragraph (ii). 
(ii) Applications for longer-term controlled operations should be subject to an external approval process. The function of determining applications for longer-term controlled operations should be transferred to the office of the Inspector-General of the NCA as described in recommendation 19 of the Committee's 1998 report Third Evaluation of the National Crime Authority. Should the Government not accede to the establishment of an Inspector-General for the NCA, then the power to approve longer-term controlled operations should be conferred on such other independent authority as the Government sees fit, such as the AAT. 
Nothing in this recommendation should affect the ability of law enforcement agencies to make urgent applications for a certificate authorising a controlled operation in accordance with section 15L of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914. Urgent applications should be able to be made in-house either in person, by telephone or by any other means of communication in respect of both minor and longer-term controlled operations. In particular, the requirements in sections 15L(5) and (6) for the follow-up provision of a written application and certificate in relation to urgent applications should be retained. These written records will be subject to the stringent accountability processes outlined in Recommendation 10. (Paragraph 4.74) 
Government Response to Recommendation 3: Disagree
The Government does not favour a two-tiered approach.  Such an approach would unduly fetter law enforcement agencies, and add unnecessary complexity to the legislative scheme.  Maintaining the same approval process for all operations will ensure consistency and accountability and promote efficiency whilst providing operational flexibility.  Both Commonwealth and NSW provisions currently employ a single approval process.  The review of the NSW provisions found no reason to alter the existing regime in this respect.
The Government agrees that urgent application procedures should be retained.
Recommendation 4: That law enforcement agencies devise appropriate training and education courses in relation to the operations of the controlled operations legislative regime. (Paragraph 4.74) 
Government Response to Recommendation 4: Agree in principle
The Australian Federal Police has established national guidelines in relation to the conduct of controlled operations.  The guidelines are enforceable through disciplinary procedures available under an employment management regime and the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979.  Appropriate training and education will continue to be a focus for all agencies.
Recommendation 5: That those States and Territories that have enacted specific controlled operations legislation should make appropriate amendments to allow the NCA Chairperson and Members to authorise controlled operations certificates. (Paragraph 4.77) 
Government Response to Recommendation 5: No comment
As previously noted, the Government has decided to adopt an approach to enhancing drug law enforcement strategies that seeks national consistency and draws together existing disparate State and Territory practices. The recommendation will be addressed in that context, and will ultimately be a matter for the States and Territories.
Recommendation 6: That the standard of satisfaction required by the authorising officer in relation to the preconditions in section 15M of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 should be expressed in such terms as `reasonably satisfied' or `satisfied on reasonable grounds'. (Paragraph 4.83) 
Government Response to Recommendation 6: Agree
The Government is developing a proposal along these lines.
 Recommendation 7: That the `no entrapment' test in section 15M(b) of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 be enunciated with greater clarity. (Paragraph 4.86) 
Government Response to Recommendation 7: Agree
The Government is developing a proposal to require an authorising officer to be reasonably satisfied that a criminal offence will be committed by the person or group targeted by the operation, whether or not the operation takes place (the `no entrapment test').  The precise formulation of the test will be reviewed in the drafting process, taking into account the Committee's comments.
Recommendation 8: That in relation to the precondition in section 15M(d) of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 the paragraph be reworded to better reflect the need for operational flexibility by relevant law enforcement agencies. (Paragraph 4.88) 
Government Response to Recommendation 8: Agree
The Government is developing a proposal to modify the existing requirement in paragraph 15M(d) that the authorising officer be satisfied that any narcotic goods that are the subject of the operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the operation.  It is instead proposed that the authorising officer be required to be reasonably satisfied that the operation will be conducted so as to minimise the risk that any illicit goods involved in the operation will be outside law enforcement control at the end of the operation.  The proposed formulation will promote improved operational planning but does not require certainty as to operational outcomes.
Recommendation 9: That section 15M of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 be amended to adopt similar conditions to those contained in paragraphs 6(3)(b) and (c) of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW) that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct are such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation and the proposed controlled activities. (Paragraph 4.91) 
Government Response to Recommendation 9: Agree
The Government is developing a proposal to amend to section 15M to require an authorising officer to be reasonably satisfied that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity is such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation within the parameters that the authorising officer proposes to authorise.  This proposal is consistent with paragraph 6(3)(b) of the of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW).
Recommendation 10: That there be an appropriate system of accountability provided within the legislative regime of controlled operations involving oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The oversight should be in identical terms to that required of the NSW Ombudsman under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW). (Paragraph 5.53) 
Government Response to Recommendation 10: Disagree
In the course of developing proposals for reforming controlled operations provisions, significant consideration was given to providing appropriate systems of accountability.  Creating an oversight role for the Commonwealth Ombudsman was one option considered.  However, oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman was considered to be unlikely to yield further accountability beyond that which is already achieved by the requirement to report to the Minister.  It was also considered that the oversight function in respect of controlled operations would not coexist well with the Ombudsman's current role in respect of Australian Federal Police complaints, as there would be a possibility the Ombudsman's office may be called upon to investigate and report on controlled operations procedures it had previously reviewed and approved.
Recommendation 11: In order that the Parliament be appropriately involved in discharging its responsibility for scrutiny under the legislation there should be a requirement placed on the Ombudsman to annually brief the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on a confidential basis in relation to the Authority's involvement in controlled operations. (Paragraph 5.53) 
Government Response to Recommendation 11: Disagree
The existing controlled operations provisions require the NCA Chairperson and AFP Commissioner to report to the Minister and the Minister to table an annual report in Parliament.  It is proposed to amend the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to require the National Crime Authority to comply with a request by the Committee for information relating to an investigation or concerning the general conduct of the operations of the authority, unless disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety of persons or the operations of law enforcement agencies.  It is considered that these existing and proposed reporting requirements are sufficient and that an annual briefing by the Ombudsman is not necessary.  Furthermore, as discussed in relation to recommendation 10, it is not considered appropriate for the Ombudsman to perform an oversight role in respect of controlled operations.
Recommendation 12: That the scope of the definition of `controlled operations' in Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 should be widened to refer to operations carried out for the purpose of obtaining evidence that may lead to the prosecution of a person for theft, fraud, tax evasion, currency violations, illegal drug dealings, illegal gambling, obtaining a financial benefit by vice engaged in by others, extortion, violence, bribery or corruption of, or by, an officer of the Commonwealth, an officer of a State or an officer of a Territory, bankruptcy and company violations, dealings or illegal importation or exportation of fauna into or out of Australia, money laundering and people trafficking. (Paragraph 6.50) 
Government Response to Recommendation 12: Agree in part
The Government agrees that controlled operations are an essential tool for infiltrating and investigating a wide range of criminal activity.  However, rather than specifying each type of criminal activity, it is proposed to amend the controlled operations provisions to provide that a controlled operation may be conducted in respect of any criminal offence, the investigation of which falls within the functions of the agency in relation to Commonwealth law.  Such an approach is consistent with the NSW Act, which does not limit the range of criminal activity for which approval to conduct a controlled operation may be sought.
Recommendation 13(i): That the immunity conferred on covert operatives should be widened commensurately with the scope of controlled operations to confer immunity from criminal liability on any person authorised to participate in a controlled operation in terms of sections 16 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW). As prescribed in section 16 of that Act, immunity should only be available where the unlawful activity engaged in has been authorised by and is engaged in in accordance with the Authority for the operation. (Paragraph 6.50) 
Government Response to Recommendation 13(i): Agree
The Government is developing a proposal under which a law enforcement officer will not be liable for any offence in relation to conduct that is undertaken for the purposes of an authorised controlled operation and is within the terms of the authorisation.  The proposal imposes an additional limitation that the conduct must not involve the commission of a sexual offence, or involve causing death or serious injury to a person.
Recommendation 13(ii): The Commonwealth Act should be amended to include a provision in terms of section 19 of the NSW Act to immune covert operatives from civil liability. As prescribed in section 19 of that Act, immunity from civil liability should only be available where the conduct engaged in was in good faith and for the purpose of executing the provisions of the Act regulating controlled operations. (Paragraph 6.50) 
Government Response to Recommendation 13(ii): Agree
The Government is developing a proposal with respect to immunity from civil liability that would protect the rights of innocent third parties.
Recommendation 13(iii): The Commonwealth Act should also be amended to include a provision expressly acknowledging that where an individual suffers loss or injury as a result of a controlled operation an action can be maintained against the State for compensation in respect of that loss or injury. (Paragraph 6.50) 
Government Response to Recommendation 13(iii): Disagree
It is not considered necessary to make statutory provision for a right of recovery where an individual suffers loss or damage as a result of a controlled operation.  The Government is considering a proposal that would preserve applicable civil remedies.
Recommendation 14: That the timeframe for which an authority to conduct a controlled operation may remain in force be extended to three months. If an investigation exceeds that timeframe, law enforcement agencies must apply for a new certificate in respect of the same investigation. (Paragraph 6.63) 
Government Response to Recommendation 14: Agree in part
The Government agrees that the current 30 day timeframe provides insufficient time for law enforcement agencies to properly infiltrate and investigate organised and serious crime.  However, it is considered that 3 months is also inadequate.  The Government proposes that the period within which an authorisation may remain in force be extended from 30 days to 6 months, with provision for review of the authorisation after 3 months.  In reviewing an authorisation the authorising officer would have to be satisfied that it is appropriate for the operation to continue having regard to the same considerations relevant to the initial authorisation.  Where the authorisation is not reviewed to assess the continuing need for the operation, the authorisation lapses and a new authorisation must be sought.  
The 6 month authorisation period recognises that effective infiltration of criminal organisation may take many months or even years.  The proposed extension takes into account the exigencies of deep infiltration of multi-faceted crime syndicates, while the provision for 3 monthly review ensures that the conduct of the operation receives frequent, high level attention.
Recommendation 15: That Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 be amended to include a provision to allow for the retrospective authorisation of controlled operations only where the life or safety of a covert operative is at risk, in terms of section 14 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. In particular, the amendment should include the conditions that the relevant unlawful conduct was engaged in only for the purpose of protecting an operative or other person from death or serious injury and that the application must be made within 24 hours of the unlawful conduct having been engaged in. (Paragraph 6.85) 
Government Response to Recommendation 15: Disagree
The Government considers that retrospective authorisation is not consistent with the integral role of planning in Commonwealth controlled operations.  Common law defences and prosecution discretion will apply in emergency circumstances.
Recommendation 16: That Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 be amended to include a provision to authorise the participation of civilians in controlled operations. The term `civilians' should be defined so as to exclude those persons who are police informants or who become involved in a controlled operation by reason of their having knowledge, position or influence as a consequence of their own involvement in criminal activities. The position of that class of civilians should remain subject to the current system of retrospective indemnities and assistance at the time of sentencing that operates according to the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions. (Paragraph 6.140)  
Government Response to Recommendation 16: Agree in part
The Government proposes to provide for the participation of persons who are not law enforcement officers in controlled operations.  It is not proposed to exclude persons from this possibility by reason that they are an informant or that they become involved by reason of their own criminal activities.  The participation of an informant may be vital to the success of a controlled operation, and it may be difficult to secure their cooperation where prospective immunity cannot be offered.  In this respect it is important to note that all non-law enforcement participants in a controlled operation, whether informant or otherwise, are subject to the requirement that the conduct for which immunity may be given must be in accordance with the operation, and in accordance with any and all directions given by a supervising officer.

The statement read as follows—
REPORT 380
Army Individual Readiness Notice; Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program; Management of Job Network Contracts Review of Auditor-General's Reports; 1999-2000; Third Quarter.
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee's Report No. 380—Army Individual Readiness Notice; Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program;Management of Job Network Contracts.   This is our Review of Auditor-General's Reports for the third quarter of 1999-2000.
Madam President, the Committee held a public hearing on 6 October 2000 to discuss these ANAO Reports with the relevant Commonwealth agencies.  I will briefly discuss issues in each of the selected reports in turn.
Audit Report No. 26 reviewed the Army Individual Readiness Notice (AIRN) which seeks to bring individual readiness components together into a single instruction and to establish a minimum level of individual readiness across Army.  The audit found scope for improving the effectiveness of AIRN in achieving its then primary objective, namely, to ensure that all Army members could be deployed on operations within 30 days of notification.
This report focuses on a number of issues arising from the audit report including the development and implementation of AIRN, individual readiness components, and Defence's response to ANAO recommendations.
The Committee observed that the administrative processes put in place to support AIRN were not appropriately efficient or flexible.  The initial AIRN implementation plan had been developed without an appreciation of the size of the task.
The Committee supports Army's proposed improvements to information systems support and visibility of personnel data, and is pleased that Army considers that the costing of AIRN is a priority of the review.
In relation to individual readiness components, the audit report found that only two of the six components appeared to have a direct relevance to ascertaining the ability of members to deploy.
Army advised the Committee that a number of amendments are to be made to the existing AIRN policy and all full-time and part-time personnel will be required to meet the new baseline AIRN requirement.  The policy will be expanded to include Individual Readiness Standards that are linked to directed unit readiness levels.
The Committee considers individual readiness is the basis for military preparedness.  While the Committee understands Army's requirement to have a system in place to ensure operational deployment of personnel in an appropriate time frame, it considers that Army's implementation of the former AIRN left a great deal to be desired.  Army had not followed through on its own objective in that it did not have in place sufficient readiness component standards to give it assurance on the former AIRN standard of 30 days.
The imprecision associated with readiness component standards and the absence of linkage to the primary AIRN objective created a fundamental difficulty in providing Army with the assurance it sought from AIRN on the deployability of personnel.
The Committee notes that Army had now agreed with the ANAO that AIRN can be enhanced through the process highlighted in recommendation No. 6 of the audit report and is undertaking the adjustment of some AIRN component standards.
The Committee noted that some of Army's responses to ANAO's recommendations had subsequently undergone substantial change.  In the past, the Committee has not always been satisfied with the quality of Defence responses to audit reports or the follow-up of ANAO and JCPAA recommendations.
While the Committee is aware that Defence has recently made a number of positive changes to the way in which it now follows up recommendations, it wants Defence to give appropriate and detailed consideration to all the ANAO's recommendations at the time they are made.  The Committee considers that if Defence intends to give further active consideration to a recommendation, it should state this explicitly in its response.
The JCPAA has continued its efforts in encouraging an open and positive relationship with Defence.  It is pleased that the ANAO report has been a useful document for Army.  It has provided a positive stimulus for Army to re-evaluate AIRN's objectives, components and record-keeping, and has driven a process aimed at establishing appropriate readiness requirements and associated costs.
Although Army is reviewing AIRN, one area of particular concern to the Committee is the apparent lack of adequate analysis being applied to what constitutes sufficient warning time in a conflict, what constitutes a sufficient level of readiness, and the cost implications of readiness sustainability.  The Committee has recommended accordingly.
In the second report selected, the Committee reviewed the audit on the Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program, which gave $70.4 million to a total of 60 projects as part of the Centenary of Federation.  The audit concluded that the assessment process was rigorous, transparent and well documented and generally complied with the ANAO Better Practice Guide for the Administration of Grants.  For the most part, there was an effective audit trail.  However, there was room for improvement in the administration of the grants to ensure a clear audit trail for the selection of projects and the distribution of funds.
The Auditor-General found there was no evidence that any needs analysis had been conducted at a State or regional level or between the need for cultural or heritage projects prior to the introduction of the program.  A needs analysis can provide a basis for the allocation of funds to proposed projects and this would be administratively transparent.
The JCPAA strongly supports a rigorous needs assessment process so program funds are well targeted.  We therefore recommended in Report 380 that the Department of Communications, Information, Technology and the Arts implement its draft Guidelines for the administration of grant programs.  These Guidelines had been developed subsequent to the audit and had taken into consideration many of ANAO's recommendations.
Another matter of concern to the JCPAA was the lack of public detail about the reasons behind successful selection for the grants, or for failure to be selected.  Although the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage had documented their reasons for grant decisions under the program, these reasons were not released publicly.  While the release of this information is at the Ministers' discretion, the ANAO considers that, because the expenditure of public funds is involved, the reasons for selecting successful projects should be made publicly available—or at least on request.  The Auditor-General suggested that public perception and confidence in the openness of the decision-making process were important.
The Committee agrees with the Auditor-General in urging that the reasons for successful grants applications should be made available to those involved.  Applicants deserve transparent processes in this respect.
In addition, the Committee recommended that after grant decisions are finalised, all applicants, successful or otherwise, should be notified of the decision as soon as possible in writing, advised of relevant appeal processes and provided with guidance for improving subsequent applications.
DoCITA informed the Committee that its new departmental draft Guidelines on the Administration of Grant Programs—in line with the ANAO's Better Practice Guide—addressed the issue of early announcement of successful grant applications.  In addition, DoCITA determined that `the advice letter to applicants whose applications have been rejected should include information on how to appeal against the decision.'
The Committee is pleased with this outcome of applicants being advised as soon as possible after the ministerial/delegate decisions are made and being shown how to appeal the decision made, if deemed necessary.
The final ANAO report the Committee reviewed in this quarter was on the Management of Job Network Contracts, which audited the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the first round of Job Network contracts.  ANAO found that, on the whole, these contracts were managed in an efficient and effective manner by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.
One area where further improvements could be made was in departmental communication on strategic, issues, with provider representatives and Centrelink officers.  The Auditor-General found that these groups had not been brought together on a regular basis to consider proposed changes to the management of the Job Network program.  It would also have been beneficial if these groups had had opportunities to discuss how to approach significant issues confronting the Job Network.
The Committee was pleased to note that since the audit, senior officials from the department, Centrelink and other essential representatives meet every two months in the presence of the Minister for Employment Services to discuss matters of strategic and significant operational importance with respect to the management of Job Network.
The Committee agrees that this is a sensible arrangement, providing a forum where departmental representatives, Centrelink and Job Network providers can exchange views and consult about strategies to overcome problems that may arise.
The Committee believes that these regular meetings should help improve communication, especially on strategic issues, and assist in the smooth delivery of services to Job Network clients.  The department will be able to inform Job Network providers of program variations, hear their reactions and take these into consideration before finalising and implementing any changes.  The meeting of senior officials is a key to better implementation of change to the design of Job Network.
The Committee was informed by the department that it had taken into consideration all ANAO's recommendations in its development of the Job Network 2 contracts.  These improvements should further ensure that contract management will be more efficient and result in more effective compliance monitoring of and a better risk management approach to the Job Network programs.
In addition, the department has ensured that all Job Network contracts will provide the Auditor-General with access to the premises of Job Network providers and access to confidential information involved in contracts, should ANAO request these as part of an audit.  `Commercial-in-confidence' will no longer be a shield for Job Network contractors to shelter behind.
The Committee is pleased to note the department's implementation of JCPAA earlier recommendations on this issue of Auditor-General access to third party premises.  Such access will doubtlessly facilitate the Auditor-General's audit responsibilities where third party contractors are involved.
May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee the witnesses who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review process.
The Chairman has asked that his thanks be recorded to Members of the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports.  As well, he would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries.
Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.

The statement read as follows—
REPORT 380
Army Individual Readiness Notice; Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program; Management of Job Network Contracts Review of Auditor-General's Reports; 1999-2000; Third Quarter.
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee's Report No. 380—Army Individual Readiness Notice; Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program;Management of Job Network Contracts.   This is our Review of Auditor-General's Reports for the third quarter of 1999-2000.
Madam President, the Committee held a public hearing on 6 October 2000 to discuss these ANAO Reports with the relevant Commonwealth agencies.  I will briefly discuss issues in each of the selected reports in turn.
Audit Report No. 26 reviewed the Army Individual Readiness Notice (AIRN) which seeks to bring individual readiness components together into a single instruction and to establish a minimum level of individual readiness across Army.  The audit found scope for improving the effectiveness of AIRN in achieving its then primary objective, namely, to ensure that all Army members could be deployed on operations within 30 days of notification.
This report focuses on a number of issues arising from the audit report including the development and implementation of AIRN, individual readiness components, and Defence's response to ANAO recommendations.
The Committee observed that the administrative processes put in place to support AIRN were not appropriately efficient or flexible.  The initial AIRN implementation plan had been developed without an appreciation of the size of the task.
The Committee supports Army's proposed improvements to information systems support and visibility of personnel data, and is pleased that Army considers that the costing of AIRN is a priority of the review.
In relation to individual readiness components, the audit report found that only two of the six components appeared to have a direct relevance to ascertaining the ability of members to deploy.
Army advised the Committee that a number of amendments are to be made to the existing AIRN policy and all full-time and part-time personnel will be required to meet the new baseline AIRN requirement.  The policy will be expanded to include Individual Readiness Standards that are linked to directed unit readiness levels.
The Committee considers individual readiness is the basis for military preparedness.  While the Committee understands Army's requirement to have a system in place to ensure operational deployment of personnel in an appropriate time frame, it considers that Army's implementation of the former AIRN left a great deal to be desired.  Army had not followed through on its own objective in that it did not have in place sufficient readiness component standards to give it assurance on the former AIRN standard of 30 days.
The imprecision associated with readiness component standards and the absence of linkage to the primary AIRN objective created a fundamental difficulty in providing Army with the assurance it sought from AIRN on the deployability of personnel.
The Committee notes that Army had now agreed with the ANAO that AIRN can be enhanced through the process highlighted in recommendation No. 6 of the audit report and is undertaking the adjustment of some AIRN component standards.
The Committee noted that some of Army's responses to ANAO's recommendations had subsequently undergone substantial change.  In the past, the Committee has not always been satisfied with the quality of Defence responses to audit reports or the follow-up of ANAO and JCPAA recommendations.
While the Committee is aware that Defence has recently made a number of positive changes to the way in which it now follows up recommendations, it wants Defence to give appropriate and detailed consideration to all the ANAO's recommendations at the time they are made.  The Committee considers that if Defence intends to give further active consideration to a recommendation, it should state this explicitly in its response.
The JCPAA has continued its efforts in encouraging an open and positive relationship with Defence.  It is pleased that the ANAO report has been a useful document for Army.  It has provided a positive stimulus for Army to re-evaluate AIRN's objectives, components and record-keeping, and has driven a process aimed at establishing appropriate readiness requirements and associated costs.
Although Army is reviewing AIRN, one area of particular concern to the Committee is the apparent lack of adequate analysis being applied to what constitutes sufficient warning time in a conflict, what constitutes a sufficient level of readiness, and the cost implications of readiness sustainability.  The Committee has recommended accordingly.
In the second report selected, the Committee reviewed the audit on the Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program, which gave $70.4 million to a total of 60 projects as part of the Centenary of Federation.  The audit concluded that the assessment process was rigorous, transparent and well documented and generally complied with the ANAO Better Practice Guide for the Administration of Grants.  For the most part, there was an effective audit trail.  However, there was room for improvement in the administration of the grants to ensure a clear audit trail for the selection of projects and the distribution of funds.
The Auditor-General found there was no evidence that any needs analysis had been conducted at a State or regional level or between the need for cultural or heritage projects prior to the introduction of the program.  A needs analysis can provide a basis for the allocation of funds to proposed projects and this would be administratively transparent.
The JCPAA strongly supports a rigorous needs assessment process so program funds are well targeted.  We therefore recommended in Report 380 that the Department of Communications, Information, Technology and the Arts implement its draft Guidelines for the administration of grant programs.  These Guidelines had been developed subsequent to the audit and had taken into consideration many of ANAO's recommendations.
Another matter of concern to the JCPAA was the lack of public detail about the reasons behind successful selection for the grants, or for failure to be selected.  Although the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage had documented their reasons for grant decisions under the program, these reasons were not released publicly.  While the release of this information is at the Ministers' discretion, the ANAO considers that, because the expenditure of public funds is involved, the reasons for selecting successful projects should be made publicly available—or at least on request.  The Auditor-General suggested that public perception and confidence in the openness of the decision-making process were important.
The Committee agrees with the Auditor-General in urging that the reasons for successful grants applications should be made available to those involved.  Applicants deserve transparent processes in this respect.
In addition, the Committee recommended that after grant decisions are finalised, all applicants, successful or otherwise, should be notified of the decision as soon as possible in writing, advised of relevant appeal processes and provided with guidance for improving subsequent applications.
DoCITA informed the Committee that its new departmental draft Guidelines on the Administration of Grant Programs—in line with the ANAO's Better Practice Guide—addressed the issue of early announcement of successful grant applications.  In addition, DoCITA determined that `the advice letter to applicants whose applications have been rejected should include information on how to appeal against the decision.'
The Committee is pleased with this outcome of applicants being advised as soon as possible after the ministerial/delegate decisions are made and being shown how to appeal the decision made, if deemed necessary.
The final ANAO report the Committee reviewed in this quarter was on the Management of Job Network Contracts, which audited the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the first round of Job Network contracts.  ANAO found that, on the whole, these contracts were managed in an efficient and effective manner by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.
One area where further improvements could be made was in departmental communication on strategic, issues, with provider representatives and Centrelink officers.  The Auditor-General found that these groups had not been brought together on a regular basis to consider proposed changes to the management of the Job Network program.  It would also have been beneficial if these groups had had opportunities to discuss how to approach significant issues confronting the Job Network.
The Committee was pleased to note that since the audit, senior officials from the department, Centrelink and other essential representatives meet every two months in the presence of the Minister for Employment Services to discuss matters of strategic and significant operational importance with respect to the management of Job Network.
The Committee agrees that this is a sensible arrangement, providing a forum where departmental representatives, Centrelink and Job Network providers can exchange views and consult about strategies to overcome problems that may arise.
The Committee believes that these regular meetings should help improve communication, especially on strategic issues, and assist in the smooth delivery of services to Job Network clients.  The department will be able to inform Job Network providers of program variations, hear their reactions and take these into consideration before finalising and implementing any changes.  The meeting of senior officials is a key to better implementation of change to the design of Job Network.
The Committee was informed by the department that it had taken into consideration all ANAO's recommendations in its development of the Job Network 2 contracts.  These improvements should further ensure that contract management will be more efficient and result in more effective compliance monitoring of and a better risk management approach to the Job Network programs.
In addition, the department has ensured that all Job Network contracts will provide the Auditor-General with access to the premises of Job Network providers and access to confidential information involved in contracts, should ANAO request these as part of an audit.  `Commercial-in-confidence' will no longer be a shield for Job Network contractors to shelter behind.
The Committee is pleased to note the department's implementation of JCPAA earlier recommendations on this issue of Auditor-General access to third party premises.  Such access will doubtlessly facilitate the Auditor-General's audit responsibilities where third party contractors are involved.
May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee the witnesses who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review process.
The Chairman has asked that his thanks be recorded to Members of the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports.  As well, he would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries.
Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-03-29,"—I want to make a few comments today in relation to this matter. It is notable that the government response to this report is, I think, about 14 lines of meaningless generalities. It was last considered in this place a little while ago and things seem to have gone from bad to worse for many dairy farmers since that time. The reason is obvious: the government failed to work with the dairy industry to develop a comprehensive, properly resourced plan to manage the deregulation of the industry and, as a consequence, a number of dairy regions have unnecessarily suffered significant adverse affects from deregulation. This is a package the government describes as a $1.7 million package—and I believe it is. The government indicates that it is responsible for the package, almost implying that it is putting up money, when it is not and when one considers that the initial position of the industry on the dairy restructure package was that the payments to dairy farmers should have been tax free and that the government rejected that. Various estimates are out there, but I think the compensation package of $1.7 million leads to revenue of about $500 million to the Commonwealth, of which they are putting up not one red cent. Because we have changed the arrangements and removed regulation, there is a package to allow the industry to restructure to some extent—and to the extent that it provides money, that is good—but there is a windfall, effectively, to the Commonwealth of half a million dollars. I do not think that should be forgotten in all of this.
One would have thought that this government would have learned something from its mishandling of the crisis that hit the Australian pork industry in 1997. In that case the government, firstly, resisted pressure from pork producers for help and, then, put in place a limited package to try to placate growers rather than deal with the problems confronting them in September 1997. According to the government, it was designed to boost the competitiveness of the industry, but it was totally inadequate. Then, on 10 June 1998, the then minister, Mr Anderson, and Mr Fischer, who I think was still Deputy Prime Minister, had a second attempt, announcing what was described as an `enhanced' assistance package for the pork industry. This package was also designed to enhance the competitiveness of the industry. It was more a response to the difficult political situation than to the needs of the industry. 
This second package provided an additional $9 million to go with the already committed $10 million—that is $19 million more than the government put into the dairy package, of course. But that package was still clearly inadequate and, in January 1999, yet another package was announced, which was worth $6 million and designed to assist people to exit the industry. I go back to the dairy package because, of course, there is an exit package funded entirely by the levy and not one cent of Commonwealth money is going to the exit package for the dairy industry. But in the pork industry the exit package was $6 million. Looking at the pork industry as a comparison, there was no coordinated strategy to address all the key issues facing the industry or to deliver in a timely manner; it was a disjointed approach and, in that case, it was driven by political pressure.
Tragically for the dairy industry, the government has adopted the same approach to assist that sector to manage deregulation. It has been clear to everyone for some time that this industry would be subjected to further deregulation. If the government were doing its job properly, as I have said before, it would have worked with the industry to develop a comprehensive plan to manage the process, but it did not. It said to the industry, `You give us a plan and we'll look at it.' The industry produced a plan and gave it to the government on, I think, 23 April 1999. But it was not until 28 September of that year that the government responded. That response did not flow from a combination of government and industry resources being applied to address the problem and build a comprehensive plan. The 28 September announcement was made by a reluctant government. And events have shown that that response was clearly inadequate, because it was a one size fits all approach that we on this side know, and knew then, would not work. In fact, the government had been forewarned by its own rural economic think tank, ABARE, that not all farmers in all regions would be affected in the same way. But the government chose to ignore that advice.
The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee then provided the government with a comprehensive plan in October 1999—that is, the committee did the minister's job for him again. The committee consulted properly with the industry and developed a plan. But that plan was also ignored by the minister—that was until March last year, when the minister was forced to extend the package to assist dairy regions adversely affected by the deregulation of the industry. But, then again, the guidelines for this regional assistance package were not released until 17 July. That is yet another example of policy on the run, of course. And, since that commitment, we have seen assistance to such key dairy region initiatives as funding of $220,000 for the Southern Cross Polocrosse and Equestrian Centre to upgrade its facilities and $55,000 for the Ipswich Grammar School Centenary Building Fund for wine promotion.
Despite having two goes at getting it right, the government's response was still inadequate. So last November the minister decided to commission a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics—ABARE—to investigate the impact of deregulation on the dairy industry. We have recently seen yet another dairy package announced by the government, this time for dairy farmers affected by floods, with a promise of more to come. So rather than doing its job, working out a comprehensive, properly resourced strategy and implementing that strategy in a timely fashion, yet again we have seen an ad hoc, disjointed approach driven by little more than political self-interest. In contrast, on 13 February, the Labor Party announced a strategy to assist this industry to get out of the Howard government imposed mess in which it finds itself. A special dairy task force was also established, which is currently meeting with farmers to get a first-hand view of the current state of the industry.
Effective and adequate assistance to regional economies is critically important. A plan to help regions should have been high on the government's list of priorities, but it was not there at all until last March. After we are elected to office—which may be later this year; it may be early next year—Labor will immediately review the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program to ensure that priority is given to projects that directly assist those who have lost jobs or whose income has been slashed as a result of deregulation. I do not think we will be giving money to a polocrosse club or to a grammar school's building fund to promote wine.
The priorities will be reskilling people—which one would have thought would be a vital part of any adjustment plan—and we will earmark $20 million of those funds to help farmers, processors and manufacturers improve their skills to increase productivity and profitability. Assisting people out of this industry will also be a key part of restructuring the dairy sector. We will review the operation of the Dairy Exit Program to make it more accessible to those who need it. We will also establish an inquiry into the operations and accountability mechanisms of dairy co-operatives. And we will respond to other issues that might emerge from the process of consultation through our dairy industry task force currently under way with the industry. These initiatives will go a long way to tidying up the mess that the government has created and the burden that that mess has imposed on Australian dairy farmers. One can only hope that we get a chance to do it sooner rather than later.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-03-29,"—Tonight I wish to address the issue of the Reserve Bank policies in relation to the setting of interest rates and the lack of transparency leading to those decisions. Last Friday's speech in Tokyo by the Reserve Bank Deputy Governor, Dr Grenville, not surprisingly attracted some political flak because of his GST observations. As far as I am concerned, it did provide the catalyst for a questioning of the bank's own policies in relation to two issues: firstly, damage done to business as a result of last year's interest rate movements; and, secondly, a lack of transparency of the bank's own board determinations.
Firstly, there does appear to be a lack of appreciation by the board of the Reserve Bank of the very severe impact that upward interest rate movements have on the confidence of business. Indeed, interest rate movements are a very crude mechanism by which to finetune the economy and keep it on an inflation free growth path. Dr Grenville at least got one thing right when he acknowledged that the current weakness in the Australian economy was likely to be short lived because the fundamentals of the Australian economy are indeed strong and because of recent budget surpluses, traditionally low interest rates and low inflationary expectations.
Given that the Reserve Bank is silent on the reasons for its own actions, Dr Grenville's extraordinary outburst blaming the GST for an economic slowdown does raise some interesting side issues, especially as his statement was made outside Australia. Therefore, to the cynic—and there are many around in Australia, including me—Dr Grenville's statements may well be seen to be an attempt to cover up some of the board's own inadequacies during the past 18 months in relation to its bewildering movement of interest rates and the problems that that has caused business. In that time, the Reserve Bank has moved interest rates seven times, and this has caused massive damage to business confidence as well as to business costs.
Therefore, I take this opportunity to state that there are a number of questions that now need to be asked of the bank board publicly from this chamber. Firstly, in raising rates last year why was the board so preoccupied with the value of the Australian dollar? Secondly, was the board itself not unaware that frequent rate rises inevitably place the economy hostage to international currency dealers? Thirdly, does the Reserve Bank not recognise that interest rate rises are inflationary since they inevitably get built into prices? The Reserve Bank policies over the past 18 months have cost businesses dearly, and one may well ask business: how many prices are now higher than they might have been without the board's frequent intervention on interest rates and the scale of that intervention last year? Inflation is rightly a concern of the Reserve Bank but, given the current environment in which we find ourselves today, we should be asking: is that focus at present too strong? 
Honourable senators should remember the disastrous impact 10 years ago of massive interest rate hikes driving the Australian economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression. Unemployment ran from 5.8 per cent to 11 per cent and interest rates rose to 17 per cent and beyond for those corporations with weak balance sheets. 
Perhaps the most significant reason for the past growth in the economy has been the impact of the coalition budget surpluses coupled with a reduction of government debt—thereby liberating funds for other purposes—a reduction in unproductive spending and a moderation of unreasonable wage claims rather than the management of interest rates by the Reserve Bank. I pose a further final question: is the Reserve Bank properly identifying those factors that the board can influence separately from those outside its control? 
Reasons for decisions are important in legal cases, just as good corporate governance requires the establishment of pathways or frameworks for decision making. Now may well be the time for the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision making process to be more open and transparent and for them to explain what influences the Reserve Bank's decisions rather than just have them merely entering the political fray by questioning the GST outside our shores.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Reserve Bank of Australia: Interest Rates</title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech
