Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I rise to introduce this private member's bill, which would provide for the establishment of a high-speed rail authority to oversee the construction of a high-speed rail network along Australia's eastern seaboard. This is the fifth time I have introduced the bill into this parliament and the last. The fact is that the government has sat on its hands when it comes to high-speed rail and we've had five years of inaction. In 2013 the High Speed Rail Advisory Group, established while I was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport in the former government, concluded that inaction is not benign and that an Australia without high-speed rail is a less prosperous one. That's why it recommended an authority to oversee the interjurisdictional issues between the Queensland, New South Wales, ACT and Victorian governments, local government and the private sector to drive this change. 


This recommendation came from the advisory group that included Tim Fischer, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, Jennifer Westacott, the head of the Business Council of Australia, a representative of the Australasian Railway Association and a representative of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union. It was a group of people dedicated to driving this change, which was intended to be bipartisan. That's why I established the advisory group. The authority is needed in order to make a difference now. Infrastructure Australia has estimated that significant savings can be made by preserving the corridor, making sure that all the land which is required is purchased now rather than later on. 


The two-stage high-speed-rail study undertaken by the former Labor government was comprehensive in its nature—it went down to the design of the very stations—and it found that the benefits were extraordinary. The benefits are not just in reducing travel times between Sydney and Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane to under three hours; the big benefit is that this is a decentralisation plan. This is about turbocharging those regional economies. It would, of course, provide significant jobs during construction, but it also would provide a significant economic boost in the medium and long term, particularly for regional Australia. 




The bill



The idea is that this authority's immediate priorities would be to finalise the track alignment and to work with Infrastructure Australia on the finalisation of a detailed business case, and it would then be able to go out to the private sector. We know that so many companies who've been successful in high-speed rail, construction and operation in Japan, China and Europe would be willing to participate. We know this because they've told us that that is the case. 




The project



The network would ultimately service two-thirds of Australians. 


The first section was anticipated to be Sydney to Melbourne via the Southern Highlands and Canberra, but you could extend that to consider Newcastle to Sydney as well. It would be a game changer. If cities like Newcastle and this great capital city of Canberra were within one hour from the CBD of Sydney, it changes the economics of business being located in those regional cities. Canberra is Australia's largest inland city. High-speed rail would produce a return of $2.50 of economic benefit for every dollar invested on the Sydney to Melbourne section alone.


The study that I commissioned to assess the project's viability identified that travel on the east coast of Australia is forecast to grow by about 1.8 per cent every year over the next two decades, which will be an increase of some 60 per cent by 2035. 


East-coast trips will double from 152 million in 2009 to 355 million in 2065. 


Population growth is greater than what was anticipated in the intergenerational reports—if anything, it was underestimated.


That's why, in 2017, Infrastructure Australia found that protecting and acquiring the corridor now would reduce the eventual cost of the project by up to $21 billion. 


We know that in the worst-case scenario, unrestricted development along the preferred corridor could mean that when the project is built more tunnelling will be required at a cost of $100 million per kilometre in today's dollars. That's why we need to get on with this. 


The Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities, chaired by my colleague the member for Bennelong, in its recent report Building up & moving out: inquiry into the Australian government's role in the development of cities concluded in recommendation 5:


… The Committee … recommends that the development of a fast rail or high speed rail network connecting the principal urban centres along the east coast of Australia be given priority, with a view to opening up the surrounding regions to urban development.


This was a unanimous report by the House of Representatives committee, and I congratulate them for it.


We need to stop talking. We need to get on with it. That's why it is tragic that we had done the work, in terms of the High Speed Rail Advisory Group, to recommend the creation of this authority and to establish funding for it—some $52 million to establish the authority was in the budget when the government changed—but it was reduced to zero, of course, by the incoming Abbott government, who walked away from that commitment.


Now we know that, according to leaked documents, the government has set aside $1.5 billion for preconstruction for high-speed rail, possibly never to be announced, given the change of prime ministership. What we need to do is to make that announcement and to get on with the job.




Financing



We also know there is strong interest from the private sector with experience in high-speed-rail technology.


That's why prior to the last election Labor announced that it would mandate the authority envisaged in this legislation to call for expressions of interest from international consortiums to participate in this project.


These consortiums would bring their expertise as well as their investment.


In addition, a portion of the funding for this major project could come from value uplift, which has been used for infrastructure projects for more than a century.


However, the study completed by the former government dismissed the idea that the project could be funded solely through this mechanism.


We also said prior to the last election that we would enact legislation to preserve the corridor along which the track would be laid.




Conclusion



Governments, of all political persuasions, should always aspire to be better.


At a time when there is much cynicism in the political system, a high-speed-rail network down the east coast of Australia is a true transformational project. It's one that has the support of the population. It is one that has the support of the business community. It is one that has the practical support of those people who are engaged in the industry itself. It's one that has international support.


We need to break the nexus between the short-termism of the electoral cycle and the long-term planning that is required to deliver these major transformative projects such as high-speed rail. That's why I established a committee including people like Tim Fischer. We need to recognise that a project such as this will go beyond one political term or one particular group of people being in government. How do you get that big change that Australia needs? It has to be bipartisan, and that's why the authority bill should be supported in this parliament.


The member for Newcastle will be seconding this legislation, and I'd encourage the government to bring it on for debate and a vote. I know that there are many on the other side of the House, including the member for Bennelong, who are genuinely supportive of high-speed rail. Let's get on with the job of actually achieving it. This is a visionary, nation-building project. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms Claydon:
  I second this bill for an act to establish the High Speed Rail Planning Authority and reserve my right to speak.

Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (10:24):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) the Government is asking the Governor-General to establish a Royal Commission into the Aged Care Sector;


(b) this Royal Commission will primarily look at the quality of care provided in residential and home aged care to senior Australians, but also include young Australians with disabilities living in residential aged care settings, as well as the challenges associated with the provision of aged care in remote, rural and regional Australia;


(c) evidence to date shows that the problems are not restricted to any one part of the aged care sector, whether it is for profit or not for profit, large or small facilities, or regional or major metropolitan; and


(d) the Royal Commission will look at the sector as a whole, without bias or prejudice, and make findings on the evidence;


(2) commends the Government for taking action to ensure that older Australians have access to care that supports their dignity and recognises the contribution that they have made to society; and


(3) calls on the Government to continue to provide record level funding to the aged care sector.


I am indeed delighted to put my name to this motion and commend the government for its decisive action in calling a royal commission into aged care, the key objective of which is to help build a national culture of respect for ageing and older Australians. I welcome the broad terms of reference announced just last week.


After learning of the abuses at Oakden and receiving recommendations of the review that followed, the government acted swiftly to improve regulation and to impose a new audit regime on the sector. The introduction of unannounced audits and accreditation visits has seen a substantial increase in the number of identified incidents over the past year, including a 177 per cent increase in reported serious risks and a 185 per cent increase in notices of noncompliance.


Yet, despite the significance of recent data that highlights serious issues, there is still strong evidence that Australia provides some of the best aged care in the world, and we should never lose sight of that fact. The Australian community has every right to expect only the highest standards when it comes to aged-care services that support the dignity of older Australians and the peace of mind of loved ones. Not only does the Australian government share these expectations but, as a government—and, I'm sure, as a parliament—we are determined that these expectations are met to ensure there are no exceptions.


The Prime Minister's announcement of a royal commission has a special significance for me as the member for Fairfax. This is because the Sunshine Coast region, where I share the local government area with the member for Fisher, has one of the highest concentrations of older Australians anywhere in the country. At the last census, 20.9 per cent of the Sunshine Coast population was over 65 years of age, compared to just 15.2 per cent for Queensland and 15.8 per cent for the entire country. It should therefore come as no surprise that I have a keen interest in the welfare of older Australians, with whom I meet regularly, as I do with their families and aged-care providers across my electorate.


I also meet regularly with the Fairfax Seniors Advisory Committee that I established soon after being elected, and we host a Fairfax Seniors Forum each year. The message from these groups is that while good progress on improving aged-care services has indeed been made, more remains to be done. Older Australians demand to be heard, and by hosting a series of community workshops later this month I intend to amplify the voices of my constituents to help inform the royal commission on the local situation. The message from the Sunshine Coast is loud and clear: they want firm action to identify and weed out substandard care wherever it is found. That is what this royal commission is all about, and this government should be commended for seeking to complement recent reforms with such a powerful response.


However, it's not enough simply to shine a bright light on the problems; real action must follow. Such action is not only a matter of legislative will but also of financial will, and that is the Liberal-National coalition's strong suit. As is also the case with nation-building infrastructure, when it comes to supporting older Australians the coalition actually puts money on the table. Today, under this minister, funding for aged care is at record levels and is expected to grow from $18.6 billion last financial year to $23.6 billion over the next five years.


This will improve the lives of older Australians and, thanks to the coalition's strong economic management, we can sustain the high-level services that older Australians expect and which they rightly deserve.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (10:30):  I want to start by acknowledging the families, friends and loved ones of those who have been affected by the aged-care media that we have seen in recent weeks. I will be very blunt. The LNP government's involvement in the care of older Australians is now clearly evident because the sector is in meltdown. This LNP government cannot cut billions of dollars from aged care and then wonder why the issues are so serious. Surely, older Australians deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, because in fact this is a human right. 


This government created this mess and now finally has decided to carry out a royal commission to investigate how the sector got into such a disastrous state. Well, let me give the government a hint: under now Prime Minister Scott Morrison's watch as Treasurer, the aged-care budget was used as an ATM to try to prop up the budget. As Treasurer, he ripped $1.2 billion from the aged-care system. Aged-care industry bodies warned at the time of the 2016 budget that cuts would result in declining standards of care, and—no surprise to anyone—that is exactly what has happened. It was always inevitable that these massive cuts would sadly lead to standards of care for older Australians slipping under the weight of the cuts. 


These cuts have also led to huge waiting lists for access to aged care—120,000 people across the nation are right now on waiting lists for access to in-home aged-care packages. In northern Queensland, there are more than 323 people waiting—people in my electorate, like Christine's mother. Sadly, Christine's mother passed away last year whilst she was waiting for approval of her aged-care plan. Christine's mother was on a plan in New South Wales, but when she moved to Townsville her mother had to apply again for an aged-care plan. What was really disturbing was the fact that Christine was notified by mail four months after her mother's passing that her package had been approved. This was both disgraceful and distressing. 


Labor fully supports the royal commission, but the royal commission must take a holistic analysis of the sector. Last week I met with my aged-care reference group and they formulated the following list. The act needs a review as there is serious concern that it is not fit for purpose in terms of the expectations of contemporary practice. It should investigate the provision of in-home care services, including the purchase of goods and services that are out of scope—capital works and renovations to dwellings, such as new bathrooms, and internal and external house painting to name a few. It should investigate the opportunity to implement emerging and innovative models of care and best practice across the entire sector. It should review the audit process related to aged-care standards, as the focus appears to be on financial and compliance aspects and not on service delivery and feedback from older persons and their families. The audit must include evidence of the voices of older persons who actually live in residential facilities. It should focus on workforce development and training. There needs to be a strong focus on quality and relevance of competencies to deliver a person-first approach. There should be staff ratios that recognise an effective skill mix and cultural competencies that meet residential needs. There should be a focus on access to aged-care services and facilities for people with complex mental health issues, including those who have been imprisoned. It should investigate the establishment of a funding model that is focused on the development of a co-design model of care, as opposed to services that simply meet a proposed funding envelope. It should investigate the growing incidence of elder abuse in both community and residential settings, including the use of chemical restraints; investigate ready access to advocacy services for older persons; and investigate access to appropriately skilled and qualified gender-relevant translators and/or interpreters. 


The Herbert electorate has an ageing population, and the issues associated with respectful care of our older persons from a human rights perspective are absolutely critical. We are an ageing population. In my electorate of Herbert, we have so many people who are in desperate need of aged-care services, particularly in-home care services. Our older persons are in desperate need of services and facilities in our community that help them live safely in their own homes for as long as is humanly possible. Older Australians cannot wait until after the royal commission; they need action right now. The government could start right now by reversing the billions of dollars that have been cut from the aged-care sector across the board, because this would make a significant difference to those people who are ageing in our communities as I speak.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Mrs MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (10:35):  I certainly support this motion and I commend Minister Ken Wyatt, who is at the desk at this time, for his decision to call this royal commission. Many people, as the minister is aware, choose my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia to come to retire. It is a fabulous part of the world, and I expect that perhaps the minister, when he comes back to where he was born in Bunbury, could well be part of the retirement group that exists in my fantastic electorate in the south-west of Western Australia. 


We all know that one of the great measures of a society is how well we treat our elderly citizens—the wonderful generations who have come before us, who certainly deserve our respect and our care. Elderly Australians—and it's not only elderly Australians; it's we, their families, as well—expect that the care that is provided in residential aged-care facilities is of the highest quality. Families like us also expect that level of service. 


We have so many wonderful facilities around Australia. Certainly, in my part of the world in the south-west, I have aged-care facilities that are providing beautiful care to people. There are the sorts of places that you walk into and think, 'When it's my turn, if I need permanent residential care, this is the type of wonderful facility that I would like to be in.' And really that's what we want. That's what the government wants, and that's what this royal commission will help to achieve. 


We know that, as a result of recent inspections and some very well-publicised incidents, Minister Wyatt and the Prime Minister announced the royal commission. There were too many incidents that certainly couldn't be overlooked. The evidence was there. We know that we have some of the finest facilities anywhere in the world. However, what we've seen through the unannounced audit process and the identified evidence is that there are, certainly, in some facilities, very serious risks. For example, a 177 per cent increase in services with serious risks was identified in just the past year alone. There was a 292 per cent increase in services with significant non-compliance. One service is being shut down by the Department of Health every month. There were 154 notices of non-compliance, which is a 185 per cent increase. Sanctions are up 136 per cent. These are the very facts that the government and the minister have been presented with, and it does make really tough reading. It means that some 2,000 residents—out of a group of just over 200,000—who are living in residential aged care and over 80,000 who are living with in-home care support, including those who receive that within retirement villages, were impacted by these incidents. Some 300 had to be placed in other services. For both the individuals and the families, that is a very tough issue to deal with. 


I know, having had to make the decision myself with my family, that one of the hardest decisions any of us make is when we are entrusted with the complete care of a family member, because they need a level of care that we cannot provide in their home or in another home. It's the complete type of care that is needed when high-level residential care is required. Whether it's your parents, your partner, your husband or wife, a dad, an aunty, an uncle or even a young person—whomever it is—they are very, very hard decisions. These decisions need to be made with confidence in the care that they will receive. That's what we want to know. When people we love go into care, we want to know they have the right level of care, which is why the government has called the royal commission. I commend the minister for this action.

"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (10:40):  Whilst Labor obviously has been very supportive of this royal commission, we wait to hear some of the terrible stories to come out of the royal commission. I think we all know the sorts of stories we are going to see and hear. I think that Australians are bracing for those stories. As the shadow minister, I've been in a position where I've had to listen to and counsel some family members about some of the terrible stories of people's experiences in residential and in-home care in Australia. What we as a parliament need to make sure and what the government needs to make sure is that we don't wait until the final report in April 2020 before acting. We need to make sure that the issues that we know are wrong today are fixed today. I have been very strong on that. I have obviously contacted the government, the minister and the Prime Minister, together with the Leader of the Opposition, about the terms of reference for this royal commission. I am pleased that they are very broad. I am still concerned that retirement village living is not included, given that a large number of people in retirement village living are also receiving home care services. I hope that the commissioners, under any other item, also look at this issue, because it is a significant issue around the country and a lot of older Australians, in my view, are signing contracts that they don't understand and they are not aware of what they are being asked to do in terms of the fees and payments.


As I said, I want to make sure that the government does act. The government has more than a dozen reports on its desk today. Some of those reports are about workforce. One, of course, is the Carnell-Paterson report into Oakden. To date, we've implemented one of the 10 recommendations. One has been partially implemented, with legislation in this place at the moment. There is a range of other recommendations that need to be implemented. We have the David Tune report into aged-care services in Australia and the government has responded to 18 of 38 recommendations. Another 20 recommendations are yet to be dealt with. So we do need to make sure that the government acts on these reports that are currently on its desk today.


The government have to accept some responsibility for where we are today. They have been in government for five years. For five years, they have been in charge of this system and, by calling a royal commission into this system, they're saying, 'We've mucked it up and things are bad.' After five years, that is what they are saying. Essentially, after three ministers and ripping billions of dollars out, they are saying, 'We now have a problem, so let's call a royal commission.' We're pleased the royal commission has finally been called. Of course, when Labor said the aged-care system was in crisis months ago, we were chastised and, indeed, the minister at the table said some things to the Leader of the Opposition about it being akin to elder abuse. I know that he has since said that, perhaps, he went a bit far in his comments, but we have been saying that there are some very serious issues in the aged-care system today. That does not take away from the hardworking staff and people in the aged-care sector. They work extraordinarily hard day in and day out to provide the best possible care to older Australians. Many older Australians do receive very-high-quality care, but what this royal commission will show is that there are people who are not receiving high-quality care. What we know is that, when you rip billions of dollars out—and the current Prime Minister was the then Treasurer who ripped almost $2 billion out of the aged-care system; $1.2 billion in his first budget came out of the aged-care budget, went back into consolidated revenue and was not spent on aged care—it has an impact on people. We know that it particularly has an impact on residents who have the highest needs in residential aged care, and that is those who require the most support and the most help.


We know that, today, there are 121,000 older Australians waiting for home care. Of those, more than 50,000 have no home care package at all. We know that many of the people waiting on that list need high-level care. They're waiting for level 3 and 4 packages. We know that, if they don't get that care, they often end up in emergency systems or in residential care. They should be able to get the care that they have been assessed for and that they need. Their families also need them to get that care so that they can return to work and not just be caring for their loved ones. We need to make sure that those people on that list get access to the care that they have been approved for and are entitled to.


We are a wealthy nation. We can and should do better when it comes to older Australians. There are so many issues that should be fixed today—that need to be fixed today. And, whilst supporting the royal commission, I implore the government: please, fix it today!

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (10:45):  Our government would firstly like to thank the community for their support for the establishment of the royal commission into the aged-care sector. I know it's an issue that has been raised within my electorate of Dunkley, whether in my local aged-care facility visits or across the community, as well as in the wider community across Australia. Around 5,100 submissions were received from aged-care consumers, families, carers, aged-care workers, health professionals and providers. I would like to thank the minister for aged care, as well as the Prime Minister, the cabinet and others for their significant work in bringing about the royal commission.


This is indeed a vital step for Australia—to determine the full extent of the problems in aged care and to understand how we can meet the challenges, as well as the opportunities, of delivering and improving upon aged-care services now and into the future. It is also about helping to build a national culture of respect, and increasing respect, for ageing and our senior Australians. Some of the issues that I came across through my own grandmother's experience, as I've mentioned in this place recently, were of concern to me. They brought about a personal understanding of some of the issues that people go through in aged-care facilities as well as in retirement villages and other sectors related to that. I note that many people in the aged-care sector and in our retirement-village sector do a great job. But there are those who are doing the wrong thing, whether they are individuals or certain elements within the aged-care sector.


I note that, on 9 October 2018, the Prime Minister announced that the Governor-General had issued letters patent establishing a Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. I would like to note now some of the issues that the aged-care royal commission will look into. Firstly, it will cover the quality of care provided to older Australians and the extent of substandard care. It will cover the challenge of providing care to Australians with disabilities living in residential aged care, particularly younger people with disabilities, which is an important element that we should not forget. It will also cover the challenge of supporting the increasing number of Australians suffering dementia and addressing their care needs as they age. It will cover the future challenges and opportunities for delivering aged-care services in the context of changing demographics, including in remote, rural and regional Australia, and it will also address any other matters that the royal commission considers necessary.


We know that there have been aged-care issues for governments, whether in the six years of the Labor government between 2007 to 2013 or the over five years of the coalition government since 2013. So these issues have gone across governments. To be fair, both Labor, when they were in government, and the coalition, while we've been in government, have been working to address these issues. But we need to go further, which is why the aged-care royal commission has been brought about. We need to look deeply into the issues, and we can't necessarily bring that about just through regular conversations. We can bring about the opportunity to speak to people, on a privileged basis as well, to see: what are the major issues facing the sector and where can we better address them? I am very proud of the actions of our government in launching this royal commission into aged care, particularly given some of the things that I've heard, for example, from my constituents, or some of the things we've seen on television or in the newspapers, not only over the last few weeks but over the last decade or more.


As I said before, I know, from my own family's experience, some of the issues across both the retirement-village sector and the aged-care sector. As I've said previously, I wish that my own grandmother had had the experience of some of the great places in my electorate, like the Village Baxter in Frankston, which has a very strong model and management, and has shown the ability to truly care for residents. I also had the privilege of going along to Village Baxter on the weekend. They had, at the conclusion of Seniors Week, an opportunity to have an open day and fete at the Village Baxter. I brought along my family—my wife and my daughter—not only to see some of the facilities but also to participate in some of the activities.


I should acknowledge and commend the students from Mount Erin College, which is the neighbouring school nearby, who were involved on Saturday, which is normally their day off from school. I thank the minister also for coming down on a number of occasions to speak about aged care in aged-care forums and for visiting a number of villages within my electorate. I am proud of the government's actions we have taken not only to improve the aged care sector but also with respect to the royal commission. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (10:50):  There is only one truth in this chamber today and that is our aged-care system is in absolute crisis and that for five years this government has failed to act, time and time again. In fact, the story of neglect is appalling. It is a story of cuts, $2 billion worth of cuts out of the aged-care sector. Since the 2014 budget, this government has been on notice that its work in this sector is coming up short. When first elected after the 2014 budget, I have a clear memory of visiting one of the not-for-profit aged-care facilities in my electorate to hear from the management there about the drastic impact the dementia supplement cuts were going to have on their day-to-day operations. I raised it in this House, as did many others on this side of the chamber. We knew that those cuts were going to have radical implications on the ground, particularly in the not-for-profit sector where they were going to be dealing with more and more high-care dementia patients with less and less funds to do so. It only got worse from there. We had a crisis around retirement villages that the member for Franklin spoke about often, as did I, and we called then for an ombudsman to look into that sector to make it easier for people to make complaints and to have their concerns heard.


We then come to the aged-care facilities and, again, we've had cut after cut after cut. The government signalled their intent in the 2014 budget and then, in the 2016 budget and the MYEFO, we saw further cuts. When the current Prime Minister was Treasurer, they looked for savings of $1.2 billion over four years with their changes to ACFI. 


In contrast, in May in this chamber in the budget reply speech, Labor leader, Bill Shorten, announced that a Labor government would make dementia and ageing a national priority, and here we are today talking about the royal commission into aged care. After failure after failure after failure, we find ourselves with the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. This is despite the Carnell-Paterson review, commissioned by those opposite, that was delivered in October 2017. It is now October 2018, and we're here talking about a royal commission but failing to act on the recommendations of that review until this week, when legislation will be brought into this chamber.


Our ageing population need to know that they will be able to age with dignity. They need to know that they will be able to stay in their homes for as long as they can, living independent lives, with support. We know that home care packages are the way to prevent people having to go into aged-care facilities for a longer period of time. They give people the best chance of staying in their homes and living a dignified life, and this government have failed in that space. In home care packages, they have failed. They've come up short at every opportunity. They then make announcements with a list of 121,000 people waiting for home care packages, 50,000 of those waiting for level 3 and 4 home care packages. They make an announcement that will put some home care packages into the system but go nowhere near covering the needs of our community. 


In contrast, in 2012, Labor went with Living Longer Living Better, an evidence-based policy about quality staff, about quality care, about dignity, about home care packages meaning people had preventative things put in place to avoid those accidents, to avoid those broken hips, to avoid the trips and falls, and to ensure that people could stay at home longer. 


Rather than put itself in a positive position, this government has failed to act for five years now across the entire space. The royal commission is necessary, but we know already that there are areas that could be fixed today if this government so chose. I join the member for Franklin and call on this government to take the actions we know will assist today, to increase the number of home care packages, to get this system out of crisis as quickly as possible. Yes, we need a royal commission, but we already know some of the faults and we already know some of the solutions. This government needs to act today.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (10:55):  One of the great privileges of being able to represent the good people of Goldstein in this place is, of course, that it is a forward-looking, modern, liberal community concerned about the issues not just of today but also of the future. When I go around the Goldstein electorate and speak directly to residents, one of the most critical issues that come to their mind and their agenda is aged care and making sure that people at a vulnerable stage of life—whether it is themselves or it is their loved ones—get the support, the care and the assistance they need to make sure that they can live out their lives with dignity in the way that they carried themselves at earlier stages of life.


That's why the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety is so important. While there are many good aged-care centres out there—and there are—and while there are many good aged-care workers, nurses, support staff and those who care for and support those people at that vulnerable stage of life every day and make sacrifices to do what is right, you cannot pretend that there have not been issues that have arisen from examples identified by this government, identified by state governments and identified, of course, by the media, which justify this royal commission to make sure that we are meeting the expectation that Australians have of us to support those at the latter stages of their life.


Of course, we know that these challenges are going to become more considerable and more complex over time. An ageing population is a testament to the wonder of modern medicine, economic progress and a society that values people for their full contribution and capacity in life. We have an obligation to support our elderly in the vulnerable stages of life and make sure they get that care. Goldstein, of course, is a perfect example of doing so. In Beaumaris, Black Rock and Brighton, more than 35 per cent of the population is aged over 55.


The royal commission is about correcting any trust deficit between aged-care operators and the community so that people can age with confidence. There are over 900 residential care providers across the country who will benefit from a reshaping and a rebuilding of that trust. The nurses, the care providers, the cleaners, the cooks and the volunteers help give our elderly healthier and happier lives. Their passion and commitment should be reflected in the sector's policies and governance, and that's why this government has made it such a priority.


We haven't twiddled our thumbs waiting for the commission's findings. The 2017 Legislated Review of Aged Care was a springboard for the changes announced in the 2018 budget to provide an extra $1.6 billion for home care. Aged-care funding will increase by an average of 6.4 per cent each year over the next four years. We also have legislated for new Aged Care Quality Standards, the first upgrade of standards in 20 years, and have introduced the bill to create the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, supported by $106 million to support better facilities, care and standards in aged care. And, since 2014, the government has allocated over 32,000 residential care places, and over 130,000 home care packages have been released and continue to be released at over 3,000 a week.


But of course what people want, what Australians want, is action. They don't just want to cover the issues affecting the elderly in aged care; they also want to make sure there's action affecting young Australians who need the support of aged care. I have already had constituents making sure that this issue is properly addressed. We can say with confidence that it is.


But, despite what may be revealed by the royal commission, one of the most critical things is that we do not beat up on the sector and diminish the standing of it when there are so many good people doing so much good work every day. We need to back them and to celebrate their achievements as much as we need to shine a very bright light into dark places. I was very privileged recently to be part of launching Fairway Aged Care, Bayside Aged Care's new facilities in Sandringham—only a week or so ago. It was a topic of great concern to the board and to the management there, including people like the president, Michael Scully, and the CEO and DON, Sandy May. Most critically, I was left with advice from the mayor and also Fairway's board member, Laurie Evans, who said, 'Tim, take it back to Canberra that there are so many of us in the aged-care and community space doing so much good work.' You heard Laurie. (Time expired)

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (11:00):  I'm very pleased to be able to speak on another occasion about aged care. The shadow minister, my good friend the member for Franklin, has moved several motions in this place, calling the government to account with respect to their serious delay in reporting key indicators with respect to access to vital aged-care services. Now I'm dealing with a motion moved by a member of the government. I thank the honourable member for moving the motion.


I must say that too often we are tempted in this place to deal with motherhood statements. It is obvious in this case that all Australians want to ensure that we look after our elderly. It is obvious that Australians can receive timely access to a level of service appropriate to their needs in their later years. But it's also a time for plain speaking, for honesty and for a direct discussion about failures in our aged-care system. Yet again I say that Labor welcomes the government's decision to hold a royal commission into the aged-care sector.


It is of course appropriate to recount why a royal commission is necessary. Around 1.3 million Australians are currently receiving some form of aged care provided by approximately 400,000 nurses and carers. By 2056 it is projected that the aged-care workforce will need to triple to around one million workers required to deliver services for more than 3.5 million Australians, and older people will represent an increased percentage of Australians. Public expenditure on aged care is expected to double as a share of the economy by the 2050s. I say again: on the present policy settings, aged-care expenditure is expected to double. That of course does not represent additional investment—an opportunity for this lot to crow about their commitment to record funding—that is merely maintaining the status quo. So that is the policy setting.


What have we seen on this government's watch? Right now, the aged-care system is in crisis. The fact that the aged-care system is in crisis should be obvious to any reasonable observer. It was obvious to many before this royal commission was called. When Labor raised this issue, when we pressed the issue—as we must in calling the government to account—we were heavily criticised by the minister. Indeed, when I've spoken on motions that I've previously referred to I'm tempted to say that the minister responded with bluster and obfuscation—indeed, with denial. Now this crisis is recognised implicitly with the calling of a royal commission. Billions of dollars have been cut from aged care in the past five years by this Liberal government. The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, cut almost $2 billion in his first year as Treasurer and, shamefully, his government denies that fact. There are 121,000 people on the home care package waiting list, including over 88,000 with high needs—many living with dementia. More than a dozen reviews and reports, including hundreds of recommendations, still sit on the minister's desk without being actioned. Three different aged-care ministers across the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have had the responsibility for this for the past five years but have failed to undertake any real reform across the aged-care portfolio.


Aged care has been a policy area which has attracted a significant level of bipartisanship. Labor introduced welcome reform with its Living Longer Living Better reforms. It's important to understand that the central philosophy driving policy was that of consumer-directed care, providing greater choice for older Australians, not just as to the care they wanted but also delivering independence and support to live at home for as long as possible. There was a growing wave of outcry from the public about the quality of care older Australians have received, particularly in residential aged-care facilities. This was highlighted by the investigations around elder abuse and neglect at the South Australian Oakden facility. In response to the Oakden inquiry there was a Senate inquiry. This triggered the government to commission a review, which is better known as the Carnell-Paterson review. This review was handed to the then Turnbull government in October 2017. 


This government has not addressed this policy area with any success, which is evident from the significant level of public concern around the aged-care sector. More than a dozen reviews and reports, including hundreds of recommendations, still sit within government. They sit on the minister's desk without being actioned, even though this royal commission has been called. The royal commission is to be welcomed, but we need action. We need something to be done now, not waiting for the results of the royal commission. (Time expired)

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2018-10-15,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (11:05):  Firstly, I acknowledge the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, who is in attendance in the chamber, and I thank the minister for the visits he has made to my region. Aged care is an incredibly important provision of services into my local region for some very simple reasons. The first one is that as at March 2018 I had 27,738 people on the aged pension and 47,506 on a pension concession card. That is a substantial amount for local voters in the Hinkler electorate who will need these services moving into the future. It is an important issue for them, so it is an important issue for me. Can I also congratulate the member for Fairfax, better known as 'Super Ted' O'Brien, for bringing forward this PMB and giving us the opportunity to demonstrate our support. 


As I said, all issues are local. For my people, simply because they live in a regional area does not mean that they are second-class citizens. It does not mean that they should have fewer services or lower ability to access those services than their city counterparts. Unfortunately, over a long period of time we have seen, particularly around ACAT assessments, real difficulty for the Labor state government to deliver those assessments in any reasonable time frame. At a federal level we continue to fund those, but unfortunately we do not see sufficient services in the regions to do these in any reasonable time. That means that people wait longer to get themselves onto the waiting list and they wait longer for a package, right from the commencement point. This is the challenge that we've addressed sometimes before, but we do need to address it again. Certainly, consumers do not understand the difference in the packages from 1 through 4. They certainly don't understand that prior to level 4 they may still be waiting for those packages for a considerable amount of time. I personally think that is unacceptable. We need to do better, in terms of the delivery of these packages into regional areas, particularly for those smaller centres. If you live in Monto or Eidsvold or Biggenden, all inside the electorate of the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd, those services are provided in the major regional centres, in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. It means that their loved ones have to travel to those regional centres to visit them. 


Once again, I want to point out the work of the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care. Ken Wyatt has worked in very difficult circumstances. Let's face facts here: it is very often that these circumstances are with grieving families. They are grieving families who have found themselves in a position where their loved one has passed on. It is a tough role, and I congratulate him on the work that he's done. I also congratulate the member for Goldstein. We don't often see eye to eye, but on this we do. We cannot tar everyone in the aged-care industry with the same brush. We cannot say to the entire aged-care industry that they are not performing, that they are in crisis. The reality is that there are very hardworking people in the aged-care sector who are doing a good job. There are aged-care residential services that are doing a fantastic job, particularly in my electorate. We have any number of new facilities which have just opened in the last 12 months which are top class—five star. In fact, one of them I always looked at as a cruise ship offering. It's quite incredible. Where there are those bad seeds that are not providing sufficient services, where those organisations are not providing sufficient boots on the ground, then it is the department's role to crack down on them. That is what we have been doing. Once again, I thank minister for aged care for the action that he took in one particular residence in my electorate. I must say, again, that it is not a reflection on the sector that you have one individual organisation with some challenges that need to be addressed.


The aged-care royal commission has been called. It will be about facts; it will not be about people out there politicising this very difficult issue. It will be about an individual with the resources and the facilities to investigate the facts, make determinations and make further recommendations. It is a difficult sector. As I've said, these are people who demand our respect and who deserve our respect. They have lived through changes in technology, like you wouldn't believe, from the donkey hot water system and the combustion stove. They've been through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. They have lost children and grandchildren on their way through life. When they find themselves at the tail end and not the beginning, it is up to us to ensure the facilities and services that they need and deserve are provided. I look forward to the results of the aged-care royal commission, and certainly to getting to the facts and establishing what we can do to improve those services for them.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:10):  I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and pay my respect to their elders past and present. We can learn a lot from the oldest continuous civilisation on the planet. We are privileged to inhabit this continent of Australia. Indigenous Australians honour their elders, and so many of the different ethnic communities in my electorate honour their elders. So many cultures around the world have their elderly stay with the younger family; it's seen to be a responsibility that they have. I think when we look at the Australian aged-care system, which has developed very differently, we have a culture in this country where people go through it, perhaps in steps, and end up in aged-care facilities. We should bear that in mind and we should ensure that respect is at the centre of the way we treat those people who've helped build this nation, who've helped raise families and who've helped make a difference. That's why I support the government's decision to finally agree with Labor's call for a royal commission into the aged-care sector.


We didn't need to watch Four Corners to know that this aged-care system is facing a crisis. The truth has been around for some time. Over recent years there has been increasing media attention of the problem. We've heard disturbing reports about frail aged Australians being mistreated in facilities meant to be dedicated to their wellbeing. This is a many-layered problem and a problem we must not ignore. It's about inadequate resourcing. It's about pay levels for aged-care workers. It's about ensuring that aged-care facilities meet required standards and taking action when they do not. It is about that culture of respect.


Safeguarding the dignity of older Australians is a fundamental responsibility of this parliament. About 1.3 million Australians are supporting residential home and community aged care, including home support packages and services such as social support and meal delivery. That figure includes 240,000 who call an aged-care facility home. These people are our parents or grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters or, indeed, friends. That's why Australians need to be secure in the knowledge that, as we all grow old, when we reach a point where we need assistance to look after ourselves there will be a society that pledges to look after them.


Funding is critical. It does matter. That's why the government's changes to funding, which they called a cap to the Aged Care Funding Instrument, needs to be called out for what it is. It was due to grow by $3 billion. Instead, as a result of the now Prime Minister's first budget, it is due to grow by $1.8 billion. That's a 1.2 billion cut. That cut was not put into other areas of aged care; it was simply put back into consolidated revenue. Then, that was followed up with another $500 million cut, meaning that $1.7 billion has been ripped out of the system by this ATM government—an ATM government that is not putting dollars back in; an ATM government that just takes deposits, but not withdrawals that are then used for the benefit of elderly Australians. I hope that the royal commission will act as a reminder to all governments that, whilst spending matters, people matter too and we need to make a real difference with this royal commission. It is good that government is having a royal commission, not for political purposes but to make a difference. I think it can certainly do this.


In the remaining time, I want to say that the issue of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds particularly has to be addressed. Elderly people from these backgrounds lose their English in many cases and go back to their first language, and they need specific support arising out of this. We need, too, as the Prime Minister has said, a culture of respect for older Australians. That's something the parliament should unite on.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (11:16):  I come here today not to praise aged care but to bury it. This motion by my good friend the member for Fairfax goes a long way to expressing the challenges that our nation faces. Everyone else in this debate has noted that our population is ageing rapidly and our capacity as a community to pay for this ageing cohort's health will also become increasingly difficult to fund as the number of people who are of working age proportionately decreases. Increasingly, as a community, we are asking people to fund their own care into old age. In return, the least we can do is to ensure that the quality of the care is improving, of good quality, and reliably so.


Both parties, I believe, come to this debate largely with clean hands. Previous Liberal ministers such as the member for Menzies and the member for Pearce were both pathfinders when it comes to aged care. The sector still considers both of them to have been the best of the best. They've both instituted a policy framework that got out of the way where it could and emphasised the importance of delivering reliable and quality care, but otherwise allowed providers the maximum flexibility to provide care that fitted the needs of our community. This allowed private providers to come into the sector and massively improve both the quality and range of care as well as the level of aesthetics that a resident and their family could expect. When I first started working in aged care, in 2004, I still remember walking into the UnitingCare nursing home at Croydon and being overcome with the stench of urine. This was by no means an isolated incident. I once visited a facility in Bathurst where the staff were all in the parking lot smoking as I drove in. I could not find anyone to help me and nearly all of the residents were in a cold common room watching a fish tank.


I'm glad to say that after the reforms of the members for Menzies and Pearce this has largely stopped. The massive investment by private sector operators has lifted the care and quality of aged care out of a postwar malaise in which aged care was seen as an annexe to the local hospital.


The member for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler, should also be noted in this debate. His reforms were both overdue and needed. They took the focus off form and onto substance. These reforms firmly put the focus on the care of residents first and foremost and stood up to the entrenched interests groups in the sector who have other concerns. The current minister, Ken Wyatt, who is in the chamber at the moment, has worked admirably to improve upon those changes, including massively expanding the number of unannounced audits.


This is not to say, by any means, that all is well in aged care. I want to see a more perfect system. Our work towards that will never be finished and nor should it be. However, in any consideration of how to move towards the perfect, we should emphasise those things that have worked and have provided better care for our tribal leaders. The reforms that have allowed so much private investment have massively lifted the performance of the entire sector. Consumer choice has put pressure on providers to give all the quality of care and life that they deserve in their last home. This incentive has meant that we are far more aware of when providers fall down and do not live up to our expectations.


But we should not ignore the failures. The artificial cap on bed places has meant too many Australians are forced to stay at home or else go into nursing homes that do not meet the standards that we would hope for as a community. This artificial cap on competition has brought about situations like the Oakden nursing home scandal in South Australia, in which the Butler reforms were universally ignored. The then South Australian government cared more about those working at the facility than the people they were meant to be caring for. 


If the royal commission achieves nothing else, it should be this: that whatever government strictures there are on choice of our tribal elders are removed, when it comes to their final home, especially if this allows more investment; and that no government should care more about the vested interests of those working in aged care over those that they are meant to be caring for.

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (11:20):  I must say I find it galling how quick government members, like the member for Fairfax, have been to shower themselves with praise for establishing a royal commission into the aged-care sector, how quickly they've been to pat themselves on the back after it took them such an excruciatingly long time to act. There is no member opposite who can truthfully say they have done all they can to fix the crisis in the aged-care sector that has been allowed to happen. There was no member opposite who could say, when the damning reports of rife exploitation within the sector were heard, they responded quickly and appropriately. And no member opposite can say they have been standing up for the seniors in their constituency by ensuring that they have access to the care that they need, be it in a dedicated facility or through a home care package. We are still waiting for action and yet we see the government congratulating themselves on a job well done.


Referring this crisis to a royal commission is a start. It's a start but it's nothing more. We know that there is a dire problem now. We know that we need to act now because, in the short-term, a royal commission won't change anything—at least not until the report's handed down and that's not until mid-2020. The government cannot use the royal commission as an excuse to delay fixing this crisis now, but this motion seems to indicate that they intend to do exactly that. Instead of patting themselves on the back before resting on their laurels, the government need to act now. They have a moral obligation to do so and they need to do it now because things just seem to be getting worse.


I'd like to just give an example to the government and the members listening here. I was speaking to the wife of a constituent recently who's been approved for a level 4 package. He has taken a level 2 package just to get some support. This man's wife's employer and her co-workers have raised $10,000 to help provide simple and basic care and support that this aged-care package isn't providing because he's had to take a lower package than what he's entitled to. It is absolutely disgusting. It is not just constituents who are raising with me the fact that they are waiting for their package or for the appropriate package. I have GPs in my area who are contacting me, advocating on behalf of their patients, asking me to get something done now for their patients. It is the whole community that is outraged about this.


It was when the June 2018 quarter of home care packages was released that we saw just how negligent this government has become with its treatment of older Australians. Since the first release of data, the waiting list for home care has grown from 88,000 to more than 121,000 older Australians waiting for packages. This is an appalling indictment on the Prime Minister and the government that he leads. Despite having claimed that aged care would be a focus of this prime ministership, Prime Minister Morrison has stood idly by as things have become worse and worse. This is unsurprising given his track record. Let's remember, as Treasurer, this Prime Minister ripped almost $2 billion from the care of older Australians—$2 billion caring for the very people who built this nation—and then he questions why things are getting worse. This is typical Liberal Party behaviour—cut first and ask questions later. 


I will always stand up for older Australians in my electorate. Seniors living in Caboolture, Bribie and Burpengary all deserve to live in comfort and with dignity. They deserve compassion and they deserve the care that they need. I'm proud to be part of Labor, who will be fighting for what's right. We're committed to a strong and sustainable aged-care system, one that delivers choice, easy access and better care for older Australians and their families and their carers. 


In the few seconds I have remaining, I'd like to make a special mention of the amazing, hardworking qualified professionals, people like Heather Jackson, delivering nursing care and personal care to those in our aged-care sector. They continue to deliver for older Australians while this government sits by and does nothing.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:26):  I rise to speak in support of the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018, moved by my friend and colleague the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon. This would reintroduce an inspector-general, a position that was let lapse by the Abbott government when it was elected in 2013. The reintroduction of an inspector-general would see the further strengthening of our live export regulatory system. It builds upon Labor's proud achievement of creating the Export Supply Chain Assurance System in 2011, which was in response to a Four Corners report that recorded atrocious acts of animal cruelty within Indonesian abattoirs. 


For a number of years now, ESCAS has effectively enforced animal welfare standards in other countries. While ESCAS is a great Labor achievement, more needs to be done to prevent future incidents of animal cruelty. For example, the shocking footage obtained by 60 Minutes on 8 April this year exposed the hideous conditions that Australian sheep were being subjected to during long-haul live export voyages to the Middle East. Unfortunately, this is not a one-off event. The 60 Minutes footage covered onboard treatment of live sheep over a series of voyages. Upon seeing the original footage, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, said: 


I've seen that footage and I was absolutely shocked and gutted … This cannot go on. 


He continued:


We saw sheep that basically died from a heat event that were left and decayed, that were unable to get to water and food, and it disturbs me greatly that this has happened.


If that is the case then the government must commit to immediately halting the northern live sheep trade, phasing it out completely within five years, as Labor has pledged to do. During the five-year transition period, Labor will impose the highest regulatory standards. Labor will work with farmers, unions and industry on a strategic red meat industry plan to do more value-adding here in Australia. This will be good for farmers. It will be good for animal welfare standards and good for the Australian economy. Labor will end the live export of sheep and Australia will be better off for it. 


There can be no doubt that appointing an inspector-general of animal welfare and live animal exports is integral to preventing further cases of animal abuse, such as the kind that was seen in Indonesia in 2011 and during long-haul live export voyages earlier this year. Not only does this bill and the appointment of an inspector-general have the support of the caucus of the Labor Party; importantly, it has the support of the live export industry itself. So it's hard to see why the government is so opposed to this practical measure. The only people opposed to this bill are some of those opposite in the deeply divided rabble that is the ATM government of Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison.


Indeed, it's a fact that the Liberal member for Farrer, Sussan Ley, introduced her own private member's bill in May to stop live sheep exports entirely. Ironically, the member for Farrer has now withdrawn her support from voting for this bill. The fact is that a majority of this parliament—of the House of Representatives and the Senate—supports this legislation. So why is it that it is not going through this parliament? This is a failure of our democracy if it doesn't happen.


Our animals need support and our agricultural sector needs strong and sustainable regulation. Both of these measures can be achieved by supporting this legislation. And the parliament needs to wake up to how angry the Australian population are about these issues not being addressed. Anyone who looks at that footage can't possibly say that this is okay to just continue. This should not be a partisan issue; we should be bringing on this bill for a vote and we should be carrying it through both houses of parliament. I commend the bill to the House.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2018-10-15,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England) (11:31):  I rise to speak on the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018. I think we should remember some of the basic facts here: 99.7 per cent of sheep that go to live export get off the ship in a better or the same condition—99.7 per cent. Of course there are times where there are issues that need to be addressed—absolutely. There are issues that need to be addressed, like there are on the roads if there is an accident, or like there are in a factory if there is a workplace accident or like there are in so many areas. But those are not solved by closing down an industry. And that seems to be the intent of the Labor Party: to close down an industry.


We've had a go at this before. They closed down the live cattle industry and that ended in an absolute disaster for the people of Northern Australia and for Indigenous communities—for the whole lot—because there was this sense, this conceit, that thousands of kilometres away they were going to make a decision about other people's lives. And now we're going down this path again. They're deciding, without any real attachment to the industry, without actually being in the industry, that they're going to close another person's industry down.


We know the path that this will follow. The people who are pursuing this are not going to stop with live sheep. After they've finished with live sheep, it will be live cattle. And after it's live cattle, it will be the transport industry. You can't believe for one second that these people—the animal rights people with this anthropomorphic principle that all animals are people and all people are animals—are going to relent after they close down just one section of the live export industry.


In this nation, under this government, we have made it our target to get a better return to the farm gate. Whilst the Labor government was there, there was no real escalation—in fact, agricultural output in their last quarter went backwards. Agricultural returns went backwards. But we brought about that record return for lambs, mutton and live sheep. We went to Western Australia and Western Australian towns, and they said: 'You have to do something about revitalising the economics of these towns. You have to get the live sheep trade going again.' And we did, and it did. So now we are saying to these regional towns: 'Sorry, you go back to being poor. That's what we're going to deliver to you. We're going to make an edict from here, from the inner suburbs, that you be poor. We think that's the only thing you deserve: to be poor.'


And that comes from the Labor Party, which is supposed to support those on the peripheries. And there is their vague promise, 'Somewhere down the path there is going to be something that may help you.' No-one is going to believe that. No-one takes them seriously. We can't take them seriously, because we've got to take them by their track record—their track record which decimated regional towns and industries, and that has no empathy and no understanding of those away from the inner suburbs of the major urban capitals.


We also have to note that we're living in a global economy and note the cultural practices of some of our major trading partners. Some of our major trading partners in agricultural products are Islamic. I spent a lot of my time as a minister going to the Islamic countries to make sure that we were seen as a global trading partner. Now we're deciding that we'll no longer do that. After we've stopped preaching to regional towns, we'll start preaching to Islamic countries around the world about how they should act. I'll tell you what: they're not going to listen to our sermon. We've got to be really careful because, if we start having a conceited approach to how they live their lives, they might have a very parochial approach as to how they trade with us, or whether they do at all. Might I remind people that there are a lot of meatworkers in the processing sector who sell meat to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait and, if we lose those markets, there will be downward pressure on their jobs and a reduction in their prospects.


We're expanding. I think the biggest manufacturing industry in Australia is the meat processing industry. That's where the jobs are, and it's worked hand in glove with the revitalisation of the ag sector because of the returns that are there. The Labor Party represent a closure of the live export industry. They represent a reduction in income to regional towns. They want you to go back to being poor. That's what they believe you should be. If you're in a regional town, away from an urban capital, the Labor Party have no policy for you but that you should be poor again.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (11:36):  Today I speak in support of the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018. My colleague the member for Hunter and shadow agricultural minister has formulated legislation that would make Australia a world leader in animal protection in live export industries. The former speaker, the member for New England, boasted that 99.7 per cent of animals reach their destination in a better state or the same state in which they left. Well, if that figure is indeed true, then point 3 certainly troubled many Australians. I and many of my colleagues and those across the chamber have received hundreds, if not thousands, of emails about this. It has been one of the issues that has engaged people like none other. People who live in the bush and produce have also sent me emails saying, 'We don't want to see the animals that we produce treated this way.'


Coming from a radio background, I distinctly remember the dark days in 2011 when the switchboards lit up as people across Australia saw the horror unfold before them in the Indonesian abattoirs. It was visceral. People reacted because they, on some level, thought, 'This is not how we, at the top of the food chain, should be treating the animals that get there.' No-one is suggesting that we shouldn't eat or consume meat—that's a big thing and that's what we do—but we have to treat those animals with respect. I think that's why we've seen such an incredibly heartfelt response from the people of Australia over this issue. We know we're better. We know that we have the capacity to treat the animals with dignity that we and others consume.


Whilst Labor supports the sustainable live export industry, where acceptable animal welfare standards can be achieved, the Australian public are becoming increasingly concerned about breaches to the current regulations. People in my electorate want guarantees that animals exported from Australia will not be subject to the types of abuse most of us have seen on our TVs, on our phone screens and on the internet. Abuse of livestock, particularly in the live export industry, is not new, but what has changed is technology, and investigative journalism has brought us pictures that we never saw in the decades before. We know that this has potentially been going on for as long as the trade itself has been going on, but what we have now is images and that's what make it all so very confronting. Public sentiment shifted dramatically following that ABC Four Corners program which screened the terrible acts of animal cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs. Community outrage forced the government's hand and the live cattle export trade was suspended, pending improvements in the industry. There is no doubt that this was an extraordinarily difficult time for producers and exporters alike, but we responded, not like this government, which turns tail and does nothing. No-one, including producers, wants to see those animals mistreated. Producers are often the first ones on the phone and on the email to say, 'This is not what we want to happen to the animals that we've produced.' But this environment paved the way for the establishment of the Export Supply Chain Assurance System, known as ESCAS. Internationally it was recognised as a good animal-welfare assurance, or guarantee.


Over time it became evident that more needed to be done, and in 2013 Labor announced that it would establish the inspector-general for animal welfare and live animal exports, or IGAW. The IGAW's role would be to review the regulator's processes and systems to ensure that the regulator was working with the regulatory framework. This would include the regulator's processes and decisions under the new ESCAS reforms.


True to form, in October 2013, that same year, when in government, the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, and his then Minister for Agriculture, the member for New England, scrapped the inspector-general for animal welfare and live animal exports. The Abbott-Morrison government subsequently scrapped two parliamentary committees committed to contributing to animal welfare strategies. The former agriculture minister has nothing to boast about in terms of the agricultural industry. At his best, he was absent and, at worst, obstructive in improving this space, handballing responsibility to the Australian veterinary authority, which has neither the resources nor the leverage of government.


This private member's bill calls on members to support the re-establishment of the independent statutory officer, and I recommend it strongly to this House. This do-nothing government should do something about this. (Time expired)

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (11:41  I rise to speak on the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018, this private member's bill by the member for Hunter. It seems to me that, in so much of our political conversation in Australia, conversations taking place are often mired in misinformation. Certainly, so it is in the case of the live export trade. As someone who farmed for over 30 years and had sheep on my property for about 95 per cent of that time, I can tell you that I am completely committed to the welfare of the animals. I understand that animals are raised with a specific purpose. In the case of merino sheep, they are for wool, but they are also for human consumption. Somewhere along the line there comes a reality about that, and we need to recognise that reality.


Farmers produce animals for various reasons. I touched on the merinos. Merinos, of course, produce one of the finest fibres in the world, one that is actually riding on a great high at the moment. But farmers need to sell their stock. Sometimes they've reached the end of their useful life; sometimes they are surplus to requirement owing to droughts; and always we hope for an increase in our flock that will go to the human consumption market.


In the case of lambs, lamb is Australians' preferred way of eating sheep. I won't say mutton, because 'mutton' refers to a sheep at a different stage of its life. A lamb is something that's less than 12 months old, but the 12 months is actually measured by dental development in the animal. The day that those first two large front teeth—just like our children when they are six years old—cut through the gum, they turn from being a lamb into being a hogget.


Now, 'lamb', of course, is a very marketable name. We've invested a lot of money in Australia into marketing lamb. Unfortunately the day it turns to 'hogget', it does not seem to be so attractive to the public. I think that's misinformation in itself. A number of people over the years have said to me, 'I don't want to eat old hogget.' Of course, there isn't any such thing as old hogget, because that particular sheep is only a hogget until it cuts its four teeth—until the next set of teeth come through. They come through in roughly 12 months time again, so that's what we would call a two-year-old. Then of course the meat becomes 'mutton'.


Once it's become mutton, it's particularly unfavourable for the Australian public. We've got to think about why farmers would keep a sheep until it turned into mutton rather than having sold it off as a lamb. Firstly, when the lambs are born, about 50 per cent of them are male and about 50 per cent are female. The females are generally kept for breeding purposes, but they will be assessed on their wool value sometime after they become hoggets, not when they are lambs. Consequently, there is already a part of this market where Australian marketing is not preferable. The wethers are castrated at around four or six weeks old. They might be for wool production for a time, and then they need to be sold off. 


The export industry is largely based on wether sales and ewes that are deemed to be unpregnant. They might be barren ewes is, for instance. They need to be preg tested before they go on boats. The industry is very necessary—it is the safety valve for Australian farmers. It's the reason why the trade exists. It's good for farmers, because it's a necessary way of unloading sheep that are not particularly palatable for our domestic markets. They are also not particularly palatable for our chilled markets, in so much as the areas that we sell these live sheep into demand that they have a live sheep. 


Whilst they are prepared to accept some chilled beef, it is worth reflecting on the market of Bahrain, for instance. Up until about 2015, Australia was supplying around 11,800 tonnes of chilled meat into the Bahrain market. We lost our pre-eminence there as the live sheep provider, and we lost 40 per cent of the chilled meat market along with it, because these companies—these countries—actually trade as an entity. They are looking for trusted trading partners, which is why we need to be steady and careful about the things that we do in this place that disrupt those long-term trade arrangements we have made with other countries. With all things, I urge caution around the live sheep trade. It is very important to the farmers, particularly of WA and certainly of my electorate of Grey as well.

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (11:46):  I rise to speak on Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018 introduced by the shadow minister for agriculture and member for Hunter. The purpose of this bill is to re-establish an independent statutory officer to watch over the regulation of the live export sector. His or her role will be to ensure that correct animal welfare standards are maintained, and, when there is an alleged breach, that the regulator fully and properly investigates the matter, comes to the right conclusions and imposes appropriate sanctions. 


When in government in 2013, Labor appointed an interim inspector-general of animal welfare and live animal exports. Unfortunately, the incoming coalition government did not proceed with the legislation necessary to make the position permanent. That was the wrong decision, which has proven to be devastating for animal protection. This government has been consistent in its opposition to the appointment of an inspector-general. We've made it clear that a Shorten Labor government will, at the first opportunity, put an end to the northern summer live sheep trade. The evidence on this is clear, and the community sentiment is clear. The northern summer live sheep trade is just not possible, because it's cruel. We've stated that, during the necessary transition period, we'll put regulations in place that will ensure the highest standards, proper oversight and appropriate sanctions for breaches, including the establishment of the inspector-general as an independent statutory position. The inspector-general will be responsible for advising on the protection of animals in all Commonwealth regulated activities and will report directly to the minister on issues like live animal exports, animal welfare standards and required guidelines. The inspector will also work with the states and territories to establish an independent office of animal welfare to oversee animal protection and welfare activities nationally. This re-establishment of state and territory cooperation on animal welfare matters will ensure a consistent national approach and continuous monitoring. 


Labor supports the sustainable live export industry where acceptable animal welfare standards can be achieved. In government, Labor will provide more transparency and accountability around the live export trade. For a long time, Labor has been calling for these changes, as have many in the community. Like many members of this House, I have received thousands of letters and emails in recent months about the live export trade. It took the horrifying Awassi Express incident to get a response from this government—a response that did nothing to fix the systemic issues with the long-haul sheep trade. They have now withdrawn even their very small token measures. It is clear the government is not willing to deal with the abuses that have occurred on its watch. This is a heartless approach. The Awassi Express incident has made it clear that the regulation isn't working. The current system is cruel. You simply cannot load 50,000 or 60,000 sheep onto a boat for four weeks and sail them through some of the hottest and most humid climates in the world and expect animal welfare expectations to be upheld. That is the reality. As one of my constituents said, if you treated your dog like that you'd likely end up in jail.


Labor's proposed five-year transition period will give the industry time to adjust to the changes. It will be a transition to something better. In contrast to all of that, all we see from the government is inaction. In fact, those opposite failed to even list their bill to increase penalties for breaches of the animal welfare standards in the live animal export sector. The government withdrew the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018 in June following our announced intention to move amendments to the bill, which, if successful, would have put an immediate stop to the Northern-Hemisphere-summer live sheep trade and phase out the trade within five years. In September, the government used its numbers in this House to block debate on a private member's bill on this issue that was passed by the Senate. The government seems determined to keep looking the other way while these appalling abuses continue.


But Labor will not stand by and do nothing. Many of my constituents have written to me. Christie from Wyoming said, 'It's so difficult to see no action being taken on such an important issue.' Labor will act. We won't stand by and do nothing, like this government has done on such a critical issue as animal welfare. It's time the government started listening to the community and hearing the concerns that they have voiced. I call on those opposite to support this private member's bill. Currently, as I and many others in this House have said, the system is cruel and unfair. The government should stop doing nothing. It should listen to the community's concerns and support this private member's bill.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2018-10-15,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Assistant Minister for Children and Families) (11:51):  I'm very pleased to stand up and defend the interests of this nation and the people who put the food on our tables and the wealth in our economy. Mark my words, this bill, the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018, is not just about sheep exports during certain months; it goes to the very core of the difference between the two sides of our parliament. On one side we have the coalition government wanting to improve the lives of people across the country by helping them engage in the economy to their capacity. We back our farmers and we back our rural communities. On the other side we have the entirely trade-union owned Labor and Greens parties wanting to erode and degrade our economic strengths and at every turn demonise and deride our farmers and fail our rural communities. It is a sad indictment on the intelligence and capacity of every single Australian that we would even entertain the member for Hunter's motion for the second reading of this bill, a bill that would place every grazing operation in this country in a perilous state and weaken our economy as a result.


What we have seen in recent footage of sheep on boats has been shocking and an absolute disgrace. This footage is certainly not representative of normal transport conditions. In 2017, some 1.7 million sheep were exported by sea; of those, some 99.29 per cent were delivered in good health. That is the real story of live export. The people I have met with who were most upset by that footage are graziers and transporters in my local electorate, people who know a thing or two about animal welfare and who care a great deal about the shape animals are in when they arrive at their destination. What these people do take to heart, though, is the response from Minister Littleproud and this government. We haven't just thrown our hands in the air and said, 'Well, this is just too hard.' We haven't done that, because this is too important. The value of live export is absolutely integral to small rural economies right across the country. Even if those opposite don't realise it, our live export markets are just like any other market for export; they are part of the tapestry of opportunities that make up the whole export picture. Having access to live export markets helps drive the prices for our sheep and cattle. Because of that positive effect, we're currently seeing livestock prices as high as they've ever been in living memory, and that's great news for primary producers, especially during times of drought.


That's why Minister Littleproud has acted swiftly in enacting the McCarthy review, headed by veterinarian Dr Michael McCarthy. All of Dr McCarthy's 23 recommendations were accepted, subject to further testing and consultation on the heat stress risk assessment recommendations. Adopting outcome measures that focus on welfare rather than mortality is perhaps the most significant suggested solution, and by adopting the recommendations we are delivering both a better outcome for the welfare of livestock and the opportunity to keep trade open.


The only option those opposite are content with, though, is to shut down the whole trade. We saw how well this went when they were last in power. Labor shut down the live cattle trade to Indonesia for a matter of weeks, and many graziers are only just recovering from the effects of that decision. Those opposite may wish to suggest a five-year phase-out, but the result will be the same. Our rural communities will suffer. Other countries who care far less about animal welfare will supply the sheep. One does not require a degree in economics to work out what will result from this. We will have secured ourselves a weaker-economy country, especially in our rural areas, and we will achieve nothing for animal welfare. So I urge those opposite to stop trying to fight a trade that delivers over $1.4 billion to the nation's economy and get on board with the government's efforts to reform and improve it. Every farmer and grazier across this wide brown land is counting on you to do so. 


Debate adjourned.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:26):  I rise to speak in support of the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018, moved by my friend and colleague the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon. This would reintroduce an inspector-general, a position that was let lapse by the Abbott government when it was elected in 2013. The reintroduction of an inspector-general would see the further strengthening of our live export regulatory system. It builds upon Labor's proud achievement of creating the Export Supply Chain Assurance System in 2011, which was in response to a Four Corners report that recorded atrocious acts of animal cruelty within Indonesian abattoirs. 


For a number of years now, ESCAS has effectively enforced animal welfare standards in other countries. While ESCAS is a great Labor achievement, more needs to be done to prevent future incidents of animal cruelty. For example, the shocking footage obtained by 60 Minutes on 8 April this year exposed the hideous conditions that Australian sheep were being subjected to during long-haul live export voyages to the Middle East. Unfortunately, this is not a one-off event. The 60 Minutes footage covered onboard treatment of live sheep over a series of voyages. Upon seeing the original footage, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, said: 


I've seen that footage and I was absolutely shocked and gutted … This cannot go on. 


He continued:


We saw sheep that basically died from a heat event that were left and decayed, that were unable to get to water and food, and it disturbs me greatly that this has happened.


If that is the case then the government must commit to immediately halting the northern live sheep trade, phasing it out completely within five years, as Labor has pledged to do. During the five-year transition period, Labor will impose the highest regulatory standards. Labor will work with farmers, unions and industry on a strategic red meat industry plan to do more value-adding here in Australia. This will be good for farmers. It will be good for animal welfare standards and good for the Australian economy. Labor will end the live export of sheep and Australia will be better off for it. 


There can be no doubt that appointing an inspector-general of animal welfare and live animal exports is integral to preventing further cases of animal abuse, such as the kind that was seen in Indonesia in 2011 and during long-haul live export voyages earlier this year. Not only does this bill and the appointment of an inspector-general have the support of the caucus of the Labor Party; importantly, it has the support of the live export industry itself. So it's hard to see why the government is so opposed to this practical measure. The only people opposed to this bill are some of those opposite in the deeply divided rabble that is the ATM government of Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison.


Indeed, it's a fact that the Liberal member for Farrer, Sussan Ley, introduced her own private member's bill in May to stop live sheep exports entirely. Ironically, the member for Farrer has now withdrawn her support from voting for this bill. The fact is that a majority of this parliament—of the House of Representatives and the Senate—supports this legislation. So why is it that it is not going through this parliament? This is a failure of our democracy if it doesn't happen.


Our animals need support and our agricultural sector needs strong and sustainable regulation. Both of these measures can be achieved by supporting this legislation. And the parliament needs to wake up to how angry the Australian population are about these issues not being addressed. Anyone who looks at that footage can't possibly say that this is okay to just continue. This should not be a partisan issue; we should be bringing on this bill for a vote and we should be carrying it through both houses of parliament. I commend the bill to the House.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2018-10-15,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England) (11:31):  I rise to speak on the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018. I think we should remember some of the basic facts here: 99.7 per cent of sheep that go to live export get off the ship in a better or the same condition—99.7 per cent. Of course there are times where there are issues that need to be addressed—absolutely. There are issues that need to be addressed, like there are on the roads if there is an accident, or like there are in a factory if there is a workplace accident or like there are in so many areas. But those are not solved by closing down an industry. And that seems to be the intent of the Labor Party: to close down an industry.


We've had a go at this before. They closed down the live cattle industry and that ended in an absolute disaster for the people of Northern Australia and for Indigenous communities—for the whole lot—because there was this sense, this conceit, that thousands of kilometres away they were going to make a decision about other people's lives. And now we're going down this path again. They're deciding, without any real attachment to the industry, without actually being in the industry, that they're going to close another person's industry down.


We know the path that this will follow. The people who are pursuing this are not going to stop with live sheep. After they've finished with live sheep, it will be live cattle. And after it's live cattle, it will be the transport industry. You can't believe for one second that these people—the animal rights people with this anthropomorphic principle that all animals are people and all people are animals—are going to relent after they close down just one section of the live export industry.

This private member's bill calls on members to support the re-establishment of the independent statutory officer, and I recommend it strongly to this House. This do-nothing government should do something about this. (Time expired)

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (11:41  I rise to speak on the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018, this private member's bill by the member for Hunter. It seems to me that, in so much of our political conversation in Australia, conversations taking place are often mired in misinformation. Certainly, so it is in the case of the live export trade. As someone who farmed for over 30 years and had sheep on my property for about 95 per cent of that time, I can tell you that I am completely committed to the welfare of the animals. I understand that animals are raised with a specific purpose. In the case of merino sheep, they are for wool, but they are also for human consumption. Somewhere along the line there comes a reality about that, and we need to recognise that reality.


Farmers produce animals for various reasons. I touched on the merinos. Merinos, of course, produce one of the finest fibres in the world, one that is actually riding on a great high at the moment. But farmers need to sell their stock. Sometimes they've reached the end of their useful life; sometimes they are surplus to requirement owing to droughts; and always we hope for an increase in our flock that will go to the human consumption market.


In the case of lambs, lamb is Australians' preferred way of eating sheep. I won't say mutton, because 'mutton' refers to a sheep at a different stage of its life. A lamb is something that's less than 12 months old, but the 12 months is actually measured by dental development in the animal. The day that those first two large front teeth—just like our children when they are six years old—cut through the gum, they turn from being a lamb into being a hogget.


Now, 'lamb', of course, is a very marketable name. We've invested a lot of money in Australia into marketing lamb. Unfortunately the day it turns to 'hogget', it does not seem to be so attractive to the public. I think that's misinformation in itself. A number of people over the years have said to me, 'I don't want to eat old hogget.' Of course, there isn't any such thing as old hogget, because that particular sheep is only a hogget until it cuts its four teeth—until the next set of teeth come through. They come through in roughly 12 months time again, so that's what we would call a two-year-old. Then of course the meat becomes 'mutton'.


Once it's become mutton, it's particularly unfavourable for the Australian public. We've got to think about why farmers would keep a sheep until it turned into mutton rather than having sold it off as a lamb. Firstly, when the lambs are born, about 50 per cent of them are male and about 50 per cent are female. The females are generally kept for breeding purposes, but they will be assessed on their wool value sometime after they become hoggets, not when they are lambs. Consequently, there is already a part of this market where Australian marketing is not preferable. The wethers are castrated at around four or six weeks old. They might be for wool production for a time, and then they need to be sold off. 


The export industry is largely based on wether sales and ewes that are deemed to be unpregnant. They might be barren ewes is, for instance. They need to be preg tested before they go on boats. The industry is very necessary—it is the safety valve for Australian farmers. It's the reason why the trade exists. It's good for farmers, because it's a necessary way of unloading sheep that are not particularly palatable for our domestic markets. They are also not particularly palatable for our chilled markets, in so much as the areas that we sell these live sheep into demand that they have a live sheep. 


Whilst they are prepared to accept some chilled beef, it is worth reflecting on the market of Bahrain, for instance. Up until about 2015, Australia was supplying around 11,800 tonnes of chilled meat into the Bahrain market. We lost our pre-eminence there as the live sheep provider, and we lost 40 per cent of the chilled meat market along with it, because these companies—these countries—actually trade as an entity. They are looking for trusted trading partners, which is why we need to be steady and careful about the things that we do in this place that disrupt those long-term trade arrangements we have made with other countries. With all things, I urge caution around the live sheep trade. It is very important to the farmers, particularly of WA and certainly of my electorate of Grey as well.

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (11:46):  I rise to speak on Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018 introduced by the shadow minister for agriculture and member for Hunter. The purpose of this bill is to re-establish an independent statutory officer to watch over the regulation of the live export sector. His or her role will be to ensure that correct animal welfare standards are maintained, and, when there is an alleged breach, that the regulator fully and properly investigates the matter, comes to the right conclusions and imposes appropriate sanctions. 


When in government in 2013, Labor appointed an interim inspector-general of animal welfare and live animal exports. Unfortunately, the incoming coalition government did not proceed with the legislation necessary to make the position permanent. That was the wrong decision, which has proven to be devastating for animal protection. This government has been consistent in its opposition to the appointment of an inspector-general. We've made it clear that a Shorten Labor government will, at the first opportunity, put an end to the northern summer live sheep trade. The evidence on this is clear, and the community sentiment is clear. The northern summer live sheep trade is just not possible, because it's cruel. We've stated that, during the necessary transition period, we'll put regulations in place that will ensure the highest standards, proper oversight and appropriate sanctions for breaches, including the establishment of the inspector-general as an independent statutory position. The inspector-general will be responsible for advising on the protection of animals in all Commonwealth regulated activities and will report directly to the minister on issues like live animal exports, animal welfare standards and required guidelines. The inspector will also work with the states and territories to establish an independent office of animal welfare to oversee animal protection and welfare activities nationally. This re-establishment of state and territory cooperation on animal welfare matters will ensure a consistent national approach and continuous monitoring. 


Labor supports the sustainable live export industry where acceptable animal welfare standards can be achieved. In government, Labor will provide more transparency and accountability around the live export trade. For a long time, Labor has been calling for these changes, as have many in the community. Like many members of this House, I have received thousands of letters and emails in recent months about the live export trade. It took the horrifying Awassi Express incident to get a response from this government—a response that did nothing to fix the systemic issues with the long-haul sheep trade. They have now withdrawn even their very small token measures. It is clear the government is not willing to deal with the abuses that have occurred on its watch. This is a heartless approach. The Awassi Express incident has made it clear that the regulation isn't working. The current system is cruel. You simply cannot load 50,000 or 60,000 sheep onto a boat for four weeks and sail them through some of the hottest and most humid climates in the world and expect animal welfare expectations to be upheld. That is the reality. As one of my constituents said, if you treated your dog like that you'd likely end up in jail.


Labor's proposed five-year transition period will give the industry time to adjust to the changes. It will be a transition to something better. In contrast to all of that, all we see from the government is inaction. In fact, those opposite failed to even list their bill to increase penalties for breaches of the animal welfare standards in the live animal export sector. The government withdrew the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018 in June following our announced intention to move amendments to the bill, which, if successful, would have put an immediate stop to the Northern-Hemisphere-summer live sheep trade and phase out the trade within five years. In September, the government used its numbers in this House to block debate on a private member's bill on this issue that was passed by the Senate. The government seems determined to keep looking the other way while these appalling abuses continue.


But Labor will not stand by and do nothing. Many of my constituents have written to me. Christie from Wyoming said, 'It's so difficult to see no action being taken on such an important issue.' Labor will act. We won't stand by and do nothing, like this government has done on such a critical issue as animal welfare. It's time the government started listening to the community and hearing the concerns that they have voiced. I call on those opposite to support this private member's bill. Currently, as I and many others in this House have said, the system is cruel and unfair. The government should stop doing nothing. It should listen to the community's concerns and support this private member's bill.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2018-10-15,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Assistant Minister for Children and Families) (11:51):  I'm very pleased to stand up and defend the interests of this nation and the people who put the food on our tables and the wealth in our economy. Mark my words, this bill, the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018, is not just about sheep exports during certain months; it goes to the very core of the difference between the two sides of our parliament. On one side we have the coalition government wanting to improve the lives of people across the country by helping them engage in the economy to their capacity. We back our farmers and we back our rural communities. On the other side we have the entirely trade-union owned Labor and Greens parties wanting to erode and degrade our economic strengths and at every turn demonise and deride our farmers and fail our rural communities. It is a sad indictment on the intelligence and capacity of every single Australian that we would even entertain the member for Hunter's motion for the second reading of this bill, a bill that would place every grazing operation in this country in a perilous state and weaken our economy as a result.


What we have seen in recent footage of sheep on boats has been shocking and an absolute disgrace. This footage is certainly not representative of normal transport conditions. In 2017, some 1.7 million sheep were exported by sea; of those, some 99.29 per cent were delivered in good health. That is the real story of live export. The people I have met with who were most upset by that footage are graziers and transporters in my local electorate, people who know a thing or two about animal welfare and who care a great deal about the shape animals are in when they arrive at their destination. What these people do take to heart, though, is the response from Minister Littleproud and this government. We haven't just thrown our hands in the air and said, 'Well, this is just too hard.' We haven't done that, because this is too important. The value of live export is absolutely integral to small rural economies right across the country. Even if those opposite don't realise it, our live export markets are just like any other market for export; they are part of the tapestry of opportunities that make up the whole export picture. Having access to live export markets helps drive the prices for our sheep and cattle. Because of that positive effect, we're currently seeing livestock prices as high as they've ever been in living memory, and that's great news for primary producers, especially during times of drought.


That's why Minister Littleproud has acted swiftly in enacting the McCarthy review, headed by veterinarian Dr Michael McCarthy. All of Dr McCarthy's 23 recommendations were accepted, subject to further testing and consultation on the heat stress risk assessment recommendations. Adopting outcome measures that focus on welfare rather than mortality is perhaps the most significant suggested solution, and by adopting the recommendations we are delivering both a better outcome for the welfare of livestock and the opportunity to keep trade open.


The only option those opposite are content with, though, is to shut down the whole trade. We saw how well this went when they were last in power. Labor shut down the live cattle trade to Indonesia for a matter of weeks, and many graziers are only just recovering from the effects of that decision. Those opposite may wish to suggest a five-year phase-out, but the result will be the same. Our rural communities will suffer. Other countries who care far less about animal welfare will supply the sheep. One does not require a degree in economics to work out what will result from this. We will have secured ourselves a weaker-economy country, especially in our rural areas, and we will achieve nothing for animal welfare. So I urge those opposite to stop trying to fight a trade that delivers over $1.4 billion to the nation's economy and get on board with the government's efforts to reform and improve it. Every farmer and grazier across this wide brown land is counting on you to do so. 


Debate adjourned.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (11:56):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the following reports: Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2017 (Second Report), and Review of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Annual Report 2017, together with the minutes of proceedings. 


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr TIM WILSON:
  by leave—On 29 June 2018 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission appeared before the committee and discussed its activities in relation to enforcing the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and related legislation. The ACCC has an important role to play in monitoring and holding individuals and groups to account for anticompetitive behaviour in breach of Australia's Consumer Law. In the last year the government has extended the ACCC's roles and responsibilities to include regular inquiries into competition in the financial sector, inquiry powers to increase transparency in the gas markets, examining the electricity markets and inquiring into the supply of residential insurance products in northern Australia. The committee notes the ACCC's assurance that it is taking a more proactive approach to issues in the financial sector in response to the committee's recommendation in its November 2016 report on its review of the four major banks. 


The government established a new financial services unit. Through the FSU, the ACCC now has a permanent role in monitoring the banks on competition matters, enabling the regulator to play a competition champion role. The FSU will undertake regular inquiries into specific financial competition issues, facilitating greater and more consistent scrutiny of competition matters in the sector. The committee shares the Productivity Commission's concern that the financial sector has been without a competition champion, and it will continue to monitor the ACCC's work in this area. It looks forward to the ACCC further developing its role of competition champion. 


While strong competition laws and corresponding penalties have been in place since 2007, until recently this has not been reflected in the pecuniary penalties imposed in competition cases. There is still much work to be done by the ACCC and in the legal system to clearly demonstrate to companies that for serious competition breaches there will be serious consequences. In particular, penalties for competition law breaches must take into account company size and turnover for them to be an effective deterrent to anticompetitive behaviour. 


While the ACCC appears well placed for its new enhanced competition role, the committee notes the regulator's advice that it has been a different story when it comes to Australian Consumer Law. However, the recently passed Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 3) Bill 2018 will correct the disparity between competition and consumer law penalties. The maximum penalties under the Australian Consumer Law will now align with the maximum penalties under the competition provisions.


The ACCC is also doing important work in energy markets on electricity and gas supply and affordability. In particular, the committee notes that the ACCC will now be monitoring and reporting to the government on electricity prices at least every six months until 2025. The ACCC will be empowered to require energy providers to support relevant information, and the regulator may make recommendations to government on how to improve electricity outcomes for consumers.


The government has also directed the ACCC and the Australian Energy Regulator to set a default price for electricity, which is expected to apply, at the latest, from July 2019. The committee will continue to monitor the ACCC's work on energy with a particular focus on and interest in making sure that we do what we can to reduce prices.


On behalf of the committee, I thank the chairman of the ACCC, Mr Rod Sims, and other ACCC representatives for appearing at the hearing. I would also like to thank the former chair of the committee, Ms Sarah Henderson MP, for her contribution. With that, I commend the report to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Bird
):  I think there may be some people interested in speaking on this report, but firstly the member for Goldstein in continuation.




Mr TIM WILSON:
  On 7 August 2018, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the RBA, left official interest rates unchanged at 1.5 per cent. In making this decision, the governor commented that accommodative monetary policy was continuing to support growth in the Australian economy and the board did not see the need to alter the cash rate.


At the public hearing on 17 August 2017, the committee scrutinised the board's decision to maintain the cash rate at its lowest historical level for the past two years, given that Australia's economy is now growing above three per cent and the unemployment rate has dipped below 5½ per cent. The governor noted: 'In the broad sweep of our economic history, these are a pretty good set of numbers,' and he said that the RBA expects further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target; however, he said that this progress is likely to be gradual.


Australia's economy continues to grow strongly, and the RBA expects GDP growth to average around 3¼ per cent by the end of 2018 through to the end of 2019, reflecting above-trend growth in a number of major economies. This is being supported by a pick-up in non-mining investment, strong commodity prices, growth in investment and energy projects and public sector infrastructure, low interest rates and the tax cuts that have already been put in place for small and medium businesses—and exciting ones to come.


While the global economy is growing strongly, the governor reported that a number of risks have emerged that could dampen investment and growth, such as the escalation of trade tension between Australia's biggest trading partners, the United States and the People's Republic of China. He noted that it was in everyone's interests for China and the United States to resolve their differences and that it was important that Australia continue to promote free trade as a pathway to prosperity in international fora.


Australia's labour market has continued to strengthen, with the labour force participation rate currently at 65.5 per cent, which is close to its historical high. Strong, continued growth in employment is expected to further reduce spare capacity in labour markets and generate a gradual increase in wages and inflation. While growth in average wages has been relatively low, we have turned the corner on wages growth. The wage price index increased by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter, which is the fastest quarterly increase since March 2014.


On behalf of the committee, I thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Philip Lowe, and other representatives of the RBA for appearing at the hearing on 17 August 2018. I would also like to thank the former chair of the economics committee, Ms Sarah Henderson MP, for her contribution. On that note, I commend the report to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (12:04):  by leave—I rise to speak, firstly, in respect of the RBA hearing before the Standing Committee on Economics on 17 August. Much of the debate revolved around the slow wages growth that Australia has been experiencing. I'm not sure I agree with the chair in saying that we've turned the corner on wages growth. We've had another annoyingly slow year when it comes to wages growth, in that growth has been basically slow or non-existent for too many Australians. Workers and those on a wage are getting a dud deal, with a falling share of national income. It's really a tale of two nations at the moment, with a divide between those workers who are doing a fair day's work but waiting for a fairer day's pay and those who aren't. 


This is a point that the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, made in looking at and analysing wages growth in the Australian economy in recent times. He said that sustained low wages growth diminishes the 'sense of shared prosperity' that we all have as Australians. He said:


I have certainly been talking for a couple of years about the benefits of stronger wages growth.


The governor said that wages growth, unfortunately, in the lower levels of the wage price index is set to continue for some time. This echoes Labor's concerns about the growing inequality that we're seeing throughout the country. We all know that with low wages growth it's those who are in marginalised occupations and those who are on award wages that tend to suffer the most. Unfortunately, they are people who are working in casual and part-time occupations, with an increasing number of women in those occupations. That ensures that those who are at the lower levels of the wages bargain, if you like, continue to fall further behind. 


There's a sense that we do need to do more to look at boosting wages growth in this country. We all know that the enterprise bargaining system has been smashed in recent years by this government, and we're starting to see, for the first time in Australia since the inception of enterprise bargaining in the 1990s, that the number of agreements that are being made is actually falling in this country. That's a great shame, because, to get real increases in incomes beyond those that are catered for by the awards system, people need to collectively bargain through that enterprise bargaining system, and changes to that system that allow companies to put workers back onto the award system if they can't reach an enterprise agreement with a company are, I believe, contributing to lower wages growth in this country. It is ensuring that we're not getting the boosts to incomes that will fuel consumption and bring us out of the economic malaise that we've had for some years now. 


There was also quite a discussion about the cost of electricity, particularly for large and small businesses throughout the country, and the fact that very, very high electricity prices are contributing to inflated cost pressures for many of those businesses, which is impinging on potential growth and potential employment opportunities. We all know that this government has been in the midst of a war for the last decade about its views on climate change and its approach to improving renewable energy uptake in our economy and eventually reducing the cost of electricity throughout the economy. We all know that we have an obligation to make a smooth transition away from dirty coal-fired power to cleaner, renewable energy sources. But this government is intent on halting that process and, in doing so, has created uncertainty for investors in this industry, which is pushing up the cost of electricity for households and businesses in Australia. 


All Australians are paying for this government's inability to work out its arguments and the war that's been going on around climate change and energy policy for the last decade. Nonetheless, I thank the Reserve Bank and the deputy governors who appeared before us on 17 August for, once again, being very frank and honest with the committee about the economic progress of the country.


Turning to the second report, about the ACCC, again there was a broad-ranging discussion. Electricity and the cost of energy were included in one of the principal discussions, but I want to turn my attention to some of the discussion that occurred about independent mechanics and the process that they have in potentially forcing up prices for motorists when they get their car serviced. In December 2017, the ACCC released its final report for the new-car retailing industry market, with studies and details of findings from almost 18 months of investigation, consultation and research. The ACCC says that independent repairers must be provided with access to the same technical information that car manufacturers make available to their authorised dealers and preferred repair networks at reasonable cost. This is something that the Labor Party wholeheartedly agrees with the ACCC on. 


Everyone should be able to choose where they get their car serviced, but the car manufacturers have, unfortunately, been pushing a view that you need to get your car serviced with them if you're going to maintain your warranty and if you're going to be able to ensure that you can resell your car in the future. It is absolute garbage. It does not reflect the Australian law and these big dealerships are forcing many Australians into having their car serviced with them, at often inflated prices, by not supplying information to independent mechanics that can ensure that they can access the technical details that are required. Cars are computers on wheels these days and they need to access that technical information.


We had a review of the industry's voluntary code in September 2016 that this government promised to deliver. They failed to do so. They also promised to review the voluntary code by October 2016 and, again, the deadline came and went without action. Labor now, in the wake of the government's inaction on this issue, have developed a plan to ensure that car manufacturers share their technical information so that vehicles can be serviced by independent mechanics. Labor will require car manufacturers to share that technical information with independent mechanics on commercially fair and reasonable terms, with safeguards on the environmental safety and security related technical information to be shared with the independent sector. The result will be more money back in the pockets of car owners and a rev up for our nation's 23,000 independent repairers.


It's a shame that Labor has had to act on this when the government's had many, many months. For many years, they've known that this is an issue and they've been unable to work on developing the process of putting in place good policy. I urge the members of the government to support Labor's approach and to support the policy of ensuring that the big dealerships provide that important technical information on a fair and reasonable basis to repairers.


Once again, I thank the members of the ACCC who appeared before us and I thank the committee secretariat for their work in preparing both of the reports.

On behalf of the committee, I thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Philip Lowe, and other representatives of the RBA for appearing at the hearing on 17 August 2018. I would also like to thank the former chair of the economics committee, Ms Sarah Henderson MP, for her contribution. On that note, I commend the report to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (12:04):  by leave—I rise to speak, firstly, in respect of the RBA hearing before the Standing Committee on Economics on 17 August. Much of the debate revolved around the slow wages growth that Australia has been experiencing. I'm not sure I agree with the chair in saying that we've turned the corner on wages growth. We've had another annoyingly slow year when it comes to wages growth, in that growth has been basically slow or non-existent for too many Australians. Workers and those on a wage are getting a dud deal, with a falling share of national income. It's really a tale of two nations at the moment, with a divide between those workers who are doing a fair day's work but waiting for a fairer day's pay and those who aren't. 


This is a point that the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, made in looking at and analysing wages growth in the Australian economy in recent times. He said that sustained low wages growth diminishes the 'sense of shared prosperity' that we all have as Australians. He said:


I have certainly been talking for a couple of years about the benefits of stronger wages growth.


The governor said that wages growth, unfortunately, in the lower levels of the wage price index is set to continue for some time. This echoes Labor's concerns about the growing inequality that we're seeing throughout the country. We all know that with low wages growth it's those who are in marginalised occupations and those who are on award wages that tend to suffer the most. Unfortunately, they are people who are working in casual and part-time occupations, with an increasing number of women in those occupations. That ensures that those who are at the lower levels of the wages bargain, if you like, continue to fall further behind. 


There's a sense that we do need to do more to look at boosting wages growth in this country. We all know that the enterprise bargaining system has been smashed in recent years by this government, and we're starting to see, for the first time in Australia since the inception of enterprise bargaining in the 1990s, that the number of agreements that are being made is actually falling in this country. That's a great shame, because, to get real increases in incomes beyond those that are catered for by the awards system, people need to collectively bargain through that enterprise bargaining system, and changes to that system that allow companies to put workers back onto the award system if they can't reach an enterprise agreement with a company are, I believe, contributing to lower wages growth in this country. It is ensuring that we're not getting the boosts to incomes that will fuel consumption and bring us out of the economic malaise that we've had for some years now. 


There was also quite a discussion about the cost of electricity, particularly for large and small businesses throughout the country, and the fact that very, very high electricity prices are contributing to inflated cost pressures for many of those businesses, which is impinging on potential growth and potential employment opportunities. We all know that this government has been in the midst of a war for the last decade about its views on climate change and its approach to improving renewable energy uptake in our economy and eventually reducing the cost of electricity throughout the economy. We all know that we have an obligation to make a smooth transition away from dirty coal-fired power to cleaner, renewable energy sources. But this government is intent on halting that process and, in doing so, has created uncertainty for investors in this industry, which is pushing up the cost of electricity for households and businesses in Australia. 


All Australians are paying for this government's inability to work out its arguments and the war that's been going on around climate change and energy policy for the last decade. Nonetheless, I thank the Reserve Bank and the deputy governors who appeared before us on 17 August for, once again, being very frank and honest with the committee about the economic progress of the country.


Turning to the second report, about the ACCC, again there was a broad-ranging discussion. Electricity and the cost of energy were included in one of the principal discussions, but I want to turn my attention to some of the discussion that occurred about independent mechanics and the process that they have in potentially forcing up prices for motorists when they get their car serviced. In December 2017, the ACCC released its final report for the new-car retailing industry market, with studies and details of findings from almost 18 months of investigation, consultation and research. The ACCC says that independent repairers must be provided with access to the same technical information that car manufacturers make available to their authorised dealers and preferred repair networks at reasonable cost. This is something that the Labor Party wholeheartedly agrees with the ACCC on. 


Everyone should be able to choose where they get their car serviced, but the car manufacturers have, unfortunately, been pushing a view that you need to get your car serviced with them if you're going to maintain your warranty and if you're going to be able to ensure that you can resell your car in the future. It is absolute garbage. It does not reflect the Australian law and these big dealerships are forcing many Australians into having their car serviced with them, at often inflated prices, by not supplying information to independent mechanics that can ensure that they can access the technical details that are required. Cars are computers on wheels these days and they need to access that technical information.


We had a review of the industry's voluntary code in September 2016 that this government promised to deliver. They failed to do so. They also promised to review the voluntary code by October 2016 and, again, the deadline came and went without action. Labor now, in the wake of the government's inaction on this issue, have developed a plan to ensure that car manufacturers share their technical information so that vehicles can be serviced by independent mechanics. Labor will require car manufacturers to share that technical information with independent mechanics on commercially fair and reasonable terms, with safeguards on the environmental safety and security related technical information to be shared with the independent sector. The result will be more money back in the pockets of car owners and a rev up for our nation's 23,000 independent repairers.


It's a shame that Labor has had to act on this when the government's had many, many months. For many years, they've known that this is an issue and they've been unable to work on developing the process of putting in place good policy. I urge the members of the government to support Labor's approach and to support the policy of ensuring that the big dealerships provide that important technical information on a fair and reasonable basis to repairers.


Once again, I thank the members of the ACCC who appeared before us and I thank the committee secretariat for their work in preparing both of the reports.

 (Scullin) (12:16):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's second advisory report incorporating dissenting reports on the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr GILES:
  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this report, which goes to a very important piece of legislation and indeed to a revised bundle of amendments the government proposes to introduce which will deal principally with implementing a ban on foreign donations to political parties and other political actors. The Australian Labor Party has long been in favour of introducing such a provision into Australian law, in particular into the Commonwealth Electoral Act.


This report follows an earlier report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters done in April this year, which made a very large number of amendments to the government's substantive amendment proposal to the Electoral Act. It is very pleasing to see that a number of the committee's bipartisan recommendations have been acted upon by the government and certainly the legislation that will be before the Senate—the other place—as I understand it, is a marked improvement on that which was originally proposed. Many of the unintended consequences that were identified by members of the committee, guided by academics and civil society, have been rectified.


However, unlike that report of the Joint Standing Committee, this report features two dissenting reports. That is disappointing. It is less than pleasing in a committee of this nature, which is really concerned about upholding the standards of our democracy, that we have felt in the Australian Labor Party—through me and my three colleagues—that it's necessary to issue a dissenting report and we have not done so lightly. We've done so principally because the amendments introduced by the government, without notice, introduced an entirely new element to this legislation, an element that bears only the barest resemblance to the subject matter of the principal piece of legislation—that is, a series of provisions which would, in effect, seek to override state electoral laws about donations. These electoral laws include provisions introduced on the recommendation of state anticorruption commissions that, for example, in the case of Queensland, ban developer donations. This is a really important matter which goes to the heart of trust and integrity in politics. It's not a matter upon which the Commonwealth parliament should lightly, if ever, seek to override state jurisdictions that have considered these matters and made laws. It is deeply concerning that such a provision is proposed here, and it is principally for that reason that the Labor members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters are dissenting. We urge the government to reconsider. We urge the government to get on with the job, the bipartisan and multipartisan goal, of banning foreign donations from our national politics, without unduly interfering with state arrangements that take money out of politics and remove certain vested interests out of politics, as I said, including on the recommendation of state anticorruption commissions.


I note also that there are some important matters that will require careful consideration in debate, and this particularly goes to some of the key definitions that are contained in these amendments. Labor members are concerned to see that any such ban and significant changes to definitional arrangements take place in a manner that provides certainty to all political actors. The regime here requires to be clearly understood by all participants, and we will be looking very carefully at the bill as presented to the parliament to ensure that that objective is met.


Fundamentally, all of us in this place have a responsibility to lift the standards of Australian politics. This bill, if enacted properly with those concerns addressed, and in particular with those provisions seeking to override state laws, would be a step forward—a necessary but insufficient step. I call on the government to look seriously at Labor's longstanding proposals to take money and the undue influence it brings out of Australian politics so that Australians can feel that our democracy is working for them.


I take this opportunity, lastly, to thank my colleagues on the committee for their hard work under a very short—indeed, unnecessarily short, in my view—time frame and of course the secretariat of the committee for their extraordinary work on behalf of all of us in this place. I move:


That the House take note of the report.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (13:30):  The drone delivery trial in Bonython is still going and residents are getting increasingly fed up. Since I did a callout last month, feedback about the drone trial has not slowed down. In fact, it has increased dramatically. While some reactions have been positive, the feedback is overwhelmingly negative. Over the past week, I've had a number of comments coming in from residents—a bit of a surge in comments from Bonython residents. Judy, a Bonython resident of 24 years, says, 'It's like having a permanent mosquito every weekend. Initially the drones seemed to follow road routes, but lately they've been flying directly over my house and the volume has increased.' Sue: 'They are driving me crazy. I enjoy having my lunch in the sun and listening to an audio book, but this is impossible as the drones are too loud and drown out the book.' Kris: 'The noise echoes across the valley and it flies over my house continuously. The serenity of a peaceful suburb has deteriorated.' Briana: 'Every weekend for the last month or so I have had drones flying around and over my property. As a result I no longer feel I have privacy in the outdoor spaces around my home.' And from today: 'This morning, starting just after eight o'clock, there have been five drones passes—10 including the return trip—by 8.35.' That's on a Sunday. 'The weekends are by far the worst. In a period of just one hour one Sunday 11 passes, 22 including the return, were made until I lost count.' (Time expired)

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Prime Minister) (14:01):  On indulgence, I rise today to remember an Australian tragedy and to remember those who were lost. On this day 48 years ago, Australians watched in horror as the West Gate Bridge collapsed during construction. It's not a particular anniversary this year, just like it's the 16th anniversary this year since the terrible Bali bombings that were commemorated just a few days ago. But, whether it's the 48th or the 16th or the 35th or the 55th, each time this date and this period is marked it's a chilling reminder and a terrible time of sadness for all of those who are touched personally by these tragic incidents.


On that day, Australians watched in horror as the West Gate Bridge collapsed during construction. Most of us who sit in this chamber would have been small children. Some would not have been born. But Australians around the country on that day watched in horror and 35 men needlessly lost their lives. Just before midday, on what should have been just another ordinary working day, 2,000 tonnes of steel and concrete crashed to the ground and the waters below. Thirty-five working men, many of them migrants who had come to Australia seeking a better life, were killed and lost. Kids lost their dads, wives lost their husbands, parents lost their sons and family members lost their brothers, and many, many more were seriously injured. Miraculously, 18 men escaped the carnage and, on that day, these survivors would be the first responders, doing what they could do to save their mates. It was a day that should never be forgotten, and it's not been forgotten today. I appreciate the Leader of the Opposition writing to me about this anniversary and suggesting us doing this here today together.


Mostly, when these things happen we call them accidents—a chance of fate—but that wasn't the case on this day. The collapse of the West Gate Bridge was not an accident; nor was it a chance of fate. As the royal commission found, the collapse was as a result of man-made errors—error upon error, mistakes compounded by efforts to rectify them, and all occurring within a confrontational culture marked by distrust, division and demarcation. Thankfully, much has changed since the 1970s and, of course, our workplaces are much safer today than they were almost half a century ago. Tougher laws have been introduced and workers have been given more of a say, as they should, about safety on the job. Safety is now something everyone is responsible for right across the organisation. We achieve so much more in our workplaces and, indeed, in a country where we work together and we look out for each other, whatever our role is within an organisation. As the report of the Royal Commission into the Failure of West Gate Bridge said:


It is widely accepted that the essential requirements for good labour relations are mutual trust, confidence and respect as between management, trade unions and men. Once this relationship is established, all concerned will work as a team and first-class production can be achieved. Without it, little if any progress can be made.


As a lesson for today, the mistakes that are made are not supposed to bind us forever; they're supposed to guide us into our future. On this 48th anniversary, we remember the lessons of those times and we remember the 35 men who needlessly perished and their families, who have lived with this every day from then till now and will into the future. Today, tens of thousands of vehicles will pass across the West Gate Bridge. Its flags will be lowered in an act of remembrance. Families, friends and former workmates will gather at the site of the collapse, as they do every year, to remember the loved ones they have lost. It's only appropriate for us here today to pause here in the nation's parliament to remember the lessons of that day so that they might shine a path forward for all of us. May the 35 souls lost at the West Gate Bridge rest in peace and may God bless their families.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:06):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words and for agreeing to our request for this motion. It was 48 years ago, on a windy Melbourne morning at 11.50 am, 50 metres above the Yarra, 128 metres of concrete and steel in span 10 to 11 of the West Gate Bridge suddenly began to shudder. Workers later told of an eerie ringing sound as giant steel bolts turned blue under the strain and shot from their sockets with a sound like light bulbs popping. Then, in a flash, 2,000 tonnes of concrete and steel fell onto the muddy ground below and onto the eight wooden site huts, where the workforce's first lunch break had just begun. Thirty-five men died; 18 were injured. Families were fractured by tragedy, others spared by sheer luck alone, racked by that inexplicable human phenomena of survivor guilt.


Today we remember riggers and fitters, ironworkers, boilermakers, engineers, fathers, brothers and sons. Many of them were actually migrants who were seeking a fresh start in a new nation, who went out the front door that day from commission flats in Collingwood and humble houses in Altona and never came home. Victor Gerada was a steel rigger born in Malta. On 14 October, the day before the collapse, he thought he felt a shudder run through the bridge. He told his wife Doris that night when he got home from work, explaining he didn't want to tell his workmates because he didn't want them thinking the less of him. That morning, Victor woke Doris before he left for work to reassure her it must have been the wind. Victor and Doris's home was close enough to the bridge for Doris to run straight there when she heard the sirens. She arrived just as her husband's body was being loaded into the ambulance.


Jack Grist was the site foreman and Fred Upsdell was a storeman. They had been mates for over 20 years. They both lived in Altona and, as usual, Jack gave Fred a lift to work that day. They had their lunch in the hut at the same time. When the mess of the rubble and the tangle of the scaffolding was cleared, their bodies were found next to one another. Later, the two old friends would be buried alongside each other. The humble plaque on the memorial beneath the bridge at Hyde Street bears 35 names. It lists their trade or craft, each carries its own story and so too do the survivors, some of whom I've had the privilege to meet. They are men like Bob Setka, a rigger, who somehow miraculously rode the bridge down, a 50 metre fall. He'd stepped out from the interior of the span for a cigarette moments before. That decision saved his life.


It should also be noted that a generation of union organisers rose out of that tragedy: men who'd worked on this job, galvanised by it. I've had the privilege of meeting some of these survivors and some of those who were on the job that day: Tom Watson, John Cummins, Pat Preston and Danny Gardiner. There were more. They learned very difficult lessons that day and they made it their mission to advance the cause, not just for better industrial relations but to champion stronger workplace health and safety across the state and the nation.


Most of us who use the bridge day by day rarely stop to reflect on Australia's worst industrial disaster. But today in the House of the Australian people we honour the memory of all those who have died. We acknowledge and remember the trauma and the guilt inflicted on families and loved ones and on survivors—many of whom lived with the nightmares for years. But in doing so we remind ourselves that we sit in the relative comfort and security of this place—that workplace deaths and injuries are not just a tragedy confined to the history books and black-and-white photos. It's been about three weeks since the parliament last met, but, in the three weeks since parliament last met, around 10 Australians have died at work, whether that be falling from heights or crushed by heavy machinery or falling material. Thousands more right now live and will die from industrial diseases incurred at work. Until every Australian workplace is safe and until every Australian has the right to come home to the people they love, then there is more for all of us to do.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (15:17):  It's indeed a pleasure to rise in this House and speak about what I'm sure all of us acknowledge is an extraordinarily important topic, and that is the topic of the quality of care that the elderly in our community receive on a day-to-day basis. The bills that we're debating today are designed to deal with some of these very important issues. They impact directly on the quality of care and the dignity of life of older Australians in residential aged care. We saw, over the past few weeks, the announcement of the royal commission into the aged-care sector. This royal commission will look into the quality of care provided in residential and home aged care for senior Australians, but importantly it will also include young Australians with disability living in residential aged-care settings.


We've all in this place seen the many stories on Four Corners, but also, I'm sure, we've received stories and representations in our various offices about the quality of care provided in residential aged care around our electorates. As a community, we rightly expect high standards of quality, care and safety for those in residential aged care and also in home aged-care situations. Our government shares those expectations, and that is the purpose for the royal commission, because it will be about proactively determining what we need to do in the future to ensure those expectations are met. Sadly, evidence to date has shown that problems are not restricted to any one part of the aged-care sector, whether it's the for-profit or not-for-profit sector, large or small facilities, or regional or major metropolitan facilities. The royal commission will look at the sector as a whole, without bias or prejudice, and it will make findings on evidence. Then, as a government and as a parliament, it will be our job to act on those findings to ensure that the care provided to older Australians is at the level that we would expect as a civilised society.


Whether you're a senior Australian contemplating entering an aged-care facility or are already a resident in such a facility, this bill in the House today is designed to be of benefit to you. If you're one of the many Australians with a parent, grandparent or other relative who is resident in or contemplating entering an aged-care facility or is an operator of or an employee in an aged-care facility, this bill is designed to benefit you.


In 2017, around one in seven Australians were aged 65 and over. We know from the statistics that growth in the number of people in aged care over 65 will occur very rapidly over the years to 2031. It will be roughly twice as fast as the total population growth. In fact, this group has grown in size over that period by 85 per cent, from a bit over three million to nearly 5.7 million people. The highest growth, however, will be in the 75-and-over age group, which is projected to more than double in size to over 2.8 million. These large increases are a result of a variety of factors, including the ageing of the baby boomer group, the decreasing of mortality rates, and the increasing life span. It's also worth noting that since World War II the average life span in Australia has increased in males by 12½ years and in women by 13 years.


Of course, as the number of older Australians in our population increases, so does the number of Australians utilising aged-care services and facilities. We are seeing that the range of medical conditions faced by these people is becoming more difficult and increasing the level of care required, particularly for those with conditions such as dementia. This government is fully committed to ensuring Australians in the aged-care system are better cared for, and this bill is an important part of ensuring this. These Australians who have given their lives to building this country deserve to get the quality care that should be expected in a country like Australia. At the heart of our aged-care system, ultimately, these are people and their lives that we are looking after—senior Australians seeking to live out their lives with dignity in environments where they know they are safe and will be cared for with compassion and professionalism, in places where their quality of life is enhanced and, perhaps most importantly, in places they and their families can trust to deliver the high standards of care that every single senior Australian deserves.


One of the reasons many Australians go into care is that their families can no longer take care of them themselves. It's for a wide variety of reasons, whether it's busyness with work or family lives—as many of us know, that's the case for many people today—or the fact that families may be living far away from where their parents are living today. This is a way that they can ensure their parents are properly looked after. Other reasons are matters of personal security and safety because they can't look after themselves properly at home anymore. Thankfully, there are many terrific community groups that do seek to help elderly Australians remain in their homes longer, by doing such things as little maintenance jobs around the house like mowing their yards. But ultimately that is not enough to meet their needs; hence the need to move into aged care. This is why we're committed to ensuring that families can rest easy knowing the right standards of quality and professionalism are maintained across the system.


This bill gives effect, from 1 January 2019, to the government's announcement in the 2018-19 budget on establishing the new commission. This reform is part of a two-year agenda to strengthen and enhance aged-care regulation in order to protect and assure the quality of care provided to aged-care consumers. The commission's objectives are to protect and enhance the safety, health, wellbeing and quality of the lives of aged-care consumers, to promote confidence and trust in the provision of aged care and to promote engagement with aged-care consumers on the quality of care and services.


In the budget, the government announced its response to the recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review. Establishing the independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission was the first of the recommendations. The commission will consolidate the regulatory functions currently split across three aged-care regulators in order to improve clarity, regulatory accountability for providers and their staff, and certain rights and responsibilities for aged-care consumers and their families. The bill to establish the commission represents the first stage of a two-stage process of reform. The commission, from 1 January 2019, subsumes the existing functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner.


It's disappointing, in some respects, that we seem regularly in this place to have to legislate for entities and organisations in our communities to do the right thing by their fellow Australians. Be that as it may, when we do identify these issues it is our responsibility to put in place legislation and regulation to deal with the shortcomings we are seeing in our community.


I commend the government for its work in this space and for its ongoing work to ensure that we provide the safety, security and level of care necessary for older Australians, who have contributed so much over the years to our community. The work we're doing both with this legislation and with the royal commission will go a long way, I hope, to dealing with the issues that we have seen articulated in the public arena. I commend the bill to the House.

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (15:27):  As previous speakers have noted, Labor supports these bills while expressing our strong concern about the government's slow introduction of this legislation into the parliament. The purpose of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill is to establish the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission from 1 January 2019. The new commission will be tasked with helping to restore confidence in aged-care services, given widespread public concern. Whilst this concern was highlighted by last month's Four Corners report, these issues, sadly, aren't a surprise to those with loved ones in aged care or seeking aged care or those working in the aged-care sector.


Many older Australians who now need aged care have lived lives very different to mine and to many of us in this House. They grew up in the Great Depression, served in and lost loved ones in the Second World War or, in the case of many postwar migrants, experienced the hardships of war. They worked and raised families in the early postwar years without many of the things we take for granted today. Free universal health care didn't arrive until the 1970s, women earned less than men doing the same work and occupational superannuation was limited to a lucky few—mostly men—until the introduction of the superannuation guarantee in the 1990s, well after many of this generation had reached the end of their working lives. They just had to trust that there would be an adequate age pension and proper aged care to support them later in life. This is a generation who are reluctant to ask for help, even when they really need it, and are even more reluctant to complain when the standard of care falls short of what it should be or what we would expect. It isn't fair that, when the circumstances of day-to-day life and caring responsibilities become too much and they need help, that help isn't there, or the quality of that help or care doesn't meet what we would want for our parents, our grandparents and loved ones.


The report of the Review of National Aged Care Quality Regulatory Processes, also known as the Carnell-Paterson review, was handed to the government on 23 October last year. It had a focus on quality care. The review made 10 recommendations, one of which was to establish the independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. The government has taken a long time to do the work around establishing this new commission, and it has yet to respond to a number of the other recommendations included in the Carnell-Paterson review.


The new commission will provide a single point of contact for older Australians and aged-care providers in relation to the quality of care and regulation. It will be responsible for the accreditation, assessment and monitoring of Commonwealth funded and other aged-care services, and for complaints handling. Although these bills would be considered non-controversial, there are a number concerns, particularly the time it has taken the government to introduce legislation into the parliament. The Greens have referred the bills to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry, with a reporting date of today. We on this side of the House hope the Greens' actions will not hold up the passage of this important legislation. These bills are a missed opportunity for government to give the new commission stronger arbitrary powers, given the widespread public concern.


Labor puts the government on notice that there must be no change to the cost-recovery process and/or fee charges to ensure the ongoing support for smaller providers. Although the advisory council is set to continue, the government is yet to fill three vacancies. Given the responsibility this council has, you would've thought the government would have urgently filled these vacancies. This new agency is due to begin on 1 July 2019, so the government has much work to do to get this commission right.


Given the number of times my colleagues and I have raised aged care in this House, I welcome the government's royal commission into the abuse and cover-ups in aged care, but the government can't wait for the royal commission to report. Older Australians need action now. Labor has been saying for a long time that the aged-care system is in crisis. When the Leader of the Opposition said this in the parliament in May, the government likened it to elder abuse. We are relieved that the government is now listening and has changed its mind. The quality standards and reporting system isn't working. There aren't enough aged-care workers, and they aren't given proper pay, respect or support to do the work they do helping others.


Last year I received a sad letter, which goes to the heart of this matter, from a constituent, Heather, regarding the standard of care her husband, Reg, received in residential care in my electorate. Heather told me that Reg entered respite at the facility in May 2017 and passed away just 7½ weeks later. When Reg was first admitted, he was well, mobile and cheerful. He had some health problems, but they were managed. His placement was due to his dementia. Heather was finding it increasingly difficult and exhausting to look after him at home and needed a break. One morning Heather arrived at the facility to find Reg in discomfort and pain. Reg was in the same position that he'd been in when she had left him the day before. She called the ambulance herself. When they arrived to take him to hospital, the officers noted that Reg had been lying in a bed of stale urine. Upon admission to hospital, Heather was told that Reg was very sick. He had septicaemia from a stage 4 bedsore. The care and treatment Reg then received while in hospital was professional and respectful, exactly what he should've received at the facility but did not. Unfortunately, the septicaemia did not respond to antibiotics, and Reg passed away four days after admission. His death certificate stated the cause of death as sepsis from bedsores.


As Heather said, this should not have happened. The royal commission needs to examine the impact of the government's years of cuts. You don't fix aged care by cutting the funding to aged care. Billions of dollars have been cut from aged care in the last five years. The now Prime Minister cut almost $2 billion in his first year as Treasurer. With three ministers in five years and billions of dollars in cuts, the government has ignored dozens of its own reports and reviews on what is needed to fix the problems we do know about in aged care.


I'll now turn to home care packages. There are now 121,000 people on the home care package waiting list, including 95,000 people with high needs, many living with dementia. I have raised a number of examples of the impact of this waiting list on my constituents in this place. There are 774 people on the Central Coast in the queue, almost two-thirds of whom are waiting for high-level packages. These are people like Gladys, who requires in-home care. She applied for support through My Aged Care a year ago and was approved for a level 2 package, but she is still in the queue a year later. Her daughter Robyn works full-time and helps as much as she can, but since she has been waiting her mother has had four falls, the most recent of which fractured her wrist, further limiting her mobility. Gladys is in desperate need of extra assistance around the house and with personal care.


I wrote to the minister about Gladys. I do appreciate his assistance, but his response was for the family to call My Aged Care for regular updates. She has had four falls whilst in the queue!


When he suggests that people are 'entering' and 'exiting' the queue on a daily basis, sadly we know what that means. Older people are dying before they access an aged-care package. 


The royal commission should also look at the difficulty older Australians have—and their family members have when trying to assist them—in navigating My Aged Care. It's complex and it's difficult, and for someone in crisis it can sometimes just be too hard. Patricia, from my electorate, entered residential aged care in September last year. It was a crisis, as many of these admissions are. She had been living at home with a family member whose own health problems had become overwhelming, and they could no longer care for her, despite wanting to. Unfortunately, the original income-and-asset summary provided to the aged-care facility by the Department of Human Services incorrectly included the house as an asset, but this was later changed to exempt the home for two years on account of her family member, a disability pensioner, living in the home. What followed was an administrative nightmare.


Because the original assessment cannot be re-issued, the aged-care facility charged an accommodation levy that should not apply, and Patricia's life savings were taken in fees—incorrectly taken in fees. Her daughter has faced nearly a year of fighting the facility and the department to have the error fixed. Even with the assistance of my office, nearly five months passed before the issue was resolved, and again I'm grateful to the minister for the assistance of his office in this case. No-one really wants to put their loved one into residential care, and families like Patricia's need support in order to do so. They don't need months and years of distress because the system is broken and doesn't work. We can't call ourselves a fair and generous country until older Australians have the love, care and respect they deserve. 


As a pharmacist who worked at Wyong Hospital in my electorate for almost a decade, I'm a proud member of the Health Services Union, and I strongly support their Our Turn to Care campaign for better conditions for aged-care workers and the people that they care for. As part of the campaign, the HSU surveyed over 300 of its members. The survey showed that the No. 1 concern of workers, above remuneration, is short-staffing. They said:


You've normally got two staff to 35 people including those with chronic needs and palliative care. You're pushed with work, you can't fulfil all your duties in the 7.5 hours. It's not fair on the workers [or] the residents. 


These are common concerns. These were concerns expressed when I held an aged-care roundtable with Labor's Medicare taskforce, with Dr Mike Freelander and Sharon Claydon, the member for Newcastle. One of the things that particularly struck me and stayed with me from that forum was an older person who was at the roundtable, representing people who were members of a local group for older people. She wasn't at the time looking for care herself, and nor was she seeking care for someone else. But during the roundtable she said that the stories that other people had shared had left her terrified. One thing we need to be very, very mindful of is the impact that this has on older Australians and their families and those who look after them—the fear that they have of entering aged care because of some of the stories and some of the things that have happened. 


I was proud to stand with my community at the rally at Central Coast Leagues Club recently on the Central Coast to call for more funding and better pay and conditions for aged-care workers. The Secretary of the HSU, Gerard Hayes, told the rally, 'We are creating an existence for older Australians, not a life.' This is just not good enough. Older Australians are at the time of their life where they need care, where they need residential care or they need respite care or they need a home care package, but the support just isn't there. 


In February this year, I lost my father, who had lived with younger onset dementia. I am very grateful for the care that my father received, both respite care and in-home care. There were many things that my dad and his friends experienced, and I do want to mention the YODSS group—the Younger Onset Dementia Social Support Club. A lot of people are aware of dementia, but they're not necessarily aware of younger people living with dementia. They have particular needs that must be looked at and must be properly funded. Their partners are often working people who are trying to juggle care, whether it's in-home care or respite care, whilst working. There is a particular set of circumstances and demands on families of people living with younger onset dementia. So today I do want to mention YODSS and Bev and Steve of the YODSS group on the Central Coast and the work they do to help support younger people living with dementia. 


We know that one of the largest groups of people waiting for higher-level packages is people living with dementia. I particularly want to say to those in my community that we on this side of the House are working as hard as we can to make sure that you get the care that you need when you need it. Carers often need help, particularly in crisis, and there is an urgency that this government doesn't seem to understand or hasn't really heard. I call on everybody in this House to work towards better-quality aged care so that people and families seeking care or in care have the confidence and assurance to know that their grandparent, their parent, their loved one is receiving the care that any of us would ask for for someone that we love and care for.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:41):  It's my privilege to be able to rise to support the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 on the basis that we all in this place care about the challenges, the vulnerability and the needs of Australians dependent on aged care. In fact, many of us will know the story and the experience of putting a loved one, in my case a grandparent, into aged care after having lived a happy and full life, sometimes beyond the life of their spouse, in their own home and then having the task of relocating them in their sunset years into the care of others. That's certainly my experience with my grandmother, who currently resides in aged care in Mount Eliza after the death of her husband many, many years ago. Now she is cared for and supported by others. 


I know that all members here and all Australians have similar stories and experiences. Deputy Speaker Andrews, you know, as I do, that when you entrust loved ones to the aged care system there are many issues that go through people's minds. One is obviously the care and support for person that they are seeking care for. Some of it is about the financial challenges that can come with making sure we support people in aged care. But, critically, at the forefront of everybody's consideration is always the health and safety of their loved one in aged care and the need to make sure that they are treated with dignity and respect and at the standard that we would want at least for ourselves. The task for us as legislators is how we provide a system that provides the highest degree of support, care and guarantee to Australians so that they can rely on the system to care for them. 


There are a lot of technicalities and legalities around how the system is designed. Some of those challenges are very serious. But at the heart of it has to be a well-regulated sector where people are held to account for their conduct should there be misdeeds or misconduct. Those who are vulnerable need to have a pathway of complaint and need to know that their concerns will be acted upon and that standards that we would wish for ourselves are set for others.


This bill is part of a package of legislation seeking to address those issues. The commission brings together the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner from 1 January 2019, and it will enable a clearer line of accountability and responsibility to government agencies from those who care for Australia's loved ones. It's a simple measure that is part of what this government is doing to support people in aged care and to address the shortcomings in the system. 


The recently announced royal commission is in recognition that some vulnerable Australians experience horrific tragedy. Yes, there have been reports from individuals through different agencies over the years. One of the bodies I used to serve on was the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, which supports the Nursing and Midwifery Board, and I heard firsthand how sometimes, sadly, there was misconduct or abuse against people who were in no position to defend themselves by those who were responsible for their care. Many members in this place will have seen the, in some cases, horrific stories on recent episodes of Four Corners. Those cases do not sit in isolation. There have been cases that have been revealed before and they tell a worrying tale. That's what the royal commission is designed to address—to turn a light into those dark corners and to make sure that truths are exposed so that those who have turned a willing blind eye will be held accountable. It's part of a broader package of what this government seeks to do to make sure that Australians can have confidence in our aged-care sector. 


Funding for aged care is at record levels. In 2017-18 alone, aged-care spending is estimated to reach $18.6 billion, and over the next five years funding will grow by $5 billion to $23.6 billion. Some $1.6 billion has been provided to create an additional 20,000 higher needs home care packages since last December. In excess of $50 million has been provided every year for dementia-specific programs. A further $5.3 million has been committed over four years to pilot improvements to care for people living with dementia, with an emphasis on the use of innovative technologies. And that's the point. While dollars and cents do matter, and no-one's trying to pretend they don't—we can always have a discussion about what and how much and whether it should go up or down and whether we should find new ways to spend it—the outcome is what matters. The realisation and the value of the public money spent is through the improved human condition of those receiving care. 


One of the broader trends, as anybody in the aged-care sector will tell if you talk to them, is that the system where people would go into care for prolonged periods in their twilight years is changing. We, of course, are providing more home care packages so people can stay in their homes longer—to have the choice to do so, to get the care where they want it, to live in the community that they know and love. What's happening is that people are going into aged care later and for shorter periods of time, with much higher care needs. That creates challenges for the system, in terms of design, capital and infrastructure, based on the prolonged periods of time that people stay there.


But more critically, when people go in with higher care needs, they face bigger and more unique challenges. The expansion in the need for dementia support services is a critical part of that story, because people often go in, as I said, in their sunset years, increasingly not knowing as much of the world around them, with a declining memory and with an increasing distance to their reality. Our task is to make sure that we have a system that can care for and support those people at that stage of life so that they continue to enjoy not just comfort, though that is important, not just health and safety, though they are important as well, but dignity, not only within themselves but also dignity for their families so that they can preserve the memories as best possible of the people that they love and care about. And that, ultimately, is what this legislation and this government's package of reforms are seeking to achieve. It is, of course, not the end.


I'm under no doubt that the royal commission will uncover stories that will shock the nation, because what people will see, as we have seen before, is that, tragically, there are times when people are in the care and assistance of others at no greater or more vulnerable stage of their life and they are taken advantage of by those who should know better. Our task in response is to soberly and cautiously go through the evidence and the conclusions of the royal commission when it is completed. It is not simply enter into a discussion around dollars and cents and think that that will solve all problems because, as I've outlined already, while that may be important as part of the story—and it is—what will deliver the improvements for the Australian people and the aged-care sector is a sense of safety and dignity for their loved ones.


More critically, what we can't allow this royal commission to do is cast a dark light, a shadow, over so much of the good work in the aged-care sector done every day because, for every one person who wrongs, there are thousands who do right. There are so many nurses, support staff and carers who every day, through sacrifice or love, turn up in community and commercial aged-care facilities and provide ongoing love and compassion to those people who need that care with the admiration of those they care for, of their families and their communities, who form a central part of the nucleus often of rural and regional communities as well.


As I said earlier today, I recently went to the launch of the renovated facilities at Fairway Bayside Aged Care in Sandringham, just like I recently visited Vasey RSL Care Brighton East. These services provide the most incredible facilities for people seeking to age with dignity, support services that are highly attentive to their needs and that not only fully recognise the expectations the community has of them but also recognises the expectations of their clients and their families, and what they deliver is a service that we should be proud of. They should be held up as exemplars. While there are wrongs, there are so many rights, and the same is true of so many other facilities across Goldstein—and, I'm quite sure, across the whole of the country. Our task, as parliamentarians, and as part of the national conversation, is to celebrate their work, to thank them enduringly for what they do, and to uphold the integrity and the dignity of their profession, at the same time as scrutinising those who have not met that standard. Our task is to thank them every day for the incredible work they do to care, to love and to show compassion for this nation's most vulnerable.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (15:55):  I, too, rise to add my support to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018. The Carnell-Paterson review recommended bringing together the functions of the Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. This was one of the 10 recommendations included in the Carnell-Paterson review. As the member for Hindmarsh—which is one of the oldest electorates in the country; I like to call it the wisest electorate in the country, because with age comes wisdom—I hear from constituents regularly who feel that they don't have a voice. They perhaps feel that they have worked all their lives, they've done everything for this nation, and now, in those twilight years towards the end, they are not getting the services that they require or that their loved ones are not receiving the services they require. So I sincerely hope that this bill will go some way to restoring the confidence of aged-care consumers and our senior citizens, in this period when they need these services.


Again, right up-front, I would like to acknowledge all the men and women who work in the aged-care sector. They include the carers, nurses, doctors, staff, kitchen staff and cleaners who keep the places going—especially the carers, because this is National Carers Week, which is celebrated between 14 and 20 October.


As I said, this bill is designed to provide a single point of contact for aged-care consumers and providers of aged care in relation to quality of care and the regulation that will be responsible for the accreditation, assessment and monitoring of, and complaints-handling for, aged-care services and Commonwealth funded aged-care services. The commissioner will be appointed for five years. The commission will regulate all areas of aged-care services, including residential aged-care services, home care services, flexible care services, the Commonwealth Home Support Program and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program.


About 1.3 million Australians are currently receiving some form of aged care, and that care is provided by approximately 400,000 nurses and carers. It's predicted that by 2056 the aged-care workforce will need to triple, and that takes us to around one million workers that will be required to care for and deliver services to the numbers of people—approximately 3.5 million older Australians—who will require those services.


Public expenditure on aged care is expected to double as a share of the economy by 2050. Billions of dollars have been cut—as we all know, from that horror budget of 2014-15. But we know that public expenditure is expected to double as a share of the economy by 2050. The Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, cut almost $2 billion in his first year as Treasurer. You cannot take $2 billion out of an industry and not expect it to suffer. Is it any wonder that the system is in crisis?


There are well over 108,000 people on the home care package waiting list, including 88,000 people with high needs, many living with dementia. As I've said in this place many times before, and as we've heard other speakers say, in the future we will judge ourselves as a nation by how we treated our elderly. We know that that figure of 108,000 blows out every quarter because there are more people going on the waiting list.


A classic example of this is a particular constituent who rang me the other day. We are trying to assist him, and we have written to the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care. He is looking after his aunty, an elderly woman in her mid-80s and who is on the list waiting for an aged-care package. She has been on that list for well over six months. She has now deteriorated and needs a higher-standard package, so she has to go through the assessment all over again, and there could be another six-month wait period. So she is waiting for another six months on top of the six she has been waiting for, which takes it to 12. She will deteriorate again before the package is handed to her. We're working with the minister's office to try to assist them and help them. When Philip rang me last week, he was beside himself. He wants to assist his aunty, who has no-one else to care for her and look after her.


Talking about the home care packages, there's a big debate about this in terms of people wanting to stay at home. If you speak to most Australians, they wish to stay at home, and with good services and good care packages they can achieve this. Unfortunately, there is not enough to go around. There is a desperate need. The release of the March 2018 data sadly reveals there are now more than 108,000 older Australians that are waiting on that list for a home care package. Many are deteriorating while they're waiting, so the package and the care that they will receive will not be up to scratch for their needs, and they will have to be reassessed and go onto higher packages. The waiting times are completely unacceptable. The numbers that we talk about are absolutely shocking. As I said, it's 108,000 and increasing every quarter. Many of these people are waiting with high needs, and many have dementia. Approximately 88,000 people who have high needs are on the waiting list.


It's now clear that the government and the minister have to do all that they can to curb that growing list and do whatever it takes to ensure that people receive the care that's required. We'll need to see a tripling of the aged-care workforce in the next 30 years to provide a high standard of living and care for this growing proportion of older Australians. Are we preparing ourselves for this? Is the government prepared? I'd say no. It's also predicted that the aged-care workforce requirements will need to increase from approximately 366,000 to around one million by 2050. Is the government prepared for this? Are we working towards this? I'd say no again.


Since government dumped Labor's $1.5 billion workforce compact and supplement after the 2013 election, we on this side have consistently called for the development of a comprehensive aged-care policy. We know that this government's been here for five years since 2013, and they will have been in government for up to six years before the next election comes. We know that the aged-care crisis has grown and become worse. It's been ignored. We on this side have said that it is an absolute priority that we should fix this. The last budget failed to fix the aged-care crisis. We saw funding for 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over four years. This is cruel and made even worse by the fact that the funding is coming from within the existing aged-care budget. Those 3½ thousand places a year aren't even enough to keep pace with demand. It feels like this government tries to plug a hole and a great big crack opens and gushes out from another place. We're not dealing with it.


It's particularly worrying that the government promised older Australians it would address the waitlist when we know that it will not address the waiting list. We know that the government's promised the world to older Australians waiting on the queue for a home care package. As I said earlier, there are 108,000 people waiting, and every quarter there's another 15,000 to 20,000 going on that list. It was this side of the House that introduced the Living Longer Living Better ageing reforms in 2012. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said in his budget reply speech that an elected Labor government will make dementia and ageing an absolute national priority.


We've seen the government finally concede, after many months of discussions, media reports and newspaper articles, that a royal commission is required to deal with a crisis that has unfolded on their watch. They denied that anything was required, but now they have finally conceded. That's a good thing, and I'm happy to see that it will be based in my state of South Australia. I support the royal commission, as do all of us on this side, but after five years in government every one of those opposite must accept some responsibility for this happening and what's going on in the aged-care system. We can't call ourselves a fair and generous country until we give elderly Australians the love, care and respect that they deserve. After all, they're the ones that built this nation that we prosper in today because of their hard work and sacrifices. 


What do we get from this government? It's failed to rule out any further cuts to aged care. The Prime Minister was asked this question directly a couple of weeks ago and he declined to rule out cutting further funding from the care of older Australians. Australians are rightly appalled by the shocking stories that we see, the horrendous images on TV, the Four Corners programs and the crisis that exists in our nation's aged-care system, particularly the standard of care being delivered in some nursing homes. Why won't the Prime Minister rule out further cuts to this area? As Treasurer, the Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from aged care in his first budget. You can't cut that amount of money from a particular area and think it doesn't have an affect. His $1.2 billion cut in the budget came on top of the almost $500 million he cut from aged-care funding in the 2015 MYEFO. This money went out of the aged-care budget and it didn't come back. This cut hits older Australians in residential aged-care facilities. It hits them the hardest, with a 50 per cent cut to the indexation of complex healthcare subsidies. The royal commission must examine the impact of these years of cuts. You don't fix aged care by cutting it; you fix it by funding it. 


To date there have been more than a dozen reviews. We've had hundreds of recommendations on this issue and they've all been ignored by the government. This isn't good enough. For all of the claims of the baby boomer budget earlier this year, the Prime Minister, then Treasurer, again cut further funding from residential aged care to try and fix the growing crisis in home care that was created by the government by cutting it to begin with. The Prime Minister and the Liberals can't be trusted to ensure older Australians get the services that they need and require. As we've heard from other speakers, the Prime Minister was the architect of those cuts, which have gutted aged care and put the sector under immense pressure. You can't rip out that amount of money, close to $2 billion, from an aged-care system over five years and not have an impact on quality. It's common sense. 


As I've said, as the representative for an area that has one of the highest ageing populations in the country, I've met and spoken with many constituents and people in the sector, who often complain about the tin-ear approach of the agencies and the way this policy is set up through this government. The government must explain to the Australian people how these continuous cuts to the aged-care budget have contributed to the crisis that we now face in aged care. The Prime Minister, as I said, was then the Treasurer who signed off on all those cuts to aged care in the 2016 budget; then he complains that there's a problem. Can you believe it—you cut and then you complain about it? When you make those cuts, it has devastating affects. The Prime Minister needs to tell them what he did and why he did it and come clean that he did cut aged-care funding. It's on the public record. We argued this point during the last sittings. The Prime Minister said that it was a lie to say he had cut funding to aged care. But all you have to do is look at the budget papers that were signed off by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. These cuts that he's denying are right there in black and white on page 101 of Budget Paper No. 2. But we all know that the infighting and the divisions that were taking place would have been their priority instead of looking at aged care and these issues at the time. It's time that the government started doing better on this critical area of policy.


I've always said that we should judge ourselves as a nation by how we treat our elderly—the people who have worked hard, the people who can no longer look after themselves, the people who have brought up children, grandchildren and in some cases great-grandchildren. They have kept family units together and have done everything for Australia as workers and as contributors, and now it's our time to look after them. I think it's an absolute disgrace that we don't have confidence in our aged-care systems in place. We should do everything we can to absolutely fix this because these people deserve better.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-10-15,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:10):  I represent the people of the Lyne electorate, which has one of the greatest aged demographics in the country. We have many aged-care facilities and many residents living at home relying on the aged-care home support package system. I must say that I have visited many of these nursing homes and residential aged-care facilities along the length and breadth of the Lyne electorate. From the north end around Wauchope and right down to Tea Gardens, we have many residential aged-care facilities.


The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the associated Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 had their genesis in the coalition government's commitment to improving the quality and safety and the standards for senior Australians who receive aged-care services, both residential and in the home care mode. It is very timely, as you know, because of recent events and the royal commission, that these bills are coming through at this time, but the genesis of this happened long before recent events appeared on TV. In fact, our royal commission into the aged-care system was initiated before any of the recent media coverage of this industry. These bills reflect the recommendations of a longstanding review of the national aged-care system's regulatory processes by Kate Carnell and Professor Ron Paterson.


In summary, this legislation merges the roles and responsibilities of two organisations and puts them into a unified one-stop shop so that both providers of aged care and people who are consumers—namely, the aged people who reside in these facilities or who receive care at home and their families—will know who is controlling standards and who they are to bring up any concerns with. Currently, these roles are divided between the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and its CEO, and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. These bills establish the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. The bills transfer the operations of the existing bodies into the new commission. They will also transfer existing members of the Aged Care Quality Advisory Council to the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council. The bills also describe the appointment processes for the commission, its council members and the commissioner himself or herself, and the reporting requirements are outlined. They describe how the information can be used or disclosed and what is protected. The commission will commence operating on 1 January 2019.


As I mentioned at the opening of my comments, aged care is a large part of the economy of Lyne because it is such a labour-intensive industry. During my time representing and caring for the members of the Lyne electorate, I have stressed the need to increase aged-care facilities across the nation. The mid-north coast of New South Wales has had an ageing demographic for decades longer than the rest of the country. We have a cluster of ageing people, many more than what you see in metropolitan Australia. So I have been very pleased to see a growth in aged-care funding across the Lyne electorate. 


When I first was given this responsibility, the aged-care combined budget was about $90 million annually. It's now up to $130 million annually. The number of aged-care beds has grown. Recurrent spending has grown. We have had increasing numbers of capital works projects that have been delivered inside the Lyne electorate. Underway at the moment there is a massive expansion at the Pacific Cape facility at Forster, with 144 new high care aged-care residential places. We've had expansion at the existing facility in Largs at the southern end. Over on the coast, at Hawks Nest and Tea Gardens, we've had an expansion at the Peter Sinclair Gardens. In the regions of Taree and Wingham, in the middle of the electorate, the Salvation Army has received an allocation of 80 new places, which will deliver a massive new facility for the Manning Valley. In Wauchope, Bundaleer Gardens, which has been in existence for decades, has received another 40 places for high care residential care. In the aged-care approvals round in the 2016-17 budget, there is an $8.5 million grant to allow this expansion. 


We've recently fought for and received an $8 million capital grant towards Anglicare's new modern, up-to-date nursing home and aged-care facility at Gloucester. They were struggling to get an up-to-date and appropriate aged-care facility, having the legacy of what used to be a nurses' home, adjacent to the hospital. It is currently straining under the physical limitations of the building because it wasn't really built with aged care in mind. Basically, it was a dormitory for nurses in the old days when nurses trained at Gloucester Hospital. Across the Hunter River, at Raymond Terrace, we have a similar facility that has been announced in these funding rounds. All together, we have made a huge advance across the Lyne electorate. 


Across Australia, however, long before the recent attention in the media with the royal commission, the minister and the coalition government looked at the required growth in the workforce. They made a fiscal allocation to a workforce development fund. We've also increased funding for multipurpose centres. We have increased flexible multipurpose services, transition care, short-term restorative care and flexible care for the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander care system. 


The other large increase has been the home care support packages, and that is really a very significant increase. We know that up until recently there were about 79,000 people receiving home care packages, but in the most recent budget there was $1.6 billion extra, including 6,000 new high care home care support packages and, over the forward estimates, another 14,000 in total, which will address some of the unmet need, because people want to live longer and with better quality of care in their own homes. It's a 20 per cent increase in one year. As I mentioned, we had about 71,000 people receiving home care by March 2017, but now that's up to 85,000 people at the end of March 2018. In rural and remote Australia, we have addressed the reality that the economies of scale are not there, so there is a $40 million pool for capital grants. Across the whole of the nation, the spend in rural and remote Australia is really significant.


When we realise how many people in Australia will require residential care or support packages in their own homes at some stage of their life, we can understand why this is such an important issue. We have people living longer because of improvements in modern health care, we've got better nutrition throughout their lives and we've reduced smoking. We have done so much in this space because we realised that we have a huge demand coming forward.


The other thing I'd like to make a few comments about is the royal commission. We realised, and Minister Wyatt realised, that there were instances where care was not appropriate. That's why he initiated these inquiries and why he was at the forefront of asking for a royal commission. It has a very large remit. Overall, it's looking at and trying to ensure the quality of aged-care services for Australians. Across the Lyne electorate and even before I was the member of the House of Representatives representing the Lyne electorate, I spent a lot of time visiting aged-care facilities because of my medical practice background. We are looking at the holistic extent of aged care, trying to identify the extent and instance of any substandard care, including, I hasten to say, mistreatment and any other form of abuse, and what the causes are behind any of these systemic failures—if and when they're identified. What actions should be taken? We need to know how to deliver the best aged-care service for Australia's seniors.


We're also looking into the care delivered to people with disabilities, including that cohort of people who end up in nursing homes at a very young age. That focus on people with disabilities and younger people in nursing homes is really important. The scourge of dementia will get particular attention. We will look at what future dementia-care models can be used, what is being used and the future challenges in keeping care accessible, affordable and of a high quality all at the same time.


There is the context of more people wanting to spend their senior years at home rather than the historical pattern of entering into residential aged care at a younger age and spending four or five years there. Now the average in some areas drops down even to six months, or to three months in some instances in my electorate. In looking at home care support packages and how home care can be delivered, the focus on rural and remote Australia is very important because, as I mentioned, some of the economies of scale don't exist in rural and remote Australia. I think that the need for support from the federal government will be critical to maintain those standards.


What Australian communities and families can do to improve aged-care services, and what they're looking for, is ensuring that all services should be patient- or person-centred and that there should be choice for people going into them. The control and the interdependence of those requirements should keep services accessible, affordable, person-centred and high quality. And it has to be sustainable. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, with the increasing numbers of senior Australians and with the amount of money available for all services, with the growth of the NDIS, the growth in the health budget and the growth in the aged-care budget, sustainability and quality are paramount. We can do this by using more technology and by growing our workforce, and also by looking at innovative models of care.


I thoroughly support this cluster of bills which will develop a one-stop shop so that both people working in the industry and people consuming the care in the industry will have a clear and transparent process for maintaining standards and for complaining when they aren't met. Aged care should be high quality. It should be accessible, particularly in rural and regional Australia and in electorates like Lyne. But please be reassured that I have fought long and hard over the five years I've been representing and caring for the Lyne electorate that we have delivered the goods in Lyne. There has been a massive growth and it is really well deserved because we have so many good institutions, but we need more physical places.

"Gorman, Patrick, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr GORMAN
 (Perth) (16:25):  Aged care is about people—people who we love and people who are vulnerable. Providing high-quality aged-care services to residents—elderly Australians—and assurance to their families and to those who love them is an essential task of any Australian government. Australia, a rich developed advanced country, should have one of the best aged-care systems in the world, and those who consume the services of the aged-care sector should have absolute confidence that the services they are being provided are of an international standard. Unfortunately, in Australia today, there are three debilitating problems with our current aged-care sector.


The Leader of the Opposition highlighted these problems plainly and simply in an interview recently on the national public broadcaster, the ABC. He highlighted these problems that are well known to anyone who works in the sector. Firstly, the staff do not get paid properly. We've got to be honest about that if we are going to grow and build this sector for the future. Secondly, we need adequate ratios of qualified staff, qualified carers, qualified nurses and all of the other health and professional workers who engage with the sector. Thirdly, years of budget cuts have reduced the quality of care and the time available to those who work in the sector to look after their residents.


The electorate of Perth is home to some 1,700 residential aged-care places from the Carramar Hostel in Morely down to Leighton Nursing Home in West Perth. The federal government spent more than $110 million in Perth alone on residential care in 2016-17. But to give us some idea of the scale of the problems facing the sector and facing us as a community, while there are 1,700 residential care places, in the electorate of Perth there are some 14,000 people over the age of 70 in the electorate. This is a big challenge and it's one that we're going to continue to confront in this parliament for many years.


Aged care has provided two women in my life with dignity in their final years. My great grandmother, Rooke, helped raise my father, Ron. Later in life, Rooke lived in the adjoining house to my home and she was my regular carer when my mother returned to work. I know all too well that older Australians are key to raising and educating the next generation of Australians. Rooke was sharp. She worked in the Australian tax office for decades and was proud of her efforts in being seconded to assist with the administration of Australia's war efforts. In her retirement, while her mind was sharp, she eventually began to have injuries from falls and minor incidents. There comes a point for many families where the burden becomes too much. My dad speaks of the pain that he and his mother went through in having to make the decision to place someone that they loved, who had been such an important part of their lives, into care. Dad describes his first engagement with the aged-care sector as navigating 'a mix of stigma and ignorance' and, at the same time, handling all of the personal guilt that comes when you take a loved one out of the family home into a world where the care is what is available or what you can afford, not always what you need. 


We were lucky in our family that Rooke found a place that was close to home in a centre that is now known as Aegis St Francis. It was a centre that respected her interests. They even allowed her to form and run prayer groups while she was in what became her final home. She ran the prayer groups as her health continued to deteriorate and she developed dementia, something that affects more families than any of us in this place probably know. For myself—at the time a high school student in year 10 who visited regularly—and for my parents and my grandmother, it was the staff in the centre that made that adjustment manageable, emotionally and practically. I want to thank all of the staff who worked with Rooke at that time. The staff in aged care do heroic work.


Rooke had lived with her daughter, my grandmother Pat, since my dad was six months old. Grandma Pat herself worked in the healthcare space, in the administration at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital or, for any Western Australians, 'Charlies'. After her retirement, she lived as an active pensioner, looking after my brother and me, learning tai chi and doing all those things that many people look forward to in retirement. Unfortunately, just a few years into her retirement, she developed pancreatic cancer, but she continued to live at home. For older Australians, living at home takes bravery and determination, but it is for many the best way to live and, wherever possible, it's a right that we should do everything we can to ensure. Grandma Pat required occasional care and was well supported in the home before starting to go in and out of palliative care. Again, to work in palliative care is heroic. Grandma Pat died when I was in year 12. I'm glad I can again say thank you to the people who worked at Silver Chain, in the palliative care and aged-care space, who cared for her when we no longer could.


It's because of these experiences and those of hundreds of thousands of Australians that I want to dedicate my contribution on the debate about this bill to the people who work in aged care—people like Simone Walsh, who works in the laundry of an aged-care home in Western Australia. Simone was leaving work one day when she heard the nurses talking about how incredibly sad it was that one of the residents who was passing on had no local family. Instead of just going home, Simone went to the resident's room. Simone sat and held her hand for the next two hours. She was there as the resident passed on, just so that she would not die alone. I think that tells you a little bit about the commitment that people who work in aged care have, not just to their professional job but also to the residents they work with and care for every single day.


Another Western Australian, Melinda Vaz, is a worker in aged care pleading for staff-to-resident ratios. Melinda has said that her facility is struggling due to the cuts:


We have a ratio of four staff to 31 residents. There is so little time that can be given to each resident. There are no mandatory staff-to-resident ratios for our industry, unlike in hospitals or childcare centres, so some facilities just cut right back on staff.


She says that she's aware of one facility where there are 60 residents being looked after or monitored by just one staff member during the night shift. This alone demonstrates the need to expand the conversation we're having today and for the royal commission to look at the need for staff-to-resident ratios if we are to have a sector that meets world-class standards. Again, to those who work in aged care: thank you for working in aged care; thank you for the work you do and for the sacrifices you make.


I'm also realistic that the operators in the aged-care sector are under extreme pressure. I've had the privilege to get to know, over a number of years, Graeme Prior, the CEO of Hall & Prior Residential Aged Care, a proud Western Australian company. I've learned from operators like Graeme, people who are passionate about ensuring that every Australian gets the quality of life they deserve. Graeme, in his leadership of Hall & Prior, has shown the true circle of life that aged care represents. I was pleasantly surprised to read, in researching for this speech, about the future of Woodside Maternity Hospital. Woodside Maternity Hospital is where I was born in 1984. It closed and concluded its work as a maternity hospital some years ago. A beautiful building in East Fremantle, it was built in 1897, initially as a residence. It became a maternity hospital in 1951 and is now under a major renovation to become an aged-care facility run by Hall & Prior. This redevelopment will create hundreds of jobs in the construction process and hundreds of jobs when it's in operation, add new aged-care places to the sector and ensure that this beautiful building continues to provide care for vulnerable Australians at the other end of the age spectrum. Graeme Prior explained his business philosophy: 'To me, it is part of what we do—preserving wonderful iconic parts of the community.' I think that comment is as true for the building as it is for the residents and consumers of aged care.


I make the point in this debate that aged-care residents are consumers. They are consumers of a service and they deserve all of the rights that are afforded to them as consumers in the Australian marketplace. I note we've got the shadow minister for consumer affairs in the chamber at the moment, and I thank her for being here for this speech. Becoming an aged-care consumer—



Mr Falinski interjecting—




Mr GORMAN:
  I also thank her for the important work she does as part of her chamber duty for the operation of the parliament.


Becoming an aged-care consumer is currently not an easy process. There are many complex forms, weeks or years of investigation and waiting lists that feel like they can span forever just to get access to essential services that an individual needs. It is at this time that people also begin the discussion about plans for the final years of one's life, juggling the immediate needs of care services and the important decisions about what happens at the end of one's life and how that life may be celebrated by family and friends when someone is no longer with us.


In this regard, I want to commend the work of the chair of the Western Australian parliament's Joint Select Committee on End of Life Choices, Amber-Jade Sanderson. The committee's report, released in August, is a carefully considered analysis of the laws needed to ensure people can manage their health care throughout the dying process. I raise this work because aged care is not just one commission, one council, one service provider or one government department. For people to have dignity in their final years it is essential for both state and federal governments to work cooperatively to deliver quality and choice for all Australians. I note that local government should also ensure timely approval of aged-care facilities to make sure that there are enough beds available in local municipalities. 


The aged-care sector, valued at some $17.4 billion by the Productivity Commission, has more than one million Australians accessing some form of its services with federal funding in this current financial year. That's more than 200,000 people in permanent care and 700,000 people accessing the Commonwealth Home Support Program. The Productivity Commission has issued a very stark and firm call about the need to think about the future of the sector, which is, I note, what the government is doing with the introduction of this bill today. The Productivity Commission said:


The Australian population is ageing rapidly, with the proportion of people aged 65 years or over in the total population projected to increase from 15.1 per cent in 2016 … to 21.8 per cent in 2056 …


The more alarming news is that by 2056 we will need to triple the aged-care workforce in this country. In other words, our nation will need around one million aged-care workers. That's one million workers delivering services to more than 3.5 million Australians in 2056.


In making further comments on this bill, I want to commend the work that Labor's shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Julie Collins, has done. Her advocacy for older Australians and the people who care for them is one of the reasons we are having this debate today. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 will establish the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission from next year. The commission will have a significant mission—restoring confidence for aged-care consumers, restoring confidence for their families, restoring confidence for millions of Australians. It will also have an important role in dealing with some of the recommendations that come out of the royal commission. 


The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will, fortunately, provide a single point of contact for aged-care consumers and a single point of contact for the providers as well. I think that's something that will be welcomed by many people who are operating in the very difficult business environment that is aged care. The agency will have responsibility for accreditation, assessment, monitoring, and complaints handling. In other words, it will have its hands full! This will cover residential aged care, home care, flexible care, the Commonwealth Home Support Program and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program. For this reason I would say that, when the government considers who they will appoint as the first commissioner, it will be a very important decision for the government.


There are problems that this commission won't fix: quality standards in the sector are dropping; the reporting system is not working; there aren't enough aged-care workers and they aren't given enough pay; and we have had cuts in the sector. With the sector in crisis, I welcome this piece of legislation, but I will finish my remarks by saying there is much, much, much more to do.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:40):  I would like to join the member for Perth in thanking the shadow minister for consumer affairs for being here to listen to this very important speech. Before I arrived in this place I had a business that supplied a lot of furniture and equipment to nursing homes and to the aged-care sector and the healthcare sector generally. It was a very interesting perspective on life and quite a confronting one for a 30-year-old to start a business and see so many people at the end of their lives. In the years between coming to this place and looking after people in so many nursing homes across Australia, I think I saw the best and the worst of humanity. But the one thing I can say for sure is that the aged-care system in Australia has never been better. In thinking back to when I first started out, 15 or so years ago, my first experience with a nursing home was to walk into the UnitingCare facility in Croydon. Before even getting to the door you were overwhelmed with the stench of urine emanating from the facility. To this day, it is something I cannot forget.


There were other instances, such as when I pulled into a nursing home in Bathurst one day and saw all the staff in the parking lot smoking. When I went into the facility—it was in the middle of winter—I found all the residents sitting in chairs in the common room of the nursing home watching a fish tank, literally. I remember another incident in which a not-for-profit provider was looking at one of our beds. As I walked down the hall, there were three women—they happened to be women—in three separate rooms screaming for someone to come and help them. I don't know how long they had been there. I still remember their cries of agony as they sought to be helped. That was 15 years ago. I haven't seen anything like that in the last 10 years or so. It wasn't because the facilities didn't have enough money and it wasn't because the facilities were understaffed—in fact, in many instances, quite the opposite. It was because we were coming out of a period in which aged care was seen as the annexe at the back of the local hospital. It was because we didn't treat our tribal elders as human beings, but rather as problems, in many instances to be forgotten.


A huge change occurred in 1987 when the then Hawke-Keating government started to allow new nursing homes to be built. There were also the reforms of the member for Pearce and the member for Menzies in the Howard government, which allowed private sector investors to come into the market. As the member for Perth mentioned, providers such as Graeme Prior, who was a good customer of mine, brought a level of service and care to nursing homes and to nursing home residents because he actually cared about the people who were in his home. The member for Perth mentioned that they are not just residents but are actually consumers of these goods. That's why it's so important that we have the shadow minister for consumer affairs here. The importance of that is that when we started treating these residents as human beings who had a choice, the quality and level of care went through the roof. It was an important and critical factor in improving the level of care that older Australians, our tribal elders, got. It wasn't by dint of government regulation. It was by dint of government reform that allowed people to come into this market and to provide a better service. 


To that end I also have to congratulate the member for Port Adelaide. If the truth be told, the Howard government probably did hold off on a lot of other reforms that the member for Pearce would have liked to have implemented. But the member for Port Adelaide, and then Senator Fifield when he was the aged-care minister, did a lot of important work in terms of providing even further flexibility in this market, which allowed more people to come into this market and allowed more people to have choice. The greatest problem that we have in Australia today is the fact that people, when they need to move into their last home, don't have a choice anymore. They have to pick either from staying at home, which has no longer become an option, or moving into a nursing home that was built in the 1950s, for the 1950s, with attitudes of how people should be treated in the 1950s, because there is nowhere else for them to go. That's not good enough. It's not good enough in the 21st century and it's not good enough in a country like Australia. 


So when the Labor Party talks about cuts to aged care, know this: what they're saying is that when Minister Ken Wyatt introduced this bill and said, 'We are going to stand up for the rights of those residents. We will no longer allow private sector companies, and for that matter not-for-profit companies, to use our ratings system to rort taxpayer dollars while not delivering the care that they say they are delivering to Australians,' he stood up for the integrity of this parliament, for the integrity of the aged-care system and for the integrity of those people who are in those homes today. 


Let's be clear that when Labor talks about restoring the so-called cuts, what they are talking about is restoring the rorts that were out of control in the aged-care marketplace, where people were rating people as having a level of care and requiring a level of care that everyone knew they didn't know. We had providers in the Australian market whose business case was that they could better manipulate the ACAR system to ensure they got the highest level of funding that they could possibly hope for. It was a rort. It was taking money from the care of others and putting it in the pockets of the unscrupulous. That's what Labor wants to return to in this entire argument. It's absolutely appalling and they should know better. They should know better primarily for this reason: both sides of this parliament have done a tremendous amount since 1987 to restore the level of care, hope and generosity that our country has always been known for to older Australians regardless of where they are in Australian society. What they're seeking to do is undo some of that bipartisanship for base political purposes. It is absolutely appalling. 


When they start talking about staff ratios, know this: they're not talking about staff ratios; they're talking about nurse ratios. There are a lot of people in every nursing home and very few of them are nurses, because the care that is provided by those people is unqualifiedly great. It is quantitatively and qualitatively out of this world. Nurses are good at providing clinical care. The carers that we have in so many of our nursing homes right around this country provide a level of care that you could not hope to get anywhere else in Australia. You ask any older Australian today whether they would prefer to be in a ward bed in a hospital or in one of these new aged-care facilities, and out of 10,000 Australians I doubt that you could find one who would say that they would prefer to be in a hospital. The reason for that is primarily the love and care that these staff bring to those nursing homes. The Labor Party wants to rip that asunder. For what reason? For the purposes of appealing to their union mates in the nurses federation. It is absolutely appalling that they would indulge themselves in this level of politicisation of this sector. 


When you think about it, an older Australian who spends their time in a ward bed in New South Wales in your average public hospital will cost the Australian taxpayer $1,600 or $1,700 for that night, but in a nursing home it's $160 a night, and they will get a better level of care. And that's what they require—not clinical care, but care. That's what this parliament should want. That's what both sides of this House should want for Australians.


When you also think about home care versus residential care, in so many parts of Australia, the key is this: that we are spending billions of dollars in providing services to people in their homes. Some of those services are not care-related services. They are gardening, cooking and other levels of care that our home care packages provide, and no-one thinks or would suggest that that's a bad thing. But compare that to the level of care that someone can get in a residential aged-care facility. That includes ensuring that people get their medicine in the right dosages at the right times, that they are properly eating and that they are getting socialisation—because the biggest issue that older Australians are facing, in my electorate and, I suspect, right across Australia, is a sense of social isolation, because they feel that they are stuck in their homes, whereas, in nursing homes and aged-care facilities across this country, a large part of the mission and the purpose that those aged-care facilities have is ensuring that their residents have the capacity to go out and enjoy their lives. And that's why residential aged care is so important.


I cannot speak too highly of Thompson Health Care, which has a number of nursing homes in my electorate. They, for example, have undertaken a major project, with the University of Technology and a number of pharmaceutical companies, to ensure that older Australians—who so often find it more difficult to communicate with their carers—are being looked after when it comes to pain, because so many issues that were seen as behavioural issues were actually our fellow Australians, simply put, in pain. These are not studies that are undertaken in public hospitals. These are not studies that are undertaken in every nursing home. Indeed, this is the sort of level of care and innovation that is going on in the aged-care sector in Australia because that's what you get when you have a competitive and innovative marketplace like we have in Australia. That is what you get when you treat people as more than just residents stuck in your nursing home—rather, as consumers who have a choice as to where they can go.


This bill, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, will make it even better for nursing homes and those people who spend the last few years of their lives in nursing homes, because it will ensure that every person who goes into a nursing home can know that they are getting a minimum level of care that is reliably performed, day in and day out.


I heard the other day that three-quarters of residents who live in these nursing homes have not been visited by a family member or someone in the last six months. That is just the way that our society is, unfortunately. It's the way that our community has evolved. So, for so many—for three-quarters of those people who are in nursing homes—their families have become the other residents and the staff of these nursing homes. We owe it to them to ensure that they have as much choice as possible.


When people have dementia, one of the side effects of the dementia is that people often end up reverting to the language that they first grew up with. We have so many Australians who were born overseas, who end up like my grandmother, who, in the last few months of her life, started speaking in Russian again. If she had not been in a nursing home where the staff were fluent in Russian, it would have been very difficult for her to communicate and for her to be understood and heard and cared for. But because we have a marketplace, because we agree with innovation, because we encourage it and encourage competition, there is a place for every person in the Australian aged-care market to get the type of care that they not only need but want. This bill is about ensuring that older Australians get the care that they need. But the marketplace that we on both sides of this parliament have created, over many years, has ensured that every Australian can get the care that they want.


In the minute that I have left, I would also like to mention that we have enormous challenges coming up. Those in the cohort of baby boomers are about to find themselves in that age category where they may consider putting themselves into their last home, being a residential aged-care home. We have challenges around workforce planning and we have challenges around the number of beds that are available. Ask any nursing home provider and they will tell you that the biggest challenge they face is planning and development. But we have created a system in this country that has ensured Australians get a superior level of care in their last few years. It is the job of this House and of this bill to make sure that we give them an even better experience than those who came before them.

"Keay, Justine, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (16:56):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the member for Franklin's second reading amendment to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018.


As we know, we have a royal commission into aged care at the moment. And there are reasons for that—very valid reasons for that. But I want to take some of my time to put into context why the issue of aged care is so important to my home state of Tasmania and, of course, to my electorate of Braddon. The recent ABS census has revealed that Tasmania has the oldest population in Australia, with almost 20 per cent of our population aged over 65 years. The census also found that Tasmania's population is ageing faster than the Australian average, so we can get a bit of a picture of why aged care is so important in my state.


In my electorate, the ABS has found that the community of Latrobe, which is not far from where I live, saw the greatest increase in the proportion of the population aged over 65 years between the years 2011 and 2016, so those aged over 65 are very concentrated in my electorate. But Tasmanians need—right now and into the future—quality aged care.


Rather than support aged care, this government, like all coalition governments before it, has reverted to type. The Prime Minister, as Treasurer, cut $1.2 billion from aged care in his very first budget. That $1.2 billion cut came on top of the almost $500 million cut from aged-care funding in the 2015 MYEFO. This savage cut hit older Australians in residential aged-care facilities the hardest, with a 50 per cent cut to the indexation of complex healthcare subsidies. The previous member seemed very deluded as to what these cuts actually meant to the people in residential aged care. I remember going to Emmerton Park, which is in Smithton, in the far north-west of Tasmania, just prior to the 2016 election. The residents there wanted to hear from the candidates as to their positions on aged care. Sadly, at the time, the then current Liberal member for Braddon didn't bother to turn up. What he would have heard at that point was that there were residents in that facility who were very, very concerned about what those cuts meant to their daily lives. I had one lady who said to me: 'Does this mean I won't get my physiotherapy? That's what's actually keeping me mobile. I don't want to end up with some mobility aid; I want to keep walking, and that physio means I can continue to do that for as long as possible.' She was concerned that it would mean she would not have access to that physio. In fact, that's what happened because of those cuts.


And these cuts have continued. In May this year, in the budget, the government announced it would fund an additional 14,000 home care packages. But this money was not new money. This money was taken out of residential aged care. It wasn't actually growing the pool of funding to provide more care for our older Australians but was just shifting the money around.


The most recent data shows that there are now 121,000 people on the home care package waiting list. Over a three-month period, that list has blown out by an extra 13,000 people waiting. We hear these stories just about every day in this place and, particularly, the ones who are telling the stories are the ones sitting on the opposition benches, because we're the ones out there listening to people and who actually care about what home care packages mean for them.


I was speaking to a lady whose relative, whose mother, sadly, passed away in March. She spent her last days in residential aged care, but she was waiting for a category 4 in-home care package, which was granted to her six months after her death. How ridiculous is that? She could have passed away in her own home with that home care package but, sadly, she was forced to spend her last days in residential aged care.


The average waiting time, according this government's own data, for level 3 or 4 packages is still more than 12 months, and the example I just gave pretty much demonstrates that is the case. While the government continues to hide the state-by-state breakdown of this data, a local provider in my electorate has told me that there are more than 3,000 people in Tasmania waiting for a package.


Waiting for these packages has a terrible impact on families. I received an email from Karen, who is the daughter of Terrence. Terrence lives in my electorate and Karen lives in Queensland. She wrote to me in absolute despair. Her father had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease eight years ago and was given a terminal diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. He had been assessed for a level 4 home care package and had been sitting on the system for over 12 months.


Karen's mother was Terrence's sole carer, 24/7. He was receiving an emergency level 2 home care package last year, but things got so bad that Karen was ringing My Aged Care, trying to find out what was going on. She was told that he was on a priority list but that it would be another 12-month wait. It got to a crisis point where Karen's mother just fell into a heap; a neighbour found her on the floor of the home, sobbing. Karen had to ship her parents to Queensland to provide them both with the care that they needed because Terrence could not get the level 4 care package that he had been assessed for. The toll on the carers in this scenario under this government was absolutely tremendous and all the hearts of the opposition members here know all too well what this means, because we hear it all the time. Now, Karen is not sure what's going to happen with her dad. She knows that they can't live with her permanently. They're trying very desperately to work out what is going on with his care package, and she came to me in absolute despair. But this is one story of far, far too many.


We know the list has blown out by 13,000 people over a quarter and that over 121,000 people are still waiting for the package that they deserve. The crisis in aged care of this government's making is not just confined to these aged-care packages. We've heard and we've seen some shocking stories. I want to share stories of two people from my electorate who have contacted me about the quality of residential care being delivered. I've removed the identity of the facilities to protect the management and staff, because I know they're doing the absolute best they can under the funding arrangement that's in place.


Elle from my electorate wrote to me, and her letter is quite long. I'll try to paraphrase it. She wrote:


After the recent Liberal leadership fiasco, I've lost any faith in the prospect of the federal coalition government taking action in the interests of elderly people in regional areas, who involuntarily are destined to end their lives in a residential aged-care facility. Which is why I'm writing to you now, in your capacity as my local MHR, asking you to make representations in the Australian parliament on behalf of such individuals.


And I'm very privileged to do that on her behalf. She continued:


Just under 12 months ago, my then wholly bed-ridden husband was admitted as a permanent resident of an aged-care facility with an ACAT 'high care, complex needs' assessment. Progressively, over the ensuing six months, commendable standards of care and support enabled him to get out and about in a wheelchair for up to 5 hours a day; leaving him nevertheless dependent on carer support for all bed based needs over the remaining 19 hours or so each day.


Come January this year, it became apparent that fewer staff across care and related categories were 'on the floor' on weekends and public holidays. At a residents' meeting, the facility manager announced the then pending cuts to staff shift hours and other resources. He advised shifts for personal care staff would be cut by 14 hours per day, inclusive of already understaffed weekend and holiday periods. The facilities manager explained that those cuts were unavoidable given the range and extent of reductions in levels of previously accessible federal government financial assistance to residential aged care.


Elle went on to provide me with some of the consequences of these additional cuts imposed by this government. Residents are waiting up to 90 minutes when they need to go to the toilet. There are not enough staff around and no-one can find a staff member when they need one. They're woken at 7 am and left on the toilet for ages while the shower water keeps running. There are lots of stories about residents being left in bed until 1 pm and reports of residents falling because they try to get up and do things for themselves. There are instances of carers in tears when they find their loved ones at risk of getting out of bed themselves and carers clearly under great stress. New arrivals have said that they cry when they get home at night because they can't provide the level of service they've been taught they should. Elle said to me:


Please, please do whatever you can to make representations in appropriate quarters and to relevant decision makers. 


She signs off her letter to me 'Almost despairingly'


This is what members of the opposition are hearing day in, day out. I am very privileged to stand here in this place and talk to the government members, although there are only two opposite me now. I'm hoping the minister is hearing this. This is just one sad example, not just of the carers, the families or the person in residential aged care but of those who are taking care of them, the staff in these facilities and what they are facing day in, day out because this government does not care about these people or about our aged-care system. That is due primarily, in my opinion, to the savage cuts that they've made in this sector. 


Brian, another member of my electorate, is a resident in a facility and he's written to me: 


I am a constituent in your electorate and a permanent resident of a not-for-profit aged care facility which receives financial assistance from the Federal Government.


I am 83 years—wheelchair bound but otherwise intact and very observant about issues and problems surrounding that facility.


Early last month—


this was back in August—


… residents were informed by the facility manager to the following effect:


(1) Because of reductions in funding previously available via government assistance, care staff cuts will be necessary on a scale leading to significant reductions in shift hours. 


We are getting a bit of a pattern here. 


(2) In the circumstances, management was unable to predict either the impact of such cuts or the extent to which the most vulnerable residents would be adversely affected. 


(3) Further cuts in staff and resources could well be necessary from financial year 2018/19 onwards.


Brian continues:


Subsequent experience has shown adverse effects of cuts in staff and shift hours to be significant. 


I would hope no elected government would intentionally treat its elderly citizens, most of whom have raised families, worked hard, paid their taxes, and/or otherwise contributed to their respective families over many decades, by making budget decisions with such foreseeably adverse consequences. 


I ask you to make direct, strong and urgent representations to government to act with the compassion and understanding that we expect from our elected representatives.


Yours hopefully


Brian


Hear how he signed that off? Please take note, those opposite, of the way those two constituents of mine have finished their letters to me: 'Almost despairingly' and 'Yours hopefully'. You can just imagine what these people facing. One has her husband in residential aged care and the other is a resident who is clearly observing what is going on. These personal stories time and time again clearly show our system is in crisis. They cannot give up on their members in these facilities and this is why the royal commission is so important and Labor welcomes, finally, this commission going ahead. 


Why did it take the Prime Minister to get all wound up over a Four Corners report to be galvanised into action? One can easily conclude it was all about getting the politics right and not about the issue. If it was about the issue, the coalition government should have and could have acted sooner, because we've been telling these stories for a very long time. Instead, they've repeatedly ignored the calls from Labor, from families and from stakeholders. Now we have to have a royal commission into aged care and it has to look at every aspect of aged care. But let's not wait until the royal commission finishes; we know what needs to be done. The government is sitting on so many reports. It could actually start fixing the system today, but it's not. 


Regarding the workforce issues, I had a tremendous opportunity to go to one of the facilities in my electorate, Meercroft Aged Care, and walk a day in the shoes of an extended care assistant. It was very confronting, I have to say. I think we know what takes places when a loved one is in residential aged care, but I saw it firsthand. There was an elderly man getting showered and cleaned up. There was a 40-year-old with Huntington's disease who has a sister in the dementia care ward with Huntington's disease as well. I saw the work that these people do. It's backbreaking work and there are the long hours. The bells are ringing all the time. We know there are not enough people on the floors of these facilities. It was an absolute privilege to go with Elaine at Meercroft—to walk with her and see what she does. 


I say to every member of this place: do it. Ring up the residential aged care in your electorate, put on your soft shoes and walk around with them, get your hands dirty and meet some of these wonderful residents and wonderful carers who this government has completely neglected. See exactly what it's like to provide that level of care to those residents, but also see what those people receiving that care are going through. I think it would open your eyes and I think it would make members opposite actually stand up and tell the stories of the people in their electorates who are suffering under a system that is severely underfunded.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (17:11):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. Aged care is not always perfect, but it is our job here to make it as near to perfect as possible: for our grandparents, for our parents and even, might I say, eventually, hopefully, for ourselves. They, that being our parents and our grandparents—and hopefully us, by the time we get there—deserve our respect. They've earned it. They've built the world in which we live. 


Aged care, though, will be an ongoing challenge for governments for virtually as long as governments exist. The intergenerational reviews have clearly mapped out the ageing of the Australian population and the demands that will be placed on the taxpayers' dollars going forward. Regardless of that demand and just how difficult it is for us to meet as a nation, we do have to meet it; we are obligated to do so. It is one of the reasons, of course—and I won't get onto this, but the Prime Minister has been saying it quite clearly—why we need to have a strong economy: we need to ensure that we can care for our aged sector, for those who have built this nation, in an appropriate manner. Regardless of how we do that, we need to make sure that good quality infrastructure exists where it is needed and, more importantly, that within that good quality infrastructure there is good quality care: the love, the consideration, the respect and the first-class medical and hotel services that our aged sector deserve. 


Events in the recent past have turbocharged change in the aged-care sector, most notably in my home state of South Australia with the tragedy, the debacle and the disgrace that surrounded the Oakden nursing home, which was a state government owned and operated facility. It was engulfed in scandal when it was found that the facility was guilty of institutionalised abuse. In fact, residents were, at times, not fed for what was deemed to be poor behaviour. That is beyond belief. It is appalling. Mercifully, that place is now shut. Unfortunately, I think we can be fairly sure that the behaviour that was so bad at the Oakden facility is not confined to just that one facility in Australia. There will be echoes of Oakden found elsewhere.


Before I go on I want to put in a plug for aged-care workers, particularly those in my electorate of Grey. I have visited many nursing homes and facilities over the years, and I can't remember a facility where I was not impressed by the strong dedication of the staff and by their care for the residents. When I spoke to the residents, they seemed to almost unanimously speak about what a wonderful place they lived in. The infrastructure is generally good. Often it is excellent, and I'm very pleased to have been to a number of facilities to mark the fact that the Commonwealth has made considerable contributions to enhancing and expanding those facilities. So often it's excellent. Sometimes, though, it is tired and in need of rejuvenation, undoubtedly. But I've found that even in these facilities, pretty much without exception, the staff have had that same loving, caring, respectful dedication to their job. But can I guarantee that every staff member and every facility is doing exactly that? Of course I can't. In fact, if there is one bad apple in the barrel, that's one too many. So I'm hopefully going to find in this royal commission that the facilities in my electorate largely live up to the plug that I've given them. I'll be somewhat surprised if they don't. 


When I do receive complaints to my office from families that are not happy with facilities, I obviously go to every degree to try and find out exactly what has happened, where fault might lie and what is being done to make sure that those issues are assessed. Sometimes there are two sides to the story, as all of us that come to this place would know. We have to be careful when we're making allegations, particularly any public allegations, that we know what we're talking about. But I work through those situations when they are brought to my attention. I have one that I'm working on at the moment. 


To come to this bill, the government's aim is to ensure the system is the best that it can be. The bill repeals the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Act 2013 and the transitional provisions related to that act. The bill amends the Aged Care Act 1997 in order to establish the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission and the commissioner to have a one-stop shop, as it were, to ramp up and give more power to this organisation so we can root out any transgressions that are in the system. Hopefully they will not be many. I'm pretty confident there won't be many. But I'm fully aware there were 5,000 submissions to the scoping study. 


The aim, simply, is to do better than we have ever done before to make the system the best it has ever been. I'm very hopeful that this commission and commissioner will help bring about whatever change is needed to bring about that outcome. I congratulate the minister. He is a very fine gentleman and I think he's doing a very good job. One of the fundamental changes that he's made to the system is to alter the reporting and registration system for home care packages so that for the first time a national government actually knows what the real demand is for home care packages. 


It is interesting that when I hear the criticisms from across the chamber, the member for Braddon most recently, they know full well that when they were in government they didn't know either what the real demand was for home care packages. It's taken courage for the minister to bring that forward and put it on the table, because now he's getting criticism for not immediately filling that backlog. He's had the strength. He knew what was coming. Our mate Ken's been around the system for a while. He knew very well that this was an understated and unrecognised demand in the system. He's had the gumption to get up and put it on the table and then to go to cabinet and get some extra finance to do something about it—$1.6 billion in the last budget. That's $1.6 billion for 14,000 new home care packages, which will take us to 74,000 by 2022. That's an outstanding result. Well done to him. 


As he knows, I know and you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, there is more to be done, because there is still this backlog that this new system has established. He's done other things as well. Very recently he announced the $40 billion funding available for infrastructure grants for nursing homes, and certainly across my electorate there's been quite a bit of interest in that. In fact, as has been stated in this place, we have, at this stage, record funding for aged care in Australia—record funding. 


I know there is a criticism from the other side that keeps coming up: 'You've cut; you've cut; you've cut.' I don't know what it is about mathematics which suggests a record is not more than we've ever had before. A record, by its very definition, means this is the most money that has ever gone into the system. It's not less; it's more. It's because we are running a strong economy. As I said earlier, I'm not going to give you a long lecture on the economy, but the turnaround has been quite stark, I think, over the last three years or so. It's really picking up a head of steam. It's taking a while to get to my home state—we had a few other issues we had to deal with—but I think it's even starting to filter through there. We're looking forward to MYEFO when it comes around. Certainly the result that came out of last year's budget, the $8 billion improvement, was very good. It gives the government the flexibility to do things about some of these long-term problems, and that's what we've been doing. 


Now we're having the aged-care royal commission, which the Prime Minister announced last week, to shine the light in. Once again, this is a brave move and not unlike the minister's move, because when a royal commission reports there is some kind of obligation, or at least a public expectation, that the government will act on that royal commission and not just ignore the incredible amount of work that a royal commission does in a certain area. I will be looking forward to that report. I'm hopeful that the task will not be as great as some might imagine, but it may well be. It may well be a huge impost on future governments. But, as I said at the beginning of this contribution, whatever it will be it will be, and we're going to have to meet it. So, with this bill, the minister is putting the blowtorch, if you like, to aged care and making sure that the sector is actually delivering what it is being paid to do. It is being paid by the taxpayer and subsidised by the taxpayer to deliver first-class aged care. We have to make sure that it is doing that, and that's what the new commissioner will do. 


In closing, before I run out of time, I'll return to a subject that I've touched on in this place before. Peterborough is a town of around about 2,000 people in my electorate. In it's day, like a number of other communities, it had an aged-care hostel that had its own management. Like many other towns, including the one that I come from, we in our wisdom, in the eighties, amalgamated the hospital boards and the aged-care facility boards. It made sense because there are a lot of genuine cross-benefits and a lot of things that you can share. It worked very well until the previous state government in South Australia, which had 16 years at the helm and was thrown out last March, decided that we didn't need hospital boards anymore, and all of us who were on those boards were made redundant. The previous state government inherited a whole swag of aged-care facilities and, as state governments don't see them as their prime responsibility, over the years it didn't reinvest in those facilities. In fact, their ownership arrangements now make it quite difficult for those particular facilities to access Commonwealth funds when it comes to infrastructure grants. 


This is an ongoing issue in Peterborough, in Cummins and in a number of other communities that I could name. We are at the stage where we need serious reinvestment. I've asked the minister to look at this closely. We've got a new minister in South Australia. I've asked him to look at it as well to see if we can come up with a way—an ownership model or a way of making sure that the bid is adapted to fit the rules—to find some Commonwealth support for these small communities. I can tell you: a town of 1,000 or 1,200 people doesn't need a 65-bed nursing home unit. In fact it would be empty most of the time and go broke very quickly. What we need is the right-sized unit that is attached to the local hospital to give mutual benefits and to make sure you make best use of your staff, with all the things that go with it.


But it is unfair not to make an effort to provide that aged care where you have the bones of the potential to do so. People who have lived in a community all their life, given their option, if they have to move out of their own home—and we'll do everything to try to keep them in their own home—would prefer, of course, to stay in the community in which they have lived for all their life and where, hopefully, their family still lives, where they can be visited by their friends and visited by their family. It comes as a great shock to some when they have to move maybe hundreds of kilometres to access the kind of care they need.


I understand that there will always be tight spots. There will always be times when we're short of places at the right place for those particular consumers. But, where we can, we need to reinvest in these smaller units, and we need to find a way for them to survive. That's something else that I regularly bend the ear of the minister on: the extra costs of operating these smaller units within country regions. We need once again, as we do with the overall challenge of aged care, to rise to that challenge and find a way for them to survive, to replenish, to renew and to provide a first-class service to those residents of the smaller communities as well. With those words, I will conclude, but I recommend the bill to this House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  I thank the member for Grey. I just remind him too: you have to call the minister by his correct title here. You can't call him 'Kenny'. It has to be the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care. That's just a reminder. Thank you.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-10-15,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (17:26):  I support the comments from the member for Grey and the attention he gave to the extra costs of providing services in rural areas. I too would like to address that as part of my speech. I welcome the government's establishment of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. It's timely and an important inquiry. In my electorate of Indi, every year I undertake a community survey. In the 2018 Indi budget survey, 79.4 per cent of respondents said that the issue of aged care and health was very important to them.


The screening of the ABC Four Corners program highlighted totally unacceptable treatment of some people living in residential aged-care facilities and created great conversation in my electorate of Indi. This ABC program showed that there's a difference between our expectation—our want—that people in our community be cared for and what is actually happening in some areas.


I'm looking forward to the terms of reference of the royal commission. The commissioners have now been announced, so I'll be really looking forward to encouraging my community to make submissions to that royal commission.


However, I don't think we need to wait until it's all done before we start active work on this. There's real, important work that needs to be done around aged-care workforce planning. Approximately 11.3 per cent of Australians aged 70 and over live in outer regional, remote and very remote areas, and residential aged-care facilities in our remote and outer regional areas are generally exactly as the member for Grey has said: small in size. These facilities lack the economies of scale and the scope that are often the case in urban areas, and aged-care costs per person in these settings are much more expensive. So it's this whole sense of: how do we design innovative, creative and effective solutions for our people who live in small country towns and more remote areas?


Today, I want to talk about some of the issues that we know exist. We know that cost is a factor. It's not only the cost of providing services; it's the cost of getting people and staff to and from services. For example, in Corryong, if you're going to bring up a specialist from Albury-Wodonga, it's the time and the cost of the travel, the two-hour trip both ways, to get there. That's expensive. But it's also that in Corryong, a small country town, we don't have access to the specialist services that we need, and they have to travel, which it is important that they do. But I'd also like to say that one of the wonderful things about the Corryong community is that it has got such creativity and such innovation in addressing its own problems. It, together with Alpine Health, has done stand-out work under a model called multipurpose provision of services, and I'll talk about that a little bit later.


The answers in many instances do lie within the communities, and we need the government then to be an active partner in putting in the resources and the money needed to provide these services. What's been happening in communities like Corryong, which has tried so hard as a community to address its own needs, is government has given it a slap in the face by cutting the services, cutting the extra funding needed to bring specialist allied health people into the community to do the work. For a lot of things, we know what needs to be done now. The knowledge is held and we don't really need to wait until the end of the royal commission to support all this.


In my own community of Indi there's a fantastic organisation which looks at the scoping and training needs in rural and aged care. They've set up a network, including Wodonga, Beechworth, Corryong, Tallangatta and Alpine, which is Mansfield, Mount Beauty and Bright. The network is supported by La Trobe University to do a lot of this work together and has so much knowledge. At another time, the minister responsible, the member for Hasluck, came and visited north-east Victoria, conducted a roundtable meeting with the primary partnerships group and talked about the really good models that were already in existence. So we know a lot. But what we don't do is say, 'How do we get the knowledge that's on the ground and link it upwards to the decision-makers at that level?' It's such a big gap, and I think we put the bureaucracy in the middle and make it so difficult. I'm hoping that, as part of the royal commission, definitely, and as part of the commissioner, the job will be to work out how we can bring these two things together. Because there is so much local knowledge, and I hear it when I go around and see some of the wonderful, innovative, creative things that are happening. It's just not reflected up the chain.


I want to spend a few minutes of my time talking about some of the wonderful models and organisations that work in my electorate and to say: thank you for your creativity, your innovation, your problem-solving and the wonderful care you give to my constituents. I'm going to name some of them. In Myrtleford there's Barwidgee Lodge. In Mansfield there's Beolite Village and, associated with the hospital, Bindaree Retirement Centre. In Tallangatta, Bolga Court does a terrific job, with a beautiful view overlooking the lake; it's almost like a men's shed where people can build things and do things. They've done a fantastic job in providing, in the most glorious part of north-east Victoria, a really lovely service-provision model.


In Wodonga proper we've got Bupa, which operates a more traditional nursing-home arrangement. In Benalla there's Cooinda Village. At Lake Eildon we've got Darlingford Upper Goulburn Nursing Home, and what a fantastic job it does. We've got Estia Health in Wodonga. In Rutherglen, a small country town near where I live, we've got Glenview Community Care Nursing Home—and a special call-out for Glenview. Not only do they provide aged care, which they do really well; they also connect up with the childcare centre just across the road, and they're linked with Indigo North Health and provide fantastic community care for residents.


In Bright we've got the Hawthorn Village Aged Care Hostel, which is run by Alpine Health. Down at Alexandra, we've got Kellock Lodge, and what a fantastic job the board of Kellock Lodge has done recently in its negotiations with the Anglican diocese—a special call-out to your board and the community there. In Mount Beauty there's Kiewa Valley House. At Tallangatta we've also got the Lakeview Nursing Home, which is associated with Alpine Health. In Benalla we've got the Morrie Evans Wing attached to the nursing hospital. In Myrtleford we've got Myrtleford Lodge Aged Care. In Wangaratta we've got Rangeview Private Nursing Home and we've got St Catherine's Hostel, which does a fantastic job. I was really pleased to take the minister there earlier this year. We've also got St John's Village in Wangaratta. In Yea we've got Rosebank Nursing Home. In Corryong we've got the Upper Murray nursing home. Out at Baranduda, near Wodonga, we've got Westmont Aged Care Services, and what a fantastic model they now provide—all types of care; they're picking up the home and community care and they're now a centre of excellence for the provision of aged care right across north-east Victoria.


In Yackandandah, which is where I want to finish this brief outline, is the Yamaroo hospital. The Yamaroo hospital is run by the Yackandandah Health service. If ever you want to see a community that has the most amazing approach to community health, it's Yackandandah. We used to have the old Bush Nursing Hospital, but for a whole lot of reasons that didn't work, so now it's called Yackandandah Health. The nursing home and hostel go with it. They're doing amazing development now. They've found a paddock behind the hospital and they're building specialist accommodation there, integrating it into the community. One of the things I particularly love about Yackandandah Health—they visited parliament recently with their plans for integration of housing and health and care—is the work they're doing with the Totally Renewable Yackandandah project. Totally Renewable Yackandandah is a model of energy generation at the community level. The old hospital, as it's still fondly known, has got this enormous array of solar panels on the roof. I wasn't able to find the figures in time for today's speech, but they now generate so much of their electricity themselves.


What I was really hoping to do in my speech is to say that it's really timely to have the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill before the House and it's really good that we've got the royal commission happening, but let's not forget the fantastic work happening in our communities as we speak. I give a call-out to the people providing the care. They give the opportunity of the solutions done at the local level and the regional level to be bubbling up through the system so that we can learn and value-add.


I want to finish my talk on the role of the multipurpose service, and the MPSs that operate in Corryong and in Alpine, which are Bright, Mount Beauty and Myrtleford. MPSs were an effort by communities to bring health together into one bundle. There are seven funded MPSs in Victoria. They're funded by the Commonwealth, with support from the Victorian government, to provide the needs that our communities have identified. I think it's a fantastic model, but it sadly doesn't have the support that it needs, so I've been lobbying the various ministers, saying we need to review the funding and review the operation. We really need to bring the MPSs into the 21st century and give them the resources that they need to actually meet the needs of local communities. Corryong is doing that, but it could do with so much more love, care and support. Alpine, in its way, is doing some fantastic work. I would just love to see a lot more attention given to those really good models.


My final call-out that I would really like to bring to the parliament is the role that some of those smaller, more isolated community groups have with telehealth. I'm so impressed by an amazing network of telehealth operating right across north-east Victoria. To Albury Wodonga Health, and particularly to the old Wangaratta hospital, now Northeast Health Wangaratta, what a fabulous job you're doing in getting telehealth out into the small hospitals, enabling specialist services and diagnostic services and really using modern technology to make our system work so much better. I call out to the University of Melbourne Northeast Health Wangaratta model and all the partnership institutions that are now working together. Every time I go out to the communities and visit the hospitals or aged-care facilities and see the work they're doing, I'm just so full of pride at the innovation and the technical expertise that our communities can bring to bear in solving problems.


Tonight, as I bring my comments to a close, I think we've got an enormous amount to offer in the future as we design healthcare services that particularly meet our needs in rural and regional Australia. We must know that rural and regional Australia are different. It often costs more to deliver services there. Our particular communities have often got a lot to be involved with, and we can do so much if we make better use of them. I would like to encourage all my existing networks to link into the scoping, skills and training needs in rural aged care. To the members of the network providers in north-east Victoria, great work. La Trobe has a centre for rural health, and they're doing some fantastic research work around aged care. So good work, north-east Victoria. I'm really looking forward to being your advocate as we move forward. I hope we can get some action before the end of the royal commission. I hope we can find a way of getting change on the ground now and not wait until 2020 before we actually get the results out of that. I look forward to working with the minister and the opposition as we progress this and come up with some really strong plans for aged care in rural and regional Australia.

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (17:40):  It's an old-age lesson that we're all taught as kids: respect your elders. As I was growing up, often my parents would introduce me to someone, and it would always be, 'This is Mr —' or, 'This is Mrs —' and I try to do the same with my own three sons when I'm talking to them; it might be, 'This is Mr Smith,' or, 'This is Mr Vasta,' or whoever it is. It is important to get across to our kids that elders should be respected. That's exactly what this bill is here to do, and I'm happy to speak on it.


Australia—as we know, as Australians—is the best place in the world to live. Often, I believe, people don't always recognise it, but it is because of our older Australians, our senior Australians, that we have been left the great country that we have today. It's their leadership that has seen our country battle wars and financial crises and everything else that we've gone through, and come out stronger. Our democracy and individual freedoms are steadfast today because they made sacrifices for our generations; whether they fought in world wars or so forth, we certainly have been left the great country that we have today because of senior Australians.


We owe a great deal to older Australians. That's why I, as an individual and as the member for Petrie, and we, as a government and as a parliament and as a nation, need to ensure that they are supported and cared for as they age. So I very much welcome Prime Minister Scott Morrison's call for a royal commission, and I support this bill, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018.


This bill is one of the most important things that this parliament will talk about this month. The reforms to aged care and the royal commission have started the conversation in the community, and the overwhelming response has been to ensure that we, as a government, do everything that we can to ensure our elderly receive first-class care. At this point, I'll add that it's not just government—the Australian community must do all that they can to ensure that elder Australians receive first-class care.


The footage that we saw recently on Four Corners did show horrendous abuse by some individuals in aged-care facilities. It was not only hard to watch; it was heartbreaking. I don't think there's a single person in the country who would watch those videos and not be distressed.


This parliament aims to make decisions for all Australians, and, by establishing the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, we are putting in place a framework that will better protect older Australians who rely on aged care. The commission is part of a significant reform in the regulation of aged-care providers. The commission will be responsible for a number of things, including the approval of providers of aged care, compliance and compulsory reporting of assaults from 1 January 2020.


Before I speak further on the specifics, I would like to say thank you: thank you to the aged-care facilities in my electorate of Petrie. It's easy to focus on the negative side of aged care, on the problems and the people, and—as we saw a member do earlier—just on the letters from people who have had issues. But there are many Australians who receive great care in aged care. That would be the majority of people in aged care, from my experience in getting around my electorate and seeing the providers and the staff at places like BallyCara in Scarborough, Seasons Aged Care in Mango Hill, Azure Blue in Redcliffe, the Holy Spirit Home at Carseldine or Bridgeman Downs Aveo.


In fact, I recently opened Opal aged care in North Lakes. What a wonderful facility that place is. It is cutting edge in dealing with the fact that as our cities grow we have less land—they have gone high-rise in their aged-care facility. It is more like the foyer of a five-star hotel. When you walk into it, that's the feeling you get. It is beautifully decorated, with a wonderful little coffee shop and cafe and a hairdresser as well, and you are greeted by wonderful staff. At the end of the day life is about relationships—the fact that when people walk in the door and are greeted well is important. It is a high-rise facility with wonderful rooms that are spacious and have ensuites. There are very good facilities, such as lounges where senior Australians staying there in aged care can just sit and chat to one another.


At Opal North Lakes they also have a dementia unit. I've just finished reading a book on dementia by one of my constituents, Debbie Flack. It talks about her experience with her mother—who has now passed away—and the heartbreak she went through in dealing with her mum, and a little bit about what the member for Grey spoke about before, which is that aged-care facilities have changed over the years in how they deal with people with dementia. The new one, Opal, has certainly done a great job there.


I've also visited Beaumont Care, Compton Gardens and St James Terrace—a whole lot of them—to name just a few. During my visits, I have been humbled to hear and see firsthand the work that staff do every day to make residents comfortable and cared for. Since the royal commission was announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, I've also started to communicate a little bit further. Whilst I've been to many aged-care facilities in my electorate, I've also started to communicate a little bit more and ask what's actually happening in their aged-care facility. I am talking to the residents there to hear their stories firsthand. I'm not there all the time, but I can visit these places. I would like to hear directly from them, too, and I would like to recognise the staff and the facilities that are doing a great job and doing it extremely well, for which I thank them. But, if there are issues, I would like to hear about them as well.


I spoke earlier about the fact that as a government we are trying to do what we can and as the member for my electorate I'm trying to do what I can to respect senior Australians, including when I get out to local schools to talk to primary school kids. I encourage them to spend time with their grandparents, listening to the stories and the wisdom and the knowledge they have gained over 70 or 80 years of life, and beyond. My four grandparents have all passed away, but I remember that in my 20s I would often sit down with them, particularly my nanna Mary, my mum's mum, who was in Zillmere, and talk about World War II, when, during her time in the Army, she operated the spotlights on the Brisbane River looking for Japanese submarines. They never found any. We know they sneaked into Sydney Harbour, but they never found any in the Brisbane River. The stories you get from your grandparents are really important. It was the same when I spoke to my grandfather. Life lessons were passed on. It is very important that grandparents pass that on to younger Australians, which is why I encourage students to do that when I visit their schools.


Often people say to me, 'Oh, you're a politician, Luke. Gee you must live a busy life.' You must get that as well, Deputy Speaker Vasta, as you live a busy life. But the fact is that all Australians now live busy lives. Every Australian lives a busy life. My wife, Louise, and I have three sons, a Doberman to walk and a business to run, and Louise is on different committees.



Ms Henderson interjecting—




Mr HOWARTH:
  She's busier than I am, Member for Corangamite. Often, people in my electorate live fast-paced, busy lives. The other thing we do is put up six-foot fences, don't we? We get our 400 square-metre block or 600 square-metre block, or we may have a unit. Often, we put up six-foot fences around our homes and we don't always talk to the neighbours. The reason I mention is this is because, as Australians, we live fast-paced, busy lives and we don't talk to our neighbours.


I was talking to a lady in aged care the other day and she was saying that she just wished she could spend a bit more time with people. I understand that. They're busy with their work in caring for people. They could chat to them for half an hour, but if you chat to them for half an hour you're probably pushing up the costs for those same people when they are paid staff doing that. That's why I say that as a community and as a nation, we do need to be doing more for older Australians. I would say to people in my own electorate: 'Go and visit your parents. Go and visit your grandparents.' To those schools in my electorate or those community groups—Lions Clubs or Rotary Club; and I met with some ladies the other day from the Older Women's Network in my electorate—I say, 'If you're looking for something to do, go and visit some of those aged-care facilities. Talk to the older Australians in those facilities that I've just visited.' I know that some schools will visit aged-care facilities or visit the local hospital at Christmas and so forth. It is a great opportunity, maybe for kids who don't have grandparents, where they can go and visit some aged-care facilities with the school and talk to those people who just want to chat. Often, many people in aged care just want to be able to chat. They might not be very mobile and they might not be able to get outside—and, obviously, the staff, like all of us now, are fast paced. I just want to make the point that as a government and as a parliament we can do these things, but that the Australian community can do them as well. I think that ministers, shadow ministers and members of parliament should encourage Australians to do that as well.


Obviously, I am proud to be part of a government which has introduced this bill. We are ensuring that older Australians are respected, listened to and cared for, no matter what their age or where they live. Whether they're self-funded retirees or on the pension, whether they are in the biggest or smallest aged-care homes, in the cities or in the regions, this bill protects and enhances the safety, health, wellbeing and quality of life for all older Australians in aged care, which is exactly how it should be.


The independent commission will make things easier for both residents and providers, becoming a single point of contact in relation to quality of care and regulations. By simplifying the process, any questions, complaints or reports of mistreatment will be, and should be, answered and dealt with quickly and appropriately. By making the commission responsible for regulating residential aged-care services, flexible-care services, home care services and Commonwealth-funded aged-care services, we are ensuring that all sectors of the aged-care sector are governed by the same body.


The message is clear: Any person or organisation doing the wrong thing will be found. We won't stand for substandard care, and we have included the option to shut down an operator who is doing the wrong thing as part of the broader reforms. This bill is part of the government's broader aged-care reform agenda, which we announced in the May budget. We have taken steps to improve aged-care regulation and to provide greater transparency of quality in aged care. We have also funded some $22 million to trial specialist elder abuse support services and have begun working with the states and territories to develop a national online register for enduring powers of attorney.


We want to provide more choice for older Australians so that they can live healthier, more independent and safer lives. The establishment of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is an essential step towards streamlining regulations and ensuring that the quality of aged care is upheld across the country. The bill will, hopefully—and I use that word, 'hopefully'—restore some peace of mind for the families of those in aged care. The commission will be a single point of contact for questions, concerns and complaints. All Australians can be assured that this independent commission will not just shuffle paperwork but will work tirelessly to improve and uphold quality care standards across the country. This reform has been shaped solely around those who rely on aged-care services and their families. This bill is for them, to ensure that the health, safety and wellbeing of the consumer is the No. 1 priority in the residences they choose to call home. Our older Australians have made a remarkable contribution to our country. Without their sacrifice, bravery and leadership our country could have been a very different place. It is imperative we support them as we age. That's why I'm proud to support this bill. When I say 'we' I mean all Australians. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,2
"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (17:55):  Around 1.3 million Australians are currently receiving some form of aged care provided by around 400,000 nurses and carers. The statistics show that it's projected that by 2056 the aged-care workforce will need to triple. That is, there will be nearly one million workers required to deliver services for more than 3.5 million older Australians, and older people will represent as much as one in four Australians. 


Any of us can trot out those statistics in this place, but what we need to consider is the personal aspect of this area of policy. It is absolutely true that each of us will, at some stage, require some measure of assistance if we live to an age that requires aged care. Every Australian who requires aged care should receive an appropriate level of service that is safe and clinically appropriate. We shouldn't have the circumstances which have been recently identified on Four Corners and other public controversies with respect to the quality of aged care. This is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, and it's something that really does move beyond us as the people's representatives standing here in parliament. There needs to be concrete action to ensure that safety, quality and dignity in aged care is maintained. 


Public expenditure on aged care as a share of the economy is expected to double by the 2050s. It is obvious to me that the aged-care system is in crisis. The fact that the aged-care system is in crisis should be obvious to any reasonable observer. But, when Labor first raised this issue, when we pressed the issue, as I might say we must when calling any government to account, we were heavily criticised by the minister. Now, as I said earlier today, this crisis is recognised implicitly with the calling of a royal commission. Billions of dollars have been cut from aged care in the last five years by this government. The present Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, cut almost $2 billion in his first year as Treasurer. There are now 121,000 people on the home-care package waiting list. It is telling that when I first wrote this speech I included the figure of 108,000 people. Between when I drafted this speech and now there are a further nearly 15,000 people that are now added to waiting list. The list include 88,000 people with high needs, many of them living with dementia and other high-care requirements. 


More than a dozen reviews and reports, including hundreds of recommendations, still sit on the minister's desk without being actioned. Three different aged-care ministers across the governments of Prime Minister Abbott, Prime Minister Turnbull and now Prime Minister Morrison have had the responsibility for this for the last five years, but in my submission they have failed to undertake any real reform across this vitally important ageing portfolio. As I indicated earlier today, I've spoken on a number of occasions on motions moved by my good friend and colleague, the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Julie Collins, the member for Franklin. Those motions criticised the government for its delay in releasing important information on the government's progress in addressing the home care waiting list. As I said earlier, in my opening, each of us should have a real interest in this policy area. This has a direct impact upon the dignity of vulnerable older Australians.


The purpose of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 is to establish a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission from 1 January 2019. The commission will be responsible for the accreditation, assessment and monitoring of aged-care services and Commonwealth funded aged-care services, and for complaints handling. The role of the commission is to protect and enhance the safety, health, wellbeing and, importantly, quality of life of aged-care consumers and also to promote confidence and trust in the provision of aged care and to promote engagement with aged-care consumers about the quality of care and services.


This is all particularly timely, given the appalling vision that we saw on the Four Corners reports over two weeks. It's appropriate for us to ask: what is the government's record with respect to this important area of public policy? And, more broadly, what is the government's record in supporting and funding regulators? I say that this government's record in supporting and funding regulators is bleak.


This is a government that called the Australian Securities and Investments Commission the 'tough cop on the beat'. We now have a royal commission highlighting every day failures not just in regulation but in general law enforcement. This government's unfortunate record of incompetence extends across multiple portfolio areas. What use is a philosophy that drives to cut what is described as 'red tape' when that regulation is properly required to maintain public trust and confidence, public trust in safety and consumer protection in multiple areas, whether it's finance or it's aged care? The undeniable fact is that the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will have a significant task in restoring confidence and trust in the provision of aged care—and this is before any evidence is taken with respect to the proposed royal commission and indeed before any terms of reference are agreed or published.


Aged care has been a policy area which, in the past, has attracted a significant level of bipartisanship. Labor introduced welcome reform with its Living Longer Living Better reforms. Those reforms were designed to deliver important benefits to older Australians, reforms that included more support and care at home; better access to residential care; increased recognition of carers, particularly those from culturally diverse backgrounds; more support for those who suffer from dementia; and, of course, better access to information to assist in the planning and delivery of care. It's important for all of us to understand that the central philosophy driving policy was that of consumer-directed care not just providing greater choice for older Australians as to the care they wanted but also delivering independence and support to live at home for as long as possible.


There was a growing wave of outcry from the public about the quality of care that older Australians have received, particularly with respect to residential aged-care facilities, even before the revelations from the Four Corners story. This was first highlighted by the investigations around elder abuse and neglect at the South Australian Oakden facility. In response to Oakden, there was a Senate inquiry. This in turn triggered the government to commission a review which is better known as the Carnell-Paterson review. The review was then handed to the then Turnbull government in October 2017.


Labor supports the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. They should be considered non-controversial, but there are a number of concerns. Firstly, it's taken nearly a year for the government to introduce legislation into parliament in response to the Carnell-Paterson review. The bills are, in my view, a missed opportunity for the government to give the new commission stronger arbitrary powers, particularly given the level of public concern in relation to service providers. Although the advisory council is set to continue, the government has yet to fill vacancies on the advisory council. Labor will put the government on notice that there must be no change to the cost-recovery process and/or fees to ensure the ongoing support which is necessary for smaller providers, in particular in regional Australia, which is where I represent. The government has also not addressed the policy area with any success, which is evident from the significant level of public concern about the aged-care sector.


As I said earlier, more than a dozen reviews and reports, including hundreds of recommendations, still sit within government and on the minister's desk without being actioned. It might be said that the government has proceeded to cherry-pick rather than deal with the reports and the reviews in an holistic manner. The lack of response in relation to the reviews and reports in relation to any reform fits a disturbing pattern of inaction, incompetence and cover-ups by successive governments.


The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have shown a complete lack of commitment to the Australian aged-care system by cutting billions of dollars from the aged-care system. The aged-care system has been used as an ATM to try and prop up the budget, with significant cuts in support to the industry, and there have been denials that there was a cut in the first place. That is what this government does: it consistently argues that it is delivering additional funding year after year—that is, in raw dollar terms—and it says it can't be accused of cutting health, education or the funding available to aged care. In this particular case, they've been caught out with their hands in the till. The aged-care funding instrument was cut by $1.2 billion. This means a cut to services to vulnerable, older Australians. It's absolutely obvious to me that standards in the care of older Australians have slipped under the weight of these cuts, in particular with the lack of supervision and attention to standard.


I, like every other representative in this place, I'm sure, receive many complaints and requests for assistance from constituents who are attempting to navigate the aged-care system. My constituent Estelle came into the electorate office to express her frustration at the system. She lives with her elderly mother and provides care to her. Her mother cannot get into a nursing home because she owns a small farm. To make matters worse, Estelle has been told that there is no palliative care available to her mother 'because of funding constraints'. Estelle told my office that she's looking forward to a change of government and a better approach to aged care.


I've also been speaking to Malcolm, who regularly visits a friend, Neil, in an aged-care facility in Launceston. Neil is recovering from a broken hip and requires physiotherapy as part of his recovery. Malcolm was horrified to learn that the only way Neil could get access to this treatment was to pay $75 per hour to a private physiotherapist. That is because the facility where Neil is a resident no longer has the funding to offer physiotherapy and other allied health services to its residents—a direct result of this government's $2 billion worth of cuts to aged care funding.


I've previously brought to the attention of the House concerns raised by Diana, who lives in a small town, Bridport, within my electorate. She despairs at the state of the My Aged Care website, saying that it should be a 'research tool for older Australians, not an advertising platform for providers'. She pointed out that, despite the fact that she lives in a remote seaside village and the fact that she finally received an aged-care package after an extended wait, according to the My Aged Care website, she has in excess of 80 providers who might provide services to her in Bridport. This is more than are available to a potential consumer in Hobart or Canberra. The reality, of course, is that there are few providers available to her, despite what that website reports. I also spoke to Michael from Launceston after the facility where his mother is a resident tried to increase her accommodation fees by 60 per cent following a refurbishment.


Clearly, there are real concerns with respect to safety and quality within the aged-care sector. There are many services that are doing very, very well, but we need to ensure that there's not just the rhetoric of being a tough cop on the beat and that the government actually follows through.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",CA,2018-10-15,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (18:10):  When the Prime Minister announced the royal commission into aged care, he said that instances of older people being hurt by failures of care simply cannot be explained or excused. I agree with the Prime Minister. I've spent months listening to stories about aged care from my community and the nation, both the good and the bad, but the footage captured in the Four Corners program that aired a couple of weeks ago was indeed heartbreaking. This system is not working. Just for the Four Corners story, more than 4,000 Australians were willing to share their stories in relation to their care experiences. 


The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 purports to protect the safety, health and wellbeing and quality of life of aged-care residents. It is a noble aim, but I think it will take a lot more than this bill to achieve that purpose. I am pleased that the government has announced a royal commission into aged care. It is my hope that this commission will give families the opportunity to share their experiences. Healthcare workers can share their concerns and providers can outline their plans for change. There is a wealth of experience that the royal commission can draw upon from academics, industry experts and staff with many years of experience. My hope is that we will listen to what they have to say about the sector and how they hope to change the system for the better. I know I have benefited from the knowledge of people like Peter Vincent of Aged Care Matters and Ian Henschke of National Seniors, whose insights and genuine passion for reform are something that I value and values that I share. Similarly, Victoria Traynor and her team from the University of Wollongong have worked tirelessly to establish a framework for aged-care nursing competence. While the framework is still in its early days, the results so far demonstrate the benefits to residents and providers of investing in professional development for those working in aged care. 


As I've said before, we must ensure that we are listening and acting on the stories of families and residents. For too long families and residents have been too afraid to share their stories. I also recognise the efforts of the minister and his active role in aged-care reforms, not only with the bill before the House today but also with those that have already passed, such as the Aged Care (Single Quality Framework) Reform Bill, and of course the forthcoming royal commission. 


The issues facing the royal commission are wide-ranging and intertwined. It will need to review an uncertain workforce, complex funding arrangements, training and education shortfalls, accreditation and compliance issues and consumer expectations. This cannot be done overnight. We need to allow the royal commission sufficient time to complete this comprehensive investigation, but it is equally important that we do not allow the royal commission to delay or derail existing plans for improving the quality of care for our older Australians and things that we can do right now in this parliament. 


The Prime Minister said:


The royal commission will be in addition to, not instead of, the actions we are taking.


I intend to hold the Prime Minister to that statement and I will continue to push for consumer-centric reforms to the aged-care sector to ensure we have transparency in staffing. Residential care experiences differ widely and the share of expenditure spent on staffing differs from place to place. I'm led to believe that anywhere from 45 to75 per cent of income that a home receives is spent on staff. That is an extraordinary difference, and it must be looked at. We must have transparency about how our residential care homes are run, how much is spent on food, how much is spent on hands-on care and activities and wellbeing. 


With that in mind, I turn back to the bill before the House today, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018. The department said this bill is the product of the recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review, consultations with the Aged Care Quality Advisory Council and extensive roundtable discussions with the sector. 


Broadly speaking, the commission is in effect the end product of a merger between the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, known as the quality agency, and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner, known as the complaints commissioner. The new commissioner will bear primary responsibility for ensuring that our aged-care sector is one that puts the wellbeing of our older Australians first and that the quality of services provided is in line with community expectations. The new commissioner will in turn be supported by an advisory council, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council, which will include members with 'significant expertise in relevant fields'. The commissioner will also be supported by a chief clinical adviser and an expert clinical panel to seek out and receive clinical advice where relevant to the role of the commission. The commission's powers will extend to all Commonwealth funded aged-care services from residential care to in-home care. As of 1 January 2020, the commission will be responsible for the accreditation, assessment and monitoring, and handling of complaints processes.


I want to pause here and draw attention to the fact that, currently, it is the government that is responsible for providing or revoking accreditation of aged-care providers. The minister is the one who ultimately makes the determination as to whether a provider should be granted a licence to operate and, in turn, receive ACFI funding. And yet now, in the midst of this turmoil, that responsibility is suddenly being transferred from the minister's office to an outside agency. That, I find concerning. The government says that this bill is a necessary structural change to improve how the aged-care sector is regulated. But what has actually changed? How can passing overall responsibility from the minister to the commissioner be an improvement? I always felt that the buck stopped with the minister. If the buck stops with the commissioner, I feel that is a retro step.


I acknowledge the government's efforts in recent months, including the recent consolidation of quality standards and the efforts to uphold those standards through stronger enforcement provisions. But this new commission reads more like a change of stationery rather than a structural change of the aged-care regulations. For example, let's look at the proposed regulatory functions of the new commission, and the obligations it can impose on providers. There is no real change. It still requires providers to have a written plan for continuous improvement in the quality of care they provide and it still enables audits to be carried out in specified circumstances. Now these are all clearly good things. But my point here is this: these provisions were already in place when the maltreatment and abuse were taking place. These provisions were already in place when families, like those featured in the Four Corners story, were left with no other option but to covertly record the distress and the suffering of their family members. These provisions were not enough to protect our vulnerable older Australians then and they are not enough now.


What is needed now is greater transparency and accountability. As I stated previously, this is the aim of my private member's bill. And I believe now, more than ever, this parliament should put aside the finger pointing, put aside playing politics with this and work together to deliver the outcomes that Australian families expect and deserve. I cannot see how transparency in nursing homes and in our aged-care facilities is anything but a good thing.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (18:18):  Although the bills before us today are considered noncontroversial, it is important to stand up and make a few statements, particularly on behalf of constituents in my electorate, in relation to aged-care quality and safety. I do have to express my disappointment that, again, the government is creating another commissioner. Whilst we on this side support that, what this government hasn't done is create the framework that is required, invest in the staff that are required, invest in the skill development that is required to ensure that we have quality and safe delivery of aged-care services. It's another bill to create another commissioner, but a commissioner is at the tip of the iceberg and we're yet to see the real body of reform work that needs to happen. This government has failed so many times to get on with the really tough work and the tough reform that's required. We do need to really look at aged care and act quickly.


I too want to acknowledge the workers who spoke up bravely to Four Corners about what they were seeing, experiencing and witnessing on a daily basis in the facilities in which they work. Thanks again to the families and to the people in those facilities for speaking publicly. It's not easy, when you're somebody that works in a centre, to speak publicly to the media about what is occurring in your workplace. Not only are you putting your job on the line by speaking publicly and raising an issue but you're also exposing the real vulnerability and weakness within your own workplace. I've met many aged-care workers—not just people who work in my electorate but also those in the unions that represent aged-care workers, like the HACSU members, the United Voice members and the ANMF members—and what they all have is pride about where they work. For them, it's a calling, a vocation. They truly, deeply love working with older Australians and working in aged care.


When they have been to parliament to speak to members—it is disappointing that members of the government did not meet with these workers on the many occasions on which they came—they spoke to us about how it's our turn to care. They spoke to us about how they are low paid and they are undervalued in their work, which they are. They spoke to us about how some of the agencies and organisations that they work for only spend $6 a day on food for residents. They spoke to us about the problem with not having correct staffing ratios at work. They spoke to us about what happens when somebody calls in sick or if somebody's on leave and they're not backfilled. They spoke about how that compromises their ability to deliver quality care.


In a recent media release put out by United Voice, they said how devastated they were by the revelations about the aged-care sector, but, unfortunately, that they're not new. Like many members of United Voice, they are placed in situations that lead to poor care on a daily basis. If that exposure weren't enough—if it weren't enough for workers who've come forward to this place to raise their issues—then surely the constituents who have called electorate offices would shock this government into more urgent action. We need to do more than just create a commission in relation to tackling the crisis in aged care.


We are facing yet another inquiry as the unions, workers and family members have said. Whilst we support the royal commission and the work it will do, we also believe that there is enough out there now that the government can be doing more. We've held lots of inquiries into aged care and we've known that there will be more and more older Australians entering aged care for quite some time, yet we are still failing to do the body of work that is required to ensure that we have quality care.


Critical to quality care is making sure that we manage high workloads, unpredictable hours and the lack of support for carers when they're performing their roles. Funding cuts have had a huge impact on aged care and aged-care delivery services. Inevitably, when you cut funding to aged care, it is borne by the workforce. The workforce shoulders the cost when you cut. It's common, it's really unfortunate and it shouldn't happen. In community services and in the health and community sector, when governments cut funding like this government has done in almost all of their budgets, organisations are told that they have to deliver the same amount of care with less money. They shave off corners. They cut from budgets. They cut day programming. They cut back hours. If somebody's sick, they're not replaced, putting more and more pressure on workers in these facilities.


One of the comments made by a WA aged-care worker is:


I want things to change for old people.


I have been in aged care for 15 years and working with dementia patients for the past 13 years. We're all heartbroken at times because we can't give the people what they want.


We have dementia residents coming up to us and saying: 'You don't have time to talk to us.' We get trained to take them through their day—now you rush them.


I think that that comment really hits to part of the problem. There's no quality that's allowed to be included when people are now staffing in aged care. There was, once upon a time, when the aged-care worker was the best friend, the person that they could have a laugh with, when they were able to chat—when they were able to be human and engage with the people that they cared for. These days, their rosters have been so cut back and they're forced to look after so many extra residents that there's not even time for a simple hello and goodbye. Another worker said:


I have worked out that from 7am, if we gave 15 minutes for residents' showers and 20 to 25 minutes for residents who use hoists and allowed an hour for breakfast, we would finish our last resident at 2.15pm.


Again, this is speaking to the pressures of trying to get things done quickly.


I've had people in my electorate come and speak to me about when staffing levels are low. If they're at one end of the facility and the buzzer goes, if they don't have enough staff on, if somebody takes a fall, they could be there stuck on the ground for anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour whilst they try to help the other resident. Literally, the way in which some of these facilities are being staffed is in case nothing goes wrong. That is a terrible way to run aged-care services because, as we all know, as we become older, something does go wrong all the time, so having the extra staff there is critical to help.


It's also about quality of life. Like many, I go to aged-care facilities. I enjoy the 'walk a day in my shoes' when I walk around and I talk to the residents and meet with them. The days that they enjoy are the days where they've got activities and they've got theme days. We have the Melbourne Cup coming up, so many residential facilities in my area would have a theme day. There are sporting colours theme days, their singalongs, their craft days, the days where they have schools—and particularly a lot of the VCAL students—come in to do work in their organisation. Our Catholic college partners with St John of God in their aged-care facilities to facilitate a real work placement experience. But these programs can only occur if they have enough staff on the ground on the day.


Workloads are high, as I said. About one in 10 workers in aged care has two jobs. That's double the national average. I'll just state that again: one in 10 aged-care workers has two jobs. Partly it's because they're only on part-time rosters or casual rosters, but the other main reason why—and this is what the workers tell me—is that their wages are so low. Their wages are so low that their full-time work or the work that they do in aged care doesn't actually pay the bills, so they take up other caring jobs outside aged care to try to subsidise their income.


The other problem we have in this sector is that, unlike, say, the early childhood education sector, there is no national quality framework that exists. Only about half the staff working in the aged-care sector hold a certificate III or a certificate IV qualification. They are barely paid the minimum legal wage, and often salaries are just above the minimum wage. We know through working through industry and through talking to the workforce that we need to work collaboratively, together, to see a similar national quality framework introduced. The staff themselves want to upskill. The staff themselves want to be more engaged. They want to have the skills to be able to deliver the care that they know that their residents require.


The statistics speak for themselves: 1.3 million Australians are currently receiving some form of aged care provided by about 400,000 nurses and carers. I know that there has been a lot of talk about looking at ratios. I do support ratios; however, I believe they need to be in a broader context. We can't just talk about nursing. We need to look at making sure that we've got ratios where we are reaching the complex care that's required. Every facility might be slightly different. There needs to be a discussion about what a safe ratio for dementia care is. What is a safe ratio for high care and low care?


When I get out and speak to some of the facilities in my electorate, there's a really stark difference between the not-for-profit community aged-care facilities and public aged-care facilities through Bendigo Health and then the for-profit facilities.


In the Macedon Ranges, there is a Bupa facility and there is RM Begg, which is a locally based not-for-profit facility. That not-for-profit facility is the place of choice for many people; however, they have a very long waiting list. They have extra staffing time and staffing hours. I'm told that it's a wonderful work environment to work in, but they acknowledge openly that they're slowly going broke under the current funding model. They're simply not adequately remunerated by the current system to continue the quality of care, and they don't want to compromise care. Meanwhile, up the road, Bupa—which is making profit and delivering a return for its shareholders—gets constant complaints from the GPs in the area, from the residents in the area and from the staff that work in the facility. There are regular reports of there not being qualified nurses on, that people who are sick aren't replaced and that programming has been cut, and there are questions about the quality of the food.


We are at a crisis point within our aged-care system: which model of care do we wish to deliver? We are a society that will be judged, and in this place here we are judged, on how we treat our older Australians. They deserve dignity and respect in their elder days. They deserve to be in places where they do feel at home, where they do feel included and where they are respected. They also deserve a workforce that is well paid and respected, and which has the resources that it requires in order to do its job. So I'm hoping that the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will actually make strong recommendations to this government on how we can fix our aged-care sector.


We need to make sure that we do get policy back on track in this area. After the funding cuts from this government in many of their budgets and the impacts that those have had on this sector, the very least that this government could do is not just to create the commission but to restore the billions of dollars that they've cut. This would help the workforce to skill up and deliver quality care, and it would help facilities to deliver better programming for the residents that live in their facilities. It would also give more peace of mind to family members.


It's one of the hardest things at a listening post: to meet a family member when they've just had the heartbreak of losing one of their older relatives. There are some of the horror stories that they share with you, about how there was not the dignity and respect for their loved one in their final days, or that they passed away in pain because there was nobody on shift to administer the medicine that was required or that they feel their loved one died of neglect or starvation—as one person put to me—because the food was so inadequate and not something you would serve to anyone, let alone to our older Australians in aged-care facilities.


People have a right to be concerned about what's happening in our aged-care institutions, and whilst this commission, which has been a long time coming, has been established, it's a little bit of work in a lot of work that needs to be done.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (18:33):  I rise today to speak on the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018.


Like my Labor colleagues, I agree to support the bills but want to note the strong concern that we all share about this government's slow response to introduce this legislation to the parliament. Today has been a day of listening to speaker after speaker on that side of the chamber, the government members: a cacophony of pathos to camouflage a complete lack of action in this space. As a nation, we should judge ourselves by how we treat our elderly. For all that older Australians have given our country throughout their working lives, they deserve respect and dignity. Recent revelations in the media confirm what Labor has been saying for a long time: that the aged-care sector is in a state of crisis. Like many local residents who have contacted me, I was appalled when I watched the shocking stories on the ABC Four Corners program. The investigations at the Oakden facility were equally disturbing yet occurred some years ago now. Like many, I was particularly shocked by the standard of care being delivered in some residential aged-care facilities. 


There has been a public outcry for action on the quality of care older Australians are receiving in residential aged-care facilities, and rightly so. Our older Australians in residential aged-care facilities deserve so much better than what we've seen on our television screens. They deserve dignity and they deserve to be cared for as if they were being cared for by a loved one. It is clear that the current regulatory framework that should be protecting older Australians is not working. Current reporting mechanisms are overly complex and accessing information about complaints is equally difficult. 


These bills are an opportunity to restore faith in the aged-care sector. However, the government has unfortunately missed the mark yet again. There are around 1.3 million Australians currently receiving some form of aged care, provided by around 400,000 nurses and carers. It is predicted that by 2056 the aged-care sector will increase to around one million workers, with 3½ million older people requiring care. The legislation before us today is in response to the Oakden investigation and a Senate inquiry which triggered the government to commission the Review of National Aged Care Quality Regulatory Processes, known as the Carnell-Paterson review. The report of the review was given to the Turnbull government on 23 October 2017. We stand here today, in October 2018, with a piece of legislation in front of us that will respond to some of the elements and the recommendations from that review. These bills go some way to responding to the 10 recommendations of the review, to establish an independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission from 1 January 2019. I stand here today when I was to speak on this some three weeks ago. But of course this legislation was pushed off the agenda, pushed back a further three weeks, and we're going to try and establish a commission by 1 January 2019. It is October and the legislation is still in the House and is yet to go to the Senate. 


In the context of recent public concern, the commission will be tasked with restoring confidence in the aged-care sector. It will create a single point of contact for all aged-care consumers and providers of aged care in relation to quality of care and regulation. But it will take an extraordinary effort by those opposite to see it formed by the projected date of 1 January 2019. The problem is that this government is too busy fighting within itself to focus on looking after older Australians. We have had five long years of watching inaction on that side. Their lack of action in relation to any reform in this space is disturbing. As the member for Bendigo outlined, we do not have a framework on which to measure the care that is being given. We have not done the hard work to reform aged care to ensure that we're getting quality, especially given that there are dozens of reviews and reports sitting on the minister's desk that have been blatantly ignored. Saying that the government has not acted in any regard would in fact be somewhat misleading. They have acted: they've slashed funding from the aged-care sector. There has been nothing but funding cuts over the past five years. It began in the 2014 budget with the dementia supplement cuts, which signalled the slide that we've now witnessed for five years. The current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has tried to deny it multiple times over the past couple of months, but in his first year alone as Treasurer he was responsible for cutting almost $2 billion from the aged-care sector. 


The system is in crisis and those opposite need to take responsibility for it. I remember after the 2014 budget visiting one of the local not-for-profit aged-care facilities to hear how they were going to struggle without the dementia supplement, how they were concerned about the increasing number of dementia suffers with high needs, and how they were going to struggle to meet those residents' needs and they were going to struggle to explain to their families why that was the case. That was some time ago now, and they are still struggling. 


The government values older Australians so little, it seems, that the minister for aged care is not included in cabinet. I would suggest that's a direct result of why this particular area has seen such savage cuts. It is deeply concerning that, in response to the aged-care crisis, the Liberal government have shown no compassion, just funding cuts. Inevitably, the result of these cuts is that the standard of care for older Australians has declined. We now have before us an agreement around a royal commission that is set to wind up in 2020. It is important that the royal commission shines a strong light on the quality, or lack thereof, in the system. It needs to look at the reasons for the appalling treatment occurring under current guidelines, legislation and the funding model. The commission should be given scope to look at the impacts of cuts and the changes to the ACFI on the current aged-care facility system. It should explore the impact of the lack of home-care packages and the subsequent impact in early entry into the aged-care system. It should look at the workforce, training and quality that has led to the outrageous practices that we have seen.


The other side of the aged-care system is the home care packages. Again, in this space we are seeing an absolute mess from this government. Time and time again, the lack of packages has been raised by the member for Franklin and many of us on this side in private members' business. Time and time again, we've complained about reports and data being held back as the numbers on the waiting lists rose. The home care package mess is another failure to add to the Liberals' record when it comes to the aged-care sector. It says a lot that the member for Cook, Scott Morrison, approved a multimillion-dollar taxpayer funded advertising campaign encouraging older Australians to access home care packages, whilst the waiting list for home care blew out to 121,000 people. The $8.2 million advertising campaign was the single biggest advertising spend in the 2018 budget. This campaign not only wasted millions of taxpayer dollars which could have been used to fund the home care packages but also gave older Australians false hope of their chance to accessing them.


What we know is that there are now 121,000 people waiting for home care packages. Of those people, 95,000 are waiting on the list with high-care needs, many with dementia. The blowout in the list means that older Australians are waiting, in some instances, more than two years before they can access a home care package that they have been approved for. The result means that people are going into aged-care facilities earlier than they would otherwise have needed to. This is irresponsible, not just in terms of quality; it's also financially irresponsible. We know about the cost blowouts as people enter aged care earlier than would have been necessary. This year's budget provided funding for a mere 14,000 packages over a four-year period. Three thousand five hundred packages per year is woefully inadequate when you consider that, in the past three months alone, the waiting list has grown by 13,000 people. While any money for the aged-care sector is welcomed, the provision of 14,000 packages over four years, when the waitlist is sitting at over 121,000, is disgraceful and says everything that is wrong with the policies of those opposite.


The issue raised by the member for Bendigo, thankfully, is around the workforce. The government is yet to commit to any funding to the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce. In the next 30 years, the aged-care workforce is expected to increase by 300 per cent, so we need to get this right now. The government's hands-off approach is failing not only the sector but older Australians who are reliant upon it. After they came into office in 2013, the Liberal government dumped Labor's $1.5 billion workforce compact and supplement. Labor will continue to advocate for a comprehensive workforce development strategy to address issues of training, staffing levels and an ageing workforce. The government is failing to ensure that the aged-care sector has staff that are adequately skilled and equipped to care for our rapidly ageing population. 


That is not to diminish the work of the many carers and nurses I have met who work in this sector. To a large degree, those I have met are caring people. They are committed workers, tarred with an uncaring brush because of the images that we have seen on our television screens. I have met with aged-care workers and they have shared their stories about the real impact of funding cuts on the work they do. Their stories horrify the broader public—they do not meet the community's expectations. They speak of having little time to spend with residents, no time for conversation. There were tears when I met with workers in the western district. There were tears for how their role has changed and has impacted on the quality of life of the residents they care for. They talked of how heartbreaking it was not to be able to sit with someone while they drank their cup of tea. They spoke of the time pressures of having to get so many people out of bed and showered and dressed for the day. Aged care should not look like it is being institutionalised. Aged care should look like care.


The bills that are in front of us today will establish a commission that was called for 12 months ago. The royal commission will shine a light on things, but we know now what many of the issues are. We know that there are issues in terms of staff ratios. We know that there are issues in terms of the quality of care. These things need to be addressed immediately.


In contrast to the crisis caused by the Liberal government, Labor has a strong track record when it comes to ageing reform. In 2012, Labor introduced the Living Longer Living Better ageing reforms. In May this year, in fact in the budget reply, Bill Shorten said that an elected Labor government will make dementia and ageing national priorities, because it is the right thing to do—to make sure that older Australians have the dignity and respect that they deserve in aged care.


I know how often members on this side, and those opposite, are being contacted by people concerned about either the level of the home care package that they are likely to receive or the treatment of loved ones in aged-care facilities. I have heard many of those opposite raise these issues in this place, and I've also heard them come back and tell us how they had gotten ministerial intervention around a home care package for a level 3 or 4 resident in their community. Ministerial intervention is not good enough in this space. We need to act and we need to act now. Beyond the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, there needs to be action taken before we see the end of the royal commission. We cannot wait until it is concluded before we start implementing changes to fix this sector, which is in a state of crisis nationally. The government cannot ignore the situation any longer, as they have with previous inquiries.


Elderly Australians deserve to spend their twilight years in a dignified way. They deserve to have care in the institutions in which they are living. They deserve to have people working with them who care for them, who have time in their day, who are receiving a decent rate of pay and who have high-quality training. We need to increase the expectations for every—every!—facility to ensure that the quality of care that we would want for our own parents is being provided for every elderly Australian.

"Khalil, Peter, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (18:48):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018. Deputy Speaker Hastie, you know that we support the royal commission into aged care, as, of course, do the vast majority of the public—there was a 240,000-strong petition to that effect. But it should not be an excuse for inaction on the issues that are facing the aged-care sector today. I've received emails, phone calls and letters—hundreds of them—and I've visited constituents of mine who have shared with me their struggles with the quality of their own aged care and that of their family members. As the need for high-quality and transparent aged-care services expands, we must act now. We must address these issues and support the quality of care that older Australians should be receiving. This bill goes some way to doing that.


The impacts of understaffing and underfunding are real—we've heard about that. The ones who get the short straw as a by-product of those shortcomings are our parents, our grandparents and our loved ones. That is not to mention, as the previous speaker has, the nurses and aged-care workers who look after them. There are around 1.3 million Australians who are currently receiving some form of aged care. This care is being provided by around 400,000 nurses and carers. There clearly are not enough carers and nurses to do the job, and the ones who are doing the hard work on the ground aren't given enough pay, respect and support. Their role is critical in the care of our older Australians and will become increasingly important as the numbers increase, so we have to act now. 


We have to implement long-term solutions to this growing and demanding issue. It is projected that by 2056 the aged-care workforce will need to triple to around one million workers to adequately deliver the services for more than 3½ million older Australians, who will represent one in four aged Australians who will need that care. 


The recommendations from a Senate inquiry and the subsequent Carnell-Paterson review following the investigations into elder abuse at the Oakden facility in South Australia have led us to this point, but it has been slow, halting and fumbling. We are extremely concerned about the government's dithering response in introducing legislation into this parliament. We are concerned that the government have yet to respond to many of the other recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review. We are concerned that the government have known about this review and the recommendations since October 2017. That was a year ago. What is the hold-up? 


The government only decided to act when they watched, or heard about before watching, the harrowing Four Corners series, the first part of which aired during the last parliamentary sitting week. The sharing of the personal experiences of families and residential aged-care facilities suddenly made them wake up to some of the problems that were right before their noses the entire time. But the Carnell-Paterson review is not the only review that has sat untouched by the government. There have been more than a dozen reviews and reports, and there are hundreds of unactioned recommendations. 


There can only be one sad answer to this dithering, this slowness. Clearly, unfortunately, the coalition government are too busy fighting amongst themselves, day to day, to actually do their day job, to drive long-term reform and to make the necessary changes to address the issues in the aged-care sector. What they've managed to do, just barely, is fit in what is pretty much a piecemeal—piecemeal in nature—process. 


I recently visited the Ethnic Communities Council in my electorate to speak and participate on a panel at its forum on the aged and those on the aged pension. A lot of the discussion included the challenges faced by culturally and linguistically diverse pensioners in particular—the rising cost of living, access to health care, maintaining active lifestyles, mental and physical health in retirement, but also the additional language and cultural challenges faced by those pensioners from very diverse backgrounds, some of whom migrated to this country in the fifties and worked all their lives helping build Australia. Really, these challenges are shared by all ageing Australians.


The forum took place on the Monday after Scott Morrison's ascension to the position of Prime Minister. The slowness in addressing these issues could be an indication, maybe, of another reason besides the infighting—that is, his philosophical view towards the elderly. As I was researching that speech, it was interesting to read what Scott Morrison had said about those elderly constituents—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! The member will refer to—




Mr KHALIL:
  Sorry Mr Deputy Speaker—what the now Prime Minister—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr KHALIL:
  at the time the member for Cook, had said in the past when he was a freshly minted Treasurer. In 2015, he had made comments stating that the aged pension should not be regarded as an entitlement for all. This is a fundamentally flawed view of the social contract that binds pensioners with the government. These are pensioners who have worked 40, 50, 60 years, paid their taxes and made their contributions. There is a contract that binds them with the government, and that is that the government has a responsibility to provide them with their pension. 


I was quite shocked by the philosophical position that was put by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister. In my mind the Prime Minister's philosophical position on this is a big part of the problem that we're facing right now. As Treasurer during the Turnbull government, he then outlined his vision for an overhaul of the country's retirement income system, by both reducing expenditure on welfare payments and limiting the amount of revenue foregone through tax concessions. 


I have a fundamental difference of opinion with this philosophical position. As I said, there is a binding contract between the elderly Australians, pensioners in this country, who deserve, after all of their years, decades, of hard work and commitment to this nation, that they are looked after by the government. It is not an entitlement; it is not welfare; it's part of the social contract. I said to the pensioners and the aged in my electorate of Wills, 'The pension is not a privilege. It is a right which you have worked for and which you deserve.' And this principle applies to aged care as well. Its provision is of fundamental and existential importance to millions of ageing Australians. 


The government may have abandoned the proposal to raise the pension age from 67 to 70, but I would say let's not be fooled by the new Prime Minister. He may be the new Prime Minister of Australia, but there is a track record there of wanting to make cuts to social welfare payments and of seeing the provision of these aged-care services and the pension as a form of welfare. Some of these policies are lifted out of the right-wing think tanks that we know of, like the Institute of Public Affairs.


Let's look at the contrast. Labor has a strong track record of support for aged care. The Living Longer Living Better reforms were delivered by Labor in government in 2012 and 2013. These reforms were designed to deliver important benefits to older Australians. They included more support and care at home, better access to residential care, increased recognition of carers and those from culturally diverse backgrounds, more support for those with dementia and better access to information. I think it is a truism. I mean, it is obvious, but I will say it again: Labor has always prioritised health care, especially for those working and living in aged-care facilities. It was Labor that was responsible for the historic reforms in 2012.


Opposition leader Bill Shorten committed in his budget reply speech that a Labor government, if elected, would make dementia and ageing a national priority. The fact is we are in a mess because, for years, the coalition government have been slashing funding to aged care repeatedly. It is only now that they claim to have some concern, but they continue to fail the public on aged care. In the Turnbull government, Sussan Ley was health minister and little if nothing was done to progress the LLLB reforms. The current Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care—a portfolio clearly not valued enough to be included in the cabinet—has also struggled to progress any of those reforms. Three different aged-care ministers across the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have had carriage of these reforms for the past five years and have failed miserably to do any real reform across the ageing portfolio. How can we call ourselves a fair and generous country if we continue to treat elderly Australians without the respect that they deserve? The system is in crisis and it is no wonder. You can't fix aged-care support and support our ageing population and our healthcare workforce by slashing funding. It just doesn't work that way. When you cut funding, you make it harder; you make it more difficult for those in aged care.


The government's lame attempts in the 2018-19 budget were woefully inadequate and they've admitted this themselves. Data released from March 2018 sadly now reveals more than 108,000 older Australians are waiting for a home-care package. These numbers are shocking and the government made a much touted—by themselves—commitment to 14,000 home-care packages over four years. That's a drop in the ocean and nowhere near the number that is needed. It is not just inadequate; it is actually an insult to older Australians. This is only worsened by the fact that it's not even new funding. It was pulled out from another part of the budget. It was found in the same bucket and re-allocated.


The government puts older Australians and their families so low on their list of priorities that they did not even commit to increase funding to keep their promises to address the waitlist to access these packages. What a sad reflection on the government—self-centred, fighting themselves, unable to focus on the needs of older Australians. Whatever light this government held up to itself as a government that would be concerned for the ageing is now covered in darkened ashes. The government created the aged-care crisis. The government then ignored the aged-care crisis, and the government and its budget failed to fix the aged-care crisis. 


Labor, when we were in government, recognised the national crisis in the aged-care system and offered practical policy and reform to make change. But things have actually got worse over the past five years under the coalition government. Inaction has been the catchword, and it's clear that a royal commission into the abuse and cover-ups of neglect in the aged-care sector is absolutely necessary. At least we can agree on that across the aisles—we can agree that we need the royal commission.


So we, on this side, wholeheartedly support the royal commission into aged care. It must examine the impact of the years of neglect, the years of funding slashed from those who need it most, and the Prime Minister's, Mr Morrison's, own attacks when he was Treasurer, when he cut almost $2 billion in his first year.


I've had many recent visits, and many visits over the two years that I've been an MP, to residential aged-care facilities in my electorate, and I've heard firsthand, from the workers and the residents, of the difficulties that they face. I support their campaign around funding, as to increasing the ratios in the system and the staffing issues generally. Fixing these issues will undoubtedly improve quality of care for some of the most vulnerable members of our society and concurrently improve the conditions of some of our least appreciated workers. But, as I said earlier, the royal commission can't be an excuse for inaction by this government.


The purpose of these bills that we speak on today is to restore confidence in the delivery of aged-care services to those in aged-care facilities—those with family who reside there and those who work there. Despite the minister for aged care receiving the 'A Matter of Care' strategy more than two months ago, the government has actually sat on it and has only just released that strategy. It is yet to make any concrete commitments to increase funding to support the aged-care workforce in the 2018-19 budget. How does the government expect to drive reform without providing that additional funding? How does that happen?


Labor has called on the government to heed the important advice of the chair of the report, John Pollaers, and implement the workforce strategy in full to meet the growing demand. We've seen that the public has lost confidence in the safety and quality of the delivery of these services. That is why this bill seeks to establish a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, starting on 1 January 2019, that will take this restoration of confidence as its primary task.


The government, frankly, has a lot of work to do to get this right—to get the commission right; to make it available to support the public as soon as possible—and they're taking far too long to do the work to establish it. We, on this side of the House, hope that the Greens political party, as to referral of these bills to the community affairs committee, will not further hold up the passage of this extremely important legislation. The government is still yet to fill three important positions on the advisory council, and you would think that these would have been filled by now if the government were as concerned as the public are on this issue.


Under Labor, there was a clear plan within our reform package. That was achieved largely through a bipartisan approach, and we're proud of that. So we hope that we can work together again to ensure that these issues in the aged-care sector are addressed, because these older Australians are so important, given the commitment to and the sacrifices they have made in this country, to help build it and to give us the wonderful future that we have before us.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (19:03):  I would like to indicate, at the beginning, in speaking to these bills—recognising that we're dealing with two cognate bills—that I support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister, but I also indicate that I think, as many of my colleagues do, that, if that amendment is to not succeed, these bills need to be supported. That is because we are in a really critically important time for the aged-care sector. In my electorate, this is certainly one of the most pressing issues that I and my staff deal with on a regular basis.


These bills before us, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, are enacting some of the recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review of aged care. In particular, the first bill is establishing a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, intended to be operational from 1 January 2019. That will bring together quality assurance and complaints procedures in the aged-care sector. That's obviously as a result of the review. It's a worthwhile thing to do.


But we do have some concerns about the aged-care sector, and I want to touch on those in general. First of all, I want to say that while this bill is definitely a move in the right direction and is a response to an important review it's now in the context of the agreement to establish a royal commission into aged care. There is no doubt in my mind that the royal commission will hear very significant and important evidence from across the nation and from all of our communities about some of the things that are a real challenge to us in looking after our elders as a nation. I commend the fact that that is to proceed.


Having said that, it is also critically important that the things we already know are not left to languish whilst the royal commission occurs. There are actions that government could take, such as the legislation before us today, that can be progressed in order to make sure that we provide better care, love and attention to the elders of our community. I don't think that anybody in our community would expect any less of us in this place. So, in that context, I want to talk about two particular areas where it's one thing to have a quality and complaints procedure but where we also need to get the other aspects of service delivery in place. One of them is around funding and delivery of services and the other is around workforce and providing for the future, given that we know this is a space where we'll need to not only improve quality and skills but increase staffing levels—the numbers of staff that will be required to do the job. Why this is so critically important, and why I think that so many of us on this side of the House wanted to speak on the bill, is that we've got elders in our communities, many of whom are living much longer and much healthier lives. They're active and participating in all sorts of activities, often now for decades after retirement. Certainly it's not something that our grandparents' or great-grandparents' generations would have anticipated post-retirement, but it's a reality. And that's a great thing.


It also means that as a result of being more healthy, more active and more engaged, it's now becoming the case that most people are often going into what we used to consider a more common experience—residential aged care—when they're at the very critical end. So they go in with very complex challenges and problems and need much more professional and qualified care provided to them. Dementia is a major issue now, as are complex health problems. People living longer means that at the end of life we are more likely to have the culmination of many of those impacts of ageing happening. It also means, obviously, that for quite a lot longer in life people will be looking to stay in their own homes—and we know from health outcomes that that's a much better thing for people to do. I think there has been a very strong bipartisan view that being able to support people to stay in their homes longer is a really good thing; it's a good policy aim. It's certainly a big part of what drove Labor's reforms in government, in the Living Longer Living Better reforms, to make sure that people were supported to do that.


What frustrates me and my community at the moment—and I've spoken about this in the chamber before, so I'll just touch on it here in this debate—is the fact that post the change of government in 2013 we have seen successive cuts to funding in the aged-care sector. Certainly I was made well aware by many of the providers in my electorate—and I'm sure other colleagues found the same in their electorates—of the massive changes that were made to the funding instrument and the implications of that cut across the sector. And that continues to be the case. Before the last budget the government had put out a whole lot of stories in the media about how there was going to be a big aged-care boost in the budget. Like many in my community, I was anticipating that it would come through, because, in particular, home care packages have been a real issue for people in my electorate. We know that people are being assessed as needing the most high-level package—a level 4 package—which means that they need the highest support to stay in their own homes, which, consequently, means that if they don't get that support they are much more likely to have to move into the residential aged-care sector. 


Just from a purely economic perspective for government, it's better—because it is more efficient and cheaper—to keep people in their own homes. Residential aged care per head is a much more expensive proposition. This is being frustrated by the fact that there are over 100,000 people waiting for care packages across the nation. In my own area, there are over 1,000 people who have been assessed as needing it but who are waiting. I will just remind the House that those published public figures about people who are waiting for a care package do not include people who have been assessed for higher-level care and then put on an interim lower-level care package. You might need a level 4, but there is a wait for it, so, in the meantime, the government puts you on a level 2, which is, obviously, a lower level of support. 


The reality of that impacts another group of people for whom I think this legislation, and the whole issue, is so important: families, loved ones and carers. I cannot tell you the number of times that I've had family members in tears talking to me and my staff, waiting for a home care package to be delivered. The reality is that most families who have an elderly relative are in one of two situations. Some people are working themselves, so they have the stress and worry about being at work all day when they've got an elderly relative in their own home: not being able to pop over at lunchtime and check on them, or, if they ring and they've got a problem, not being able to duck over to see them. This puts enormous stress and pressure on people. And that, obviously, has productivity implications for people in the workplace. Getting this right would have a really important economic flow-on for those workers in our communities who have caring responsibilities in families. 


Often, people are not only are working; the way our demographics are these days—people not having families until much later in life—they often have kids of their own that they're also juggling in terms of child care and school commitments and so forth, at the same time that they're dealing with older parents and family members. So this is a huge issue in our community, and it's an enormous stress on people, particularly when they've got a loved one who they know has been assessed and is entitled to support, but it's taking up to a year to get that for them. Imagine that you are a son or a daughter of an elderly person in that circumstance, where you're trying to work, you're trying to support your own family, you love this person and you're trying to do everything you can for them, and for month after month that pressure continues on you even though that person has been assessed as entitled to support. It is unacceptable, and the measly 14,000 places that were in the last budget barely make a dent on that long waiting list—and the funding for that came out of residential care funding anyway; it wasn't additional money. So this has real implications not only for our loved elders in our community but also for their families, their work colleagues and the businesses that they work for.


The third group of people who I want to talk about in terms of the aged-care sector are the providers. By that, I mean the aged-care providers who are caring, quality providers. In this environment, with what's happening, they really are going to have a hard time of it too. It's very unfair to those providers to be put under the pressure of funding cuts and also under the pressure of delivering quality services and trying to match those up. I'm very conscious in my own area of providers who were running particular programmes to really give some quality of life to residents and who, through changes to the funding instrument and so forth, were not able to do a whole lot of things that they really wanted to do. I want to acknowledge them in this situation.


Most significantly, I want to acknowledge the aged-care workers. These are just amazing people. I'm sure all of you in the chamber will have visited aged-care providers in your own area. You would know that, by and large, they are women, but increasingly more men are working in this sector. You would know how deeply they care for the people that they're working for—their residents or older people that they're visiting and providing services to in their homes. It's just an amazing aspect of this sector—how deeply dedicated the workforce are. But they're not supported well enough.


That means some challenges for us around a female-dominated sector's pay rates—certainly Labor's had something to say about how we get better in that space—but also around training and development. The job is becoming more complex; it requires higher levels of skill. Part of that is also about resilience and about helping people get the skills and knowledge they need to feel competent and, therefore, confident in their work and not stressed by it. It also goes to sheer numbers. We're all ageing. It's one of those industry sectors that's unlikely to take a downturn. We're all going to hit that point and we are going to need a huge increase in the number of people working in the aged-care sector. It has already been a challenge for many providers to recruit people. It's hard to get young people to see the sector as a viable long-term career option, although it is one and it provides great opportunities. They're seeing a sector under stress, under pressure and underfunded, without appropriate recognition of skills or support through upskilling and retraining, and when people look at that it's very hard to encourage them to come into the sector. We have to get much better at workforce planning. I do think it was a great error by the Abbott government, when they were first elected, to abolish the over $1 billion workforce strategy that Labor had put in place alongside the reforms. I think it was very short-sighted.


I want to acknowledge that I attended a forum with many of those workers in Wollongong in June. Our local Labor councillor, Arthur Rorris, spoke, and so did Gerard Hayes from the Health Services Union as well as locals Amanda Hampton, Karen Singh, Lisa Walker and Lyn Martin, who between them have decades of experience in the sector. The thing that they were there for wasn't about their own educational opportunities or their own pay rates; it was about their despair and about making sure the system delivered for the people they loved and cared about and the clients that they were working with. It was just inspiring to hear that dedication. I want to pay huge respects to those workers and say to the whole parliament that we need to do better.


Many of the people I have spoken about are carers, and in my final 20 seconds I want to acknowledge it is National Carers Week. The website's up and running, and I encourage people to support a carer. Go and have a look at the website and support National Carers Week.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (19:18):  I want to start by acknowledging my thoughts are with the families, friends and loved ones who have had their parents or loved ones affected by some of the stories that I've been hearing today and those we have seen in media over the last few weeks. Aged care is a policy area that needs urgent attention due to the fact that Australia has an ageing population. Around 1.3 million Australians are currently receiving aged-care services provided by approximately 400,000 nurses and carers. It is projected that the aged-care workforce will need to triple by 2056—that is, around one million workers will be required to deliver services for more than 3.5 million voters. Older people will represent one in four Australians. Public expenditure on aged care is expected to double as a share of the economy by the 2050s. Right now, there are over 100,000 people on the in-home-care-package waiting list, including 88,000 people with high needs, and many of those are living with dementia. This demonstrates the high demand and rapid growth of this sector.


When Labor were last in government, we understood the need to act quickly, and we are still aware of the need for urgent attention. Due to the fact that Australia has an ageing population, the ageing-policy area is a rapidly changing environment. Labor made massive reforms to the sector, delivering the Living Longer Living Better reforms in 2012 under the then minister, the Hon. Mark Butler. The Living Longer Living Better reforms were designed to deliver important benefits to older Australians. Those included more support and care at home; better access to residential care; increased recognition of carers—and I pay tribute to carers, as this week is Carers Week—and those from multicultural and diverse backgrounds and also for our First Nations people; more support for those with dementia; and better access to information. The main focus was about consumer-directed care that would give older Australians not only a greater choice about the care they wanted but the independence and support to live in their homes for as long as possible, preferably until they passed away.


There was a clear plan for the Living Longer Living Better reforms, and Labor delivered a massive aged-care reform package that provided $3.7 billion over five years. Labor legislated these reforms, and we funded them. And then something devastating happened for the aged-care sector three months later. The LNP Abbott government was elected, and then the attacks on aged care commenced.


The very worst thing about the current LNP government is that the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care is not included in cabinet. Three different aged-care ministers across the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have had carriage of the Living Longer Living Better reforms over the last five years, and all have failed have to do any real reform across the Ageing portfolio. The former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Sussan Ley, did little or nothing to progress the reforms. The current minister, Ken Wyatt, has also struggled to progress the Living Longer Living Better reforms. More than a dozen reviews and reports, including hundreds of recommendations, still sit on the minister's desk without being actioned. The reports have all been there, sitting on the minister's desk. Instead of responding to them with compassion, they have responded with cuts.


Arguably, the worst thing that this LNP government has done to the aged-care sector is the massive cuts. The LNP have cut billions of dollars from the Aged Care Funding Instrument and have dumped Labor's $1.5 billion workforce compact. Under Scott Morrison's watch as Treasurer, the aged-care budget was used as an ATM to try to prop up the budget. He cut approximately $1.2 billion from the aged-care sector. Now, as Prime Minister, Scott Morrison has tried to say that he hasn't made any cuts. Allow me to enlighten the Prime Minister, who seems to have forgotten that he was Treasurer and apparently cannot read his own budget papers. The budget papers are very clear. Under 'Aged care provider funding' on page 101 of Budget Paper No. 2 from the 2016 budget, it states:


The Government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 billion over four years through changes to the scoring matrix of the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) that determines the level of funding paid to aged care providers.


It's there in black and white. How inept can one honestly be? You cannot rip $1.2 billion out of the aged-care system and not have an impact on the quality of services.


The aged-care industry bodies warned at the time of the 2016 budget that the cuts would result in reduced quality of standard of care. And—no surprise to anyone except the LNP—that is exactly what has happened. It was always going to be inevitable that these massive cuts would, sadly, lead to reducing the standard regarding the care of our older Australians.


Care for older Australians is fundamentally a human right. The LNP seem to be too busy fighting amongst themselves instead of focusing on what truly matters. The lack of response in relation to any reform fits a disturbing pattern of cover-ups and inaction on aged care from successive LNP governments. The aged-care workforce is expected to increase by 300 per cent in the next 30 years, underscoring the challenges and opportunities to get this right. But how does the LNP government react to this rapid growth rate? By cutting vital funds to the sector. The current situation in the aged-care sector can be no surprise to this government, and the responsibility for this demise rests solely on its shoulders. But, instead of responding with critical funding, it has responded with denial and a royal commission.


Personally, I back the royal commission, as does Labor. After all, it is Labor that has been saying for some time that the system is in crisis. It was only in May that the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said this in the parliament, and the government likened it to committing elder abuse. So it is a positive step that the LNP have changed their minds and are finally listening to people who use aged-care services, and workers, because the issues are blatantly obviously. 


In Townsville I have set up an aged-care reference group, and that group and members of the wider community have raised a number of issues. Firstly, the staff don't get paid properly. Secondly, the ratios of nurses and support workers to patients, and the skill mix of staff, need to be addressed. I think there needs to be a discussion about the ratio of qualified people to residents, and about the care that those residents need in the aged-care facilities. Are there enough nurses? Are there enough doctors? Do we have the local pharmacist involved? Can we get GPs to visit aged-care facilities? These are all questions that need answering.


Thirdly, regarding Prime Minister Scott Morrison's cuts to aged care, you can't cut billions of dollars in funding to residential aged-care facilities—supporting people with high needs and complex conditions, like high-care dementia—and expect a better result. Fourthly, is the cost of access. I am hearing lots of stories about people feeling ripped off in retirement villages. 


Fifthly, is, importantly, My Aged Care. Accessing My Aged Care is simply a traumatising experience for many elderly people—apart from the fact that many elderly people are not computer literate or do not even own a computer. When my father was extremely unwell and living in a residential aged-care facility, he was being transferred to hospital and my mother had a fall and broke her pelvis whilst walking with him to the ambulance. If that was not traumatic enough, when she was eventually discharged from hospital, she also needed a visit from the aged-care assessment team, because she needed an assessment for support services. The nurse visited and spent five hours with my mother, doing the assessment on line. At the conclusion, she hit the 'submit' button, and the entire assessment disappeared from the screen. 


The long and the short of this story is that she had to redo the assessment at a very traumatic time in her life. The only reason she had a nurse visit was because she had just been discharged from hospital and she needed immediate support. My mother had family to support her in this process. The question for me is: what happens to older Australians who do not have someone to support them? My mother-in-law got her appointment for her assessment after she died. The My Aged Care process needs immediate attention. 


There have been several inquiries into the problems in the aged-care sector, which the LNP government has not acted upon. If we are going to be serious about a royal commission, then the entire system must be included—the cuts, the reports, the inaction, everything. The royal commission must look at all aspects of aged care. It must look at the long-term sustainability of the sector, the workforce and the quality of care. It all must be investigated. 


The workers in the aged-care sector work really hard every day. They are on very low wages. Sometimes they are low-skilled workers, and sometimes they are highly skilled individuals who are not receiving the remuneration they should because they are working in the aged-care sector. They need to have their say as well. The workers I have spoken to want to feel proud they work in the aged-care sector. They want to go home feeling they have done a good job and have had the time to properly care for the older Australians in their care. As a nation we want to encourage people to work in the aged-care sector and we want to ensure that this royal commission takes a long-term view, and not just a rushed short-term look at some systemic issues. 


Most importantly, the royal commission must allow for and encourage older Australians to have their say—as well as their loved ones and their families. They must feel safe to make complaints without fear of repercussions. If the government is ever to rebuild faith through the royal commission process, then it is vital that older Australians and their families have their say. 


But it is also critical that we do not wait until the end of the royal commission before we take action, because we know what action needs to be taken. The LNP government cannot use the excuse of a royal commission before they commit to take the necessary action to fix the sector in its immediate crisis. Older Australians and families cannot wait. The LNP government must act now on the things we know are wrong with the system. The reports are available and the reports say that the cuts are having a detrimental impact on the quality of care offered in aged-care facilities. Now it is time for the government to step up, say they are sorry and restore the funding that has been cut. You don't fixed aged care by cutting funding. You don't fix aged care by not funding it. You certainly don't fix aged care by delaying action. That is really at the heart of what has happened to the aged-care system.


That brings me to the bill at hand. The Carnell-Paterson review recommended bringing together the functions of the Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. There are 10 recommendations in the Carnell-Paterson review. The purpose of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 is to establish a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission from January 2019.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (19:30):  I often speak in this chamber on the need for state and federal governments to provide adequate levels of infrastructure to meet the needs and demands of the ever-growing population of Macarthur. The reality is that my community, and indeed other areas of western and south-western Sydney, are experiencing exponential growth in population. This brings with it benefits but also certain problems. In the last few months we've heard much talk and discussion of population growth in the rapidly growing metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane et cetera. In Macarthur we're witnessing very rapid development, with old farms being converted into entire new suburbs virtually overnight and new homes cropping up every day. Literally thousands upon thousands of people are taking up residence in Macarthur, moving into suburbs such as Gilead, Campbelltown, Oran Park, Gregory Hills, Leppington, Catherine Field, Emerald Hills and Willowdale, to name just a few.


These growing communities are filled with great people who have decided to call Macarthur home, and it's my pleasure to represent them all in this place. Many young families, in particular, are moving into the area with young children, having decided that our community is the area where they want to raise their children and make a life. They've moved to Macarthur seeking out opportunities in employment, business and education and just to have a better life, with a desire to find a thriving community to call home. 


I'm working hard to secure better outcomes for these people and, indeed, for future residents of my community. However, time and again I've lobbied for the appropriate level of services and infrastructure to be established to meet the present and future demands of my community. We are experiencing exponential growth and it's necessary that essential infrastructure is established now, not later. The reality is that these residents have been let down by national government and state governments for a long time. It's not sufficient for incumbent governments to continue negating all responsibility in these areas. We are already behind and falling further behind in transport, education and health services. Our schools are at breaking point. Some of the infrastructure is 40, 50 and 60 years old and really breaking down as I watch. I can only hazard a guess at how bad a state we'll be in over the next few decades unless something is done. 


There have been really very terrible attempts at public relations exercises to inform my population of how much infrastructure is being provided, which has clearly not been the case. The City Deal promoted by the Turnbull government really was a very bad, politicised outcome for my community. Transport is terrible and getting worse. The federal and state governments have not provided a rail link from my community to the new Western Sydney Airport, considered essential by all public transport and airport consultants. Our train timetable has become so much worse that it now takes 20 minutes longer to get into the city from Campbelltown than it did only 12 months ago. We have been failed by state and federal governments. We have been presented with a group of spin doctors' documents that have failed to recognise the importance of providing proper infrastructure for these rapidly growing communities.


Immigration has been good for our community in many ways, but state and federal governments have failed to understand the importance of providing infrastructure for these communities now, not later. I'm very disappointed in the response of the New South Wales state government, in particular, who can spend billions of dollars on reproducing stadiums that are not needed and will be used very little by Macarthur residents, instead of proper public transport and proper funding for our schools. I'm very disappointed in the federal government's City Deal, which has been very bad for Macarthur and Campbelltown in particular. I'm very disappointed in their planning documents, which have removed all responsibility for planning from the local community and given it to developers and the moneyed few of the inner city and the north and east of Sydney and very little to Macarthur residents. It's a very poor outcome.



It's not sufficient for our state and federal governments to say they're doing the right thing when they're clearly not. I've made many, many representations, as have my state colleagues, to the federal and state governments, highlighting the concerns of my constituents and the need for urgent action. Time and time again my concerns have fallen on deaf ears, with the Morrison government and the Berejiklian government now treating the Macarthur region with contempt. I've written to the minister to come and see the core infrastructure— (Time expired)

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (10:30):  It was a year ago that I stood in this place to talk about how important a decision it was for Geelong, back in 2013, that the NDIA would be based in Geelong. It was a difficult time for our city. Ford had just decided to stop building cars in Australia, and Alcoa would shortly decide to close its Point Henry smelter. The Labor government knew the challenges faced by our city, and we had a Prime Minister who knew that the decisions that that government made could make a real difference. That's why the Labor government created the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, which has delivered almost $30 million and over 850 jobs in our community. That's why the Labor government built the Geelong Ring Road, funded the Regional Rail Link and invested in Geelong's stadium, library and heritage centre development. That's why the national headquarters of the NDIA is based in Geelong, bringing 450 jobs and a new building that is changing Geelong's skyline as we speak. That's what it looks like when you have a government that listens to community needs and does the work to address those needs.


A year ago, in that speech, I talked about how important it was that the leadership of the NDIA be based in Geelong. At that time, the CEO of the NDIA had indicated, in Senate estimates, that he was spending about a day a week in Geelong—that's all. There were unconvincing answers about where the senior leadership of the NDIA were based. It was made clear that the NDIA's actuary was based in Sydney. A year later, exactly what's happened in terms of where the senior leadership of the NDIA are based and whether they're based in Geelong remains unclear.


The member for Corangamite has a role here. She is yet to advocate for and win a single notable project for our region. She stoked people's hopes on Land 400 and let them down. It was false-hope peddling of the worst kind. In the lead-up to the last federal election, there was a $20 million announcement—of what, we were not sure. After the election, that morphed into the idea of a city deal. There was an announcement earlier this year with no actual substance. But then the state government supported $150 million worth of projects under the city deal. When the Shorten Labor opposition proposed through its city partnership program that it would support those projects, creating almost a thousand jobs in the Geelong region, the member for Corangamite appeared to walk away from it. The member for Corangamite will go to the next election promising the same city deal she promised at the last one, with no progress being made. Not only has she done that but she has been part of a government that has made decisions that have made life in Geelong harder—a massive loss of manufacturing jobs and, just when people need it, attacking the social safety net that people require.


On the question of the NDIA, the member for Corangamite has no excuses. There is no state Labor government or federal colleagues to shift blame to. I know that she's part of a government which has failed to recognise that our community exists but, in this instance, she has ministerial responsibility for this—no fudging, no-one else to blame. It's time that she made sure that the NDIA leadership are based in Geelong.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) 15 October marks International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day;


(b) on this day, parents, families and friends will memorialise babies they have lost through miscarriage, stillbirth and infant death; and


(c) International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is an opportunity to officially acknowledge the losses experienced by parents and families across Australia;


(2) acknowledges that in Australia:


(a) it is estimated that one in four pregnancies results in miscarriage—that's 103,000 every year;


(b) in 2016 2,849 lives were lost due to stillbirth or newborn death;


(c) the rate of stillbirth and newborn death is 70 per cent higher in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples;


(d) despite medical advancements, the stillbirth rate has not changed in two decades; and


(e) International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is an opportunity to raise awareness of this difficult reality and start a conversation about miscarriage and infant loss;


(3) expresses sympathy to all families who have suffered a miscarriage, a stillbirth or infant death; and


(4) commends each and every person who has supported parents and families through their journey from the loss of a baby.


Chris and I were really excited about our first pregnancy. I had passed the no-go zone after a year of being on Roaccutane for adult acne. You have to sign a disclaimer that you will not fall pregnant while you are taking it or for a period after you have taken it. Chris and I were also really excited about my first ultrasound. We were really excited about seeing what was causing the changes to my body in such a short period of time. We were really excited about acquainting ourselves with what we looked forward to being a future member of our family. We were really excited about seeing that little heartbeat.


Back then—and I'm not sure whether it's the same today—you had to drink what seemed like litres of water to have a full bladder for the ultrasound for the best vision of the baby. I did that and when I went to the ultrasound my doctor told me that my bladder was too full, so I went to the toilet. When I came back from the toilet my doctor told me my bladder was too empty. After the optimal amount of water, I lay there eagerly awaiting that first vision of the baby. I was eagerly awaiting the clear read on the baby. The doctor got a clear read, and I strained to see what he was seeing. Then he paused, looked closer and turned to me and told me that there was no heartbeat—that the baby was dead. That was it. That was the language he used. He then told me to get dressed and meet him in his office to discuss an appointment for a D and C. That was it. That was the language he used.


After I got dressed and we worked out a time for the D and C I left his rooms. I left his rooms without any offer of support, without any offer of support services and without any offer of sympathy. That was 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, when I was trying to fall pregnant and trying to keep my pregnancies, the rate of stillbirth was more than 2,000 babies a year—six babies a day. Twenty years on the rate of stillbirth is still the same—more than 2,000 babies a year—six babies a day.


Pregnancy loss carries with it countless misconceptions—that it's uncommon, that it's caused by stress or even that it is the fault of the mother. Pregnancy loss is more than just an unfortunate blip on the radar or a sad detour on the way to a successful pregnancy. For many parents the death of a much-wanted baby is a life-altering tragedy that rips away hope of a happy ending. According to Miscarriage, Stillbirth and Newborn Death Support, one in four confirmed pregnancies tragically ends in a miscarriage. Today is International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Today. Today is an opportunity to talk about pregnancy subjects that are usually avoided or are taboo—things like miscarriage, stillbirth and infant loss.


In 2015 Samantha and Aaron were expecting their first child. Sam's pregnancy was what they call a low-risk and textbook pregnancy. She was 24. It was her first pregnancy. She was fit and healthy. Sam always had a feeling that something wasn't quite right. On 14 November 2015 Sam went to the hospital with severe pain in her feet, an intense feeling of sickness and a headache. She was monitored for a few hours and then she was sent home. The next day Sam woke up and her baby didn't move in the usual 'good morning' way. Sam went to the hospital again. At 37 weeks pregnant Sam was told that her baby no longer had a heartbeat. Evelyn Louise Isfahani was born sleeping on 16 November 2015.


Stillbirth still remains the leading cause of death in infants, and the cause of at least one-third of all stillborn babies remains unknown. Yesterday, Labor's shadow minister for health announced that, under a Shorten Labor government, Labor will invest $5 million to fund prevention and research programs in an effort to spare families the unimaginable heartache of losing their babies, and I say thank you.


Finally, I want to express my sympathies to all the families who have suffered a miscarriage, a stillbirth or an infant death. I encourage Australians on this day and every day to speak openly about these topics so we can remove the stigma and give families the vital support they need. I want to thank Steph Brimson, who's part of my team, who has been a tireless advocate on this issue, and I encourage her to continue her quest for support for these families going through such tragedy.

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2018-10-15,"



Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (11:05):  I thank the member for Canberra for her advocacy on this very important issue, for moving the motion today and for sharing her very personal story with us this morning. It's a very brave thing to do—and we probably don't do it enough in this place—because it does make a difference when all of the women and the families sitting out there see you talking about these sorts of things. It gives them hope that, first of all, we understand and that we're working on things that really matter to them.


As a lot of people in this place probably know, the member for Canberra and I are very passionate about supporting women's health around reproductive issues, and we have already done a lot of good work together on endometriosis, where we have achieved significant outcomes for women in a very short space of time. While our male colleagues can understand these issues, they don't personally physically go through them, so there is a difference that a woman's perspective does make on these sorts of things, as the member for Canberra has just very bravely outlined.


I'm pleased to speak on this issue today, because stillbirth awareness is a critical issue for us to educate women, families and the medical profession about across Australia. This awareness and education has the potential to save the lives of unborn babies. My understanding of this issue has been helped by the South Australian organisation Still Aware. I want to pay tribute to their incredible advocacy on stillbirth awareness today. Claire Foord founded Still Aware because of her own deeply personal and tragic experience. In February 2014, Claire and her husband welcomed a baby girl, Alfie. Alfie was stillborn at term without explanation. Alfie had no illness and no identified issues, but she was born still. Despite her indescribable grief, Claire decided she would do everything in her power to prevent other women from suffering the tragedy that she and her family suffered. Now, as CEO of Still Aware, Claire works tirelessly to ensure other mothers do not have to go through the same loss. Still Aware is a not-for-profit organisation that aims to raise awareness of the occurrence of stillbirth and what prevention strategies can be used by expectant mothers. It also provides support to families who have lived through this terrible tragedy.


'Stillbirth' is defined as the death of a baby beyond 20 weeks gestation. Sadly, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, around 2,200 babies are born still in Australia every year. This is about double the number of road fatalities. While we all know about road fatalities and how to prevent them, too many women don't know about stillbirth. Too many women don't know about the risk factors and signs that could save their unborn baby's life. At the moment, there's no mandatory educational training for clinicians and no mandatory information provided to women when they're pregnant. Educating expectant mothers on the signs to look for, including reduced fetal movement or unusual fetal movement and safer sleeping positions while pregnant, could help save an unborn baby's life. The message is very clear: if you are concerned about your baby, don't wait—seek medical assistance immediately.


International experience suggests that it is possible to reduce the instance of stillbirth through education. In Norway, mothers monitoring their baby's movements daily in the third trimester, which is 28 weeks onwards, resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in stillbirth. In New Zealand, a 30 per cent drop in unexplained late-term stillbirth over three years coincided with the introduction of midwives providing sleep position advice to pregnant women as part of their antenatal care. This work was supported by the findings of three studies which showed that, when a pregnant mother sleeps on her back, the risk of stillbirth is increased.


Here in Australia we haven't seen these sorts of declines in stillbirth rates, and I believe it is critical that we do. I was genuinely shocked to learn that, over the past 20 years, there has not been a decline in the number of babies born still. I'd like to acknowledge the work that Still Aware and the Stillbirth Foundation do to promote education, awareness and research about stillbirth in Australia.


The government is committed to supporting those affected by pregnancy and infant loss and to improving infant and maternal health outcomes. In this year's budget, we announced nearly $18 million for the Maternal Health and First 2000 Days research program. I note the opposition's announcement yesterday on stillbirth and I will look very carefully at their proposal. I will continue to work with the Minister for Health on behalf of all women and families so that we can reduce the rate of babies born still here in Australia.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:11):  I too thank the member for Canberra for moving this very important motion on pregnancy and infant loss. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the parents and families who have lost a child or children in pregnancy, infancy or at birth. I acknowledge your loss in this place and pay my respects and sympathy to you and your families. I also acknowledge First Nations women and their families whose babies were taken from them and, in many cases, they never saw these children again.


This is an issue that is very close to my heart. The loss of a child at any stage of pregnancy or infancy or at birth is unbelievably painful for the parents, other children, extended family and close friends. I am sure that there is not a day that goes by that we do not think about the children or child that we have lost. Far too many families grieve in silence, and that was my experience. It was not because I did not have a family that was very supportive around me. In those days, losing a baby during pregnancy was really not discussed or even thought of. In fact, I doubt that I have ever properly grieved for the baby that I lost in pregnancy, because there was no opportunity to do so. Life simply went on. I came home from hospital, had a day off and went back to work. I am talking about 34 years ago, but that does not mean that I don't often think about the child. I wonder whether it was a boy or a girl and what he or she would have looked like. So opportunities like today, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, are very important and are welcome in our communities. It is very pleasing to see that times have evolved and the loss of a child is now talked about openly and we 'Walk to Remember'.


In October 1988 President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the month of October as National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month in the United States. The former President made a very poignant point when he stated:


When a child loses his parent, they are called an orphan. When a spouse loses her or his partner, they are called a widow or widower. When parents loses their child, there isn't a word to describe them.


International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day allows parents, families and communities to officially stop, remember and come together. Each family's experience is unique, because, as human beings, we are all very unique. In a society where we have expanded lines of communication from carrier pigeon to the multiple modes of Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, emails, text messages and mobile phones, in all of these communication methods we have somehow lost the art of actually personally reaching out.


I remember attending the Sands Walk to Remember in Townsville for the first time and being hit by emotions that had been deeply buried. Yes, life does go on and, yes, we did already have two other healthy, beautiful children, and in time we had another healthy child, but we also lost a child that we knew absolutely nothing about. The only time our third child was referred to was when I fell pregnant with our last child and I was asked how many pregnancies I had had. Thankfully, as I said, in today's world we talk much more openly and we hold our memories in our hearts. The love that we have for our lost babies will live forever in our hearts.


Yesterday I, along with many other parents and families, attended the Sands Australia remembrance walk in Townsville. I congratulate Linda Adams, who brought Sands to Townsville in 2006 and has dedicated a huge amount of time to Sands in our community. Marie Dueble, Loretta and Janice coordinated the ceremony with the help of a wonderful team of volunteers.






This ceremony provided a healing experience for the parents, siblings, families and close friends who attended. It helps us heal by seeing we are not alone. It helps us heal by talking to each other. It helps us heal by providing support and guidance, and, importantly, it helps us remember the loved ones that we have lost. I want to thank Sands Australia for the tremendous work that they do and continue to do for other parents just like my husband and me.


I commend Labor for its announcement on the weekend. We will invest in research to assist in reducing the number of babies that are lost in infancy, at birth or in pregnancy. In 2018 we certainly should not be losing the children that we are currently losing. It is a journey that you would not wish on any person. I am very pleased, I must say, after 34 years, to be with people who are speaking very openly about their experiences and are supporting each other.

Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (11:15):  I acknowledge and thank the member for Canberra for moving this motion, and I thank her and the member for Herbert for sharing their stories of their babies. Today is International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. Today, and each day that follows, six families will grieve the loss of a stillborn baby. More babies will fight for life in neonatal intensive care units around the country, where the issues or infections that they were born with will become insurmountable. Tonight candles will be lit to acknowledge bereaved parents and provide support in their loss.


The number of little lives lost each year tells the story of families affected by the loss of a baby or a pregnancy. We estimate that one in four pregnancies results in miscarriage. In 2016, 2,849 lives were lost to stillbirth or within the first four weeks of life. This issue is even more prolific among Indigenous Australians. They are almost twice as likely to experience the loss of a baby due to stillbirth or neonatal death than the Australian population at large, and this rate has not moved for the past two decades. Furthermore, culturally and linguistically diverse Australians also experience stillbirth and neonatal loss at a higher rate than the general population. In 2013-14, nearly 35 per cent of all stillbirths that occurred in Australia were born to women who were born in countries other than our own. Given these statistics, I commend the Senate for establishing the Select Committee on Stillbirth Research and Education. This committee will inquire and report on the future of stillbirth research and education in Australia. I acknowledge the work of Senator Keneally in highlighting these issues, and her daughter Carolyn's importance to her family.


For families of the future, we must do everything that we can to reduce the number of babies lost. We must educate families about steps that they can take to improve pregnancy outcomes. We must properly fund critical research into why stillbirth still happens. We must ensure that we take the opportunity to gather data wherever possible to better this critical research. This is why Labor announced that, if a Shorten Labor government is elected, it will invest in driving down the stillbirth rate in Australia. Labor will fund prevention, education and research programs that will make a critical difference in saving lives and sparing families the unimaginable heartbreak of losing their babies. When the Senate select committee delivers its report, Labor will consider further measures. These include developing a national stillbirth strategy to ensure that this issue is addressed with comprehensive policy measures.


Today is about recognising those families for whom there is someone missing to celebrate birthdays, Christmas, graduations and all those special family moments. Today is about supporting parents and grandparents, and mums and dads too. Today is about recognising their loss, which is rarely spoken about. Talking about their feelings and concerns will help families better cope with the future that lies ahead.


The Senate select committee submissions tell us that it's not only grieving mothers who are impacted when a baby is stillborn. Stillbirth is especially difficult for fathers, who are often expected to hold things together and suppress the pain they're feeling. Stigma is a cycle. Vulnerability and trauma on this issue should not be things that families feel they need to hide. As a caring and compassionate society, Australia owes it to the families who have lost children to step up and discuss how we can do better. We know that having a conversation around regular infant movement dramatically reduces the risk of stillbirth. We know that taking women's anxieties seriously during pregnancy has a positive impact on live births. And we know that naming stillbirth as a risk to women between 18 and 24 weeks dramatically increases awareness, vigilance and, ultimately, prevention.


Today though is also about recognising those groups like Sands Australia, the Stillbirth Foundation and Red Nose that work tirelessly to support families and develop solutions to improve the numbers of little lives lost every year. It is only recent changes that have allowed babies in New South Wales that were stillborn to be registered by Births, Deaths and Marriages. This official recognition has helped to raise awareness of the scale of the issue, but, more importantly, it helps families and communities recognise the baby's existence was important. I would like to express my sympathy to all families—dads and mums, grandparents, siblings and friends—who've been touched by today's recognition. My family recognise Michael and Meaghan, who are still a very special part of our family.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (12:38):  Every day is just another day that working people in this country are being ripped off by a government that doesn't care and is not interested in helping millions of Australians who are seeing their wages go backwards. The facts couldn't be clearer. When inequality is at a 75-year high and wage growth is at an all-time low, what do the government do? They support a cut in penalty rates for 700,000 Australians who, for the past two years, have seen cuts to their take-home pay and who will continue to do so under the Morrison government. This comes off the back of 20 consecutive quarters of falling wage growth in the private sector, where wage growth has now plummeted to just 1.9 per cent. The government will tell you that we have turned a corner on this, but the truth is we are still at all-time historical lows, with workers in this country paying the price for this government's inaction. Under this government, there are no signs that this is going to change anytime soon. In fact, it's only going to get worse.


On the other hand, this important piece of legislation that we're debating today, the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018, introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, will protect workers' take-home pay in the future. I'm proud to rise today to state unequivocally my support for penalty rates and the protection of take-home pay. On this side of the House our united team is so committed to ensuring Australian workers get a fair go that, if we are privileged to be elected, a Shorten Labor government will in our first 100 days restore penalty rates and legislate so that they can never be cut again. This is in stark contrast to the government, which is led by a Prime Minister who voted eight times to support cuts to penalty rates.


Despite what those opposite think, penalty rates are not a luxury. They are what pay the bills and put food on the table for over 10,000 workers in my electorate, who are losing up to $77 a week. This includes those who work in retail, which is the third-biggest industry in my community, employing 6,976 local workers. A further 3,612 employed in the food and hospitality sector are also feeling the pain of cuts to penalty rates. These are real people who are losing real money under this government.


As the Leader of the Opposition has previously stated, cutting penalty rates means that working people have less money to spend in small businesses, in the shops and in the cafes; cutting penalty rates dampens confidence and deepens inequality; and cutting penalty rates is bad news for young people and bad news for Australian women. At the current pace under this government, Australia is 150 years away from closing the gender pay gap. Those opposite should come down from their shining ivory towers, get out in the community and speak to those who are being affected by these cuts rather than trying to hand out billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to big businesses and the big banks. We know it is in their DNA.


When these cuts to penalty rates first came in I was joined by the member for Bendigo at a community penalty rates forum in Goodna in my electorate of Oxley. We were joined by dozens of workers, who voiced their frustration and disappointment with the LNP government in supporting the decision to cut penalty rates. At the forum we heard from people like Donna, who has fought tooth and nail to put food on the table only to be given a kick in the guts by this government cutting her weekly wage. These are the stories of real people. 


Whereas, on the other hand, we have seen members of the government who are living in denial and have been too busy fighting with each other for the past five years to care how this affects everyday Australians. My community does not deserve this. The working men and women of Australia who work on a Sunday deserve their full penalty rates, not a pay cut. What is most insulting to these workers is that the day after these tax cuts first came in the government gave a millionaire a tax cut of $16,400. In my electorate, in places like Redbank and Redbank Plains, people who work in retail and hospitality got a pay cut while millionaires living on the North Shore got a tax cut of $16,000. How on earth is that fair? How on earth can members of the government look anyone in the community in the eye and say, 'We've got your back'? They don't.


The Leader of the Opposition and Labor have not given up on workers. I will not give up on workers in my electorate and I will continue to fight these pay cuts every single day until the election. Today I call on the government to do the right thing. Stop looking at yourselves, stop fighting amongst yourselves and start looking after the workers of this country and making sure that their penalty rates are restored.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (12:43):  It is great to follow the member for Oxley on this very important Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018. The retail industry is the second-largest employment category in Australia and employs 1.2 million people, or one in nine Aussies, and 52 per cent of those workers have absolutely no post-school qualifications. In my electorate of Lindsay the retail trade employs over 12,000 people. These working Australians are relying on penalty rates to survive. The Liberal government's savage cuts to penalty rates mean on average a $77 a week pay cut. More than 75,000 people in my electorate—that is, more than half of my electorate—have jobs that will be affected by these cuts and will continue to be out of pocket. We need to stand up for working people and their conditions. Labor has a proud history of supporting workers.


According to the calculations made by the ACTU, a level 6 cook who works Sunday to Thursday every week will be $1,000 a year worse off. Penalty rates are not a luxury. They put food on the table, pay the bills and fill up the car. Employees who rely on penalty rates to meet their household expenditure are far more likely to be a single parent, a woman, a young person, on an income of less than $30,000 or living in regional Australia. I ask: where are the Nats on this? These penalty rate cuts stand to negatively and disproportionately affect more women and young people. They also pose a huge risk to our local economies and communities. This is simply not good enough.


Under this government, Sunday penalty rates will be cut next year and again the year after that. Make absolutely no mistake: Scott Morrison and the Liberal government support cuts to penalty rates. They voted eight times to support these savage cuts, and they want to take them even further. Currently the industries that are worst affected are retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy. We know this government has plans to further slash the wages of ordinary workers, which begs the question: which industry is next? Our living standards are what make this country a great place to live. When our industrial systems are vandalised, these standards are the things that are most at risk. Cuts to penalty rates are exactly that: vandalism of our industrial system and an attack on our living standards.


We keep hearing about Australian workers being ripped off. It is happening everywhere; it is rife. Over the last 12 months, from 15 June to 16 July, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered more than $27 million owed to over 11,000 workers from almost 30,000 allegations of Fair Work Act breaches. These astronomical numbers represent only those instances of underpayment and exploitation that were reported to the ombudsman. How many are not reported?


This Liberal government is so out of touch. It is happier to line the pockets of big business and the big end of town than to give the workers of Australia a fair go. We must do everything we can to fight back, restore these penalty rates and change the rules. For the life of me, I cannot understand why low-paid workers are always in the firing line of this cruel government. How can anyone justify taking money from those who most need it? This shows how out of touch this government really is with the lives of middle- and low-income earners.


The Prime Minister gives millionaires a tax cut and big companies get billion-dollar tax handouts, yet inequality is at a 75-year high. Australia has seen some of the lowest wage rises in 25 years. Cuts to working Australian wages are not emblematic of the Australian 'fair go'. This government has already cut the take-home pay of 700,000 working people across the country with the changes to penalty rates. Considering wages in Australia have been stagnant ever since this government was elected in 2013 under Abbott, then Turnbull and now Morrison—and who knows who's next; it seems like everyone gets a turn over there!—its decisions are a kick in the guts for working people who are already struggling to get by.


This government wants to further undermine workers' rights and their unions. It is the job of the government of the day to alleviate the pain and struggles that everyday Australians face. Pay and conditions are not supposed to stagnate or go backwards, and this is not alleviating the pain or helping the cost of living. People need penalty rates to make ends meet. Every cent counts for so many people across this country, whether it is the working mum who spends weekends away from her family in order to put food on the table or the struggling uni student who, despite juggling work and university commitments, is still eating two-minute noodles for dinner every night. When I was a uni student, I ate frozen veggies because I didn't like the noodles—that's how I survived. Every single cent counts.


Labor will never ever support the undermining of workers' rights and their conditions. Labor understands the value of an extra $77 a week for working Australians and their families. Penalty rate cuts mean less income tax revenue because people are earning less, resulting in more people relying on Centrelink to make ends meet. They also means workers have less money to spend in local shops, restaurants and businesses. Everybody loses under this government. Penalty rate cuts are hurting Australians, and this government must do more. Everybody deserves decent pay and conditions. I encourage everybody to attend the Change the Rules rally on 23 October in Sydney. Join your union, support the campaign and stand up and fight back.

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (12:38):  Every day is just another day that working people in this country are being ripped off by a government that doesn't care and is not interested in helping millions of Australians who are seeing their wages go backwards. The facts couldn't be clearer. When inequality is at a 75-year high and wage growth is at an all-time low, what do the government do? They support a cut in penalty rates for 700,000 Australians who, for the past two years, have seen cuts to their take-home pay and who will continue to do so under the Morrison government. This comes off the back of 20 consecutive quarters of falling wage growth in the private sector, where wage growth has now plummeted to just 1.9 per cent. The government will tell you that we have turned a corner on this, but the truth is we are still at all-time historical lows, with workers in this country paying the price for this government's inaction. Under this government, there are no signs that this is going to change anytime soon. In fact, it's only going to get worse.


On the other hand, this important piece of legislation that we're debating today, the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018, introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, will protect workers' take-home pay in the future. I'm proud to rise today to state unequivocally my support for penalty rates and the protection of take-home pay. On this side of the House our united team is so committed to ensuring Australian workers get a fair go that, if we are privileged to be elected, a Shorten Labor government will in our first 100 days restore penalty rates and legislate so that they can never be cut again. This is in stark contrast to the government, which is led by a Prime Minister who voted eight times to support cuts to penalty rates.


Despite what those opposite think, penalty rates are not a luxury. They are what pay the bills and put food on the table for over 10,000 workers in my electorate, who are losing up to $77 a week. This includes those who work in retail, which is the third-biggest industry in my community, employing 6,976 local workers. A further 3,612 employed in the food and hospitality sector are also feeling the pain of cuts to penalty rates. These are real people who are losing real money under this government.


As the Leader of the Opposition has previously stated, cutting penalty rates means that working people have less money to spend in small businesses, in the shops and in the cafes; cutting penalty rates dampens confidence and deepens inequality; and cutting penalty rates is bad news for young people and bad news for Australian women. At the current pace under this government, Australia is 150 years away from closing the gender pay gap. Those opposite should come down from their shining ivory towers, get out in the community and speak to those who are being affected by these cuts rather than trying to hand out billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to big businesses and the big banks. We know it is in their DNA.


When these cuts to penalty rates first came in I was joined by the member for Bendigo at a community penalty rates forum in Goodna in my electorate of Oxley. We were joined by dozens of workers, who voiced their frustration and disappointment with the LNP government in supporting the decision to cut penalty rates. At the forum we heard from people like Donna, who has fought tooth and nail to put food on the table only to be given a kick in the guts by this government cutting her weekly wage. These are the stories of real people. 


Whereas, on the other hand, we have seen members of the government who are living in denial and have been too busy fighting with each other for the past five years to care how this affects everyday Australians. My community does not deserve this. The working men and women of Australia who work on a Sunday deserve their full penalty rates, not a pay cut. What is most insulting to these workers is that the day after these tax cuts first came in the government gave a millionaire a tax cut of $16,400. In my electorate, in places like Redbank and Redbank Plains, people who work in retail and hospitality got a pay cut while millionaires living on the North Shore got a tax cut of $16,000. How on earth is that fair? How on earth can members of the government look anyone in the community in the eye and say, 'We've got your back'? They don't.


The Leader of the Opposition and Labor have not given up on workers. I will not give up on workers in my electorate and I will continue to fight these pay cuts every single day until the election. Today I call on the government to do the right thing. Stop looking at yourselves, stop fighting amongst yourselves and start looking after the workers of this country and making sure that their penalty rates are restored.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (12:43):  It is great to follow the member for Oxley on this very important Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018. The retail industry is the second-largest employment category in Australia and employs 1.2 million people, or one in nine Aussies, and 52 per cent of those workers have absolutely no post-school qualifications. In my electorate of Lindsay the retail trade employs over 12,000 people. These working Australians are relying on penalty rates to survive. The Liberal government's savage cuts to penalty rates mean on average a $77 a week pay cut. More than 75,000 people in my electorate—that is, more than half of my electorate—have jobs that will be affected by these cuts and will continue to be out of pocket. We need to stand up for working people and their conditions. Labor has a proud history of supporting workers.


According to the calculations made by the ACTU, a level 6 cook who works Sunday to Thursday every week will be $1,000 a year worse off. Penalty rates are not a luxury. They put food on the table, pay the bills and fill up the car. Employees who rely on penalty rates to meet their household expenditure are far more likely to be a single parent, a woman, a young person, on an income of less than $30,000 or living in regional Australia. I ask: where are the Nats on this? These penalty rate cuts stand to negatively and disproportionately affect more women and young people. They also pose a huge risk to our local economies and communities. This is simply not good enough.


Under this government, Sunday penalty rates will be cut next year and again the year after that. Make absolutely no mistake: Scott Morrison and the Liberal government support cuts to penalty rates. They voted eight times to support these savage cuts, and they want to take them even further. Currently the industries that are worst affected are retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy. We know this government has plans to further slash the wages of ordinary workers, which begs the question: which industry is next? Our living standards are what make this country a great place to live. When our industrial systems are vandalised, these standards are the things that are most at risk. Cuts to penalty rates are exactly that: vandalism of our industrial system and an attack on our living standards.


We keep hearing about Australian workers being ripped off. It is happening everywhere; it is rife. Over the last 12 months, from 15 June to 16 July, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered more than $27 million owed to over 11,000 workers from almost 30,000 allegations of Fair Work Act breaches. These astronomical numbers represent only those instances of underpayment and exploitation that were reported to the ombudsman. How many are not reported?


This Liberal government is so out of touch. It is happier to line the pockets of big business and the big end of town than to give the workers of Australia a fair go. We must do everything we can to fight back, restore these penalty rates and change the rules. For the life of me, I cannot understand why low-paid workers are always in the firing line of this cruel government. How can anyone justify taking money from those who most need it?

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (16:00):  October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Last Saturday, families affected by this terrible disease marked Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. The women and men who live with advanced breast cancer travel a very different journey to those with an early diagnosis and the hope of a cancer-free future. I met a few of these women last week when I spent Pink Lady Day in Victor Harbour with the wonderful members of the Fleurieu Cancer Foundation's Breast of Friends group. Their stories are heartbreaking, but the support they give each other is truly inspirational. Magic happens when women put their arms around each other. Sharon has been living with breast cancer for decades, and spoke of how a chance meeting in a cafe and a hug from a friend brought her back to the Breast of Friends group just a few years ago.


Unfortunately, this year breast cancer has overtaken prostate cancer as the most diagnosed cancer in Australia, with more than 18,000 Australian women diagnosed every year. It is a sad statistic to reflect on. While it's encouraging that incidences of prostate cancer have declined in recent years, I look forward to a time when advances in medical care lead to significant declines in all cancers, and particularly breast cancer. We need a cure for breast cancer, and I commend all women and men for their courage going through that journey.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (16:47):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) 20 October is World Osteoporosis Day and aims to increase awareness of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis;


(b) osteoporosis is a fragile bone disease that causes painful and debilitating fractures, particularly of the hip and spine;


(c) every year in Australia around 165,000 fractures occur, many of which could have been prevented with earlier diagnosis and treatment; and


(d) 4.7 million Australians over 50 have poor bone health;


(2) acknowledges that the cost of fractures associated with osteoporosis nationally amounted to $2.1 billion in 2017; and


(3) recognises that:


(a) early action can be taken through regular exercise, a bone-healthy diet and consultation with a doctor about osteoporosis risk factors;


(b) diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis can halve the risk of fracture; and


(c) effective preventative treatments include regular exercise, a bone healthy diet and consultation with doctors about risk factors.


Today I'd like to recognise that this Saturday, 20 October is World Osteoporosis Day. It is a disease that makes bones become brittle, leading to higher risk of fractures. For the individual, it of course can cause pain, decreased mobility and loss of independence, particularly in those over the age of 65. Every year around 165,000 fractures occur, often from just a minor bump or a fall. That is around one bone broken every three minutes. The cost of fractures to the health system is over $2 billion. As many as 4.7 million Australians, or 66 per cent of Australians, over the age of 50 have poor bone health.


But there does remain hope. Many people don't know that effective treatments are available and can halve the risk of fracture. The fracture risk, particularly for hip fractures for older Australians, is quite alarming. Indeed, when it comes to mortality and morbidity from hip fractures, five per cent of those over 65 who get a hip fracture never leave the hospital; 10 per cent go straight to a residential aged-care facility; 50 per cent have a mobility disability within a year; and, sadly, 15 to 20 per cent die within a year because of the complications post-hip-fracture.


This is a really serious issue when it comes to older Australians, and we must do everything we can to make sure that older Australians, in particular, understand that you need to take good care of your bone health early. Indeed, early detection is vital to ensure that bone health is managed to prevent these fractures. You can take action to maintain and improve your bone health at every stage of your life. The earlier you start, the better. A calcium-rich diet, adequate vitamin D levels and regular exercise are all very important for that bone health. When diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are also medications that can help you manage it and improve your bone health or stop the decline in bone health. Labor had a proud history when last in government of dealing with those diagnosed with osteoporosis and of trying to prevent the diagnosis of osteoporosis in people by advocating healthy physical activity.


There is always more that needs to be done. We know that as many as 80 per cent of patients fail to receive appropriate treatment post-fracture. There are some places in Australia, particularly in some large hospitals, where there is a fracture liaison service run by the state government. These are remarkable facilities. They do a quick quiz of people who have had a fracture to see whether they are at risk of osteoporosis. If they are, they send them off for a bone density scan so that osteoporosis can be detected much earlier and they can receive appropriate treatment if they do have the early signs of osteoporosis.


It is critical as we go into World Osteoporosis Day that we advocate on behalf of older Australians, in particular, to look at their bone health and self-assess. There is a web site, knowyourbones.org.au, which has a five- to 10-minute quiz that people can do to see whether they are at risk of osteoporosis. If they are at risk, they can go to their GP and get appropriate referrals to get treatment and/or further diagnostics to see whether they are at risk of osteoporosis. It is really, really important that this is highlighted in the lead up to World Osteoporosis Day because, as I said, it costs the health system billions of dollars, but also for older Australians who are getting spine and hip fractures it is a huge cost to their physical health and to their families and loved ones in trying to provide the additional support.


I have my own story of my grandma, who fractured her hip in her 90s. I had to go and fight the hospital for her to have a hip replacement. I think she was 91 or 92 at the time. I remember them saying to me, 'She's unlikely to survive this,' and all the difficulties around that. I'm proud to say that my nan was one of the best rehabilitation patients in their 90s that that hospital had ever seen. She went on to live to 98, but it did put her into a residential aged-care facility some months post that hip fracture. So I know from my own family's experience just how difficult this can be, and then having to access all of the systems and supports of aged-care services, such as the ACAT teams. It would be much better if we dealt with the incidence of osteoporosis much earlier in our lives. I've done the Know Your Bones quiz, and I need to go and get a bone density scan. I'll absolutely be doing that, and I recommend that many people do it also.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-10-15,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:52):  I second the motion. Osteoporosis is a growing issue for many Australians. Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and fragile, so that they break easily. This can happen as a result of a minor fall, bump, sneeze or sudden movement. Fractures caused by osteoporosis can be life threatening and they are a major cause of pain and long-term disability. Fractures due to osteoporosis have a devastating impact on millions of people worldwide and result in enormous socioeconomic costs to society and healthcare systems. Worldwide, one in three women and one in five men aged 50 years and over will suffer an osteoporotic fracture. Every year in Australia around 165,000 fractures occur, many of which could have been prevented with earlier diagnosis and treatment.


But the problem is far greater for the population than those who have experienced a fracture. More than 4.7 million Australians over 50 years of age have poor bone health. In 2012, Osteoporosis Australia released individual state reports identifying the burden that osteoporosis and fractures will have and are projected to have from 2012 to 2022. The statistics for Queensland are incredibly concerning. The facts for poor bone health in Queensland between 2012 and 2022 are that by 2022 it is estimated there will be 1.27 million older Queenslanders with low bone mass, an increase of 39 per cent from 2012. Millions of adults in Queensland aged 50 years and older—66 per cent, in fact—had osteoporosis or osteopenia, poor bone health, in 2017. In Queensland, 910,000 adults aged 50 years and older, or 66 per cent, had osteoporosis or osteopenia in 2012. Among Queenslanders aged 50 years and older, 14 per cent had osteoporosis and 52 per cent had osteopenia. Among Queenslanders aged 70 years and older, 43 per cent of women and 13 per cent of men had osteoporosis—that is, 92,000 women and 23,000 men.


The fracture impact in Queensland from 2012 to 2022 results in the total number of fractures over the 10-year period—2013 to 2022—to be projected at 329,071. In 2022, it is expected that there will be a 46 per cent increase in the annual number of fractures over 10 years, resulting in 38,800 fractures per annum. In 2022, there will be 106 fractures every day amongst older Australians in Queensland. Approximately one in six of these fractures will be a hip fracture. In 2017, there were 88 fractures each day among older adults in Queensland. This is a serious cost that needs to be a concern for governments because between 2012 and 2022 the total direct cost of fractures over the 10 years—2013 to 2022—will be $4.3 billion. These costs include ambulance services, hospitalisations, emergency and outpatient departments, rehabilitation, limited aged care and community services.


In 2017, the total direct cost of osteoporosis and osteopenia in Queensland adults aged over 50 years was more than $611 million, of which $414 million—68 per cent—relates to the treatment of fractures. In 2012, the total direct cost of osteoporosis and osteopenia in Queensland adults aged 50 years and over was $495 million, of which $335 million—68 per cent—relates to the treatment of fractures. Nationally last year, the cost of fractures associated with osteoporosis amounted to $2.1 billion. This clearly identifies the fact that the projections for 2022 are well and truly on track.


But early action can be taken through regular exercise, a bone-healthy diet and consultation with a doctor about osteoporosis risk factors, with diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis halving the fracture risk. On 20 October, it will be World Osteoporosis Day. I urge people in the Herbert electorate to take at least one preventative measure—that is, exercise, see your doctor, drink a glass of milk—and together let's work to prevent osteoporosis.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (16:57):  I thank those opposite for the opportunity to provide a brief contribution to this motion. Certainly World Osteoporosis Day is an important recognition of those challenges inside this part of the health sector. The reason that I've jumped to my feet is, quite simply, my wife is a radiographer; this is an area in which she works regularly—in fact, every single week. I do want to recognise the work of those people, both the radiographers and the radiologists, who are working in the radiology practices. As I'm sure some of my colleagues know, it can be a challenging environment to work in.


But I do want to relate one very brief story, and that's about the toughness of our people. Bone-D scans are things that do happen regularly, every single day, on a full list. But I've got to say that typically they tend to be hardy older women. The story I want to relate—clearly I can't break any confidences—is about a lady who came in for a bone-D scan and who was then promptly sent off for an X-ray, because she'd been in a fair bit of pain and was feeling uncomfortable. When my wife completed the X-ray, she found this lady had a broken hip; it was completely snapped off. She said to the patient, 'Are you in any pain?' The answer to that was, 'It's a bit uncomfortable, love.' So I just want to reflect on the resilience of the Australian people. It is important to keep your diet right, to do what you need to, to take the advice of your doctor. Particularly given that I have probably the highest number of people on the age pension of any electorate in Australia—I have some 45,000 people on a concession card for the age pension—my electorate is a place where this is something that happens regularly.


So I just want to say thanks to those opposite for giving me an opportunity to make a brief contribution. It is an important matter that we are discussing, and I would urge all of those in my electorate to do what you need to do, take the advice of your medical practitioner. I also want to give a shout-out to all who are in there, doing this work—I can't use their full names obviously, for reasons that everyone here knows—including Alison, Nat and Tracey, who do a lot of the bone-D work in those local facilities.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (16:59):  I'm delighted to speak on the motion moved by the member for Franklin, who, as the shadow spokesperson on aged care, is very well aware of the major issues we have with osteoporosis as our population ages. I'm delighted to speak on this before 20 October, World Osteoporosis Day. 


Osteoporosis, as anyone who's worked in any of our busy hospital emergency departments would know, is a very important medical problem that is faced day in, day out by our hardworking nursing and medical practitioners. I've certainly worked in a number of emergency departments and seen many people—the lady who presents with the Colles' fracture of the wrist; usually a lady but sometimes an older man, presenting with a shortened, externally rotated leg due to a fractured neck of femur, requiring hip replacement. We know that, as our population ages, this is likely to become an increasing problem. Unfortunately, it's a cost of billions of dollars every year to our medical system. It is also a cause of significant morbidity and, unfortunately, significant mortality. 


We know there are risk factors. We know that post-menopausal women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis than the general population. We know those who are sick, those who have a poor diet and those who are sedentary—and especially those who are immobile—are at particular risk of osteoporosis and the fractures that can occur. In the paediatric age group, children who are extremely premature and children who suffer from conditions leading to poor mobility are also at risk of osteoporosis. However, we know that most of us, from about the age of 35, lose bone density. Unfortunately, sometimes the first time that we become aware of pathological osteoporosis is when a fracture occurs. This fracture can often occur following very minimal trauma and is a cause of significant pain and significant debility. Unfortunately, in some older people, it can be a leading factor in their ultimate demise. 


We know that our medical, nursing and allied health practitioners can provide world's best practice in the treatment of osteoporosis and in the fractures that are due to it—particularly hip fractures, which in years gone by would ultimately lead to a person becoming bedridden and dying from their fracture. We now know, with best practice—an operation within 24 hours of fracture and early mobilisation—that survival rates and, indeed, mobility are really excellent. 


Unfortunately, however, as I've said, for many people who present with hip fractures it's the first idea they have that they may have osteoporosis. However, it is important to note that treatment is available. Treatment depends on awareness, early diagnosis and attention to bone health. That's why recognition of World Osteoporosis Day on 20 October is so very important. We know that things like improving our diet, improving sun exposure, improving exercise, early diagnosis and the use of some of the newer treatments, including drugs called bisphosphonates, lead to remarkable improvements in bone health and reduction in fractures. We know that with attention to all of these, fracture rates can be halved and morbidity and mortality can be markedly reduced. I encourage every one of us, particularly in this place, to be aware of our bone health and make sure our practice ensures we do have good bone health. That means diet; sun exposure, which is very hard to get in this place; and good, healthy exercise. 


I really am very pleased to speak on this motion. All my colleagues are very well aware of the difficulties when osteoporosis occurs, and we are also increasingly aware of how treatment, early diagnosis and recognition can make remarkable differences to people's lives. I thank you for the opportunity to speak to this motion. I recommend bone health for everyone.
