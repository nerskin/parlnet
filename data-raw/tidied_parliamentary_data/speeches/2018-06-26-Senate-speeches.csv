"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (12:01):  As I was saying last night, the government is increasing transparency for students around admission requirements and course cut-offs. We are working to give students better information about their choices. We are funding rural and regional hubs and regional scholarships, and we're having Universities Australia and Professions Australia work together to improve arrangements for student work placements. We are not increasing student fees. We do, however, think that we should hold universities to account for student outcomes, given the significant taxpayer funds they receive—something Labor also opposes. We also think that universities, like non-university providers, should not be able to charge students whatever they like because taxpayers and students will pick up the tab irrespective of how inefficient they are. Providers need to think of the product and the service they are providing students for the significant taxpayer investment they receive.


The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 will set a new schedule of repayment thresholds for HELP from 1 July 2018 with a lower minimum repayment threshold of $45,000 at a one per cent repayment rate—up from $42,000 proposed in last year's budget—and with smaller incremental rises in thresholds and repayment rates, up to a top threshold of $131,989, at which 10 per cent of income is repayable. It will align the indexation of the repayment thresholds to the consumer price index. From 1 July 2019, it will bring repayment thresholds for the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, managed by the Social Services portfolio, into line with HELP repayment thresholds and make corresponding changes to the order of repayment of student loans. It will also introduce a refreshable, new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP to cover their tuition fees. The combined limit is $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses and $104,440 for other students. We heard and read in the media today about the importance of that, given that some 'serial students', as I think the minister has categorised them, have racked up debts large enough to pay for an apartment, let alone higher education. While the loan limit is not new, it will now apply to Commonwealth supported students borrowing through HECS-HELP as well as fee-paying students accessing FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and the VET Student Loans scheme.


HELP lending has grown rapidly, with the expansion of the demand driven system. The amount accessed for HELP loans has increased from just $3 billion in 2009 to $7 billion in 2016. The Turnbull government shut down Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP loan scheme at the end of 2016 and replaced it with the VET Student Loans scheme. This is a much more tightly controlled scheme with caps on tuition accounts and extensive safeguards against reporting by unethical providers. The fiscal challenge for the government is that HELP repayments have not kept pace with HELP lending growth. From 2010-11 to 2016-17, the level of new debt not expected to be repaid increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. It is no longer possible to ignore the long-term burden of this debt on the taxpayer.


Schedule 1 of the bill proposes a new set of repayment thresholds commencing from 1 July this year. There is a new minimum repayment income of $45,000 at which one per cent of income is repayable, amounting to around $8.65 per week. The second threshold is $51,957 with a two per cent repayment rate, which would otherwise be the first threshold rate on 1 July this year. Each progressive threshold increases by six per cent income amounts and by half a per cent increments in repayment rates, which smooths the repayment obligations. Importantly, this new schedule of thresholds will also reduce incentive for debtors to 'cluster' below thresholds to avoid repayments as they do now. This came out very clearly in the Senate inquiry. There are increased repayment rates for those earning the highest incomes, who are best placed to repay their debts sooner, with those earning $131,989 or more paying at 10 per cent of their income, as I said earlier. 


From 2019–20, the revised HELP thresholds will also apply to SFSS debts under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Assistance Act 1973. Currently, these debts are repaid concurrently with HELP debts but according to a subset of just three thresholds. To improve rates of repayment of SFSS debts, and to achieve consistency in debt administration, the current three-tier threshold approach applied to SFSS repayments will be replaced with the full range of HELP thresholds. There will be a transitional year in 2018-19 that maintains the three-tier threshold arrangement, while systems changes are implemented, and to allow these debtors additional time for transition.


Schedule 1 of the bill also implements new indexation arrangements for the HELP repayment thresholds, which are currently indexed according to average weekly earnings. For a number of years now, the HELP repayment thresholds have been rising relative to earnings. The higher growth in AWE, average weekly earnings, has meant that people have dropped from a higher repayment threshold to a lower one, or have dropped out of the repayment stream altogether as the thresholds rise faster than their income growth. This bill provides that the minimum and all subsequent thresholds will instead be indexed to the consumer price index. This will ensure repayment requirements are adjusted in line with the cost of living. It also streamlines indexation factors used throughout the Higher Education Support Act 2003, as all amounts will be indexed in the same way.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the order of repayment of student loan debts by loan type. Currently, student debts under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Assistance Act 1973 are repaid concurrently with HELP debts. I realise I have repeated myself there, so please excuse me.


Schedule 3 of the bill provides for the expansion of the loan limit to all HELP loans for which students can defer their tuition fees but makes it replenishable. The Senate committee inquiry which I chaired received evidence that a replenishable loans cap was preferable to a lifetime limit, and that was the recommendation to the government from the majority report of the committee. I'm pleased that the government has accepted that amendment, which it introduced in the House of Representatives and which was subsequently passed.


The new $150,000 loan limit for students undertaking medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses, as defined in the act, is an increase on the estimated current FEE-HELP limit of $130,552 for 2019. Students in these courses who had previously reached their FEE-HELP limit will, from 2019, have access to additional funds up to the new $150,000 limit. Apart from annual indexation increases, the loan limit applying to students in other courses remains the same, with a base amount of $104,440 in 2019. The caps will be increased in 2019, but new replenishable combined loans caps arrangements will not start until 2020.


The measures in this bill are fair. They are modest but, over the longer term, they will ensure that the world-class income-contingent loans program remains sustainable for future generations of students and taxpayers. We have a system that is the envy of the world, and Professor Bruce Chapman is a man in demand around the globe as others seek to emulate the system that we have. Australian government funding is now at record levels, and it is important that we continue to ensure that Australians from all walks of life, irrespective of their background or financial means, can continue to access high-quality tertiary education if they have the aptitude and the application to succeed. That's why I, like my colleagues across the government, want to ensure we keep these opportunities open to future generations.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (12:17):  In making a contribution to the debate on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 I want to welcome the government's attention to the importance of reform in the higher education sector. I understand that this bill goes some way to reforming the HECS and FEE-HELP schemes, but there is a broader discussion and debate that we need to have in this place about the benefits of university education for a number of students. I recognise also that we've had the vocational education and training scheme, and there have been some significant reforms in that nature.


Our university system has become almost effectively a degree mill. That concerns me because there are many students who have the expectation placed upon them by society, their schools, their parents or themselves to get a degree from a university which doesn't equip them with a financially valuable skill when they graduate, some years down the track, indoctrinated in some respects by the university ethos and kudos, but they have a higher education scheme bill and are left pursuing rather menial tasks that are completely outside their training and education. That benefits no-one. The government, the public assume, by virtue of the fact that they fund it, will be accruing tens of billions of dollars worth of higher education debt, but much of it won't be repaid. As much as 25 per cent in some instances won't be repaid. We're talking about a significant amount of money—$15 billion, $16 billion or $20 billion over the next 10 years will never be repaid.


So I congratulate the government on their attempts at redressing some of the imbalances in the scheme, because, if you don't recognise that there's a problem and you don't try and fix it, you're never going to have a hope of improving the current situation. University education is not servicing all our students and our younger people as effectively as it should. Postgraduate outcomes are critically important. Meaningful reforms in this sector should incorporate a report and a very frank disclosure about how many graduates from a particular university, in a particular discipline, have obtained jobs within a certain time frame of graduating from that institution. It would produce some accountability. It would mean that universities don't just pick the cheapest degree to provide—let's say it's a law degree, for argument's sake—and graduate hundreds of students who all expect a glittering legal career and are unable to find work in that sector. That is but one example. We have numerous other examples in the sociology and social studies space. They have very little prospect of gaining meaningful employment outside of a tiny little cabal, which is not really adding to the productive nature of our society. 


These things may be contentious. I don't think they are. I think many parents recognise it as common sense, and I know that many graduates lament the fact they have incurred a rather large and substantial debt and yet have no real meaningful employment prospects enhanced as a result of it. 


There's also another gratuitous imbalance in the system, which I will be moving an amendment seeking to reform. That applies to the four private universities in this country: Bond University in Queensland, Torrens University in South Australia, Notre Dame University in Western Australia and New South Wales, and the University of Divinity, which is based in Melbourne. These four privately funded institutions not only don't benefit from taxpayer subsidies for each enrolment; the students who choose to go to these institutions are penalised for doing so. They're penalised with no real justification. The penalties are quite significant. Effectively, what it means is that, if they are accessing HELP fees to the tune of say $60,000 in order to get their educational qualification, the government slugs them with a 25 per cent loading on those fees simply because they've chosen not to pursue a publicly funded university place. 


I understand this was introduced in around 2006 by the Howard government. In going back to understand why, I found very little rationale or explanation other than it was the vibe at the time that this should take place. Since then, I've had conversations with a number of individuals about it, and the rationale has moved down the path to, 'These are going to be accumulating higher HECS debts for individuals that are attending them'—HECS is my terminology; it's HELP and HECS now—'by virtue of the fact they're more expensive to go to, so the government will be financing a larger loan, so there should be a penalty.' This is a nonsensical argument, because it doesn't take into account the subsidies that go into universities already. It doesn't account for the fact that, for example, in Bond University a student can get through their degree in two years because they have an accelerated program that the student, who has learnt a financially valuable skill—I note in yesterday's Australian Financial Review that the private universities had higher satisfaction and better outcomes for job placement than most others—they will get into the workforce at an earlier stage and they will begin to be able to repay their debt at a later stage. 


As for the concept that the fees, and hence the borrowings, attached to private institutions are somewhat higher, yes, the fees are higher, because there are no subsidies taking place there. There's not a $20,000- or $30,000-per-student subsidy that has been injected into the university to maintain the sandstone. These are privately funded institutions. 


The government, might I also say, charges the interest rate that it determines applies to all student loans, irrespective of the amount. We know from media reports as well that there are students out there who have obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars in HECS debt and HELP debt by becoming perpetual students, and that, I'm sure, doesn't pass the commonsense test. What does pass the commonsense test, though, is for the government to effectively introduce a cap on HECS and slash outstanding HECS and HELP debt of, I think, $104,000, which is in this bill. It also entirely negates the justification for this loading on private universities. The loading on private university students was justified, as I said, because the fees they were going to be accumulating would be higher. Well, in the end, the only amount of borrowing that a student can undertake at any single time, with one or two exemptions—we understand that—is around $104,000. Whether you pay $60,000, $80,000 or $90,000 for your degree, or whether you do two degrees, whatever it is, the most you can get is $104,000 outside of the medical sciences. I have no dramas about a loading, perhaps, for private institutions in medical sciences. I don't think it should exist, but, if a degree at Bond University in medicine could cost upwards of $500,000, one has to question whether the taxpayer should be on the hook for that. That is a decision to be made. But the principle is the same. By capping the fees, you undermine the very argument for a 25 per cent loading. 


In the interests of full disclosure, my son is a scholar at Bond University. This contribution to the debate is not driven by self-interest at all, apart from the fact that I pay his fees there. He's not using HELP or accessing HECS because we're very fortunate that there's no need for him to. But it was his enrolment there, the engagement with it and the discussions I had with him about this that marked the inequity of the system.


There is an attractiveness about the private university system for many students. I've talked about the accelerated education so you can actually do a degree in two years. You do three semesters per year, you have minimal breaks between them and there are three 14-week semesters rather than two 14-week semesters or thereabouts. I'm decidedly impressed with the commercial nature of it. They explore a great many things, but everything is oriented towards practical, real-world skills in the area in which they will graduate. If that is in law, they're practising their mooting skills, discussing real-life cases or assisting in particular areas. Everything I've learned from my son's explanations to me demonstrates that there is a truly valuable skill that is coming down the pipeline, rather than just theoretical knowledge—which has its place in higher education, in research and academia, but that's not what he was seeking from a university degree. 


I understand it's the same at Torrens University. This is not an ideological bent. For those on the other side of the chamber who don't share my conservative leanings or perhaps my sense of fiscal responsibility, I make the point that Torrens University in South Australia is part of a global network of universities which, I think, was launched and certainly celebrated by no less a left-winger, if I can put it like that, than Bill Clinton. 


Private universities have their place. They are just another option for children and students in our country to make a decision about, and I don't think they should be penalised by government simply for opting into a system that is not state sanctioned or state run. I've been on the record many times as saying that I think the university system is becoming a bit more of a closed shop, where freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of ideas and the battle of ideas are no longer as relevant as they once were. It seems that few are willing to defend in this space what we have always tolerated or accepted. They're just students. They have differing views. But now we see students who were campaigning for the 'no' campaign being attacked and vilified simply for having that view. We have seen pro-life organisations on campus. We have seen pro-conservative organisations on campus. We've seen people penalised—and I just spoke about it in my podcast today—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  A podcast?




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, Senator Hanson-Young. You can tune in actually.



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, you can. You can go to iTunes—I'll just make that point—and look for the Weekly Dose of Common Sense. It's entirely free and commercial free. The Greens do cop a bagging on it every single week. Senator McKim features a lot. Senator Hanson-Young, of course, is very unpopular with my listeners, so we mention her quite a lot. But I digress.


We have a circumstance where places like Curtin University—it was reported to me today—are penalising students for using gender-specific pronouns. They're not bringing those sorts of things in. It is like an indoctrination of children. I think parents and all students need to be able to have a choice about where they want to go in that respect.


In the end, I welcome the opportunity that every Australian has to enter into a competitive decision with respect to the university that they choose to attend. I also welcome the fact that they may choose not to attend university. But what I will be proposing—and I will be moving this amendment in the committee stage and I will look for the support of the chamber—is to remove that impediment, that barrier, that tariff, if you like, for those children who do choose to attend a private institution who then seek to avail themselves of what many in this place celebrate as the opportunity that should be provided to every student, and that is accessing funds in order to finance their degree in an advantageous manner. We've accepted, rightly or wrongly, that a very low-interest rate loan, effectively a market-neutral loan, repaid out of future earnings is the way forward and is an equitable measure for people to finance their tertiary education and studies. Applying a 25 per cent loading on top of that, plus the interest, I do not think is in anyone's best interest.


More specifically about this bill, I do agree that lowering the threshold at which repayments are meant to be made is very important. If it were left to me, I would suggest that one per cent of income is probably not enough. I would prefer, of course, to lower taxes across the board for everyone and then expect people to make a higher repayment schedule as they get into the earnings market. I make the point that, in New Zealand, about 10 per cent of income is quarantined to pay for university education, from the very first dollar earned or thereabouts. It's much the same in many other places around the world. We are not reinventing the wheel here. I'm just trying to make it fairer and more reasonable and balanced, mindful of the new university environment that is springing up around the country. I think competition in this space and options for people are very important, and government should facilitate that freedom of choice, without imposing an arbitrary penalty on people, which has, from my research, very little justification for being.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (12:34):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. Labor opposes this bill. It's an unfair piece of legislation. This MYEFO package of cuts is the government's fourth attempt since coming to office to cut universities and make students pay more. At last year's budget, they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now they're proposing a new rate of $45,000. It's still too low.


Labor believe the current repayment rate is about right. We don't want to make students repay their debts when they are starting a career, saving for a house or trying to start a family. We know that higher student debt is a genuine barrier to study for low-SES and disadvantaged students. We should be doing all we can to increase participation in higher education and not making it harder. Experts warn that, if Australia does not boost participation in postsecondary education, we risk being left behind the rest of the world. Indeed, Universities Australia Chief Executive, Belinda Robinson, said:


Universities will be moving resources around, they'll be looking at other programs they can perhaps close down, campuses they can close … anything they can do to hold on for 12 months. There will be adverse consequences.


In a time of significant economic transition, we should be investing in our people and not making it harder to get a university qualification. It's pretty clear that the government has only ever had one plan for higher education: cut and make students pay more. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution in the OECD to the cost of their degrees, but the Liberals can't help themselves. They have consistently tried to make students pay more. Why? All to pay for their $80 billion tax cut. They've even given themselves a $7,000 tax cut. We've seen it in schools: a $17 billion cut. We've seen it with vocational education and training: nearly $3 billion cut. And more than 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships have been lost since the Liberals came to office. Again, we've seen it with the universities: a $2.2 billion cut.


I'd like to take this opportunity to share a story about the harsh reality of the impacts of these cuts. One of my constituents left the Territory to move to Canberra to study at the Australian National University. This is just one example of many. This student held an undergraduate degree and was looking to study Indonesian through ANU's then Diploma of Languages program. Having spent Christmas with their friends and family in Darwin, the student moved their entire life to the ACT to pursue this course. Upon realising the impacts of the MYEFO cuts, ANU sent the following email to aspiring language students:


Dear Student, I refer to your application for the Diploma of Languages. I regret to advise you that the Diploma of Languages will no longer be available for commencement in 2018 and your application has been withdrawn. This is owing to a recent notification, in December 2017, from the Commonwealth that there will no longer be any Commonwealth Supported Places available for the Diploma of Languages at ANU. You may want to consider studying language courses at the ANU on a Non-award basis or look at what other options are available to you through Open Universities Australia.


In other words, if you've got enough money to fund your language diploma yourself, then, they'd be happy to take them on. Understandably, the student was devastated. After they had moved their entire life from the Territory to the south, a move which came at a massive personal and financial cost, the government has basically said, 'You moved your whole life to pursue your dreams, but, because we're going back on our word, here's an online alternative.' This action by the Turnbull government is completely unacceptable. It is unjust and unfair.


This brings me to my next point. These cuts to universities damage the future prosperity of our nation as a whole. Cuts to courses like language diplomas restrict our ability to establish business and career opportunities for our students. They restrict our nation's ability to grow and they diminish our influence in our region. Indonesia is Australia's ninth-largest trading partner. Restricting the next generation's ability to communicate with one of our largest trading partners is simply baffling. The Northern Territory stands to be one of the hardest hit by the Turnbull government's cuts to universities. Indeed, CDU vice-chancellor Simon Maddocks has said that small, young universities such as CDU would be disproportionately affected by the freeze, as they lacked budgets big enough to absorb the cut to revenue. Only last week, Professor Maddocks was quoted in NT News as saying:


'If revenue is going down and costs going up, you can't just keep doing what you're doing … 


We will inevitably have to review our capacity to sustain everything we've been doing because you can't keep paying out more and not get the revenue in.'


The university was 'only just financially viable' now, he said.


'We all understand the Government has savings to find but education is a significant pillar to the future of the country. High-performing countries invest in quality education systems …


I agree wholeheartedly. If we are to continue to develop, build and grow as a nation, we must ensure that higher education is affordable and accessible no matter where you live in this country.


If we look at the data from this government's much-bungled census, it's obvious that cuts to universities will only restrict—certainly in the Northern Territory—people's ability to further their careers and improve their quality of life. The 2016 census revealed that only 17.1 per cent of Territorians have a bachelor degree or higher. Compare that with the national average of 22 per cent. That statistic should be an indication that the Territory needs more investment in higher education, not less. These funding cuts have left the people of the Northern Territory in a dire situation.


When Labor first uncapped places, there were 484 more university places for students in the seat of Lingiari. That was for 2008 to 2016. Under Labor's new policy we'll see around 400 more students in Lingiari on their way to university. When Labor first uncapped places in the seat of Solomon, which covers Darwin and much of Palmerston, there were 649 more places for students at university for 2008 to 2016. That's a total of 3,207 students in the Northern Territory over eight years. Now, compare that to the Liberals 2,140 projected number of students under their unfair cuts to university placements between the years of 2020 and 2032—no growth there; no future there.


Labor delivers real reform to higher education in this country. Under Labor's new policy, we'll see around 831 more students in Solomon on their way to university. Certainly, when we were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. We opened the door to university to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to go to university. But under this government, with this latest round of cuts, that door is being slammed tightly shut.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:43):  I rise today to speak against the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. First, let's look at what this bill does. It amends the Higher Education Support Act to provide a new minimum repayment income of $44,999. In plain English what that means is that, where previously we had a threshold of somewhere around $53,000, the threshold for repaying a HECS debt has been dropped by close to $8,000. But what does it mean in the real world? It means that when a university graduate is earning about 700 bucks a week, taking that home, they're going to be expected to start paying back their HECS debt. Previously, they started paying back their HECS debt once they were earning more than 700 bucks a week. Now the threshold has been dropped. Let's try and translate what that means for people in the real world. If you're a young person taking home about $700 a week, let's face it, it's not a goldmine. Once you've paid your rent and energy bills, and paid for your groceries, shopping needs and transport needs, there's very little left to spend on anything else. 


Put that in the context of what else this government is doing. We were here last week. This is a government that gave a whopping great big tax cut to people earning over $200,000. If you're earning $200,000 or more, you get an extra $11,000 in your back pocket. Someone on $200,000, $300,000, $500,000, $1 million or $2 million gets an extra $11,000 in their pocket. Yet the government is saying to a young person who has just graduated from university, 'We're going to make life harder for you. We're going to make life harder for people on Newstart. We're going to condemn you to a life of poverty. Indeed, we're going to make it worse than that. We're going to come after you. We're going to allege that you have debts you haven't repaid and in many instances we're going to make your life miserable.' Look at what they're doing in health care, with increasing out-of-pocket costs and the freeze on Medicare. 'We're going to make life harder for people with chronic illnesses. But we're going to make life easier for people who are already earning many hundreds of thousands of dollars.' 


It is a reflection of the priorities of this government. It is no secret that young people are getting royally screwed over by this older generation of LNP politicians. This bill is just one of many examples of a government that is intent on making life harder for young people. Just have a look at the last budget. What did we see in the area of housing, which is one of the great areas of intergenerational inequity that's emerged in our country? We saw nothing. What did we see in terms of addressing insecure work for young people? Again, nothing. Did we see a rise in the youth allowance? No. What did we see to make child care more affordable for young parents? Again, nothing. When it comes to climate change, 'the great moral challenge' of our time, as it was once described by a former prime minister, it was not even mentioned in the recent budget. There is nothing to stop the extinction crisis, or the crisis on the Murray River or the Great Barrier Reef. 


This government is presiding over one of the greatest acts of intergenerational theft ever seen in an Australian parliament. Look at what happens to that young person who's now being to forced to repay their HECS debt when they're earning less than they were previously. They're expected to save for their first home. But of course we know that housing prices have increased exponentially over recent years. We know that many young people are locked out of the property market because of skyrocketing property prices, all because they're competing against not people buying their first home but investors buying their third, fourth or fifth home. That's who they're competing against. So is it any wonder that as a young person in this country you would be looking right now at members of the Liberal and National parties and saying to them, 'You had it pretty good and you're making life tough for us.' This is a rigged system that young people are entering into now, where investors who are buying multiple properties get huge tax breaks, yet somebody who's aspiring to buy their first home gets almost nothing. 


It is time we started to do something about the young people who are going to inherit many of the consequences of decisions made by this parliament. We're seeing a generation of politicians who enjoyed free education, free health care and affordable housing, who were able to pollute the planet for free with no consequences, now saying to young people in this country, 'We had it pretty good, but we're pulling the drawbridge up behind us and you need to clean it up. You need to fix up the mess that we've created.' Right now they're not only asking young people to pay for something they never had to pay for but also condemning young people to a life of struggle because of the decisions that are being made in this parliament. 


We have some very important choices to make. We can recognise that investing in our young people, in the education of the generations that come after us, is an investment in our own country, an investment in the foundations of a decent society and an investment in the prosperity of current and future Australians—the teachers of tomorrow, the nurses of tomorrow, the doctors of tomorrow, the engineers of tomorrow. We can choose to make their life harder or what we can recognise is that we all benefit when we have a well-funded tertiary education sector. We can recognise that those young people who come after us shouldn't be condemned to a life that is made more difficult than the life that we enjoyed. Indeed, one of the very markers of human progress is to look at our young people and say, 'Your life will be easier than the life that we live right now.' We're reversing that trend in this parliament through these acts of intergenerational theft. Look at the housing market, climate, energy policy and, of course, now this retrograde step when it comes to making life more difficult for people who are pursuing tertiary education.


It's time for governments to end this act of intergenerational theft. It's time for governments to stop acting in the interests of the rich and powerful, of corporate Australia. The government should be dropping its plan for corporate tax cuts. It should recognise that what this parliament did last week, when you look at what it's doing today through these changes to the HECS system, is making Australia a less egalitarian, a more unfair and a less caring society. We are here with a duty to act not just for the interests of people who put us here but also for the interests of those generations that follow. And the passage of this bill is emblematic of a government that cares more about its mates at the big end of town than it does about the generations that will follow us.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:51):  I'm always very happy to see young people go to university, succeed and get ahead in their careers. I'm happy for them personally. The other reason I'm happy is that university graduates and undergraduates form a big part—not an entire part but a big part—of the Young Liberal Movement around Australia and in my home state of Queensland and they do a wonderful job. Indeed, as undergraduates, they've taken a real interest in democracy in many universities in Queensland. It is the YLMP who've actually taken over the student advancement leagues in the university—some call it student politics. They do a wonderful job, and I'm delighted for them that the taxpayers are able to send them to university and then, through Labor's HECS, pay it back, and I think that's only very fair.


I wasn't bright enough to go to university and, in those days, you needed a Commonwealth scholarship. My parents weren't wealthy enough to send me to university, so I started work as an articled clerk, working eight hours a day, and then studied externally through the University of Queensland to get my solicitor's qualifications. Can I remind Senator Di Natale and most of the other senators—I say 'most' because I suspect Senator Sterle and a couple of others, like me, never had the opportunity to go to university—as they rail on about asking students to pay back the taxpayers for their education, that the people who are paying for their education are, in many cases, not people who will ever go to university. There are a lot of young people who, for various reasons, cannot get into university and go into the workforce. They start earning a fairly meagre wage but they start paying tax, so the likes—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. The members on the crossbench, the minor parties and the opposition, you have been heard in silence. Under standing order 197, you will hear Senator Macdonald in silence.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  These young people leave school, go straight into work, get a meagre wage, often not a very good wage, and start paying their tax so the likes of Senator McKim and Senator Di Natale can go to university. I begrudge no doctor whatever they earn. Having recently been through the hospital system, I have the greatest admiration for doctors and nurses. But, if Senator Di Natale were any sort of a doctor, he would have, if he had chosen to, been making a small fortune in that profession—and good on him! But it's only fair to the other Australians who paid their taxes for Senator Di Natale's, Senator McKim's and Senator Watt's educations that they should pay it back under Labor's HECS scheme.


I have a niece who left school and started as an apprentice hairdresser. She happily did that; she didn't want to go to university. She's a very good hairdresser. She did her apprenticeship, again, on very meagre wages, but paying tax so that the likes of Senator McKim could go to university. She paid that tax and now she's become a hairdresser, earning a bit more and paying more tax. I think that when we have these debates it's important to understand that young people are not the only ones at university. In the committee stage I will ask the minister for these statistics, but I would guess that there are more young people leaving school who don't go to university than those who do. These senators rail on about university education. As I said, I'm a great supporter of young people going to university; they do a wonderful job in society. Again, I mention what a great job the YLNP, the Young Liberal National Party in Queensland, do, not just in student politics and not just in contributing their arguments but in helping people like me and the Liberal National Party in Queensland to devise policies that keep young people in mind.


I won't delay the Senate much more on this particular bill, but I do ask senators that when they carry on, as we hear Senator Di Natale carrying on, to remember that there are many young Australians who do not have the opportunity they had of going to university. They've paid their taxes, happily, and they would happily pay for the likes of Senator McKim and Senator Di Natale to go to university. But we have to bear in mind the contribution they make, and the fairness, I might say, of Labor's Higher Education Contribution Scheme of a decade or so ago. I think that's fair. I do ask that when senators are debating higher education they keep in mind that there are many young people, who, for various reasons, never have the opportunity of participating in higher education.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (12:58):  It's always a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald in a debate. I'm sure that I'm not the only member of this chamber, or the outside world, who has noticed that every single speech he gives at the moment is directed at the Young LNP. I wonder if that could be because of his preselection being up for debate right now and his dependence on the Young LNP for those votes.


Of course, he spends the rest of his time in this chamber consistently voting for measures that hurt young people, including the bill that we are discussing. But—oh!—will he use this chamber to grovel to the people who will determine his preselection. We can only assume that other Queensland LNP senators are worried about him and are giving him every opportunity to stay in this chamber so that he can be the first senator in this chamber to reach the age of 80 for some period of time. From my point of view, long may his reign he continue, because every time he gets on his feet I can hear the Labor primary vote going up! So I very much welcome Senator Macdonald's participations in these debates.


On a more serious note, I do rise, as other Labor speakers have done, to oppose this Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, which is just the latest attempt by this LNP government to again hurt the interests of young people. What this bill is about, more than anything, is putting more and more of the cost of university education onto young people, or onto those who undertake higher education, and forcing them to pay it back at a much earlier stage.


If there was a key point to Senator Macdonald's speech—other than, 'Please Young LNP, vote for me in the forthcoming preselection'—it was that we shouldn't be asking people who don't have the opportunity to go through university to shoulder the burden of paying for that university. I'm disappointed to hear Senator Macdonald have that attitude. I hope that's not an attitude that is reflected among other speakers on the government side in this debate, because many of us who have had the good fortune to attend university, like me, do not come from families of great privilege but come from families who didn't themselves have the opportunity to attend university straight out of school and did exactly what Senator Macdonald talked about and put themselves through work or night school. 


In some cases they did have an opportunity to attend a university at a later stage of life. But I know many people who haven't had an opportunity to go to university and who do not begrudge for one moment that opportunity being given to other people. In some cases it is their own children, or their nephews and nieces. In some cases it is the opportunity for their spouses to go to university later in life. People who go to university do not begrudge paying a contribution through the taxation system for someone to do an apprenticeship to become a hairdresser, an electrician or a chef, because that is something where a taxpayer gives people an opportunity to get ahead in life. 


If there is a dividing line between Labor senators and those from the Liberal and National parties, on the other side of this chamber, it is whether we believe that we actually are all about an individual or about a greater society and a greater community. We on the Labor side will always argue that we're not only here to advantage individuals' interests; we're also here to advantage the community overall. The higher education system, along with other aspects of our education system—TAFE, training, work experience, all those opportunities—is about giving young people, but also those who need to retrain later in their career, an opportunity to get ahead. 


I'm currently chairing a Senate inquiry looking at the future of work. There is a big debate that is going on in our community, and we are looking at the fact that, as automation comes online, as we get greater technology coming into the workplace, there are going to be more and more people whose jobs are disrupted and, in some cases, eliminated. Without giving away key findings of that report, which is yet to be tabled in this chamber, it is very clear from the evidence we've received that more and more Australians, regardless of their background, are going to need retraining and upskilling to be able to simply get a job or retain a job in the new and emerging world of work that we have. 


Measures like this higher education bill the government is trying to pass not only disadvantage younger people who are looking to undertake university studies straight out of school; they're also going to impact the many people, and the growing number of people, who will need to retrain from their previous occupation simply to have a job into the future. 


So I ask Senator Macdonald and other Liberal senators to just reflect on the fact that, although they might like to come in here and play a bit of class warfare and try to argue that they are on the side of battlers who don't ever have the opportunity to go to university and who shouldn't have to pay for those who do, the fact is that we all have an interest in having a highly educated community, whether it be people educated through universities, TAFEs, apprenticeships or other forms of education and training that people obtain on the job. That is not only in the interests of the individual who is getting that education and training; it is also in the interests of our entire community to make sure that we are preparing people for the new world of work, which is increasingly going to require higher levels of skill and knowledge, and that's not what this bill is doing. What this bill is doing is actually putting more of burden on students to pay for their own education. 


I have never objected to the idea of students making a contribution to their own education. Going back to student politics days, it wasn't always a popular opinion on the left-hand side of politics that students should make some personal contribution to their education, but I truly believe that, where we've got to at the moment—with the fees we're asking students to pay at the early stages of their career and with the requirement to repay those loans that they take out to undertake those studies—is a disincentive for poorer and working-class kids to have the opportunity to go through a university education. 


Senator Macdonald and others might think that they are defending the interests of working-class and poorer people in supporting these kinds of measures, but what they are actually doing is taking university back to the pre-Whitlam days, when it was the preserve of rich kids only. If we're not careful, we're going to discourage kids from poorer and working-class backgrounds from undertaking university studies, even if they get the marks at school that would enable them to do so.


Specifically this bill will make students start repaying their higher education loans once they hit an income level of $45,000, well below average weekly earnings, at the very time when new graduates, if they are younger people, are looking at trying to save up for a house deposit, which we know is becoming harder still as a result of this government's failure to deal with housing affordability. At the very time when younger students are coming out of university, trying to put together a house deposit, trying to pay off other debts that they may have incurred while they were studying, through credit cards and other forms of debt, and while they are looking, in some cases, at starting a family—also an expensive proposition, as all of us who have a family know—at the very time when some of the students are finding it difficult to make ends meet, this government wants to throw another debt at them and start forcing them to repay the loans that they have taken out to undertake university studies.


Let's remember that, by and large, the only students who are taking out loans to undertake higher education are those from lower and middle-income families. If you're fortunate enough to come from a rich family, you've got parents who can pay what used to be known as HECS and now your HELP loans. But it's working-class and middle-class kids who are being faced with the prospect of having to repay their loans at a much earlier stage of their career while they are also trying to save up for other things like a house or a family.


This bill will also impose, for the first time, a lifetime borrowing limit, to constrain students' ability to undertake further study if it's going to be funded by loans. As I say, anyone who pays any attention to the Australian workplace of the present and of the future knows that, in order to get a job and keep a job in the future, Australians are going to need more education, not less. There are so many jobs that haven't required a post-school qualification that are disappearing in our economy as a result of technology, as a result of offshoring and as a result of other changes, including as a result of this government's failure to defend the car industry. We've seen Telstra announce 7,000 job losses over the last week. The banks are shedding thousands of jobs too. What is needed for people who are being made redundant from their existing employers, to ensure that they will get a new job in the future, is more education, not less. But what does this government want to do? It wants to say, 'Sorry; if you want to go and get some more education so that you can get another job, we're not going to continue supporting you in the form of loans.' Why would any government do that? Why would any government put in place active steps that are going to discourage people from undertaking further education and training, when that is exactly what people need to do to be able to compete for jobs in the future?


In essence, this bill is simply a continuation of the trend that we have seen from this government to put more and more of the burden of university education , TAFE education, traineeships and apprenticeships onto students themselves rather than onto all of us, as part of the community. This government has continued to cut general funding to universities as well as putting more pressure on students to pay more.


One of the most concerning aspects of these cuts to universities that we have seen from the government is the impact they are particularly having on regional Australia and regional Australians. Very often I come into this place and highlight the ineptitude of National Party senators and members of parliament, who say that they are the defenders of regional and rural Australians and consistently get done over by their Liberal counterparts, who are very good at putting through measures which help high-income people in big cities around Australia, to the disadvantage of people in rural and regional areas. This is another example. Universities in regional Australia have played a very important role in preparing the local community for higher skilled jobs, which tend to pay more. Also, they are very big employers in their own right in regional Australia. Many of the regional universities across Australia are some of the biggest employers in their towns and their regions, so if we're cutting funding to regional universities, as is happening under this government, what we're actually doing is cutting jobs in universities and making it harder for regional Australians to get the university education that they will need in the future.


We already know that rural and regional Australians have some of the lowest levels of participation in higher education anywhere in the country. We all know that fewer people in regional and rural Australia than in big cities get the opportunity to go to university. Wouldn't a National Party member or a National Party senator who's keen to get behind rural and regional Australia actually want to be fighting for more funding for regional universities and making it easier for regional students to get a university education? That's what they should be doing, but of course that would involve standing up to the Liberal Party, which we know our National Party members and senators are completely incapable of doing.


The cuts that this government is imposing on regional universities are twice as bad as those we're seeing on universities in the big cities. If you tally it up across the country, you find that regional universities are going to be suffering cuts of seven per cent to their funding, on average, while universities in the big cities are only suffering cuts of 3½ per cent. I don't think we should be cutting funding to the universities in the big cities either. I think we have a massive national interest in increasing funding to universities, as we do in increasing funding to TAFEs, for apprenticeships and for traineeships, but this government has the opposite view. It wants to cut back because it's got to find a way to pay for its big-business tax cuts somehow, so it says, 'Let's take money out of universities, traineeships and apprenticeships,' even though in the long term it will do massive harm to our economy, 'and instead shovel it into the pockets of our mates in the banks and big business.'


Of all the universities across the country, the university that is worst hit by the cuts this government is making to university funding is Central Queensland University. Its main campus is in Rockhampton, but it has campuses in Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg and other parts of Central Queensland. In fact, it's been so successful that it's now got many campuses all around the country, particularly attracting international students, who bring more revenue into the university. But, as a reward for its success, what are the government doing? They are cutting its funding by 15 per cent—more than double the amount that regional universities are getting cut overall and, on my maths, four to five times worse than the cuts we're seeing to urban universities.


If you look at who is representing the electorates that Central Queensland University is largely based in—in Central Queensland—you see that, of course, they're all National Party members. You've got George Christensen representing Dawson, Michelle Landry representing Capricornia, Ken O'Dowd representing Flynn and Keith Pitt representing Hinkler. Every single one of them is a National Party member. But have you heard anything from any of them about the cuts their own government is making to the university that is employing hundreds and thousands of people across their communities; and that is giving kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, who have never had a parent go to university, the opportunity to go to university and be the first person in their family to have an opportunity for a university education? Not a peep—because what would that involve? It would involve standing up to the Liberal Party. They never do it on university cuts; they never do it on health cuts; they never do it on school cuts; they never do it on apprenticeship cuts; and they never do it on cuts to big-business taxes, which are not going to benefit Central Queensland either. I really wonder why these people are in parliament. I thought the job of being a parliamentarian was to come to Canberra to defend the interests of your community, whether it be on universities, TAFEs, schools or hospitals, but these people just seem to want to get a flight down here and spend a nice week in the cold in Canberra. Frankly, I'd rather be spending a week in Central Queensland, where it's a lot warmer than here in Canberra. If you are going to come to Canberra and be cold, you might as well actually do your job properly and fight for the interests of Central Queenslanders.


The Vice-Chancellor of Central Queensland University has labelled the cuts that this government is making 'a tax on success'. I thought that the government—the Liberal and National party members—were generally about no tax and limiting tax. The vice-chancellor of this university has labelled the cuts a tax on success. So maybe any one of those four members of parliament or Senator Canavan, who's also based in Central Queensland, can listen to the vice-chancellor of the university there and do something about these cuts. I'm pleased that Russell Robertson, the Labor candidate for Capricornia, is actually doing something and speaking up about the need for these funding cuts to be reversed, because, unfortunately, the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, has yet again been missing in action on this issue. It is good to see there is at least one political representative who is taking up the issue.


The same can be said of Griffith University, whose main campus is on the Gold Coast, where my office is based. They're facing funding cuts of $92 million. Again, has anyone heard a peep out of any of the Gold Coast LNP members of parliament? Just like Central Queensland is currently a total stranglehold for the LNP, so is the Gold Coast, but these people aren't doing anything to deserve their places in parliament. They are completely lazy, completely complacent and completely happy to just nod along and let Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison make whatever funding cuts they want to make to their universities, even though it's their own constituents who miss out. You've really got to wonder why any of these people bothered getting elected to parliament if they don't want to come to Canberra and make a difference for their communities.


The real effect of this bill, in forcing students to repay their higher education loans at an earlier stage and in imposing a lifetime limit on the amount that students can borrow to undertake university and other forms of education, is that students are going to miss out on the opportunity to go through university or to go through vocational education and training through TAFE, apprenticeships and traineeships. At the very time that we are trying to get more Australians to undertake more study to prepare themselves for the new world of work—for the high-tech, high-knowledge jobs that our country is going to be producing—this government is cutting funding to those institutions and forcing students to pay more and to pay earlier in their career. It's the complete opposite of what we should be doing as a country. It's for that reason that I and the other Labor senators will be opposing this bill.


In conclusion, I also want to point out that this bill is a continuation of another trend we're seeing from this government. What this bill does is force students to repay their loans at an earlier stage, and in the background we've also got massive funding cuts that this government is making to universities and traineeships. Right now it's students in universities who are in the gunsights of this government, but it really doesn't matter what kind of young person you are in this country—you are in the sights of this government. It's got to come up with ways of paying for the big-business tax cuts that it wants to give, and the way it's doing it is increasingly by going after young people. If you're a young person who is working, this government is coming after your penalty rates, with more cuts to penalty rates coming in another five days. If you're an unemployed young person, this government is coming after you by tightening eligibility and wanting to drug-test you. If you're in training, this government is cutting funding for apprenticeships and cutting funding for TAFE, making it harder for the young hairdressers, chefs, boilermakers, electricians and chippies to get an opportunity to start their career. Now, with this bill, if you're a university student, it's coming after you by forcing you to pay more for your education and by forcing you to pay it back at an earlier stage. Why is it that this government has such a problem with young people? No matter what kind of young person you are, this government is coming after you, and, at the same time, it's using the funding it's stripping away from you to pay for a tax cut for big business. We all know what this government's priorities are. They are to support its friends in big business, even if it's young people who suffer. The parents of those young people are noticing it, as well.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:18):  I rise to contribute to this debate today in relation to the government's Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, and to put clearly on the record the Greens' opposition to this piece of legislation. We all know that this government goes on and on about not wanting political debate to get drawn into class warfare, and yet what we've got right in front of us today is a piece of legislation that takes the heart out of our higher education support scheme, right down to making it more and more difficult for students who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to get a university education, and, even if they do, to never be able to do further training or study because of the difficulty of being able to afford to pay back this loan.


Over and over again we hear this government talk about aspiration. Last week we heard from the Prime Minister, with all of his might during the income tax debate, that this was about aspiration and supporting aspirational Australians. Yet, with one fell swoop, this legislation cuts out the ability for young people right across this country to be aspirational about what level of education they get, how they go about getting it and how they set themselves up for the future, because what this bill does is widen the gap between the rich and the poor. It widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots. It says to young people in this country, 'Unless you've got a bank balance, probably funded by your parents, that is big enough to support your university education, you're going to have to do it pretty tough.' That's what this bill does, and it does it in two ways.


Firstly, it reduces the threshold at which students have to start paying back the debt on their university education. At the moment, on average, students have to start paying back their debt once they start earning $53,000. But this bill wants to drop that down. It wants to drop it down so far that it falls well below the average weekly earnings. It wants to drop it down to about $45,000, which is not much better than the minimum wage in this country. It is astounding that what the government wants to do here is punish students and young people who've gone out of their way to get a university education. It's going to punish them for going to university if they didn't have enough money to pay the up-front fees or to clear the HECS debt on the day they graduated or if they didn't ask mum and dad to foot the bill.


The second thing that this piece of legislation does is cap the amount of money that a student can borrow in order to further their education. At a time when we know that retraining is absolutely essential, when young people are going to enter the workforce in one job and change positions, careers and skills over and over again throughout the journey of their working life, this bill makes it more difficult for young people to get retraining and to further their education as life goes on.


Here, in this place, I think it's really important to look at the lack of vision that this government has under Malcolm Turnbull and the education minister, Simon Birmingham, for aspirational young people and for investing in education in this country. Compare that with the vision that is put forward by the Greens. We argue for an investment in lifelong learning. We know that investing in education is the best bang for buck that any government can spend. That starts with early childhood learning and goes right through school, tertiary education and lifelong learning. We know that we have to enable members of our community to train, to engage in the workforce and to retrain. That is the changing nature of working life right around us. And it's not just here in Australia, of course; it's happening right around the world.


Putting a handbrake on the ability of young people in this country, or anyone, to go back to university to complete another degree and further their skills is a stupid, stupid idea and shows a lack of vision from a government that says it cares about aspiration. It's all lip-service. Perhaps it's all about aspiration for the millionaires and the big income earners and the big banks, but there's no aspiration being put forward by this government in relation to allowing young Australians to get an education to further their opportunities and to be job ready for the workforce.


This bill comes at a time when there is a widening gap already between the haves and the have-nots. Inequality in Australia is getting worse. We know that two-thirds of students live in poverty. Poverty, of course, is one of those areas where, once you're in it, it's very, very hard to get out. It's a tricky cycle. And what this bill does is make it even harder for young people to get out of that cycle. It locks them in. If you're a young person who needs income support from the government, through youth allowance, in order to study, because your parents can't afford it, and if you need to take out a university loan because you're not lucky enough to have a mummy and daddy who are able to sign the cheques at the university down the road, then this bill locks you into a cycle of poverty right from the beginning.


It's not about whether a young person has enough spare cash in their back pocket to have a beer at the uni bar. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about being able to put food in one's belly, pay for the rent so that you've got a roof over your head, pay for the public transport that you're going to need to get to classes every day or wind back on study to take more part-time work or full-time work, paid at a ridiculously low rate, often with very few penalty rates—this government wants to cut them. We are keeping young people trapped in a cycle of poverty at a time when we should be supporting them to take up more and more opportunities for education. In fact, the best way of dealing with inequality would be to better fund education, to ensure that it's more accessible and to ensure that it's affordable for people so that, when students are studying, they are able to actually focus on their studies. This isn't just about being able to make the university degree itself affordable; it's also about ensuring that students have the support in order to be a student.


Youth allowance is ridiculously low in this country. It is well below the poverty line, so of course you can't live on it. University students struggle every day to be able to go to university, study, get an education and further their careers in order to contribute to society, while struggling on pitiful amounts under youth allowance. We need a better deal for young people in this country, particularly those who are doing everything they can to get an education and to contribute to society.


Of course, higher education isn't all about just what the market gains or about what profits can be gained. This bill sends a very clear message that that's all this government care about, that they only really care about whether there is a commercial return for a university student's university loan. What happened to the days when we understood that educating the next generation was good, in and of itself, for the society and for the community? Education is essential for a decent society. It shouldn't be simply measured against whether the government of the day thinks it offers the certainty of a commercial dividend. 


We heard Senator Macdonald speaking on this bill. And while he talked about the importance of having young National and Liberal members educated at university—I think he was doing, as Senator Watt suggested, a pitch for his preselection rant—ultimately he missed the key point, which is that any young person in this country should have the opportunity to go to university, to get an education and to contribute back to the community and the society. We, as a decent society, pay for the opportunity for some of those young people to go to university because we know we get a dividend back in what that contributes to the community.


Nurses don't earn very much. They should earn more. But would anyone in this place begrudge a university graduate who's done a nursing degree next time they're confronted with them at an emergency ward in a hospital? Is the Prime Minister going to turn around to the next nurse he sees when he falls ill or a member of his family falls ill and say, 'But have you paid back your university debt yet?' Of course not, because we know the role of these people in society is absolutely paramount and essential. 


It shouldn't be that, just because you're not rich enough to pay your university degree off either upfront or quickly, you don't deserve support from the government. University education is getting more and more expensive. These days, the average fees that students pay and debts that students graduate with range anywhere from $30,000 to $40,000—sometimes more. If you've studied medicine, you're more likely to have a debt of $60,000 to $70,000. If you do a combined degree, your debt is closer to $100,000. University students today are graduating with debts of this magnitude, and yet we expect them to start paying back their debt when they've just exited university, they've just entered the workforce and they're only earning $45,000 before tax. This is absurd. Either we value education in this country or we don't. Either we value the dedication and determination of young people in Australia to go to university, get an education and become our nurses, our doctors and our teachers or we don't.


Why is it that rich kids, because money doesn't matter for them, are the only ones who can pick which university degrees they would like? The reality is that those lower paid jobs are essential for our community but those who are in them still aren't paid what they are worth. Teachers, nurses and early childhood educators are the people who are going to be graduating with debts and having to pay them back on pitiful wages. It is simply unfair. Inequality is a problem in this country, and the sooner this government works that out the better. If they don't, they are going to cop it at the ballot box. Australians are not silly. The voters can see what's going on here. The government has prioritised giving $140 billion in tax cuts which primarily help high-income earners. Later on today, we're going to be debating a bill that gives $85 billion in tax cuts to big corporations—and then the government turn around and say, 'We don't have enough money left to fund education.' It's absurd. It says everything you need to know about the priorities of this government. They don't care about young people, and they certainly don't care about young people from low-income families. They'd prefer that teachers, nurses and early childhood educators went off and did their university degrees, started paying back their loans and then shut up and weren't heard from again.


The problem with this bill is that the government's argument is that these thresholds need to be lowered because somehow, apparently, wage growth is stalling, yet the argument for why we need to give income tax cuts to the rich is that wage growth is going to explode. This government picks and chooses which arguments it wants to run on a bill being debated based on what is going to satisfy the big end of town. 'Let's keep low-income workers down and let's keep kids from low-income households locked out of the system.' This government has already cut $2.2 billion from our university sector. Not only are they making it harder for students to be able to cover the costs of their education; they're making it harder and harder for universities to cover that gap.


I fear that we are sliding into a future Australia that says, 'If you come from a low-income family, if you're not part of the rich kids who went to the best private schools in this country, then you don't deserve a quality education; you can stay over there.' I'm worried that we're sliding towards an Australia that says, 'You can only go to university if your parents are rich.' I'm worried that we're sliding towards a future Australia that says, 'If you come from a poor household, you should stay poor. Don't get in our way. Do the jobs we don't want to do, but don't complain.' That's not the kind of Australia I want, and I don't believe for a second that it's the kind of Australia that anyone else out there in the real world wants either. The Prime Minister talked about aspiration. Well, this is the exact opposite. Aspiration for some but not for all is what this bill says. That's the attitude of the Prime Minister. It is going to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and that is not the Australia that I want to see.


At a time when the workforce is so rapidly changing, we need investment in our education system across the board—in our early childhood sector, in our schools, in our universities and in our TAFEs. It's going to be a normal thing for people to have to re-enter education and get retraining. Why on earth we would be making that harder is beyond me. It shows a total lack of vision from this government—unless, of course, the vision is to look after the rich and shut out the poor. You can't read this piece of legislation as anything else. It is part of that narrative from this Prime Minister and his government, and it is the exact opposite of the decent Australia that we should all be striving for.


Tax cuts for big banks and big corporations, and tax cuts for millionaires—and then all the money is spent, so there's nothing left to be spent on educating the next generation. That is what is before us today. This is a matter of priorities. I say to the crossbench: Don't fall for this. Don't fall for this false argument from the Prime Minister that we can't afford to invest in our young people. We can afford it, but it means that we can't afford tax cuts for the banks. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate notes that:


(a) the Government is at war with young people, pursuing policies that put the aspirations of young people to get a degree, own a home and pay the bills further out of reach;


(b) the Government is cutting $2.2 billion from universities around the country, without a vote in the Parliament or a mandate from the public;


(c) this bill makes students pay back more of their debt sooner, rather than doing anything to assist people with the cost of living while studying or to boost wages upon graduation; and


(d) no government that genuinely supports aspiration would make it harder to study at university"".

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (13:38):  I'm pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. Labor opposes this bill in its current form, and I'll explain why to the Senate shortly. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the work of my colleagues Senator O'Neill, Senator Marshall and Senator Collins—the Labor members of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. Their dissenting report sets out very clearly and cogently the many problems with this bill as it stands.


Next, I want to point out to the Senate the proud record of past Labor governments in the great work of broadening access to higher education in Australia. In 1940, when Australia had only six small and very elitist universities, John Curtin's wartime Labor government dramatically increased the number of scholarships available to students from government schools to enter university and also allowed women to apply for these scholarships for the first time. When Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister in 1972, Australia was still served by a small number of elite, fee-charging universities. Although the university sector certainly expanded during the Menzies era, our higher education system was still geared to the economy of the 1950s, not the new knowledge based economy which was emerging in the 1970s. Most university students still came from private schools and upper-income families. The only way students from low-income families could get to university was by winning a scholarship. Gough Whitlam and his education minister, Kim Beazley, made university education free and introduced the first student funding scheme, the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, known as TEAS. These two reforms revolutionised higher education in Australia. A whole generation of bright students from government schools were able to go to university who would not otherwise have been able to do so. They included some of the very same people who now want to withdraw that same access from the current generation of young Australians.


By the late 1980s, it was apparent that Australia's massively expanded higher education system could not be sustained on an entirely free basis. Rather than introducing up-front university fees, as the Liberal opposition of the time wanted to do, the Hawke government, through its visionary education minister, John Dawkins, introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme in 1989. Under this scheme, a fee was charged to all university students and the Commonwealth paid the balance. But students could defer payment of this fee and repay it through the tax system when their income exceeded a threshold level. This measure preserved the access to higher education created by the Whitlam government while requiring those students who gained high-income employment after graduation to repay some of the cost of their education once they could afford to do. This was a great Labor reform, which has stood the test of time.


The Howard government brought in several retrograde measures designed to undermine the principles established by Gough Whitlam of equal access and no up-front fees. They greatly increased the fees charged under the renamed HELP scheme and also allowed the universities to bring back full, up-front fees for some courses. The Howard changes have allowed the older universities to reclaim their elite status, becoming largely fee-paying institutions. And I will add there that, in fact, because those universities have become largely fee-paying institutions and because of the cuts to the higher education sector, those universities have, of course, had to go offshore to look for students, and we now see the result of this. We see that, in fact, some universities are tailoring courses for particular cohorts of overseas students, and we have seen a recent example where one higher education institution apologised for a supposedly incorrect use of course material when it was brought to the attention of the Chinese embassy here. I think this is one of the consequences that couldn't be seen at the time, but that is what happens when higher education institutions have to seek out fee-paying students in order to sustain their business model.


As a result of these changes, the ability of students from lower-income families to access universities—and, particularly, the more prestigious universities—declined, and students also amassed increasingly onerous levels of debt. It has always been obvious that the Liberal Party wants to return Australia to a two-tier higher education system in which high-prestige courses and high-prestige universities, which naturally lead to higher-income careers, are once again reserved for the children of the affluent elite, while everyone else is channelled off into lower-prestige universities or into the TAFE system, even as that system is being systematically attacked by Liberal state governments.


The last Labor government took a stand against this retrograde trend. In 2009, Julia Gillard, as education minister, introduced the demand driven system. Universities were allowed to enrol unlimited numbers of students in virtually all undergraduate courses in order to increase educational attainment and student equity. Labor's reforms aimed to increase the proportion of young Australians with undergraduate degrees to 40 per cent and raise the proportion of students from lower income families to 20 per cent. This objective was funded through the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships program. This reform was spectacularly successful. University participation rose enormously without any sacrifice of quality. Australia quickly moved from an elite higher education system to a mass higher education system. The proportion of students from lower income families rose from 16.2 per cent to 17.7 per cent between 2009 and 2014. In the same period, the overall number of students from lower income families increased by 44 per cent. Since 2009, the number of Indigenous undergraduate students has increased by 60 per cent. The number of students with a disability has increased by nearly 80 per cent.




Senator O'Neill:
  It's a wonderful outcome.




Senator KITCHING:
  It is a wonderful outcome. Andrew Harvey, Director of the Access and Achievement Research Unit at La Trobe University, wrote in June 2016: 'The improvements in equity are even more impressive when considered in historical context. The level of low socioeconomic status participation was virtually unchanged from 1990, when data was first collected, until the introduction of the demand driven system. Class is intractable but not immovable.'


Sadly, however, we now, once again, have a government which does not see greater equity in access to higher education as a priority or even a desirable objective. We've seen during the tax debate in recent weeks that this government's overriding priority is to reduce the amount of tax paid by corporations and high-income earners—the people who essentially fund the Liberal Party and the people who vote for it. That means government spending has to be cut accordingly and government revenue from other sources increased. University education is once again to be a privilege rather than a right; and access is, once again, to be cut off for students from lower income families and government schools.


This bill must be seen in that context. Its primary motive is to cut costs to fund the government's high-income tax cuts. Its secondary motive is to roll back the Labor government's reforms and reduce equity in our higher education system. The dissenting report by the Labor members of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill sets out in detail our objections to this bill. Firstly, we oppose the government's move to lower the HELP repayment threshold to $45,000—only $9,000 a year more than the minimum wage. This completely contradicts the original premise of the HECS and HELP schemes, which was that students should only start repaying some of costs of their university education when they reach an income level high enough to enable them to do so while also meeting the other demands that people face at that age, such as buying a first home and raising a family.


As the dissenting report says, the government has made no sufficient case for changes to HELP beyond budget savings. The report quotes Professor Bruce Chapman, an economist and academic, who designed the original HECS student loan system. He testified: 'I think it is unfortunate when people focus on the stock of the debt. It is really not very interesting. What's interesting is the overall amount that is not repaid. If that number is even at 25 per cent, there is no crisis here, there is no crisis in the system.'


Labor also opposes the government's proposal in this bill to introduce a limit on how much students can borrow under HELP. Currently, students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places have no limit to the amount they can defer through the HELP scheme. The proposal in this bill would create a borrowing limit across all of the HELP programs. The shadow minister for higher education, Ms Terri Butler, made it clear in her speech on this bill that Labor does not oppose the principle of loan limits operating as price signals. But we believe that the proposal in this bill is too rigid. It ignores the fact that our rapidly changing economy and workforce require more and more students to take on additional study throughout their lives to meet the changing needs of the labour market.


This proposal also ignores the fact that the universities—in particular, the elite universities—are now free to charge whatever fees they like and that there is a growing gap between what university courses cost and the assistance available to students to pay for them. As a result, a student in graduate debt is a major concern and has the potential to be a drag on the economy. Young families cannot buy homes if they are crippled by student debt. Labor does not want a system where students have to take out commercial loans to pay for the gap between fees set by universities and the loan borrowing amount. This bill does nothing to discourage reckless high-fee settings. For these reasons Labor opposes this bill and urges the Senate to reject it.


While we're on the subject of higher education, I want to say something about the current controversy over the Australian National University's decision to reject a proposed course on Western civilisation sponsored by the Ramsay Centre. As with so many other policy debates in Australia at present, this debate has become yet another episode in the culture wars. On the one hand, supporters of the Ramsay Centre course say that the ANU has surrendered to a coterie of left-wing academics and students who hate Western civilisation and all of its works, while admiring or at least excusing the behaviour of totalitarian regimes, and who fear that such a course would undermine their ideological hegemony in the universities. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that such a course would be mere apologetics for the West's sorry history of imperialism, colonialism, militarism, racism, and all of the other isms, and would ignore the history of non-Western civilisations, people of colour, women and other oppressed people. Both of these positions are, of course, caricatures and neither of them is very helpful in understanding the issues involved.


I'm a big fan of Western civilisation and I think that our universities should be teaching students about it and about the Jewish, Christian, Greek and Roman foundations of Western culture, religion, politics, literature and art. I studied both Latin and Greek at school, and, perhaps less usefully, Mediaeval French as well. My life and career have been hugely enlightened and enriched by my studies of these subjects. There is no contradiction in teaching these things and also teaching about non-Western civilisations, particularly the civilisations of our Asian neighbours. Indeed it can only help with diversity and understanding of different cultures if we study a variety of courses and if we study different cultures. Australian universities are perfectly capable of teaching both and Australian students are perfectly capable of learning both—nor should any course on any type of civilisation shy away from teaching about the failings of those civilisations.


To go back to the bill: we don't want to discourage people from learning. I would argue that we need more, not less. We don't need cuts, and we don't need a more-euphemistically-phrased freeze on higher education. The sector needs more support, not less. Why don't we not give tax cuts to big banks and foreign billionaires? Why give $80 billion in tax cuts to those groups and not support the education of everyone we possibly can in our society with a merits based system?

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-06-26,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (13:53):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this chamber in support of the proposed change to the student loan system through the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill. After much consideration I have come to the view that the lower loan repayment threshold is preferable to other higher education cuts. I doubt that future students entering tertiary education would appreciate fewer opportunities and perhaps a lower quality education than those who are already reaping the benefits intellectually as well as financially from their time at university. 


If the savings from this measure, estimated by the government to be $231 million, are not legislated, the money will have to come from elsewhere in the education budget. At a time of growing debt and with the budget struggling to return to balance, it is important that this bill rein in the rising costs to government of HELP loans. Total HELP lending is growing rapidly, and I agree with the need for repayments to keep pace with HELP lending growth. Those who are reasonably able to pay off their HELP loans should do so to avoid the student loan system becoming unsustainable for future generations and to avoid our loan systems becoming unnecessarily costly to taxpayers, as the Grattan Institute argued in its submission to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee.


We should also take into account the point raised by Grattan, that HELP's largest cost to the taxpayer is debt not expected to be repaid. In 2012, HELP debt was $25 billion, whereas today it is $55 billion. Of that $55 billion, nearly $20 billion is doubtful debt. The evidence is significant, however. On its own, it's not sufficient reason to vote for the bill. Fortunately, this bill does a good job, in my view, in balancing economic sustainability with fairness to students and to those repaying student loans.


I have decided to accept the readjustment of the current repayment pathway. Growing slowly upwards from a fair one per cent repayment rate for those earning $45,000, this legislation offers a smoother repayment process. Those earning between $57,000 and $98,000 will see considerable benefit, and high-income earners will pay their fair share as well. The legislation will couple lower repayment rates across the board for the vast majority of lower- and middle-income earners with smoother incremental rises. That will give significant relief to many, at the same time as increasing the amount of loans that are ultimately repaid. For example: under the current system, from 1 July this year someone on an annual income of $58,378 would face a repayment rate of four per cent. By contrast, if this bill were passed we would see the same person pay a repayment rate of 2.5 per cent. That is a saving of $876 for that individual per year.


I would also like to draw greater attention to the fact that those struggling to pay off their HELP loan do have the option to defer their repayments or to set up a repayment plan that would provide appropriate relief. As I understand it, the vast bulk of those who apply for hardship relief are successful. The hardship provisions provide a responsible safety net to ensure that this bill does not apply undue burden on those in hardship. I support efforts to increase the visibility of the hardship arrangements so that those who need relief get it. I would encourage my fellow senators to consider the hardship provision when weighing up the impact that the lower repayment threshold might have.


Overall, the economic sustainability of the student loan system needs to be balanced with fairness to students, and this bill achieves that balance. With regard to the amendments put forward by Senator Bernardi: I too agree that public and private universities should be treated fairly. His amendments would level the playing field for student access to both private and public universities. The current 25 per cent fee for students at Torrens University Australia in my home state of South Australia, Bond University, the University of Notre Dame Australia and the University of Divinity should be scrapped. One strong reason to vote for the Australian Conservatives amendments is that they would encourage fairer access to students across the board to attend programs that are best fit for them.


It seems to me that the current 25 per cent fee could act as a disincentive for some students when weighing up whether to apply to a private university. A consequence of removing the fee could be that more eligible candidate students, and from less affluent backgrounds, for example, might choose to apply to private universities if they felt that those programs would give them most benefit. I would encourage my fellow senators to vote for the Australian Conservatives amendments on the grounds of fairness—primarily for our students but also for educational providers.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:58):  Today we're talking about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. We've come a long way with education, but we've still got a long way to go. This is about students having to pay back to the taxpayers the loans that they've taken out. It has to be sustainable for future generations, and that's what the discussion here is about today.


A lot of Australians are grateful for the help from taxpayers and for having the opportunity to go on to further education. We have come to a stage in Australia where I believe that we are pushing people onto further education—people who do not have the qualifications and who should not be in universities because they're not able to do it. I think there needs to be a harder test on people before they go into universities. They're taking out exorbitant loans and they are not able to pay them back, and a lot of people are not able to get jobs when they finish.


Debate interrupted.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (12:01):  As I was saying last night, the government is increasing transparency for students around admission requirements and course cut-offs. We are working to give students better information about their choices. We are funding rural and regional hubs and regional scholarships, and we're having Universities Australia and Professions Australia work together to improve arrangements for student work placements. We are not increasing student fees. We do, however, think that we should hold universities to account for student outcomes, given the significant taxpayer funds they receive—something Labor also opposes. We also think that universities, like non-university providers, should not be able to charge students whatever they like because taxpayers and students will pick up the tab irrespective of how inefficient they are. Providers need to think of the product and the service they are providing students for the significant taxpayer investment they receive.


The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 will set a new schedule of repayment thresholds for HELP from 1 July 2018 with a lower minimum repayment threshold of $45,000 at a one per cent repayment rate—up from $42,000 proposed in last year's budget—and with smaller incremental rises in thresholds and repayment rates, up to a top threshold of $131,989, at which 10 per cent of income is repayable. It will align the indexation of the repayment thresholds to the consumer price index. From 1 July 2019, it will bring repayment thresholds for the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, managed by the Social Services portfolio, into line with HELP repayment thresholds and make corresponding changes to the order of repayment of student loans. It will also introduce a refreshable, new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP to cover their tuition fees. The combined limit is $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses and $104,440 for other students. We heard and read in the media today about the importance of that, given that some 'serial students', as I think the minister has categorised them, have racked up debts large enough to pay for an apartment, let alone higher education. While the loan limit is not new, it will now apply to Commonwealth supported students borrowing through HECS-HELP as well as fee-paying students accessing FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and the VET Student Loans scheme.


HELP lending has grown rapidly, with the expansion of the demand driven system. The amount accessed for HELP loans has increased from just $3 billion in 2009 to $7 billion in 2016. The Turnbull government shut down Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP loan scheme at the end of 2016 and replaced it with the VET Student Loans scheme. This is a much more tightly controlled scheme with caps on tuition accounts and extensive safeguards against reporting by unethical providers. The fiscal challenge for the government is that HELP repayments have not kept pace with HELP lending growth. From 2010-11 to 2016-17, the level of new debt not expected to be repaid increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. It is no longer possible to ignore the long-term burden of this debt on the taxpayer.


Schedule 1 of the bill proposes a new set of repayment thresholds commencing from 1 July this year. There is a new minimum repayment income of $45,000 at which one per cent of income is repayable, amounting to around $8.65 per week. The second threshold is $51,957 with a two per cent repayment rate, which would otherwise be the first threshold rate on 1 July this year. Each progressive threshold increases by six per cent income amounts and by half a per cent increments in repayment rates, which smooths the repayment obligations. Importantly, this new schedule of thresholds will also reduce incentive for debtors to 'cluster' below thresholds to avoid repayments as they do now. This came out very clearly in the Senate inquiry. There are increased repayment rates for those earning the highest incomes, who are best placed to repay their debts sooner, with those earning $131,989 or more paying at 10 per cent of their income, as I said earlier. 


From 2019–20, the revised HELP thresholds will also apply to SFSS debts under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Assistance Act 1973. Currently, these debts are repaid concurrently with HELP debts but according to a subset of just three thresholds. To improve rates of repayment of SFSS debts, and to achieve consistency in debt administration, the current three-tier threshold approach applied to SFSS repayments will be replaced with the full range of HELP thresholds. There will be a transitional year in 2018-19 that maintains the three-tier threshold arrangement, while systems changes are implemented, and to allow these debtors additional time for transition.


Schedule 1 of the bill also implements new indexation arrangements for the HELP repayment thresholds, which are currently indexed according to average weekly earnings. For a number of years now, the HELP repayment thresholds have been rising relative to earnings. The higher growth in AWE, average weekly earnings, has meant that people have dropped from a higher repayment threshold to a lower one, or have dropped out of the repayment stream altogether as the thresholds rise faster than their income growth. This bill provides that the minimum and all subsequent thresholds will instead be indexed to the consumer price index. This will ensure repayment requirements are adjusted in line with the cost of living. It also streamlines indexation factors used throughout the Higher Education Support Act 2003, as all amounts will be indexed in the same way.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the order of repayment of student loan debts by loan type. Currently, student debts under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Assistance Act 1973 are repaid concurrently with HELP debts. I realise I have repeated myself there, so please excuse me.


Schedule 3 of the bill provides for the expansion of the loan limit to all HELP loans for which students can defer their tuition fees but makes it replenishable. The Senate committee inquiry which I chaired received evidence that a replenishable loans cap was preferable to a lifetime limit, and that was the recommendation to the government from the majority report of the committee. I'm pleased that the government has accepted that amendment, which it introduced in the House of Representatives and which was subsequently passed.


The new $150,000 loan limit for students undertaking medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses, as defined in the act, is an increase on the estimated current FEE-HELP limit of $130,552 for 2019. Students in these courses who had previously reached their FEE-HELP limit will, from 2019, have access to additional funds up to the new $150,000 limit. Apart from annual indexation increases, the loan limit applying to students in other courses remains the same, with a base amount of $104,440 in 2019. The caps will be increased in 2019, but new replenishable combined loans caps arrangements will not start until 2020.


The measures in this bill are fair. They are modest but, over the longer term, they will ensure that the world-class income-contingent loans program remains sustainable for future generations of students and taxpayers. We have a system that is the envy of the world, and Professor Bruce Chapman is a man in demand around the globe as others seek to emulate the system that we have. Australian government funding is now at record levels, and it is important that we continue to ensure that Australians from all walks of life, irrespective of their background or financial means, can continue to access high-quality tertiary education if they have the aptitude and the application to succeed. That's why I, like my colleagues across the government, want to ensure we keep these opportunities open to future generations.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (12:17):  In making a contribution to the debate on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 I want to welcome the government's attention to the importance of reform in the higher education sector. I understand that this bill goes some way to reforming the HECS and FEE-HELP schemes, but there is a broader discussion and debate that we need to have in this place about the benefits of university education for a number of students. I recognise also that we've had the vocational education and training scheme, and there have been some significant reforms in that nature.


Our university system has become almost effectively a degree mill. That concerns me because there are many students who have the expectation placed upon them by society, their schools, their parents or themselves to get a degree from a university which doesn't equip them with a financially valuable skill when they graduate, some years down the track, indoctrinated in some respects by the university ethos and kudos, but they have a higher education scheme bill and are left pursuing rather menial tasks that are completely outside their training and education. That benefits no-one. The government, the public assume, by virtue of the fact that they fund it, will be accruing tens of billions of dollars worth of higher education debt, but much of it won't be repaid. As much as 25 per cent in some instances won't be repaid. We're talking about a significant amount of money—$15 billion, $16 billion or $20 billion over the next 10 years will never be repaid.


So I congratulate the government on their attempts at redressing some of the imbalances in the scheme, because, if you don't recognise that there's a problem and you don't try and fix it, you're never going to have a hope of improving the current situation. University education is not servicing all our students and our younger people as effectively as it should. Postgraduate outcomes are critically important. Meaningful reforms in this sector should incorporate a report and a very frank disclosure about how many graduates from a particular university, in a particular discipline, have obtained jobs within a certain time frame of graduating from that institution. It would produce some accountability. It would mean that universities don't just pick the cheapest degree to provide—let's say it's a law degree, for argument's sake—and graduate hundreds of students who all expect a glittering legal career and are unable to find work in that sector. That is but one example. We have numerous other examples in the sociology and social studies space. They have very little prospect of gaining meaningful employment outside of a tiny little cabal, which is not really adding to the productive nature of our society. 


These things may be contentious. I don't think they are. I think many parents recognise it as common sense, and I know that many graduates lament the fact they have incurred a rather large and substantial debt and yet have no real meaningful employment prospects enhanced as a result of it. 


There's also another gratuitous imbalance in the system, which I will be moving an amendment seeking to reform. That applies to the four private universities in this country: Bond University in Queensland, Torrens University in South Australia, Notre Dame University in Western Australia and New South Wales, and the University of Divinity, which is based in Melbourne. These four privately funded institutions not only don't benefit from taxpayer subsidies for each enrolment; the students who choose to go to these institutions are penalised for doing so. They're penalised with no real justification. The penalties are quite significant. Effectively, what it means is that, if they are accessing HELP fees to the tune of say $60,000 in order to get their educational qualification, the government slugs them with a 25 per cent loading on those fees simply because they've chosen not to pursue a publicly funded university place. 


I understand this was introduced in around 2006 by the Howard government. In going back to understand why, I found very little rationale or explanation other than it was the vibe at the time that this should take place. Since then, I've had conversations with a number of individuals about it, and the rationale has moved down the path to, 'These are going to be accumulating higher HECS debts for individuals that are attending them'—HECS is my terminology; it's HELP and HECS now—'by virtue of the fact they're more expensive to go to, so the government will be financing a larger loan, so there should be a penalty.' This is a nonsensical argument, because it doesn't take into account the subsidies that go into universities already. It doesn't account for the fact that, for example, in Bond University a student can get through their degree in two years because they have an accelerated program that the student, who has learnt a financially valuable skill—I note in yesterday's Australian Financial Review that the private universities had higher satisfaction and better outcomes for job placement than most others—they will get into the workforce at an earlier stage and they will begin to be able to repay their debt at a later stage. 


As for the concept that the fees, and hence the borrowings, attached to private institutions are somewhat higher, yes, the fees are higher, because there are no subsidies taking place there. There's not a $20,000- or $30,000-per-student subsidy that has been injected into the university to maintain the sandstone. These are privately funded institutions. 


The government, might I also say, charges the interest rate that it determines applies to all student loans, irrespective of the amount. We know from media reports as well that there are students out there who have obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars in HECS debt and HELP debt by becoming perpetual students, and that, I'm sure, doesn't pass the commonsense test. What does pass the commonsense test, though, is for the government to effectively introduce a cap on HECS and slash outstanding HECS and HELP debt of, I think, $104,000, which is in this bill. It also entirely negates the justification for this loading on private universities. The loading on private university students was justified, as I said, because the fees they were going to be accumulating would be higher. Well, in the end, the only amount of borrowing that a student can undertake at any single time, with one or two exemptions—we understand that—is around $104,000. Whether you pay $60,000, $80,000 or $90,000 for your degree, or whether you do two degrees, whatever it is, the most you can get is $104,000 outside of the medical sciences. I have no dramas about a loading, perhaps, for private institutions in medical sciences. I don't think it should exist, but, if a degree at Bond University in medicine could cost upwards of $500,000, one has to question whether the taxpayer should be on the hook for that. That is a decision to be made. But the principle is the same. By capping the fees, you undermine the very argument for a 25 per cent loading. 


In the interests of full disclosure, my son is a scholar at Bond University. This contribution to the debate is not driven by self-interest at all, apart from the fact that I pay his fees there. He's not using HELP or accessing HECS because we're very fortunate that there's no need for him to. But it was his enrolment there, the engagement with it and the discussions I had with him about this that marked the inequity of the system.


There is an attractiveness about the private university system for many students. I've talked about the accelerated education so you can actually do a degree in two years. You do three semesters per year, you have minimal breaks between them and there are three 14-week semesters rather than two 14-week semesters or thereabouts. I'm decidedly impressed with the commercial nature of it. They explore a great many things, but everything is oriented towards practical, real-world skills in the area in which they will graduate. If that is in law, they're practising their mooting skills, discussing real-life cases or assisting in particular areas. Everything I've learned from my son's explanations to me demonstrates that there is a truly valuable skill that is coming down the pipeline, rather than just theoretical knowledge—which has its place in higher education, in research and academia, but that's not what he was seeking from a university degree. 


I understand it's the same at Torrens University. This is not an ideological bent. For those on the other side of the chamber who don't share my conservative leanings or perhaps my sense of fiscal responsibility, I make the point that Torrens University in South Australia is part of a global network of universities which, I think, was launched and certainly celebrated by no less a left-winger, if I can put it like that, than Bill Clinton. 


Private universities have their place. They are just another option for children and students in our country to make a decision about, and I don't think they should be penalised by government simply for opting into a system that is not state sanctioned or state run. I've been on the record many times as saying that I think the university system is becoming a bit more of a closed shop, where freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of ideas and the battle of ideas are no longer as relevant as they once were. It seems that few are willing to defend in this space what we have always tolerated or accepted. They're just students. They have differing views. But now we see students who were campaigning for the 'no' campaign being attacked and vilified simply for having that view. We have seen pro-life organisations on campus. We have seen pro-conservative organisations on campus. We've seen people penalised—and I just spoke about it in my podcast today—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  A podcast?




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, Senator Hanson-Young. You can tune in actually.



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, you can. You can go to iTunes—I'll just make that point—and look for the Weekly Dose of Common Sense. It's entirely free and commercial free. The Greens do cop a bagging on it every single week. Senator McKim features a lot. Senator Hanson-Young, of course, is very unpopular with my listeners, so we mention her quite a lot. But I digress.


We have a circumstance where places like Curtin University—it was reported to me today—are penalising students for using gender-specific pronouns. They're not bringing those sorts of things in. It is like an indoctrination of children. I think parents and all students need to be able to have a choice about where they want to go in that respect.


In the end, I welcome the opportunity that every Australian has to enter into a competitive decision with respect to the university that they choose to attend. I also welcome the fact that they may choose not to attend university. But what I will be proposing—and I will be moving this amendment in the committee stage and I will look for the support of the chamber—is to remove that impediment, that barrier, that tariff, if you like, for those children who do choose to attend a private institution who then seek to avail themselves of what many in this place celebrate as the opportunity that should be provided to every student, and that is accessing funds in order to finance their degree in an advantageous manner. We've accepted, rightly or wrongly, that a very low-interest rate loan, effectively a market-neutral loan, repaid out of future earnings is the way forward and is an equitable measure for people to finance their tertiary education and studies. Applying a 25 per cent loading on top of that, plus the interest, I do not think is in anyone's best interest.


More specifically about this bill, I do agree that lowering the threshold at which repayments are meant to be made is very important. If it were left to me, I would suggest that one per cent of income is probably not enough. I would prefer, of course, to lower taxes across the board for everyone and then expect people to make a higher repayment schedule as they get into the earnings market. I make the point that, in New Zealand, about 10 per cent of income is quarantined to pay for university education, from the very first dollar earned or thereabouts. It's much the same in many other places around the world. We are not reinventing the wheel here. I'm just trying to make it fairer and more reasonable and balanced, mindful of the new university environment that is springing up around the country. I think competition in this space and options for people are very important, and government should facilitate that freedom of choice, without imposing an arbitrary penalty on people, which has, from my research, very little justification for being.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (12:34):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. Labor opposes this bill. It's an unfair piece of legislation. This MYEFO package of cuts is the government's fourth attempt since coming to office to cut universities and make students pay more. At last year's budget, they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now they're proposing a new rate of $45,000. It's still too low.


Labor believe the current repayment rate is about right. We don't want to make students repay their debts when they are starting a career, saving for a house or trying to start a family. We know that higher student debt is a genuine barrier to study for low-SES and disadvantaged students. We should be doing all we can to increase participation in higher education and not making it harder. Experts warn that, if Australia does not boost participation in postsecondary education, we risk being left behind the rest of the world. Indeed, Universities Australia Chief Executive, Belinda Robinson, said:


Universities will be moving resources around, they'll be looking at other programs they can perhaps close down, campuses they can close … anything they can do to hold on for 12 months. There will be adverse consequences.


In a time of significant economic transition, we should be investing in our people and not making it harder to get a university qualification. It's pretty clear that the government has only ever had one plan for higher education: cut and make students pay more. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution in the OECD to the cost of their degrees, but the Liberals can't help themselves. They have consistently tried to make students pay more. Why? All to pay for their $80 billion tax cut. They've even given themselves a $7,000 tax cut. We've seen it in schools: a $17 billion cut. We've seen it with vocational education and training: nearly $3 billion cut. And more than 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships have been lost since the Liberals came to office. Again, we've seen it with the universities: a $2.2 billion cut.


I'd like to take this opportunity to share a story about the harsh reality of the impacts of these cuts. One of my constituents left the Territory to move to Canberra to study at the Australian National University. This is just one example of many. This student held an undergraduate degree and was looking to study Indonesian through ANU's then Diploma of Languages program. Having spent Christmas with their friends and family in Darwin, the student moved their entire life to the ACT to pursue this course. Upon realising the impacts of the MYEFO cuts, ANU sent the following email to aspiring language students:


Dear Student, I refer to your application for the Diploma of Languages. I regret to advise you that the Diploma of Languages will no longer be available for commencement in 2018 and your application has been withdrawn. This is owing to a recent notification, in December 2017, from the Commonwealth that there will no longer be any Commonwealth Supported Places available for the Diploma of Languages at ANU. You may want to consider studying language courses at the ANU on a Non-award basis or look at what other options are available to you through Open Universities Australia.


In other words, if you've got enough money to fund your language diploma yourself, then, they'd be happy to take them on. Understandably, the student was devastated. After they had moved their entire life from the Territory to the south, a move which came at a massive personal and financial cost, the government has basically said, 'You moved your whole life to pursue your dreams, but, because we're going back on our word, here's an online alternative.' This action by the Turnbull government is completely unacceptable. It is unjust and unfair.


This brings me to my next point. These cuts to universities damage the future prosperity of our nation as a whole. Cuts to courses like language diplomas restrict our ability to establish business and career opportunities for our students. They restrict our nation's ability to grow and they diminish our influence in our region. Indonesia is Australia's ninth-largest trading partner. Restricting the next generation's ability to communicate with one of our largest trading partners is simply baffling. The Northern Territory stands to be one of the hardest hit by the Turnbull government's cuts to universities. Indeed, CDU vice-chancellor Simon Maddocks has said that small, young universities such as CDU would be disproportionately affected by the freeze, as they lacked budgets big enough to absorb the cut to revenue. Only last week, Professor Maddocks was quoted in NT News as saying:


'If revenue is going down and costs going up, you can't just keep doing what you're doing … 


We will inevitably have to review our capacity to sustain everything we've been doing because you can't keep paying out more and not get the revenue in.'


The university was 'only just financially viable' now, he said.


'We all understand the Government has savings to find but education is a significant pillar to the future of the country. High-performing countries invest in quality education systems …


I agree wholeheartedly. If we are to continue to develop, build and grow as a nation, we must ensure that higher education is affordable and accessible no matter where you live in this country.


If we look at the data from this government's much-bungled census, it's obvious that cuts to universities will only restrict—certainly in the Northern Territory—people's ability to further their careers and improve their quality of life. The 2016 census revealed that only 17.1 per cent of Territorians have a bachelor degree or higher. Compare that with the national average of 22 per cent. That statistic should be an indication that the Territory needs more investment in higher education, not less. These funding cuts have left the people of the Northern Territory in a dire situation.


When Labor first uncapped places, there were 484 more university places for students in the seat of Lingiari. That was for 2008 to 2016. Under Labor's new policy we'll see around 400 more students in Lingiari on their way to university. When Labor first uncapped places in the seat of Solomon, which covers Darwin and much of Palmerston, there were 649 more places for students at university for 2008 to 2016. That's a total of 3,207 students in the Northern Territory over eight years. Now, compare that to the Liberals 2,140 projected number of students under their unfair cuts to university placements between the years of 2020 and 2032—no growth there; no future there.


Labor delivers real reform to higher education in this country. Under Labor's new policy, we'll see around 831 more students in Solomon on their way to university. Certainly, when we were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. We opened the door to university to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to go to university. But under this government, with this latest round of cuts, that door is being slammed tightly shut.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:43):  I rise today to speak against the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. First, let's look at what this bill does. It amends the Higher Education Support Act to provide a new minimum repayment income of $44,999. In plain English what that means is that, where previously we had a threshold of somewhere around $53,000, the threshold for repaying a HECS debt has been dropped by close to $8,000. But what does it mean in the real world? It means that when a university graduate is earning about 700 bucks a week, taking that home, they're going to be expected to start paying back their HECS debt. Previously, they started paying back their HECS debt once they were earning more than 700 bucks a week. Now the threshold has been dropped. Let's try and translate what that means for people in the real world. If you're a young person taking home about $700 a week, let's face it, it's not a goldmine. Once you've paid your rent and energy bills, and paid for your groceries, shopping needs and transport needs, there's very little left to spend on anything else. 


Put that in the context of what else this government is doing. We were here last week. This is a government that gave a whopping great big tax cut to people earning over $200,000. If you're earning $200,000 or more, you get an extra $11,000 in your back pocket. Someone on $200,000, $300,000, $500,000, $1 million or $2 million gets an extra $11,000 in their pocket. Yet the government is saying to a young person who has just graduated from university, 'We're going to make life harder for you. We're going to make life harder for people on Newstart. We're going to condemn you to a life of poverty. Indeed, we're going to make it worse than that. We're going to come after you. We're going to allege that you have debts you haven't repaid and in many instances we're going to make your life miserable.' Look at what they're doing in health care, with increasing out-of-pocket costs and the freeze on Medicare. 'We're going to make life harder for people with chronic illnesses. But we're going to make life easier for people who are already earning many hundreds of thousands of dollars.' 


It is a reflection of the priorities of this government. It is no secret that young people are getting royally screwed over by this older generation of LNP politicians. This bill is just one of many examples of a government that is intent on making life harder for young people. Just have a look at the last budget. What did we see in the area of housing, which is one of the great areas of intergenerational inequity that's emerged in our country? We saw nothing. What did we see in terms of addressing insecure work for young people? Again, nothing. Did we see a rise in the youth allowance? No. What did we see to make child care more affordable for young parents? Again, nothing. When it comes to climate change, 'the great moral challenge' of our time, as it was once described by a former prime minister, it was not even mentioned in the recent budget. There is nothing to stop the extinction crisis, or the crisis on the Murray River or the Great Barrier Reef. 


This government is presiding over one of the greatest acts of intergenerational theft ever seen in an Australian parliament. Look at what happens to that young person who's now being to forced to repay their HECS debt when they're earning less than they were previously. They're expected to save for their first home. But of course we know that housing prices have increased exponentially over recent years. We know that many young people are locked out of the property market because of skyrocketing property prices, all because they're competing against not people buying their first home but investors buying their third, fourth or fifth home. That's who they're competing against. So is it any wonder that as a young person in this country you would be looking right now at members of the Liberal and National parties and saying to them, 'You had it pretty good and you're making life tough for us.' This is a rigged system that young people are entering into now, where investors who are buying multiple properties get huge tax breaks, yet somebody who's aspiring to buy their first home gets almost nothing. 


It is time we started to do something about the young people who are going to inherit many of the consequences of decisions made by this parliament. We're seeing a generation of politicians who enjoyed free education, free health care and affordable housing, who were able to pollute the planet for free with no consequences, now saying to young people in this country, 'We had it pretty good, but we're pulling the drawbridge up behind us and you need to clean it up. You need to fix up the mess that we've created.' Right now they're not only asking young people to pay for something they never had to pay for but also condemning young people to a life of struggle because of the decisions that are being made in this parliament. 


We have some very important choices to make. We can recognise that investing in our young people, in the education of the generations that come after us, is an investment in our own country, an investment in the foundations of a decent society and an investment in the prosperity of current and future Australians—the teachers of tomorrow, the nurses of tomorrow, the doctors of tomorrow, the engineers of tomorrow. We can choose to make their life harder or what we can recognise is that we all benefit when we have a well-funded tertiary education sector. We can recognise that those young people who come after us shouldn't be condemned to a life that is made more difficult than the life that we enjoyed. Indeed, one of the very markers of human progress is to look at our young people and say, 'Your life will be easier than the life that we live right now.' We're reversing that trend in this parliament through these acts of intergenerational theft. Look at the housing market, climate, energy policy and, of course, now this retrograde step when it comes to making life more difficult for people who are pursuing tertiary education.


It's time for governments to end this act of intergenerational theft. It's time for governments to stop acting in the interests of the rich and powerful, of corporate Australia. The government should be dropping its plan for corporate tax cuts. It should recognise that what this parliament did last week, when you look at what it's doing today through these changes to the HECS system, is making Australia a less egalitarian, a more unfair and a less caring society. We are here with a duty to act not just for the interests of people who put us here but also for the interests of those generations that follow. And the passage of this bill is emblematic of a government that cares more about its mates at the big end of town than it does about the generations that will follow us.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:51):  I'm always very happy to see young people go to university, succeed and get ahead in their careers. I'm happy for them personally. The other reason I'm happy is that university graduates and undergraduates form a big part—not an entire part but a big part—of the Young Liberal Movement around Australia and in my home state of Queensland and they do a wonderful job. Indeed, as undergraduates, they've taken a real interest in democracy in many universities in Queensland. It is the YLMP who've actually taken over the student advancement leagues in the university—some call it student politics. They do a wonderful job, and I'm delighted for them that the taxpayers are able to send them to university and then, through Labor's HECS, pay it back, and I think that's only very fair.


I wasn't bright enough to go to university and, in those days, you needed a Commonwealth scholarship. My parents weren't wealthy enough to send me to university, so I started work as an articled clerk, working eight hours a day, and then studied externally through the University of Queensland to get my solicitor's qualifications. Can I remind Senator Di Natale and most of the other senators—I say 'most' because I suspect Senator Sterle and a couple of others, like me, never had the opportunity to go to university—as they rail on about asking students to pay back the taxpayers for their education, that the people who are paying for their education are, in many cases, not people who will ever go to university. There are a lot of young people who, for various reasons, cannot get into university and go into the workforce. They start earning a fairly meagre wage but they start paying tax, so the likes—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. The members on the crossbench, the minor parties and the opposition, you have been heard in silence. Under standing order 197, you will hear Senator Macdonald in silence.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  These young people leave school, go straight into work, get a meagre wage, often not a very good wage, and start paying their tax so the likes of Senator McKim and Senator Di Natale can go to university. I begrudge no doctor whatever they earn. Having recently been through the hospital system, I have the greatest admiration for doctors and nurses. But, if Senator Di Natale were any sort of a doctor, he would have, if he had chosen to, been making a small fortune in that profession—and good on him! But it's only fair to the other Australians who paid their taxes for Senator Di Natale's, Senator McKim's and Senator Watt's educations that they should pay it back under Labor's HECS scheme.


I have a niece who left school and started as an apprentice hairdresser. She happily did that; she didn't want to go to university. She's a very good hairdresser. She did her apprenticeship, again, on very meagre wages, but paying tax so that the likes of Senator McKim could go to university. She paid that tax and now she's become a hairdresser, earning a bit more and paying more tax. I think that when we have these debates it's important to understand that young people are not the only ones at university. In the committee stage I will ask the minister for these statistics, but I would guess that there are more young people leaving school who don't go to university than those who do. These senators rail on about university education. As I said, I'm a great supporter of young people going to university; they do a wonderful job in society. Again, I mention what a great job the YLNP, the Young Liberal National Party in Queensland, do, not just in student politics and not just in contributing their arguments but in helping people like me and the Liberal National Party in Queensland to devise policies that keep young people in mind.


I won't delay the Senate much more on this particular bill, but I do ask senators that when they carry on, as we hear Senator Di Natale carrying on, to remember that there are many young Australians who do not have the opportunity they had of going to university. They've paid their taxes, happily, and they would happily pay for the likes of Senator McKim and Senator Di Natale to go to university. But we have to bear in mind the contribution they make, and the fairness, I might say, of Labor's Higher Education Contribution Scheme of a decade or so ago. I think that's fair. I do ask that when senators are debating higher education they keep in mind that there are many young people, who, for various reasons, never have the opportunity of participating in higher education.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (12:58):  It's always a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald in a debate. I'm sure that I'm not the only member of this chamber, or the outside world, who has noticed that every single speech he gives at the moment is directed at the Young LNP. I wonder if that could be because of his preselection being up for debate right now and his dependence on the Young LNP for those votes.


Of course, he spends the rest of his time in this chamber consistently voting for measures that hurt young people, including the bill that we are discussing. But—oh!—will he use this chamber to grovel to the people who will determine his preselection. We can only assume that other Queensland LNP senators are worried about him and are giving him every opportunity to stay in this chamber so that he can be the first senator in this chamber to reach the age of 80 for some period of time. From my point of view, long may his reign he continue, because every time he gets on his feet I can hear the Labor primary vote going up! So I very much welcome Senator Macdonald's participations in these debates.


On a more serious note, I do rise, as other Labor speakers have done, to oppose this Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, which is just the latest attempt by this LNP government to again hurt the interests of young people. What this bill is about, more than anything, is putting more and more of the cost of university education onto young people, or onto those who undertake higher education, and forcing them to pay it back at a much earlier stage.


If there was a key point to Senator Macdonald's speech—other than, 'Please Young LNP, vote for me in the forthcoming preselection'—it was that we shouldn't be asking people who don't have the opportunity to go through university to shoulder the burden of paying for that university. I'm disappointed to hear Senator Macdonald have that attitude. I hope that's not an attitude that is reflected among other speakers on the government side in this debate, because many of us who have had the good fortune to attend university, like me, do not come from families of great privilege but come from families who didn't themselves have the opportunity to attend university straight out of school and did exactly what Senator Macdonald talked about and put themselves through work or night school. 


In some cases they did have an opportunity to attend a university at a later stage of life. But I know many people who haven't had an opportunity to go to university and who do not begrudge for one moment that opportunity being given to other people. In some cases it is their own children, or their nephews and nieces. In some cases it is the opportunity for their spouses to go to university later in life. People who go to university do not begrudge paying a contribution through the taxation system for someone to do an apprenticeship to become a hairdresser, an electrician or a chef, because that is something where a taxpayer gives people an opportunity to get ahead in life. 


If there is a dividing line between Labor senators and those from the Liberal and National parties, on the other side of this chamber, it is whether we believe that we actually are all about an individual or about a greater society and a greater community. We on the Labor side will always argue that we're not only here to advantage individuals' interests; we're also here to advantage the community overall. The higher education system, along with other aspects of our education system—TAFE, training, work experience, all those opportunities—is about giving young people, but also those who need to retrain later in their career, an opportunity to get ahead. 


I'm currently chairing a Senate inquiry looking at the future of work. There is a big debate that is going on in our community, and we are looking at the fact that, as automation comes online, as we get greater technology coming into the workplace, there are going to be more and more people whose jobs are disrupted and, in some cases, eliminated. Without giving away key findings of that report, which is yet to be tabled in this chamber, it is very clear from the evidence we've received that more and more Australians, regardless of their background, are going to need retraining and upskilling to be able to simply get a job or retain a job in the new and emerging world of work that we have. 


Measures like this higher education bill the government is trying to pass not only disadvantage younger people who are looking to undertake university studies straight out of school; they're also going to impact the many people, and the growing number of people, who will need to retrain from their previous occupation simply to have a job into the future. 


So I ask Senator Macdonald and other Liberal senators to just reflect on the fact that, although they might like to come in here and play a bit of class warfare and try to argue that they are on the side of battlers who don't ever have the opportunity to go to university and who shouldn't have to pay for those who do, the fact is that we all have an interest in having a highly educated community, whether it be people educated through universities, TAFEs, apprenticeships or other forms of education and training that people obtain on the job. That is not only in the interests of the individual who is getting that education and training; it is also in the interests of our entire community to make sure that we are preparing people for the new world of work, which is increasingly going to require higher levels of skill and knowledge, and that's not what this bill is doing. What this bill is doing is actually putting more of burden on students to pay for their own education. 


I have never objected to the idea of students making a contribution to their own education. Going back to student politics days, it wasn't always a popular opinion on the left-hand side of politics that students should make some personal contribution to their education, but I truly believe that, where we've got to at the moment—with the fees we're asking students to pay at the early stages of their career and with the requirement to repay those loans that they take out to undertake those studies—is a disincentive for poorer and working-class kids to have the opportunity to go through a university education. 


Senator Macdonald and others might think that they are defending the interests of working-class and poorer people in supporting these kinds of measures, but what they are actually doing is taking university back to the pre-Whitlam days, when it was the preserve of rich kids only. If we're not careful, we're going to discourage kids from poorer and working-class backgrounds from undertaking university studies, even if they get the marks at school that would enable them to do so.


Specifically this bill will make students start repaying their higher education loans once they hit an income level of $45,000, well below average weekly earnings, at the very time when new graduates, if they are younger people, are looking at trying to save up for a house deposit, which we know is becoming harder still as a result of this government's failure to deal with housing affordability. At the very time when younger students are coming out of university, trying to put together a house deposit, trying to pay off other debts that they may have incurred while they were studying, through credit cards and other forms of debt, and while they are looking, in some cases, at starting a family—also an expensive proposition, as all of us who have a family know—at the very time when some of the students are finding it difficult to make ends meet, this government wants to throw another debt at them and start forcing them to repay the loans that they have taken out to undertake university studies.


Let's remember that, by and large, the only students who are taking out loans to undertake higher education are those from lower and middle-income families. If you're fortunate enough to come from a rich family, you've got parents who can pay what used to be known as HECS and now your HELP loans. But it's working-class and middle-class kids who are being faced with the prospect of having to repay their loans at a much earlier stage of their career while they are also trying to save up for other things like a house or a family.


This bill will also impose, for the first time, a lifetime borrowing limit, to constrain students' ability to undertake further study if it's going to be funded by loans. As I say, anyone who pays any attention to the Australian workplace of the present and of the future knows that, in order to get a job and keep a job in the future, Australians are going to need more education, not less. There are so many jobs that haven't required a post-school qualification that are disappearing in our economy as a result of technology, as a result of offshoring and as a result of other changes, including as a result of this government's failure to defend the car industry. We've seen Telstra announce 7,000 job losses over the last week. The banks are shedding thousands of jobs too. What is needed for people who are being made redundant from their existing employers, to ensure that they will get a new job in the future, is more education, not less. But what does this government want to do? It wants to say, 'Sorry; if you want to go and get some more education so that you can get another job, we're not going to continue supporting you in the form of loans.' Why would any government do that? Why would any government put in place active steps that are going to discourage people from undertaking further education and training, when that is exactly what people need to do to be able to compete for jobs in the future?


In essence, this bill is simply a continuation of the trend that we have seen from this government to put more and more of the burden of university education , TAFE education, traineeships and apprenticeships onto students themselves rather than onto all of us, as part of the community. This government has continued to cut general funding to universities as well as putting more pressure on students to pay more.


One of the most concerning aspects of these cuts to universities that we have seen from the government is the impact they are particularly having on regional Australia and regional Australians. Very often I come into this place and highlight the ineptitude of National Party senators and members of parliament, who say that they are the defenders of regional and rural Australians and consistently get done over by their Liberal counterparts, who are very good at putting through measures which help high-income people in big cities around Australia, to the disadvantage of people in rural and regional areas. This is another example. Universities in regional Australia have played a very important role in preparing the local community for higher skilled jobs, which tend to pay more. Also, they are very big employers in their own right in regional Australia. Many of the regional universities across Australia are some of the biggest employers in their towns and their regions, so if we're cutting funding to regional universities, as is happening under this government, what we're actually doing is cutting jobs in universities and making it harder for regional Australians to get the university education that they will need in the future.


We already know that rural and regional Australians have some of the lowest levels of participation in higher education anywhere in the country. We all know that fewer people in regional and rural Australia than in big cities get the opportunity to go to university. Wouldn't a National Party member or a National Party senator who's keen to get behind rural and regional Australia actually want to be fighting for more funding for regional universities and making it easier for regional students to get a university education? That's what they should be doing, but of course that would involve standing up to the Liberal Party, which we know our National Party members and senators are completely incapable of doing.


The cuts that this government is imposing on regional universities are twice as bad as those we're seeing on universities in the big cities. If you tally it up across the country, you find that regional universities are going to be suffering cuts of seven per cent to their funding, on average, while universities in the big cities are only suffering cuts of 3½ per cent. I don't think we should be cutting funding to the universities in the big cities either. I think we have a massive national interest in increasing funding to universities, as we do in increasing funding to TAFEs, for apprenticeships and for traineeships, but this government has the opposite view. It wants to cut back because it's got to find a way to pay for its big-business tax cuts somehow, so it says, 'Let's take money out of universities, traineeships and apprenticeships,' even though in the long term it will do massive harm to our economy, 'and instead shovel it into the pockets of our mates in the banks and big business.'


Of all the universities across the country, the university that is worst hit by the cuts this government is making to university funding is Central Queensland University. Its main campus is in Rockhampton, but it has campuses in Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg and other parts of Central Queensland. In fact, it's been so successful that it's now got many campuses all around the country, particularly attracting international students, who bring more revenue into the university. But, as a reward for its success, what are the government doing? They are cutting its funding by 15 per cent—more than double the amount that regional universities are getting cut overall and, on my maths, four to five times worse than the cuts we're seeing to urban universities.


If you look at who is representing the electorates that Central Queensland University is largely based in—in Central Queensland—you see that, of course, they're all National Party members. You've got George Christensen representing Dawson, Michelle Landry representing Capricornia, Ken O'Dowd representing Flynn and Keith Pitt representing Hinkler. Every single one of them is a National Party member. But have you heard anything from any of them about the cuts their own government is making to the university that is employing hundreds and thousands of people across their communities; and that is giving kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, who have never had a parent go to university, the opportunity to go to university and be the first person in their family to have an opportunity for a university education? Not a peep—because what would that involve? It would involve standing up to the Liberal Party. They never do it on university cuts; they never do it on health cuts; they never do it on school cuts; they never do it on apprenticeship cuts; and they never do it on cuts to big-business taxes, which are not going to benefit Central Queensland either. I really wonder why these people are in parliament. I thought the job of being a parliamentarian was to come to Canberra to defend the interests of your community, whether it be on universities, TAFEs, schools or hospitals, but these people just seem to want to get a flight down here and spend a nice week in the cold in Canberra. Frankly, I'd rather be spending a week in Central Queensland, where it's a lot warmer than here in Canberra. If you are going to come to Canberra and be cold, you might as well actually do your job properly and fight for the interests of Central Queenslanders.


The Vice-Chancellor of Central Queensland University has labelled the cuts that this government is making 'a tax on success'. I thought that the government—the Liberal and National party members—were generally about no tax and limiting tax. The vice-chancellor of this university has labelled the cuts a tax on success. So maybe any one of those four members of parliament or Senator Canavan, who's also based in Central Queensland, can listen to the vice-chancellor of the university there and do something about these cuts. I'm pleased that Russell Robertson, the Labor candidate for Capricornia, is actually doing something and speaking up about the need for these funding cuts to be reversed, because, unfortunately, the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, has yet again been missing in action on this issue. It is good to see there is at least one political representative who is taking up the issue.


The same can be said of Griffith University, whose main campus is on the Gold Coast, where my office is based. They're facing funding cuts of $92 million. Again, has anyone heard a peep out of any of the Gold Coast LNP members of parliament? Just like Central Queensland is currently a total stranglehold for the LNP, so is the Gold Coast, but these people aren't doing anything to deserve their places in parliament. They are completely lazy, completely complacent and completely happy to just nod along and let Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison make whatever funding cuts they want to make to their universities, even though it's their own constituents who miss out. You've really got to wonder why any of these people bothered getting elected to parliament if they don't want to come to Canberra and make a difference for their communities.


The real effect of this bill, in forcing students to repay their higher education loans at an earlier stage and in imposing a lifetime limit on the amount that students can borrow to undertake university and other forms of education, is that students are going to miss out on the opportunity to go through university or to go through vocational education and training through TAFE, apprenticeships and traineeships. At the very time that we are trying to get more Australians to undertake more study to prepare themselves for the new world of work—for the high-tech, high-knowledge jobs that our country is going to be producing—this government is cutting funding to those institutions and forcing students to pay more and to pay earlier in their career. It's the complete opposite of what we should be doing as a country. It's for that reason that I and the other Labor senators will be opposing this bill.


In conclusion, I also want to point out that this bill is a continuation of another trend we're seeing from this government. What this bill does is force students to repay their loans at an earlier stage, and in the background we've also got massive funding cuts that this government is making to universities and traineeships. Right now it's students in universities who are in the gunsights of this government, but it really doesn't matter what kind of young person you are in this country—you are in the sights of this government. It's got to come up with ways of paying for the big-business tax cuts that it wants to give, and the way it's doing it is increasingly by going after young people. If you're a young person who is working, this government is coming after your penalty rates, with more cuts to penalty rates coming in another five days. If you're an unemployed young person, this government is coming after you by tightening eligibility and wanting to drug-test you. If you're in training, this government is cutting funding for apprenticeships and cutting funding for TAFE, making it harder for the young hairdressers, chefs, boilermakers, electricians and chippies to get an opportunity to start their career. Now, with this bill, if you're a university student, it's coming after you by forcing you to pay more for your education and by forcing you to pay it back at an earlier stage. Why is it that this government has such a problem with young people? No matter what kind of young person you are, this government is coming after you, and, at the same time, it's using the funding it's stripping away from you to pay for a tax cut for big business. We all know what this government's priorities are. They are to support its friends in big business, even if it's young people who suffer. The parents of those young people are noticing it, as well.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:18):  I rise to contribute to this debate today in relation to the government's Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, and to put clearly on the record the Greens' opposition to this piece of legislation. We all know that this government goes on and on about not wanting political debate to get drawn into class warfare, and yet what we've got right in front of us today is a piece of legislation that takes the heart out of our higher education support scheme, right down to making it more and more difficult for students who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to get a university education, and, even if they do, to never be able to do further training or study because of the difficulty of being able to afford to pay back this loan.


Over and over again we hear this government talk about aspiration. Last week we heard from the Prime Minister, with all of his might during the income tax debate, that this was about aspiration and supporting aspirational Australians. Yet, with one fell swoop, this legislation cuts out the ability for young people right across this country to be aspirational about what level of education they get, how they go about getting it and how they set themselves up for the future, because what this bill does is widen the gap between the rich and the poor. It widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots. It says to young people in this country, 'Unless you've got a bank balance, probably funded by your parents, that is big enough to support your university education, you're going to have to do it pretty tough.' That's what this bill does, and it does it in two ways.


Firstly, it reduces the threshold at which students have to start paying back the debt on their university education. At the moment, on average, students have to start paying back their debt once they start earning $53,000. But this bill wants to drop that down. It wants to drop it down so far that it falls well below the average weekly earnings. It wants to drop it down to about $45,000, which is not much better than the minimum wage in this country. It is astounding that what the government wants to do here is punish students and young people who've gone out of their way to get a university education. It's going to punish them for going to university if they didn't have enough money to pay the up-front fees or to clear the HECS debt on the day they graduated or if they didn't ask mum and dad to foot the bill.


The second thing that this piece of legislation does is cap the amount of money that a student can borrow in order to further their education. At a time when we know that retraining is absolutely essential, when young people are going to enter the workforce in one job and change positions, careers and skills over and over again throughout the journey of their working life, this bill makes it more difficult for young people to get retraining and to further their education as life goes on.


Here, in this place, I think it's really important to look at the lack of vision that this government has under Malcolm Turnbull and the education minister, Simon Birmingham, for aspirational young people and for investing in education in this country. Compare that with the vision that is put forward by the Greens. We argue for an investment in lifelong learning. We know that investing in education is the best bang for buck that any government can spend. That starts with early childhood learning and goes right through school, tertiary education and lifelong learning. We know that we have to enable members of our community to train, to engage in the workforce and to retrain. That is the changing nature of working life right around us. And it's not just here in Australia, of course; it's happening right around the world.


Putting a handbrake on the ability of young people in this country, or anyone, to go back to university to complete another degree and further their skills is a stupid, stupid idea and shows a lack of vision from a government that says it cares about aspiration. It's all lip-service. Perhaps it's all about aspiration for the millionaires and the big income earners and the big banks, but there's no aspiration being put forward by this government in relation to allowing young Australians to get an education to further their opportunities and to be job ready for the workforce.


This bill comes at a time when there is a widening gap already between the haves and the have-nots. Inequality in Australia is getting worse. We know that two-thirds of students live in poverty. Poverty, of course, is one of those areas where, once you're in it, it's very, very hard to get out. It's a tricky cycle. And what this bill does is make it even harder for young people to get out of that cycle. It locks them in. If you're a young person who needs income support from the government, through youth allowance, in order to study, because your parents can't afford it, and if you need to take out a university loan because you're not lucky enough to have a mummy and daddy who are able to sign the cheques at the university down the road, then this bill locks you into a cycle of poverty right from the beginning.


It's not about whether a young person has enough spare cash in their back pocket to have a beer at the uni bar. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about being able to put food in one's belly, pay for the rent so that you've got a roof over your head, pay for the public transport that you're going to need to get to classes every day or wind back on study to take more part-time work or full-time work, paid at a ridiculously low rate, often with very few penalty rates—this government wants to cut them. We are keeping young people trapped in a cycle of poverty at a time when we should be supporting them to take up more and more opportunities for education. In fact, the best way of dealing with inequality would be to better fund education, to ensure that it's more accessible and to ensure that it's affordable for people so that, when students are studying, they are able to actually focus on their studies. This isn't just about being able to make the university degree itself affordable; it's also about ensuring that students have the support in order to be a student.


Youth allowance is ridiculously low in this country. It is well below the poverty line, so of course you can't live on it. University students struggle every day to be able to go to university, study, get an education and further their careers in order to contribute to society, while struggling on pitiful amounts under youth allowance. We need a better deal for young people in this country, particularly those who are doing everything they can to get an education and to contribute to society.


Of course, higher education isn't all about just what the market gains or about what profits can be gained. This bill sends a very clear message that that's all this government care about, that they only really care about whether there is a commercial return for a university student's university loan. What happened to the days when we understood that educating the next generation was good, in and of itself, for the society and for the community? Education is essential for a decent society. It shouldn't be simply measured against whether the government of the day thinks it offers the certainty of a commercial dividend. 


We heard Senator Macdonald speaking on this bill. And while he talked about the importance of having young National and Liberal members educated at university—I think he was doing, as Senator Watt suggested, a pitch for his preselection rant—ultimately he missed the key point, which is that any young person in this country should have the opportunity to go to university, to get an education and to contribute back to the community and the society. We, as a decent society, pay for the opportunity for some of those young people to go to university because we know we get a dividend back in what that contributes to the community.


Nurses don't earn very much. They should earn more. But would anyone in this place begrudge a university graduate who's done a nursing degree next time they're confronted with them at an emergency ward in a hospital? Is the Prime Minister going to turn around to the next nurse he sees when he falls ill or a member of his family falls ill and say, 'But have you paid back your university debt yet?' Of course not, because we know the role of these people in society is absolutely paramount and essential. 


It shouldn't be that, just because you're not rich enough to pay your university degree off either upfront or quickly, you don't deserve support from the government. University education is getting more and more expensive. These days, the average fees that students pay and debts that students graduate with range anywhere from $30,000 to $40,000—sometimes more. If you've studied medicine, you're more likely to have a debt of $60,000 to $70,000. If you do a combined degree, your debt is closer to $100,000. University students today are graduating with debts of this magnitude, and yet we expect them to start paying back their debt when they've just exited university, they've just entered the workforce and they're only earning $45,000 before tax. This is absurd. Either we value education in this country or we don't. Either we value the dedication and determination of young people in Australia to go to university, get an education and become our nurses, our doctors and our teachers or we don't.


Why is it that rich kids, because money doesn't matter for them, are the only ones who can pick which university degrees they would like? The reality is that those lower paid jobs are essential for our community but those who are in them still aren't paid what they are worth. Teachers, nurses and early childhood educators are the people who are going to be graduating with debts and having to pay them back on pitiful wages. It is simply unfair. Inequality is a problem in this country, and the sooner this government works that out the better. If they don't, they are going to cop it at the ballot box. Australians are not silly. The voters can see what's going on here. The government has prioritised giving $140 billion in tax cuts which primarily help high-income earners. Later on today, we're going to be debating a bill that gives $85 billion in tax cuts to big corporations—and then the government turn around and say, 'We don't have enough money left to fund education.' It's absurd. It says everything you need to know about the priorities of this government. They don't care about young people, and they certainly don't care about young people from low-income families. They'd prefer that teachers, nurses and early childhood educators went off and did their university degrees, started paying back their loans and then shut up and weren't heard from again.


The problem with this bill is that the government's argument is that these thresholds need to be lowered because somehow, apparently, wage growth is stalling, yet the argument for why we need to give income tax cuts to the rich is that wage growth is going to explode. This government picks and chooses which arguments it wants to run on a bill being debated based on what is going to satisfy the big end of town. 'Let's keep low-income workers down and let's keep kids from low-income households locked out of the system.' This government has already cut $2.2 billion from our university sector. Not only are they making it harder for students to be able to cover the costs of their education; they're making it harder and harder for universities to cover that gap.


I fear that we are sliding into a future Australia that says, 'If you come from a low-income family, if you're not part of the rich kids who went to the best private schools in this country, then you don't deserve a quality education; you can stay over there.' I'm worried that we're sliding towards an Australia that says, 'You can only go to university if your parents are rich.' I'm worried that we're sliding towards a future Australia that says, 'If you come from a poor household, you should stay poor. Don't get in our way. Do the jobs we don't want to do, but don't complain.' That's not the kind of Australia I want, and I don't believe for a second that it's the kind of Australia that anyone else out there in the real world wants either. The Prime Minister talked about aspiration. Well, this is the exact opposite. Aspiration for some but not for all is what this bill says. That's the attitude of the Prime Minister. It is going to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and that is not the Australia that I want to see.


At a time when the workforce is so rapidly changing, we need investment in our education system across the board—in our early childhood sector, in our schools, in our universities and in our TAFEs. It's going to be a normal thing for people to have to re-enter education and get retraining. Why on earth we would be making that harder is beyond me. It shows a total lack of vision from this government—unless, of course, the vision is to look after the rich and shut out the poor. You can't read this piece of legislation as anything else. It is part of that narrative from this Prime Minister and his government, and it is the exact opposite of the decent Australia that we should all be striving for.


Tax cuts for big banks and big corporations, and tax cuts for millionaires—and then all the money is spent, so there's nothing left to be spent on educating the next generation. That is what is before us today. This is a matter of priorities. I say to the crossbench: Don't fall for this. Don't fall for this false argument from the Prime Minister that we can't afford to invest in our young people. We can afford it, but it means that we can't afford tax cuts for the banks. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate notes that:


(a) the Government is at war with young people, pursuing policies that put the aspirations of young people to get a degree, own a home and pay the bills further out of reach;


(b) the Government is cutting $2.2 billion from universities around the country, without a vote in the Parliament or a mandate from the public;


(c) this bill makes students pay back more of their debt sooner, rather than doing anything to assist people with the cost of living while studying or to boost wages upon graduation; and


(d) no government that genuinely supports aspiration would make it harder to study at university"".

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (13:38):  I'm pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. Labor opposes this bill in its current form, and I'll explain why to the Senate shortly. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the work of my colleagues Senator O'Neill, Senator Marshall and Senator Collins—the Labor members of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. Their dissenting report sets out very clearly and cogently the many problems with this bill as it stands.


Next, I want to point out to the Senate the proud record of past Labor governments in the great work of broadening access to higher education in Australia. In 1940, when Australia had only six small and very elitist universities, John Curtin's wartime Labor government dramatically increased the number of scholarships available to students from government schools to enter university and also allowed women to apply for these scholarships for the first time. When Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister in 1972, Australia was still served by a small number of elite, fee-charging universities. Although the university sector certainly expanded during the Menzies era, our higher education system was still geared to the economy of the 1950s, not the new knowledge based economy which was emerging in the 1970s. Most university students still came from private schools and upper-income families. The only way students from low-income families could get to university was by winning a scholarship. Gough Whitlam and his education minister, Kim Beazley, made university education free and introduced the first student funding scheme, the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, known as TEAS. These two reforms revolutionised higher education in Australia. A whole generation of bright students from government schools were able to go to university who would not otherwise have been able to do so. They included some of the very same people who now want to withdraw that same access from the current generation of young Australians.


By the late 1980s, it was apparent that Australia's massively expanded higher education system could not be sustained on an entirely free basis. Rather than introducing up-front university fees, as the Liberal opposition of the time wanted to do, the Hawke government, through its visionary education minister, John Dawkins, introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme in 1989. Under this scheme, a fee was charged to all university students and the Commonwealth paid the balance. But students could defer payment of this fee and repay it through the tax system when their income exceeded a threshold level. This measure preserved the access to higher education created by the Whitlam government while requiring those students who gained high-income employment after graduation to repay some of the cost of their education once they could afford to do. This was a great Labor reform, which has stood the test of time.


The Howard government brought in several retrograde measures designed to undermine the principles established by Gough Whitlam of equal access and no up-front fees. They greatly increased the fees charged under the renamed HELP scheme and also allowed the universities to bring back full, up-front fees for some courses. The Howard changes have allowed the older universities to reclaim their elite status, becoming largely fee-paying institutions. And I will add there that, in fact, because those universities have become largely fee-paying institutions and because of the cuts to the higher education sector, those universities have, of course, had to go offshore to look for students, and we now see the result of this. We see that, in fact, some universities are tailoring courses for particular cohorts of overseas students, and we have seen a recent example where one higher education institution apologised for a supposedly incorrect use of course material when it was brought to the attention of the Chinese embassy here. I think this is one of the consequences that couldn't be seen at the time, but that is what happens when higher education institutions have to seek out fee-paying students in order to sustain their business model.


As a result of these changes, the ability of students from lower-income families to access universities—and, particularly, the more prestigious universities—declined, and students also amassed increasingly onerous levels of debt. It has always been obvious that the Liberal Party wants to return Australia to a two-tier higher education system in which high-prestige courses and high-prestige universities, which naturally lead to higher-income careers, are once again reserved for the children of the affluent elite, while everyone else is channelled off into lower-prestige universities or into the TAFE system, even as that system is being systematically attacked by Liberal state governments.


The last Labor government took a stand against this retrograde trend. In 2009, Julia Gillard, as education minister, introduced the demand driven system. Universities were allowed to enrol unlimited numbers of students in virtually all undergraduate courses in order to increase educational attainment and student equity. Labor's reforms aimed to increase the proportion of young Australians with undergraduate degrees to 40 per cent and raise the proportion of students from lower income families to 20 per cent. This objective was funded through the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships program. This reform was spectacularly successful. University participation rose enormously without any sacrifice of quality. Australia quickly moved from an elite higher education system to a mass higher education system. The proportion of students from lower income families rose from 16.2 per cent to 17.7 per cent between 2009 and 2014. In the same period, the overall number of students from lower income families increased by 44 per cent. Since 2009, the number of Indigenous undergraduate students has increased by 60 per cent. The number of students with a disability has increased by nearly 80 per cent.




Senator O'Neill:
  It's a wonderful outcome.




Senator KITCHING:
  It is a wonderful outcome. Andrew Harvey, Director of the Access and Achievement Research Unit at La Trobe University, wrote in June 2016: 'The improvements in equity are even more impressive when considered in historical context. The level of low socioeconomic status participation was virtually unchanged from 1990, when data was first collected, until the introduction of the demand driven system. Class is intractable but not immovable.'


Sadly, however, we now, once again, have a government which does not see greater equity in access to higher education as a priority or even a desirable objective. We've seen during the tax debate in recent weeks that this government's overriding priority is to reduce the amount of tax paid by corporations and high-income earners—the people who essentially fund the Liberal Party and the people who vote for it. That means government spending has to be cut accordingly and government revenue from other sources increased. University education is once again to be a privilege rather than a right; and access is, once again, to be cut off for students from lower income families and government schools.


This bill must be seen in that context. Its primary motive is to cut costs to fund the government's high-income tax cuts. Its secondary motive is to roll back the Labor government's reforms and reduce equity in our higher education system. The dissenting report by the Labor members of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill sets out in detail our objections to this bill. Firstly, we oppose the government's move to lower the HELP repayment threshold to $45,000—only $9,000 a year more than the minimum wage. This completely contradicts the original premise of the HECS and HELP schemes, which was that students should only start repaying some of costs of their university education when they reach an income level high enough to enable them to do so while also meeting the other demands that people face at that age, such as buying a first home and raising a family.


As the dissenting report says, the government has made no sufficient case for changes to HELP beyond budget savings. The report quotes Professor Bruce Chapman, an economist and academic, who designed the original HECS student loan system. He testified: 'I think it is unfortunate when people focus on the stock of the debt. It is really not very interesting. What's interesting is the overall amount that is not repaid. If that number is even at 25 per cent, there is no crisis here, there is no crisis in the system.'


Labor also opposes the government's proposal in this bill to introduce a limit on how much students can borrow under HELP. Currently, students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places have no limit to the amount they can defer through the HELP scheme. The proposal in this bill would create a borrowing limit across all of the HELP programs. The shadow minister for higher education, Ms Terri Butler, made it clear in her speech on this bill that Labor does not oppose the principle of loan limits operating as price signals. But we believe that the proposal in this bill is too rigid. It ignores the fact that our rapidly changing economy and workforce require more and more students to take on additional study throughout their lives to meet the changing needs of the labour market.


This proposal also ignores the fact that the universities—in particular, the elite universities—are now free to charge whatever fees they like and that there is a growing gap between what university courses cost and the assistance available to students to pay for them. As a result, a student in graduate debt is a major concern and has the potential to be a drag on the economy. Young families cannot buy homes if they are crippled by student debt. Labor does not want a system where students have to take out commercial loans to pay for the gap between fees set by universities and the loan borrowing amount. This bill does nothing to discourage reckless high-fee settings. For these reasons Labor opposes this bill and urges the Senate to reject it.


While we're on the subject of higher education, I want to say something about the current controversy over the Australian National University's decision to reject a proposed course on Western civilisation sponsored by the Ramsay Centre. As with so many other policy debates in Australia at present, this debate has become yet another episode in the culture wars. On the one hand, supporters of the Ramsay Centre course say that the ANU has surrendered to a coterie of left-wing academics and students who hate Western civilisation and all of its works, while admiring or at least excusing the behaviour of totalitarian regimes, and who fear that such a course would undermine their ideological hegemony in the universities. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that such a course would be mere apologetics for the West's sorry history of imperialism, colonialism, militarism, racism, and all of the other isms, and would ignore the history of non-Western civilisations, people of colour, women and other oppressed people. Both of these positions are, of course, caricatures and neither of them is very helpful in understanding the issues involved.


I'm a big fan of Western civilisation and I think that our universities should be teaching students about it and about the Jewish, Christian, Greek and Roman foundations of Western culture, religion, politics, literature and art. I studied both Latin and Greek at school, and, perhaps less usefully, Mediaeval French as well. My life and career have been hugely enlightened and enriched by my studies of these subjects. There is no contradiction in teaching these things and also teaching about non-Western civilisations, particularly the civilisations of our Asian neighbours. Indeed it can only help with diversity and understanding of different cultures if we study a variety of courses and if we study different cultures. Australian universities are perfectly capable of teaching both and Australian students are perfectly capable of learning both—nor should any course on any type of civilisation shy away from teaching about the failings of those civilisations.


To go back to the bill: we don't want to discourage people from learning. I would argue that we need more, not less. We don't need cuts, and we don't need a more-euphemistically-phrased freeze on higher education. The sector needs more support, not less. Why don't we not give tax cuts to big banks and foreign billionaires? Why give $80 billion in tax cuts to those groups and not support the education of everyone we possibly can in our society with a merits based system?

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-06-26,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (13:53):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this chamber in support of the proposed change to the student loan system through the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill. After much consideration I have come to the view that the lower loan repayment threshold is preferable to other higher education cuts. I doubt that future students entering tertiary education would appreciate fewer opportunities and perhaps a lower quality education than those who are already reaping the benefits intellectually as well as financially from their time at university. 


If the savings from this measure, estimated by the government to be $231 million, are not legislated, the money will have to come from elsewhere in the education budget. At a time of growing debt and with the budget struggling to return to balance, it is important that this bill rein in the rising costs to government of HELP loans. Total HELP lending is growing rapidly, and I agree with the need for repayments to keep pace with HELP lending growth. Those who are reasonably able to pay off their HELP loans should do so to avoid the student loan system becoming unsustainable for future generations and to avoid our loan systems becoming unnecessarily costly to taxpayers, as the Grattan Institute argued in its submission to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee.


We should also take into account the point raised by Grattan, that HELP's largest cost to the taxpayer is debt not expected to be repaid. In 2012, HELP debt was $25 billion, whereas today it is $55 billion. Of that $55 billion, nearly $20 billion is doubtful debt. The evidence is significant, however. On its own, it's not sufficient reason to vote for the bill. Fortunately, this bill does a good job, in my view, in balancing economic sustainability with fairness to students and to those repaying student loans.


I have decided to accept the readjustment of the current repayment pathway. Growing slowly upwards from a fair one per cent repayment rate for those earning $45,000, this legislation offers a smoother repayment process. Those earning between $57,000 and $98,000 will see considerable benefit, and high-income earners will pay their fair share as well. The legislation will couple lower repayment rates across the board for the vast majority of lower- and middle-income earners with smoother incremental rises. That will give significant relief to many, at the same time as increasing the amount of loans that are ultimately repaid. For example: under the current system, from 1 July this year someone on an annual income of $58,378 would face a repayment rate of four per cent. By contrast, if this bill were passed we would see the same person pay a repayment rate of 2.5 per cent. That is a saving of $876 for that individual per year.


I would also like to draw greater attention to the fact that those struggling to pay off their HELP loan do have the option to defer their repayments or to set up a repayment plan that would provide appropriate relief. As I understand it, the vast bulk of those who apply for hardship relief are successful. The hardship provisions provide a responsible safety net to ensure that this bill does not apply undue burden on those in hardship. I support efforts to increase the visibility of the hardship arrangements so that those who need relief get it. I would encourage my fellow senators to consider the hardship provision when weighing up the impact that the lower repayment threshold might have.


Overall, the economic sustainability of the student loan system needs to be balanced with fairness to students, and this bill achieves that balance. With regard to the amendments put forward by Senator Bernardi: I too agree that public and private universities should be treated fairly. His amendments would level the playing field for student access to both private and public universities. The current 25 per cent fee for students at Torrens University Australia in my home state of South Australia, Bond University, the University of Notre Dame Australia and the University of Divinity should be scrapped. One strong reason to vote for the Australian Conservatives amendments is that they would encourage fairer access to students across the board to attend programs that are best fit for them.


It seems to me that the current 25 per cent fee could act as a disincentive for some students when weighing up whether to apply to a private university. A consequence of removing the fee could be that more eligible candidate students, and from less affluent backgrounds, for example, might choose to apply to private universities if they felt that those programs would give them most benefit. I would encourage my fellow senators to vote for the Australian Conservatives amendments on the grounds of fairness—primarily for our students but also for educational providers.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:58):  Today we're talking about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. We've come a long way with education, but we've still got a long way to go. This is about students having to pay back to the taxpayers the loans that they've taken out. It has to be sustainable for future generations, and that's what the discussion here is about today.


A lot of Australians are grateful for the help from taxpayers and for having the opportunity to go on to further education. We have come to a stage in Australia where I believe that we are pushing people onto further education—people who do not have the qualifications and who should not be in universities because they're not able to do it. I think there needs to be a harder test on people before they go into universities. They're taking out exorbitant loans and they are not able to pay them back, and a lot of people are not able to get jobs when they finish.

The PRESIDENT 

(
15:02
)
:  I would like to respond to the question asked by Senator Wong in the chamber last Thursday, following reports in the media relating to a member of the public being asked to remove or cover up clothing that displayed a union logo. All people entering Parliament House are subject to security procedures, and prohibited items are not to be brought into Parliament House. Items that might cause danger to people or damage property, might be used to disrupt order or decorum or compromise security arrangements must be cloaked before entering into Parliament House. These items include weapons, aerosol or paint cans, laser pointers and obvious protest paraphernalia. Protest paraphernalia, including clothing with specific messages, if allowed into Parliament House, may, depending on the circumstances, have the effect of bringing the protest into Parliament House and can be used to disrupt the order of the parliament. Operating Policies and Procedures No. 10.5 notes that if a person is found inside the building with a prohibited item, Parliamentary Security Service staff ask that person to surrender that item.


I'm advised that, on 19 June, a protest organised by UnionsACT was conducted on the authorised assembly area within the parliamentary precinct. On 20 June, I'm advised a PSS officer noticed potential protest material or paraphernalia being taken into the building through the main front screening point by a small group. The PSS officer spoke to a passholder and the visitors who owned the material before contacting the team leader. One of the visitors was carrying a poster that was promptly passed to the passholder who accompanied the group. The clothing worn by the visitors displayed material that related to the demonstration of the previous day. After speaking with the PSS officer, the team leader took into account these matters and made an assessment that their clothing was potentially protest paraphernalia. The clothing in question contained more than a small logo. Where a personal assessment is made that an item of clothing worn by a person may be protest paraphernalia, they are requested to cover it, change the item or turn it inside out.


The team leader approached the visitors and requested that clothing displaying protest material be covered, changed or turned inside out. The team leader suggested to the group that they could use the nearest bathrooms for changing purposes. After some discussion, I'm advised the visitors appeared to comply before leaving the area. I'm advised the PSS team leader was asked if his decision was because their clothes displayed union logos. The team leader explained that displaying a union logo was not the issue. The issue with the clothing was the slogans and images contained on the clothing. From the inquiries made as a result of this question, and the media report, the department has determined that the manner in which the relevant security service team leader addressed the situation was professional and courteous.


As is evident from the many union representatives that attend Parliament House on a regular basis, there is no policy precluding access by association, nor does the policy prohibit the display of logos. Parliament House receives thousands of visitors each day. The Parliamentary Security Service officers bear a significant responsibility for interpreting policies and making judgements at a point in time which balance the right of people to access the building while ensuring that proper decorum is maintained. My advice is that this particular policy has been in place since January 2009, and it has not since been reviewed. All security policies are currently on a review program by the Department of Parliamentary Services, which commenced last year.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Keneally, Sterle and Collins today relating to corporate taxation.


The first thing I have to say, in taking note, is here we again have Senator Cormann with another triumph of ideology over the facts. Ideology is just being backed out nonstop, incessantly, by this senator in complete contradiction to the facts.


Senator Cormann denies the fact that Republican Senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio had rubbished the claims that corporate tax cuts would lead to an increase in wages. Senator Rubio referenced the experience in the United States, which recently also slashed corporate tax. He said:


In fact they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker.


That's the reality in the United States. That's also the reality in Canada, where the tax cuts did not result in more jobs, did not result in more investment. What it did result in was share buybacks, money going into the pockets of individuals and massive salary increases for the executives of the corporations in Canada and the US. That's exactly what happened.


What Senator Cormann needs to understand is that there is no invisible hand of the market out there. This nonsense that we hear all the time that the market will self-regulate, that the market will balance—what a load of rubbish! For the Leader of the Government in the Senate to stand here, after we've seen the global financial crisis, after we've seen the behaviour of corporations around the world, and defend that sort of behaviour and argue that that's the market at work is an absolute nonsense.


Senator Cormann just gets up and goes into top gear; he just talks and talks and talks. Unfortunately, not much of it makes much sense. It might make a bit of sense to the ideologues in the rabble of a government that sits across the other side of this chamber, but it doesn't make much sense to the pensioners across the country who have watched the attacks by this coalition on their pensions. It doesn't make much sense to the underprivileged and those that are in need of support in this country, who are being attacked by this rabble of a government. It doesn't make much sense to the workers out there that are being denied their capacity to negotiate with their employers for a wage increase.


For Senator Cormann to get up here and say: 'Well, you know, if we give more money to big business and if we hand $17 billion to the banks, everything's going to be okay. There'll be more jobs. There'll be more investment,' is absolute nonsense. That is not what's happened, and that's exactly why the Business Council of Australia refused to sign off on a commitment that they would create more jobs or that they would invest more. The Business Council know that that is not what happens. The Business Council know that, if you give these tax cuts to businesses in this country, the bulk of it will go back to individual shareholders and go back to the executives of the companies. It won't flow through to ordinary workers, who would end up going out and would need that money to spend. The money will go to the banks. The money will go to the big end of town. The money goes into banks. The money goes into family trust funds. The money goes into all of the areas that will not create more activity in the economy.


If you want to actually get the economy moving, you'll give more tax cuts to the low paid, you'll look after pensioners and you'll look after people that need the money, the people that will go out and spend that money to create jobs and create economic activity. This triumph of ideology by Senator Cormann over the facts defies reality; it defies what's happening out there. What happened in the global financial crisis? Workers lost their houses. Workers lost their jobs. That's the market at work. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:11):  What the Senate has just heard is more unmitigated nonsense from Senator Cameron. In fact, Senator Cameron's one true statement in this parliament in all of his time here was when he rightly accused his fellow colleagues in the ALP caucus of being lobotomised zombies. Remember that? Senator Cameron was saying that nobody discusses anything in the Labor Party caucus. He said that they were all lobotomised zombies; they took whatever the then ministers said as true.


Senator Cameron, I often confess to this parliament that I'm not terribly bright, but I can work out the enterprise tax plan. Senator Cameron perhaps hasn't caught up with this yet, but many international competitors, including Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Norway, Israel, Japan and France, have reduced their company taxes. The US slashed business tax from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. If the Australian rate remains stranded at 30 per cent, Australia will have one of the highest tax rates in the OECD, making it harder for Australian companies to compete in a fiercely competitive global market. International investors will take their capital and the resultant jobs to countries where it is cheaper to do business.


What the ALP and the lobotomised zombies on the other side want to do is create jobs in the United States, in Norway, in Israel, in France and in the United Kingdom. As I say, you don't have to be terribly clever to work this out. If a company has $100 million to spend on building a factory to make widgets and is going to make $10 million profit as a result of it, and when it looks around can see that it's going to pay 30 per cent tax in Australia on its profit but only 21 per cent in the United States and less in other countries—they can build the same factory, they can make the same widgets and they would make the same profit, but they'd pay more tax in Australia—where is this international investor going to go? Clearly, not to Australia. Clearly, they will go to a country where it is cheaper to make the widgets and get the same profit, because they will pay less tax and more money to their shareholders.


The ALP policy is all about transferring Australian jobs to overseas countries. I don't understand why the ALP doesn't work this out now. Mr Shorten used to understand that, because it was only a few short years ago that Mr Shorten was advocating for lower corporate taxes for this very reason. He then understood that you can't compete in a very tight international market where you are charging international investors more than your competitors, and so Mr Shorten was very vocal in those days in promoting this. In fact, that was about the time, as I recall, that Senator Cameron made his famous description of his colleagues in the ALP caucus as being lobotomised zombies. I assume that, when Mr Shorten was advocating for lower corporate taxes, that the lobotomised zombies—Senator Cameron's term—simply sat there dumbfounded and agreed with Mr Shorten.


Mr Shorten thinks he can fool the Australian public with this politics of envy and with this, 'We'll give you everything you ask' approach that he's currently adopted. He thinks that that might win him a few votes at an election, but most Australians are not fools. They can see right through Mr Shorten and the fact that a few years ago he thought it was a good idea. The lobotomised zombies agreed with him a few years ago but now, because they think they see a political advantage, they've changed their approach. It won't work. The Australian people are not that stupid.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:16):  In a rare moment of agreement with Senator Macdonald, I do agree that he's not very bright, because, if the logic of his argument were correct, how is it possible that we've had 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth? How is it possible that, if we're in such dire circumstances, we need to match, in a Dutch auction, whoever's got the lowest tax rate to be able to live and be successful in Australia? The facts don't speak to that.


If I go back to Senator Cormann's response, he may well have a point that Rubio's an outlier in the Republican Party. He was a presidential candidate though. If you look at Bloomberg, 60 per cent of the tax cut gains will go to shareholders compared to 15 per cent to employees. Morgan Stanley analysts found that 43 per cent of the tax cut will go to stock buybacks and dividends and 13 per cent will go to pay rises, bonuses and employee benefits. Just Capitals's analysis of 121 Russell 1,000 companies found that 50 per cent of the tax savings will go to shareholders, compared to 20 per cent directed to job creation and capital investment and six per cent to workers.


On this side of the chamber, every week that we're not in parliament we meet with workers. I can tell you the story of any number of workers who are waiting for that permanent job, perhaps with the Port Adelaide council, where there are respectable pay and conditions enjoyed, but they're in the labour hire contingent, which has vastly different hours to those in the permanent workforce. There is no trickle-down effect coming to those people—not in the informal economy; it's a formal part of the employment sector—those without permanent jobs, those with casual jobs and those with part-time jobs. For someone who's applied for a job in my office or someone who works 25 hours a week at Coles stacking shelves—but would dearly like to get a well-paid job—this tax cut is not going to trickle down to them, and anybody who believes it believes in the tooth fairy or some such other fallacy.


There is a simple reality here: it's not in the best interests of companies to suddenly start handing out wage increases. The job of a vibrant union movement is to force companies to negotiate into fairer enterprise agreements. This government spends most of its time trying to destroy trade unions in this country when all trade unions do is provide that equalising equilibrium in the capitalist system. We and union representatives go in and fight for fairness, fight for wage growth and get that share back for the workers so they can look after their families.


I have never met a CEO who thought it his job to actually hand out a pay rise. Every CEO in this country would not be doing their shareholders a service if they suddenly said, 'We'll give them an extra 10 bucks an hour.' It won't happen. You know it won't happen. You're batting for your side of town: power, position and privilege. That's who you're batting for. Be honest about it. Own up to it. That's your job over there, and you do it very well. So don't pretend that you're looking after the working class or the middle class or anybody who's not in a position of power and privilege.


Senator Cormann has his mantra. He's unshakeable on his mantra. He says one thing and does another—always. He just keeps battering with that battering ram of his, but he's for position, power and privilege. He wouldn't know a worker if he fell over one. He certainly wouldn't know a casual worker on $18 an hour. If he believes that any CEO in this country is suddenly going to wake up tomorrow and say, 'I've got less tax to pay; everybody's got a pay rise,' he's dreaming—and we ought to tell him he's dreaming. But he knows he's dreaming. That's the really awful thing. Senator the Hon. Mathias Cormann knows exactly what he's doing here. He's batting for power, position and privilege, and he does not give much of a stuff about the working people in this country, whose wages growth is so low. That low wages growth feeds into all of the other parameters of our society. It feeds into all of the other negative aspects in our economy and all of the other negative aspects or outcomes in our society. We need a living wage. We need an increase in Newstart. We need an increase in so many areas so that people can get up in the morning, look after themselves, feed and clothe their families and enjoy a bit of respectability in an economy that's fair and shares the income around and doesn't hand it all to the big end of town, like this disgraceful tax cut will do.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:21):  The one thing I noted from listening to this debate and observing question time today is that Labor's form, as to repeating falsehoods in the hope that people believe them, is well and truly on show again today. The notion that keeping taxes higher or indeed jacking them up higher is going to result in higher wages for workers just doesn't stack up either. I don't know where this idea is coming from. In terms of the falsehoods being peddled, we heard it last week with the ABC being sold off by the government, we heard it at the election with Medicare being sold off and we're hearing it now with keeping tax cuts and reserving them for the big end of town. It's just nonsense. It makes no sense and it doesn't stack up to any level of scrutiny.


Last week we did have the good news in being able to hand some tax relief to hardworking Australians right across the country—something that the opposition opposed. Labor didn't want to see the fruits of people's labour being enjoyed by them—money back in their pocket; money for them to spend as they see fit. That is something that we on this side of the chamber believe is the right way to go when it comes to handling people's money—allowing them to spend it rather than the government taking it off them and spending it on big government programs. And this week we hold out hope that the Senate will pass the much-needed tax relief for business in this country, to put our country's businesses on a globally competitive footing so that they can compete with the countries that Senator Macdonald mentioned in his contribution a little earlier on and so that those businesses don't make decisions to move offshore or to reduce their employment workforces here. That's what we need to be doing. That's what this is about.


But it's clear that the opposition, instead of being focused on the people we represent in this place and the communities that elect us to this place, are more focused on the political games down here. They're more focused on the Canberra bubble than on, say, the electors of Braddon in my home state, who would be big beneficiaries of the enterprise tax plan if it's realised to its full extent. The proof of this, as Senator Cormann mentioned today, is the captain's call made by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to what they would do if they won the next election after these tax cuts passed the parliament—that is, they would bring tax levels back up for businesses with a turnover of at least $10 million and perhaps even businesses with a turnover of $2 million. It's astounding. Instead of maintaining this competitive tax environment, they're going to jack taxes back up for businesses with a turnover of around $2 million. There wouldn't be many small family grocery stores and businesses like that that would be missing out in being caught up in this tax rate.


Speaking of Braddon, I did a bit of research and was able to look into the businesses in the electorate of Braddon, which, of course, will be going to a by-election on 28 July—and I wish Brett Whiteley, that great former member and candidate, all the best.




Senator Dean Smith:
  A very good person.




Senator DUNIAM:
  He is very, very good, absolutely. But, in terms of the businesses that would be impacted by Mr Shorten and his captain's call to jack up taxes on small to medium businesses in Australia, there are 24 businesses in the electorate of Braddon alone that would get caught up in his plan to jack up taxes. One of them, Stubbs Constructions, a mid-sized business with 63 employees on the north-west coast of Tasmania, is something those opposite would class as a nasty big business at the big end of town. It has 63 local employees in Braddon. The managing director of that business has confirmed that, if the tax cuts were to go through and he and his business were beneficiaries of the tax plan, he would invest more. He'd employ more people; he has made that commitment.


On that point, there are 164 businesses statewide that would be penalised by Bill Shorten's captain's call to jack up taxes and penalise those people who take a risk and actually generate economic activity. We all know why he's doing this, of course. We've seen the would-be Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese, snapping at the heels of the current Leader of the Opposition He has decried the antibusiness and antijobs rhetoric and policies that Mr Shorten's pushing. That's why we have a captain's call; he's desperate. He's trying to lock in his position. He'll do whatever it takes to get a headline or get a vote, even if it is at the cost of jobs in places like Braddon and Longman. I've just talked about 63 jobs. I hope that whoever speaks next from the opposition—be it Senator Keneally—will guarantee those 63 jobs and implore the Leader of the Opposition to back down on this terrible policy he has announced today.

Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:26):  I rise to take part in this debate to take note of the answers provided by Minister Cormann to questions posed by me, Senator Sterle and Senator Collins. Many of the questions today focused on the Business Council of Australia. While Senator Duniam was so keen to hear about commitments written in stone and firmly given, he might have inquired of the Business Council of Australia, when it made a 'commitment'—and I use that in quotation marks—to the Senate were the Senate to pass the corporate tax cut: what will the Business Council of Australia do? They will—wait for it, folks—invest more. Not one job was committed to. Not one specific investment was committed to. There was not one project that they said would go ahead. They simply said, 'We will invest more.' If Senator Duniam is so concerned about the voters of Braddon and voters in his home state of Tasmania having that ironclad commitment, he should try to get a commitment out of the Business Council of Australia as to what they would do if they were given a corporate tax cut, because 'invest more' is not a commitment. It's just two words that really convey very little. They don't convey anything specific about what those companies will do.


When the BCA was asked in a Senate inquiry if it could name a country—just one country in the world—where a cut in the corporate tax rate had led to a rise in wages, do you know what it said? It said that it would have to take that on notice. The BCA has already declared itself the campaigning arm of the Turnbull government for the corporate tax cut. You would think that this campaigning arm, the Business Council of Australia, would have an answer to this very basic question: if you give a corporate tax cut, where does it lead to a wage rise? There is not one country in the world that the BCA can point to where a corporate tax cut has led to a wage rise for workers. We saw that played out again today in the answers given by Senator Cormann in question time.


What we know from the answers given by Senator Cormann in question time is that he completely rejects that there is any evidence whatsoever that shows that corporate tax rates only benefit shareholders and corporate executives. He rejects that. He says there is evidence somewhere in the world, apparently, that corporate tax cuts somehow benefit workers. But this flies in the face of the evidence that we see in the United States today. We hear over and over from this Turnbull government—from the Treasurer, the finance minister, the Prime Minister and speakers here today in this take-note debate—that Australia has to somehow cut its corporate tax rate because the United States has cut its corporate tax rate. If they want to cite the United States as an example we should follow, maybe we should look at the evidence of what is happening in the United States. What do we know of what is happening in the United States since they cut their corporate tax rate? We know that share buybacks are at a record high.


We also know that companies like Harley-Davidson, right after getting the corporate tax cut, cut their workforce. In fact, they shut down a plant and had a net loss of 350 jobs. And what did they do just days later? They transacted a share buyback of several million dollars. They had a net loss of 350 jobs, they bought back 15 million shares and they announced a dividend increase. This is what the evidence shows in the United States.


Now, I picked on Harley-Davidson because President Trump himself has held this company up as one of the gold standards—one of the great ones 'bringing the jobs back to America'. Well, they're not. The Trump administration has given a corporate tax cut. Who has benefitted? Shareholders and CEOs. Who has lost out? The working people of America. This is the example that the Turnbull government wants us to follow and these are the consequences of that action.


What we heard about today in question time was no less a person than Marco Rubio, a Republican senator—a former Republican candidate for President—who has told the truth to the American people. He has told them the truth. He said that when it comes to corporate tax cuts in the United States they have seen that the companies have bought back shares. They have seen that few have given out bonuses, and that, 'There is no evidence whatsoever that the money has been massively poured back into the American worker.' Well, if that is what's happening in America, you can only imagine what's going to happen in Australia: the same thing, because this government stands up for their mates—the big end of town. They stand up for the shareholders and they're not standing up for the working people of Australia.

The PRESIDENT
 (15:37):  It is with regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 2 June 2018 of the Hon. Joseph Max Berinson QC, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the division of Perth, Western Australia from 1969 to 1975. I call the Leader of the Government in the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (15:37):  I move:


That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 2 June 2018, of the Honourable Joseph Max Berinson QC, a former Member of the House of Representatives for the division of Perth and Minister for the Environment in the Whitlam Government, and State Member of Parliament and Attorney-General of Western Australia, places on record its gratitude for his service to the Parliament, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.




Senator CORMANN:
  Attaining political success at both the state and the federal levels, and working for his community, which he cherished, the Hon. Joseph Max Berinson QC's life was one of significant achievement. Born opposite Perth's Hyde Park in Highgate on 7 January 1932, Joe was the youngest of three children to Jewish immigrant parents, Shulem 'Samuel' and Rivka 'Rebecca'. Though he grew up deeply involved in the local Jewish community, the suburban Perth of his youth was a world away from the Turkish Palestine that his mother and father had left years before. His mother's experience of hardship would inform his sensibilities as a proud member of Australia's Jewish community.


Studying at Highgate Primary School before securing a scholarship to the distinguished Perth Modern School, Joe went on to attain has professional qualification in pharmacy in 1953. He worked in that field for several years before deciding, in the mid-1960s, that a pivot towards law would prove more fruitful. It says something for Joe's talent and energy that he so deftly shifted professions midstream. In fact, when he graduated from the University of Western Australia with his bachelor of laws in 1971, he won the prestigious JA Wood prize for the best student in law and the humanities. This is even more impressive when one considers that, at the time, he was serving in the federal parliament. Indeed, he could often be found delving into legal textbooks while flying between Perth and Canberra or studying in the Parliamentary Library, late into the night, after the House had risen.


Joe was also a devoted servant of Perth's Jewish community, pushing for the purchase of land in the Yokine-Dianella district that today hosts the Maccabi sports and culture club, the Maurice Zeffert Home for the elderly and Carmel School. Decades on, these institutions still sit at the heart of Perth's Jewish community, with Carmel School marking his recent passing with a tribute to:


… a giant of vision, a giant in generosity of time, wealth and spirit.


Some others may reflect that his messaging skills were sharpened, at least in part, by time spent as the co-editor of The Maccabean newspaper, which services the Jewish community in Perth.


In 1953 Joe was invited to become a member of the WA Labor Party, and he joined its Mount Lawley branch. Decades later, he reflected that he approached the Labor Party with no socialist ideology but, instead, with a firm focus on pragmatism and an intense dislike of the then active Communist Party and its motives. In the turbulent years that followed the 1955 ALP split, Joe navigated sectarian intra-party tensions between Catholics and Protestants from his unique position as a Jewish member. With time, his political involvement increased and he became a state vice-president. On 9 September 1958 he married Jeanette Bekhor, whom he had met through the Zionist youth league. Together they would raise three daughters and a son: Jill, Linda, Ruth and David.


Having stood unsuccessfully for the seat of Swan at the 1963 federal election, in 1969 Joe contested the seat of Perth for the Labor Party and won it with a convincing swing of 12.2 per cent. In his maiden speech, he eschewed policy minutiae and, instead, articulated his vision for Australia's changing federal system. Perhaps uniquely at the time, this was a Western Australian voice that welcomed the growing role of the Commonwealth. He advocated for its further involvement in such spaces as health, education and transport.


Within the federal parliament, Joe took on a number of roles, serving as Deputy Chairman of Committees from early 1973 until his elevation to Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees in February 1975, a role in which he would remain until his further promotion to the cabinet. Among other committee roles, he put his professional experience to good use on the House of Representatives Select Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits between 1970 and 1972. Within his electorate, Joe focused on a range of local constituent issues, including helping the incoming community of Burmese immigrants, who, in the context of Australia's changing immigration system, were making Perth their home at that time.


In the tumultuous political year of 1975, Joe was promoted to the cabinet, succeeding Gough Whitlam, who had stood in for Jim Cairns, as Minister for the Environment in July 1975. However, his time in the executive was cut short when he was defeated at the 1975 federal election that brought an end to the Whitlam government. But Joe's political career was far from over. His short tenure in the executive had inspired him, and decades later he would reflect that, 'There is nothing to compare with being in cabinet, in terms of actually doing something.' During this time, Joe completed his articles and practised law.


Briefly despondent after failing to secure federal preselection, his course changed at the suggestion of Kim Beazley Jr, who prompted him to run for the WA Legislative Council. Soon after, Joe was elected to the council at the 1980 state election, initially serving as a member for the North East Metropolitan region before representing the North Central Metropolitan and the North Metropolitan regions over the years that followed.


Joe had returned to public life with the full intent of making a mark in cabinet. He would not be disappointed. In opposition, he served as the opposition spokesman on legal matters in the council and on parliamentary and electoral reform. These topics were important to WA Labor at the 1983 election. Upon the election of the Burke Labor government that same year, he became its Attorney-General.


The years that followed were busy, with Joe often representing the Premier and Deputy Premier on key bills in the council. Among other things, he pursued incremental reforms to the Western Australia Criminal Code, informed in part by the expansive commentary that had been provided by the Murray report in 1983. He was a fixture of WA politics during that era and remained as Attorney-General under the premierships of Brian Burke, Peter Dowding and Carmen Lawrence. In 1988, while still serving as Attorney-General, his legal prowess was formally recognised with his appointment as a Queen's Counsel. In 1993 he retired from the ministry and the parliament following the election of the Court Liberal-National government. 


The decades that followed afforded Joe more time for other pursuits, including his service on the superannuation commission and his diligent work as president of the Jewish Community Council of Western Australia between 2001 and 2005. As the son of humble immigrants who went on to serve with distinction at both the state and federal level, Joe Berinson's life speaks to his talent and energy, just as it does to the remarkable opportunities that this great country of ours affords its citizens. 


Despite these achievements, Joe's modesty and service mentality were clear throughout his life, as was the love that he gave his family whenever he was away from the political scrum. His obituary notice, posted in The West Australian on 4 June of this year, lauds him as being:


At once brilliant and modest … a leader and a servant of his community who in life did that which is asked of man - to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with G-d.


To Joe's wife, Jeanette, his four children, Jill, Linda, Ruth and David, his 15 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, and all of his loved ones—on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate I offer my sincerest condolences.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:46):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of one of our own, the Hon. Joseph Max Berinson, who passed away on 2 June 2018 at the age of 86. I commence by conveying the Labor Party's condolences to relatives and friends of Joseph Berinson. 


Joe Berinson was the pharmacist turned lawyer who would serve as a federal minister and as a state Attorney-General. He was regarded as a humble and decent individual who demonstrated courtesy and tolerance, and he was a dedicated servant of the Commonwealth, of his state and of his community. Kim Christian Beazley, now Governor of Western Australia—but, obviously, previously our federal leader—summed him up in this way:


Courageous and determined … that is how Joe came across, whether discussing our party's aims with trade unionists or with journalists and the ALP State executive. … Away from politics he was rightly admired as the most devoted family man.


A lifelong Western Australian, Joe Berinson was born in Perth in 1932 to parents who had emigrated from the Middle East on either side of World War I. After completing primary and secondary education with high levels of attainment, he then completed a four-year apprenticeship at Perth Technical College in pharmacy and finished each year as the best student in his cohort. He had a dual education in politics through exposure to political leaders, including Ben Chifley and Robert Menzies, at Forrest Place near the site of his on-the-job training, and also as a young leader in the Jewish community. He was a key proponent of the development of education facilities for Perth's Jewish community and also co-editor of The Maccabean newspaper. 


Elected the member for Perth in 1969, after having previously and unsuccessfully contested the division of Swan in 1963, Joe Berinson was part of the growth in the Western Australian representation in Canberra that was critical to Labor's later success. In 1958 only Kim Edward Beazley was returned as a federal Labor member from Western Australia. Just over 10 years later, he had five colleagues. In his first speech, Mr Berinson identified the malaise that had developed as a result of two decades of conservative rule. He saw economic prosperity in Western Australia had come about in spite of government policies, not because of them, and he struck a chord with many of his constituents by identifying that many of them had failed to benefit from an otherwise buoyant economy. Ordinary people were not benefitting from a higher standard of living and were faced with rising costs at the same time as grappling with inequitable social payment and taxation scales. The lack of interest in considering an orderly transfer from the states to the Commonwealth of responsibilities in areas such as transport, education, health and housing resulted in a shunting process between different levels of government, with the ordinary person most definitely not a beneficiary. 


In 1972, Labor came to power for the first time in a generation. Mr Berinson admired Gough Whitlam, for Gough's commitment and attention to civil rights and social welfare, and he would have an opportunity to participate in the advancement of the government's program, not only as a backbencher but in the ministry. He served briefly as Deputy Speaker and was appointed Minister for the Environment on 14 July 1975. Like many others, obviously his service was severely curtailed by the dismissal of the Whitlam government on Remembrance Day later that year.


Labor has a proud history of protecting the environment, and it was the Whitlam government that provided the foundation for this. Mr Berinson took on a portfolio in which there had been great policy advances in a short time. The Whitlam government appointed Australia's first minister for the environment, passed Australia's first environmental legislation, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, and put in place the inquiry into the environmental impacts of the Ranger Uranium Mine. Joe Berinson approached his ministerial role with the diligence that was typical across his career. He was a voracious reader and he quickly gained a reputation for being across his brief and for his well-informed questioning of his colleagues' cabinet submissions. But, of course, as I alluded to, the regrettable events of 11 November 1975 curtailed his ability to make his own impact in the environment portfolio. With his passing, there remain just four surviving members of those who served in the Whitlam ministry: Doug McClelland, Moss Cass, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating.


At the election immediately following the dismissal, Joe Berinson lost his seat in the parliament. A decade earlier, he had taken the view that it would be law rather than pharmacy that would best equip him with the skills required to affect the change that he saw was necessary. He completed his studies at the University of Western Australia by making use of the long flights to and from Canberra to work on his assignments. After an intervening period in which he put these legal qualifications to use, he entered the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1980.


On the election of Labor to government in Western Australia in 1983, he became Attorney-General. Courtesy of his service in the Whitlam government, he was the only member of the new state cabinet with any ministerial experience—obviously an asset, as he cast a critical and pedantic eye over the workings of the new government. He went on to serve in this role for a decade, surviving both the political winds and, of course, the WA Inc. royal commission. He took on other portfolios, including corrective services, prisons, budget management and resources, and, additionally, served from '87 to '93 as the Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council.


One of the key political and policy issues he dealt with in his role was Aboriginal incarceration, which he described as a serious and frustrating problem. He recognised the need to address the causes through diversionary programs and alternative options to imprisonment. Regrettably, many years later, the incarceration rate of our First Nations peoples is still, as it was then, unacceptably high. Mr Berinson was justifiably proud of his efforts to place new emphasis on the rights of victims in criminal proceedings, and he oversaw the creation of a new parole system and introduced home detention. A new children's court with judicial oversight was established during his tenure. Of the Whitlam government ministers, only Paul Keating was to continue serving in an Australian parliament longer than Joe Berinson. Regarded as competent and well liked, he served with three premiers and could potentially have replaced one of them had he not turned down a suggestion that he assume the leadership. True to his humble demeanour, he decided he wasn't right for the job.


Joe Berinson did not contest the 1993 state election and he retired from politics at the end of April that year. Subsequently, he was appointed by the Commonwealth to serve on the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Mr Berinson was a dedicated servant of the Jewish community in his home state. This was something to which he was able to devote a greater amount of time in his retirement. He served as the president of the Jewish Community Council of Western Australia. At annual general meetings of Carmel School, he directed questions at the board with the same insistence as he had done to his colleagues around federal and state cabinet tables. Fifty years earlier, he had been the youngest contributor to the campaign to purchase the land on which the school would later be situated. He often spoke publically as a defender of the rights of Israel and in support of freedom of religious practice.


Joe Berinson was at the coalface of a generation-defining government. After being part of Labor's return to government in 1972, he had the opportunity to serve as a federal minister before Labor was swept from power just three years later. However, this proved to be the prelude to a much longer period of ministerial service at a state level, where he was fortunate to be a senior minister in a Labor government that lasted a decade. As I said, after politics he continued to serve his community.


Labor mourns the passing of our comrade. We again extend our sympathies to his family and friends at this time. As Senator Cormann has quoted, and as Mr Shorten has quoted, I end on the words that his family used to describe him: 'In life he did that which is asked of man: act justly, love mercy and walk humbly with God'. May he rest in peace.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government has responded rapidly and generously to the urgent humanitarian needs of refugees in Bangladesh and Myanmar, including by providing $70 million in humanitarian assistance since September 2017 for emergency supplies in Rakhine State, and food, shelter, clean water and essential health services in Cox's Bazar. This includes an additional $18.4 million, announced on 20 June 2018, to support those in Bangladesh.


Managing the humanitarian response during the cyclone and monsoon season is a priority, including to address flooding and landslides and the increased risk of disease outbreak. Australian funding is helping to reinforce shelters, relocating people from at risk locations, positioning food supplies and delivering diphtheria vaccinations.

  The Australian government has no agreements in place for the export of live equines for slaughter to any country.

 (New South Wales) (16:15):  I present the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



On behalf of the Australian Greens and Senator Derryn Hinch I introduce the Export Control Amendment (Equine Live Export for Slaughter Prohibition) Bill 2018.


In doing so, I acknowledge the work of former Senator Kakoschke-Moore and her staff on this bill and their contribution to this second reading speech.


The Export Control Amendment (Equine Live Export for Slaughter Prohibition) Bill amends the Export Control Act 1982 to expressly prohibit the live export of horses, donkeys, mules and hinnies for the purpose of slaughtering those animals overseas. 


The recent footage of 2,400 sheep slowly dying on board a live export ship is a reminder of why the intense suffering inflicted by the existing live export trade should not be allowed to extend to even more species. 


This bill if passed would ensure that equines would not also be subject to the horrors of the existing live export trade.


The live shipment of these sensitive animals for slaughter does not currently exist in Australia. However, in 2017 it was revealed that the Turnbull government had prepared an exposure draft of the Export Control (Animals) Amendment (Equine Animals) Order 2017 (the Equine Amendment Order). If this order had been enacted it would have opened the door for Australia's horses and donkeys to be exported. This would have resulted in an expansion of the cruel live export system that has been responsible for the horrific death of thousands of cows and sheep at sea and brutal deaths at their destination.


In this instance, the target destination was to China—a country not known for animal welfare protections.


There is an emerging global trade for donkey skins that has resulted in global donkey populations plummeting, and working donkeys from villages around the world being sold or stolen and killed often brutally for their skins. There are reports of donkeys and related animals being skinned alive. Some are killed by being pounded with a hammer.


The trade is being driven by a marketed demand for the animals' skins which are boiled into a glutinous glue called Ejiao and marketed in pills, bars or tonics as a so-called luxury ""vitality tonic"". Around the world, this is causing mass-scale suffering to donkeys and devastation to the communities that depend on these animals for transport. 


In 2017, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce was eyeing this cruel live export trade of all equines for slaughter as a business opportunity. In March 2017, responding to the interest of Chinese businesses he stated that ""We're going to make sure if you want to eat donkey skins, you're going to eat our [Australian] edible donkey skins"". 


Questions in Senate Estimates to the Department of Agriculture asked by myself and Senator Hinch confirmed that secret discussions had been had with visiting businesses looking to Australian horses and donkeys to boil up into potions for a hungry market.


The public response was swift and outraged. Australia's peak body for the live export trade, the Australian Live Export Council (ALEC), immediately issued a statement that ""A live export trade in Australian horses and donkeys does not currently exist, and ALEC members are neither seeking nor supportive of any such trade commencing."" 


The Senate supported Senator Hinch's and my motion condemning any such trade. The motion called on the government to heed community expectations and definitively ban the export of live horses, ponies and donkeys for slaughter.


That is what this bill would achieve.


The annual global demand for donkey skins has been estimated by The Donkey Sanctuary to be between four and ten million. 


As the lucrative fad for donkey hide glue has soared in China, Chinese agricultural authorities have reported that their own donkey populations have plummeted from 11 million in 1990 to five million in 2015. 


Supply businesses have had to look elsewhere and have been thus decimating donkey populations across the world as they feed the animals into the supply chain and into the stinking holds of the ships carrying their suffering live animal cargos across the planet's oceans to be killed.


The growth of the market for donkey skins has seen poor communities priced out of ownership or replacement of old animals, or have their animals stolen and killed. Many of these communities rely on donkeys as their transport for water and goods, and as agricultural beasts of burden, and this has seriously affected agricultural production and the livelihoods of whole impoverished communities. 


The growth of this market has also seen the starvation of animals by dealers, given the profit lies in the skins' gelatine and not their flesh. 


So serious has this become, that countries are now banning the international trade, with Pakistan the first country to ban the export of donkey hides in 2015. Nine African governments have followed suit by banning donkey skin exports, and in Brazil concerns about the trade are growing. 


The booming Ejiao profiteering grinds on, producing more than 5,000 tonnes of gelatine per year. The scarcity of skins has led to rising product fraud, with manufacturers substituting horses as raw material.


An industry based on the long-distance transportation and slaughter of equines raises serious and unavoidable risks to the welfare of the animals. As is already tragically well known, the live export trade is a serious welfare crisis, with stress, disease, injury and death during the transport alone being compounded by the lack of control over what happens to the animals in importing countries.


These risks are especially high for horses and donkeys who must also pass through the same many stressful stages of transportation prior to even leaving Australia. Mustering, then yarding, loading, trucking, unloading, holding in an assembly area and then trucking and final loading for export subjects the animals to terrible stresses before the horrors of the live export journey itself begins.


As all horse and donkey lovers know, equines are highly sensitive animals and are particularly susceptible to the many collective stressors inherent with live export.


Studies, including a 2013 study published in the Animal Science Journal, have shown that trucking even previously handled horses or donkeys for as little as four hours results in both species showing a stress response, with donkeys showing higher levels of stress hormones, including cortisol, than horses.


A 2015 Australian study titled 'Health problems and risk factors associated with long haul transport of horses in Australia' researched records from 180 consignments of horses transported over 4,000 km (from Perth to Sydney) and concluded that long-haul transport is a risk for horse health and welfare.


Researchers have also noted that domesticated donkeys are very difficult to load and that it is essential that the animals must be handled with great care and patience by competent people. Similarly, even well-trained horses can develop an aversion to transport and pose a danger to themselves and the handler if transported.


In addition to a stress response, other outcomes associated with transporting live animals, including horses and donkeys, include physical injuries such as broken limbs, damaged hooves, and eye and head injuries; psychological trauma; elevated heart and respiration rates and decreased electrolyte levels.


Where wild horses or donkeys are sourced for live export, these welfare risks are compounded by their lack of any prior contact with humans or experience of yarding, loading or transport. While the risks of loading domesticated horses and donkeys can be high, these animal welfare risks are magnified for wild animals as are the impacts of the stressors associated with transport. Where these animals are dealt with en masse as part of a supply chain dependent on time and quantity efficiencies as its model, the cruelty and suffering of equines entering this trade is guaranteed.


Let's not forget the tragic death of last year's 16 prized polo ponies on the relatively short ferry trip from Tasmania to Victoria, to the shock of careful and loving owners. If this is the level of risk, how could we then expect horses and donkeys to survive the long trip overseas, in conditions already proved to cause such terrible suffering?


The recognised fact is that the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) and Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (ASEL) conditions on the live export chain do not work. The live export industry is a business model unavoidably built on the suffering of animals that continues under the Australian government's purview. Additionally, evidence of brutal and abhorrent suffering once the animals are unloaded continues to be exposed by courageous whistleblowers and animal welfare organisations who are committed to Australians' demand for better treatment of the animals unfortunate enough to be used by humans.


We have been giving a rare opportunity here. Australians do not want to see the start of a live export trade in horses and donkeys for slaughter overseas. The live export industry itself does not want to see such a trade. There is little doubt that horse racing and horse breeding industries would not want to be associated with such a trade, nor risk the added cruelty of their old or injured animals entering into the supply chain where so much suffering is known.


Supporting this bill does not require the shutting down of an industry. There are no jobs reliant on the live export of equines for slaughter.


Non-government organisations led by Humane Society International and The Donkey Sanctuary have been tirelessly educating the public and decision-makers about the realities of the terrible demand for the skins of these sensitive and charismatic animals. The Greens stand with them, and with most Australians, to support a pre-emptive ban to ensure that Australia plays no part in growing this terrible trade.


The thought that there is a legislative gap that could allow the live export trade to extend to more animals is very worrying. The Greens are firmly opposed to this trade that is already seeing millions of equines suffering for a substance that is nothing more than boiled donkey or horse skin, marketed and packaged up to unsuspecting consumers as a luxury good. Australians want no part in supplying or facilitating growth in this profiteering.


Animals suffer so much in the name of human profit, entertainment or beauty. The Greens are deeply committed to removing that suffering of animals where it is possible, from ending cosmetic testing on animals to ending live exports. 


This bill confirms the status quo and ensures that export of live equines, including horses, ponies and donkeys for killing in overseas slaughterhouses will never begin.

Senator McGRATH:
  The Australian government has no agreements in place for the export of live equines for slaughter to any country. Each year a large number of equines are transported both to and from Australia for breeding, racing and equestrian purposes. Since 2010, there have been an average of 2,377 equines in 396 consignments per year. Donkeys are occasionally exported for breeding purposes or as companion and zoo animals. During 2017, a total of 14 donkeys were exported for these purposes.

(a) notes that:


   (i) on 4 June 2018, Mr Bill Morrow told the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network (NBN) that NBN Co was considering instituting a fair use policy to curb the usage of some customers on fixed wireless who were using terabytes of data and characterised these customers as being 'predominantly gamers',


   (ii) Mr Morrow also stated that 'when people are gaming it is a high bandwidth requirement that's a steady stream',


   (iii) Mr Morrow also stated that, as a layer 2 company, NBN Co does not have the data to know how users are consuming data,


   (iv) online video games require a very minimal amount of bandwidth at approximately 10MB per hour versus streaming a 720p video at approximately 500MB per hour, and


   (v) according to NBN Co's own webpage entitled 'How much data does gaming use? A handful of popular examples' published on 29 December 2016, 'some of the biggest online games use very little data while you're playing compared to streaming HD video or even high-fidelity audio';


(b) acknowledges that online video game players are not to blame for the poor performance of the NBN, during peak or other times, over any NBN technology; and

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  Ensuring affordable broadband is available to all Australian homes and businesses, including those in regional areas, is a priority for the coalition government. That's why the Australian government is committing close to $5 billion to regional and rural broadband in the form of fixed wireless and satellite technologies. This is arguably the biggest investment in rural and regional broadband anywhere in the world, and includes cross-subsidies from NBN users in our cities. As with any satellite and fixed wireless broadband technology, capacity is finite and needs to be carefully monitored and managed in order to deliver a network that can provide the best customer experience. Neither the government nor NBN determine or develop policy by way of a Senate motion.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (16:33):  This debate is about something that we've been talking about very often over the course of this sitting week and last sitting week, and that is the government's outrageous proposals to give further tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our community and to big banks and big business in general. I think it's well known by now the kinds of figures we've been talking about, because we have talked about them quite a lot over the last week or two.


Let's just revisit what occurred in this chamber last week, where we had a gaggle of coalition senators, supported by One Nation and Centre Alliance senators and a few other Independents, who ganged up to give themselves a $7,000 tax cut while they were willing to give only a measly few hundred dollars to low- and middle-income earners. There's the hypocrisy of government and One Nation senators in doing that. I particularly want to single out the National Party senators and One Nation senators, who do come down here to Canberra and claim that they represent some of the poorest people in our community, particularly in rural and regional areas. Yet what they did last week was take instructions yet again from Liberal Party representatives, who represent some of the wealthiest parts of the country, and effectively handed over their votes and their own constituents' taxes and services to fund a massive tax cut for themselves, among other wealthy business owners.


As this motion states, the other effect of that debate last week and the legislation put through last week was that government senators, with One Nation senators and others, also provided a $7,000-a-year tax cut not only for themselves but for merchant bankers and investment bankers—the kinds of people who don't need that sort of assistance from this government. We all know that the way that's being funded is by continuing to cut funding to regional and rural services: hospitals, schools, TAFEs, apprenticeships, roads and transport. They're the kinds of things that this government is cutting, all to pay for $7,000-a-year tax cuts for investment bankers and the members of parliament who voted for these tax cuts.


We have another opportunity this week for National Party senators and One Nation party senators to demonstrate who they really stand for. Are they really on the side of battlers, as they claim when they're back in their electorates, or are they actually on the side of the billionaires who will benefit from these tax cuts? We know that, at some point in this week, a debate is going to come on, finally, for whether we should be providing another massive tax cut for the biggest businesses in Australia, including $17 billion for the banks.


We've seen from Senator Hanson flip-flopping around for months now on whether she will support these company tax cuts. I've lost count of the number of times that Senator Hanson has changed her position. She was originally going to vote against these tax cuts for big business, then she was voting for them. Then she was back to voting against them, then she was voting for them. She had another chat with Twiggy Forrest and she was voting for them, and then she went back to Queensland and told people that she was voting against them.


It's 4.37 pm on Tuesday, 26 June, and the current One Nation position is to vote against these company tax cuts. But you have to wonder why it is that yesterday, when Senator Hanson and Senator Georgiou were presented with an opportunity to bring on the debate to stop these company tax cuts from going ahead, they dogged it. Yet again, they voted with the government senators because that's just what they do. They don't use their own minds. They don't think about what people in Queensland or people in Western Australia think about company tax cuts. All they do is run up to Senator Cormann and his colleagues and say, 'Where do I put up my hand? Tell me what to do and I'll do it for you,' and, yet again, they sell out the battlers they say they represent.


At some point this week, they are going to be tested. At some point this week, the colour of their money is going to be tested and we will see, once and for all, whether they are for the big banks and big business or whether they actually do want to get behind better services for regional and rural Australians, not to mention people in electorates like Longman. We all know there's going to be a by-election in Longman in the coming weeks, as there will be in Braddon and other seats around Australia. As I've said to this chamber before, with the doorknocking I've been doing in Longman—I don't know whether Senator Hanson has had an opportunity to get out and doorknock in Longman; I know she's been in the electorate, but whether she's actually spoken to any voters on their doorsteps is another matter—there are not many people out there crying for big tax cuts for the big banks. Instead, they want to see this money put into their local hospitals and their local schools, and into giving pensioners and other working people a fair go. Let's hope they come through when the vote's on.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:38):  I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance introduced to this place by our colleague from Victoria, Senator Collins. She wishes us to discuss 'putting health and education ahead of a $7,000 a year tax cut for investment bankers and a $17 billion tax cut for the banks they work for'. What a pleasure it is to receive the opportunity to stand in this chamber and speak of the government's record and priorities. The Turnbull government is, in fact, the only side of politics that will fully fund the essential services that all Australians rely on. Only a growing economy that fuels growth and job creation, combined with prudent fiscal management, reining in the profligacy of Labor governments past, will ensure that essential services like education, Medicare, hospitals and the NDIS can be guaranteed.


The education reforms introduced by the coalition to this place—reforms that deliver record funding to schools year on year and that the Labor Party voted against—are in fact game changing. The coalition's Quality Schools reform delivers an additional $23.5 billion on top of the 2016 budget for Australian schools over the next decade. We'll ensure that the investment is distributed according to need, as originally envisaged by David Gonski's review of school funding in 2011. The coalition reforms ensure that students with the same need and within the same sector attract the same support from the Commonwealth government, regardless of where they live. These are real, committed dollars, needs based and fully funded.


The coalition has guaranteed Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme with legislation. They are guaranteed in legislation. It has established the Medicare Guarantee Fund to ensure the ongoing funding of these essential activities. Over 86 per cent of GP visits were bulk-billed last year—21 million more than in Labor's last year. Hospital funding is now at record levels, increasing from $13.3 billion in 2013-14 to a record $22.7 billion in 2020-21—that's a 70 per cent increase. After this date, with the coalition's new national hospitals agreement, the government has committed to an additional $30.2 billion in public hospital funding for 2020-21 to 2024-25, taking the overall investment during this period to $130.2 billion. This means more hospital services, more doctors and more nurses, with increased funding year on year for every state and territory.


For the 13 million Australians who rely on private health insurance, the coalition has taken steps to lower premium rises and to make private health insurance more affordable and easier to understand. Our No Jab, No Pay policy resulted in 210 extra children immunised in its first year, and 12 to 13-year-olds will now be immunised for HPV. To help the one-in-five Australians who have mental health problems, the coalition government has increased mental health funding to around $4.3 billion this year. The 2018 budget also includes $1.4 billion for new and amended listings to the PBS, including medicines to treat spinal muscular atrophy, breast cancer and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. That is guaranteed. That is where the coalition's priorities lie. Of course, the coalition government is the only side of politics that can guarantee a fully-funded NDIS without more or punitive taxes.


That's what economic management and fiscal responsibility can do: more and better guaranteed essential services for all Australians without the burden of higher taxes. The electorates know it. They can feel it in their hip pockets. They can see it in the numbers of job ads. They can hear it when they talk to their friends, their neighbours and their workmates.


It's only Labor who have not so much a tin ear but have turned a blind eye to these facts. They are in denial. They are doing this because they're starting to doubt themselves. They're starting to doubt their own policies. Why aren't they resonating with Australian workers anymore? How could Labor be, potentially, the first party ever to lose a by-election to a government? What an awful, sick feeling that must be. Labor are starting to doubt their own rhetoric. Why do they sound so bitter? 'Why do we sound so bitter and envious of anybody that's had a go and done well? What base element of our nature is it that makes us want to slash the sickle of socialism through every tall poppy in the country?'


Most of all, Deputy President, you're starting to doubt your leader. We can see why you would do that. It's so easy to do. After all, it wasn't all that long ago that Mr Shorten himself believed in company taxes. We've heard the quotes over and over again in this chamber, from Mr Shorten himself, from Mr Bowen, from Mr Leigh, from Mr Hawke and from Mr Keating. There are a number of Labor ministers, past and present, who believe in the power of company tax cuts to reinvigorate an economy and help businesses grow, invest and employ.


Indeed, the seeds of doubt in Labor's political strategy have been sown for some time. And now they have moved inexorably beyond green shoots, well into discontent and the triffids of dissent and disloyalty. While Mr Shorten spent the weekend spewing forth invective at the members of the crossbench who supported leaving more money in Australians' hip pockets, the member for Grayndler was extolling the virtues of cooperation between companies, government and business. This is to his credit, that there is one respectable member of the Australian Labor Party who understands the business community's vital role in society.


Mr Albanese's Whitlam Oration implored his Labor colleagues:


… to engage constructively with business large and small.


He reminded his colleagues:


We respect and celebrate the importance of individual enterprise and the efforts and importance of the business community.


I'm not exactly sure who the member for Grayndler meant when he said 'we' in that sentence. Far from respecting the efforts and the enterprise of the business community, Mr Shorten continues to paint those hardworking business owners as pariahs. He has all but declared that should he become Prime Minister he will wage a war on business. Of course, we've seen that nowhere more effectively than today: the mistrust was amplified and justified today, topped off by the announcement that Mr Shorten will repeal the company tax cuts. He will roll back company tax cuts, and that decision did not go to caucus. It didn't go to shadow cabinet or to the Expenditure Review Committee. It was a captain's call. No wonder Labor are worried.


The opposition's hatred of banks is so convenient, yet so misguided. Of course, it is largely theatrical. Surely, Labor must know that the banks to which they refer are already Australia's four biggest payers of corporate tax—and this is well before the bank levy. Moreover, the banks employ more than 170,000 employees—170,000! The average bank teller earns $48,000, the average personal banker earns $55,000 and the average mortgage broker earns $59,000. This is not the top end of town and yet this is who Labor will punish. There are 170,000 of them, and Labor treats them like greedy crooks. Well, shame on them!


The opposition leader's wish is to have a class warfare election, where he pits one Australian against the other. Well, what disrespect and what disdain he must have for those he wishes to govern. But it applies equally to all of those opposite. Don't they feel grubby when they hear the lies they're told that they have to peddle? Don't they feel the shame when they're sent out time and time again, like some luckless boxer into the ring, with talking points which are fully loaded with personal insults—or worse, dripping with sneering derision towards hardworking Australians whose only crime is to have made good?


Labor may make hollow promises of more money for this and increased billions for that, but redistributing the wealth of others rather than growing the wealth for all is intellectually lazy and irresponsible in the extreme. It's no secret that Labor has no plan to grow the economy, no plan to increase wages and no plan to create jobs. Moreover, Labor has no shame. Where is the pride in the party it once was? Mr Shorten will lead this opposition from nowhere to obscurity because it has defenestrated its history, it has defenestrated its values and its credibility, and now it has thrown away its relevance to ordinary, aspirational Australians. It mystifies me!

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:48):  It felt like the thesaurus got a bit of a workout when that speech was being drafted!


Having helped themselves to a massive personal tax cut last week, the Liberals are now trying to look after their big corporate mates and donors by giving them a whopping great tax cut this week. Let's be really clear about what's actually at stake here. Fundamentally, what are we discussing and debating when we talk about corporate tax cuts?


What is at stake here is the question of what kind of country we want to be and what kind of society we want in Australia. Do we want to be the kind of country where people look after each other? The Greens say, resoundingly, 'Yes, that is the kind of country we should be.' When we ask ourselves, 'Do we want quality public services, quality hospitals, quality schools, quality public transport and quality social security nets for those doing it tough?' the Australian Greens answer, resoundingly, 'Yes'.


When we ask ourselves, 'Do we want the big corporates, who donate so massively to both the Liberal and National parties in this place, to pay a reasonable return to our society on the huge profits they are making?' the Australian Greens resoundingly answer, 'Yes'. Or do we want what the Liberals are proposing—to cut these corporations free of the very basic obligations that many of them are actually failing to meet right now? Do we want to hand over more power to the corporate boardrooms, bought by the corporate donations that are corrupting our democracy? The Australian Greens answer, 'No'. Do we want to leave vulnerable people out in the cold, like the homeless people in my home city of Hobart, who are camping out at showgrounds now because they can't find a house—and many of these people are working full-time and they can't find a house because the Liberal government in Tasmania has not taken strong enough action and invested enough money into social and affordable housing? When we ask ourselves, 'Do we want to leave vulnerable people out in the cold?' the Australian Greens answer, 'No'. Those are the questions that are currently before this parliament.


The Liberal Party made their choice many years ago and their decisions are hurting us all and they are devastating the environment. The Liberal Party have been instrumental in taking power away from people and putting it into the hands of the corporate boardrooms and their corporate masters, who buy and sell the Liberal Party with their massive corporate donations. The big corporates buy the Liberal Party in donations and, in turn, the Liberal Party come in here and cut the taxes of the big corporations so that the top end of town can put more money into their own pockets. That's exactly what will happen if these corporate tax cuts are passed.


The people of Braddon, in my home state of Tasmania, know all about it—my word they do! There are corporations on the north-west coast that have cut jobs in Braddon and have cut the working conditions of thousands of people in the north-west of Tasmania—the very same big corporates that the Liberal Party wants to give a giant tax cut to. Meanwhile, if you're one of the people sacked by these corporations, you get nothing but disdain and contempt from the Liberal Party. Newstart hasn't been raised in more than 20 years—nearly a full generation—and the minimum wage in this country is far, far too low. Instead of acting on those things, the government tries to recover debts from people who either don't have enough money to pay them or who, in many cases, did nothing wrong and incurred no debt in the first place. It's enough to make you sick, and the people of Braddon have had enough—and the Australian Greens will stand with them.


We're the only party campaigning in Braddon to raise Newstart. We're the only party campaigning in Braddon to make sure that the minimum wage in this country is set at a minimum of 60 per cent of the median income. We'll stand with them. We'll stand for a better society in Australia—the kind of society that demands that the big corporates pay what they owe; a society that looks after the sick as well as the healthy, the old, the young, the poor, people working on the minimum wage and those people who cannot find work. To those people, particularly those people in Braddon, I say: the Australian Greens and our fantastic candidate Jarrod Edwards have got your back.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:53):  I rise to put on the record for anybody who wasn't watching in the last week a really clear indication of what this government thinks is much more important than the health and education of the people of this nation—and that is giving a $7,000 a year tax cut to investment bankers and taking a $17 billion tax cut away from schools and giving that instead to the big banks. You can see an amazing contrast between the priorities of those who are on the government benches and Labor, who believe that it is not just this generation that should benefit from investing in education but that those who follow on from us should also benefit. Young people in this country should be assured that they are able to get a decent education in any primary school across the country, at any early childhood education centre and at any TAFE. No area of the education sector is safe from the attacks of this government.


Governing is all about priorities—and this government has got all of its priorities wrong. Labor will never support the hugely expensive tax cuts of an arrogant and out-of-touch government. The priority that is driving the agenda of the parliament this week—tax cuts for big business—follows terrible legislation passed last week that will see people who are earning $200,000 get a $7,000 tax cut. They are not knocking on the doors of this place saying, 'Give me a cheque for $7,000 because I can't make ends meet.'


People are coming to this parliament daily—and government members, if they were to tell the truth, would let you know this is the case—saying they cannot access the basic services they need. I met someone at a function last weekend who told me a teenager who is currently seeking treatment for cancer at Penrith hospital has had his treatment delayed because of cuts to that hospital. And it is not just cuts to Penrith hospital and that family; cuts to our health system are being implemented by this government daily, while they are out there spinning a pack of lies to the rest of the community about how they care about hardworking Australians. Well, the facts simply belie what they are telling the Australian people.


I will talk about a couple of hospitals. Broken Hill is a great area of New South Wales. We have a fantastic candidate running in the seat of Parkes, Jack Ayoub, who will be trying to represent that community and help people understand what Labor has to offer. But I can tell you what Labor will not be doing, and that is: endorsing what this government has done. The Far West hospital in Parkes and Broken Hill is subject to a cut of $1.15 million between 2017 and 2020. That is money that hospital can ill afford to lose. Local families in that community and the regions that surround it need that hospital to function. They have concerns about lead levels for young children in that community. They have major concerns about suicide. They have high-risk occupations where they need the capacity of emergency response—and this government is taking $1.15 million from that hospital while they want to give $17 billion to the big banks and pay $7,000, in a tax cut, to somebody on $200,000. It simply doesn't make sense if you believe in an equitable country.


In western New South Wales, between 2017 and 2020, this government will take $2.84 million out of Dubbo hospital. Yet they show up here, they smile and they keep telling people: 'We're looking after you. We've got your back. We'll look after your children. You can entrust the future to us.' Well, we certainly cannot do that. And they are doing that in seats that they hold. In the Treasurer's seat of Cook in south-eastern Sydney, the Sutherland Hospital is subject to $2.38 million worth of cuts.


I have been to headspace centres, the wonderful youth mental health centres across the country—35 of them, in fact, including two in the Sutherland area in the seat of Cook. And I can tell you: there is great concern among the people working with young people in headspace centres about the capacity of the Sutherland Hospital to respond to young people in a mental health crisis and their families. Yet knowing that, and living in that community, Mr Morrison, the Treasurer of this country, has taken $2.83 million off them—and all to cobble together some money so that they can spend it on giving $7,000 to people in that electorate and around the country who are already earning $200,000. Let me tell you: you can earn an awful lot of money but, if your child has a mental health crisis, you need a hospital that is properly funded and you need headspace centres that are properly funded, because you are a vulnerable family. Money will not protect you from sickness. Money will not protect you from cancer coming to your family. Money will not protect you from the need for those basic services. Labor supports the provision of those services and we will support that every day over arbitrary, unnecessary and excessive tax cuts to the top end of town. I don't need another $7,000. I'd rather see that go to my local hospital, because a lot of people will rely on their hospital, and their $7,000, cobbled together with somebody else's $7,000, might just be enough to provide them with the treatment they need for their son or daughter, and that's the difference between Labor and Liberal.


I want to make a couple of remarks around the cuts that have impacted education in this country under this government. I go first to the seat of Farrer, to apprentices trying to access services, trying to access the learning they want to undertake. In the duty electorate that I look after, the seat of Farrer, represented by Minister Ley, our candidate, Kieran Dabsch, sees a community where there has been a 42 per cent decline in apprenticeships between 2013 and 2017. There are 1,691 fewer apprentices in the seat of Hume where Labor's candidate, Aoife Champion, is already out on the ground, under this government, which is cobbling together money as it pulls away services from TAFE to fund $7,000 tax discounts for very wealthy people.


In the seat of Parkes, where Labor's candidate, Jack Ayoub, is already out campaigning, there was a 47 per cent reduction in the number of apprenticeships between September 2013 and September 2017. That's 1,765 people, predominantly young people, in the seat of Parkes who have not had the opportunity to learn the skills in order to get a job and move ahead because of cuts by this government. In the seat of Robertson, where I live on the Central Coast, there are 840 young people, who have a champion in Anne Charlton—Labor's candidate for that seat—whose lives could have been transformed in that period between 2013 and 2017, but they have lost their chance to get an apprenticeship and training because of this government's cuts to education and because of its abrogation of its responsibilities to TAFE. That is the sort of government that we have.


It's in the detail that we see how different the value sets are between the government and a Labor government, if it came into being. I want to put on the record: if a Shorten Labor government were elected, we propose that we would conduct an inquiry into Australia's post-secondary education system—how VET, TAFE and uni intersect. We would scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students who choose to learn the skills that Australia needs and invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. God knows that needs to happen after the wholesale destruction of TAFE undertaken by Liberal governments across this country, and the leading of that charge by this federal government. We would guarantee that at least two out of three Commonwealth training dollars would go to TAFE. We would ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth-priority projects was filled by Australian apprentices. There is a very big difference: $17 billion for the banks or for further education and health. There is a difference between Labor and Liberal. We need a Labor government for this country.

It's not a problem for me. In fact, I like to see that kind of aspiration, that kind of planning for one's financial future, that kind of effort to get one and one's family ahead. It's fascinating reading because of the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor Party coming in here and attempting to crush the personal aspirations of others, of fighting working Australians who demonstrate all of the traits that built this country and made it strong—a desire to get ahead, make sensible investment decisions, make sacrifices, save, prepare a nest egg for their retirement.


I could be describing the characteristics of Liberal and National Party voters, but these are members of the Labor Party. All, no doubt, are well leveraged with bank loans. But the very bank loans they depend on come from the people they come in here and rant and rave against day after day. They complain on a personal level, because of their competitive position, if there's an increase in fees or charges from banks, but they're happy to sabotage the needs and wants of Australians in their own interests to sandbag their personal political positions to try and get some advantage in here. They're quite happy to grandfather the proposed changes to negative gearing to suit their own personal interests but keep other Australians off that ladder of opportunity that once mattered to the Labor Party. They have now rebranded themselves as the party of envy, the killjoys of other people's aspirations.


I still believe Australia is an aspirational country. Both its history and its present ring with aspiration. But we've got, in the opposition, a bunch of knockers. They don't even represent their own tradition. The genesis of the Labor Party was in the improvement of the lives of hardworking shearers in the sheds, giving them a hand to become a greater contributor to Australian society. But now it's all just a big attempt to divide this nation with the politics of envy. But I'm an optimist. I believe that most of the Labor Party don't agree with this strategy of being relentlessly negative without considering the merits of each policy. So ruthless is their desire to win government that we've seen that Mr Shorten will take any position that he thinks will further that possibility. I've seen the flip-flops year after year, whether by Mr Bowen, Mr Shorten or Mr Leigh. All of them have said that cutting corporate tax is a policy that will bring great benefit to the Australian people. But, then again, if you only stand for your own political interests, really, you value nothing.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Stoker, would you just resume your seat. Senator Gallacher, on a point of order?




Senator Gallacher:
  I've listened carefully to the contribution from Senator Stoker. I refer to the standing order about senators not reading speeches and I ask you to consider that in relation to her contribution.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, thank you, Senator Gallacher. Senator Stoker, there is a standing order against reading speeches; however, I'm sure you're just using copious notes, so feel free to continue.




Senator STOKER:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I'm happy to accommodate the needs—



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator STOKER:
  How about this? We'll focus on a few facts and figures that demonstrate that, in this matter of public interest, we have nothing more than an exercise in divisiveness. The truth is that the strong economy that tax cuts for individuals and for corporations delivers empowers this government to deliver essential services. That's the good news here. When we cut corporate taxes, we increase investment, we increase job creation, we tighten the labour market, we raise wages and we increase the welfare and the wealth of all Australians. In doing so, we have more Australians contributing to revenue.


This allows us to make great investments like spending 53 per cent more in Longman than was the case under the previous Labor government. Don't believe the Labor lies you'll see on the leaflets being peddled around Longman. Funding for Caboolture Hospital and the health district around there is up 53 per cent. Yet over and over we hear Labor lies about funding of hospitals in Longman. It's shameful. We heard more of this class-envy nonsense today from Mr Shorten. We heard that there will be a repeal of the tax cuts that were delivered to small and medium-size businesses with a turnover of between $10 million and $50 million. There's even going to be a reconsideration of the cutting of taxes to businesses with a turnover of just $2 million, without a shred of consultation with the party room. I know I'd be very frustrated if that was how my party was run.


Nothing is sacred in the effort to divide this nation—to try to make people turn against one another—based on some formulation of envy. The truth that cuts through all this class rhetoric is that, even with the benefit of the coalition's tax cuts delivered last week, the top four per cent of earners today pay 30 per cent of tax now, but under the coalition's plan, fully implemented, they will pay 36 per cent of tax revenue. In fact, the burden on those who earn more will only increase. That reflects the fact that we not only have to cut taxes for all across the board in order to unlock the economic potential of this country but are doing it in a way that recognises the fact that there are many people on small and medium-size incomes who are doing it tough. While a person who earns $30,000 will pay around $2,200 in tax, which is about seven per cent of their income, someone earning $200,000 will pay $67,000 in tax, or around 34 per cent of their income. Any way you dice that up, the person who's earning $200,000 is paying their share. They're paying about five times the amount of tax being paid by the person on $30,000.


It's all well and good for the opposition to come in here and talk about this magic number of $7,000. But the truth is that you need to be paying a certain amount of tax in order to even make a cut of that nature possible. We can't give a $7,000 tax cut to those earning $30,000, because they pay only $2,200. We have so equitably distributed the tax cuts in this measure that it can only be in the interests of all Australians and of the Australian economy as a whole that we continue to press on and deliver more for all Australians, including essential services.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-06-26,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:12):  It's quite interesting to listen to some of the debate here on the floor of the chamber today. Last Wednesday, 20 June, I set out the reasons I supported personal tax cuts. Let me repeat that: personal tax cuts. It was because I wanted to see all hardworking Australians receive tax relief into the future, and it's going to be a rebate for the next four years for them. It's quite interesting that Labor did not want to give their voters—their supporters—this tax cut. My colleague Senator Georgiou and I actually considered a number of issues. We looked carefully at different occupations and the number of individuals who would or would not benefit from each stage of the personal tax cuts. I reminded Labor that tens of thousands of electricians, plumbers, nurses, secondary school teachers, mechanics and welders earn more than $90,000 and would miss out on a permanent tax cut if Labor opposed stage 2. I don't know why they weren't advised properly about this. They did not want to give these people tax relief or tax cuts.


In today's MPI debate, Labor were once again twisting and changing this to justify their position. What they're putting across to the Australian people is wrong. They're saying that it's only going to be the big end of town, the investment bankers, that will benefit from this $7,000 tax cut. But they're not looking at those people who earn up to the $200,000 who are going to get tax relief. I say now: Australians need it. They are doing it tough, they really are. But they want to cut back on them getting any incentives whatsoever.


It was wonderful here: Senator O'Neill was saying that she doesn't want the $7,000 and that she's going to donate it to a hospital. I'd like to see that happen. I remember last year in the chamber here, when there was a vote that we do not accept our pay rises until the budget is in surplus. Guess what? On this side of the chamber, only six people voted for it. One Nation was there. Where was everyone else? Over there! Where was Labor? There, on the other side of the chamber. They weren't interested; they voted themselves pay rises. The hypocrisy of the whole lot of them makes me, and Australians, fed up. So don't deny other Australians tax relief or rebates when you want to take your own pay packets!


I've donated my $4,000 to the Young Veterans at Caboolture. I've actually donated money to on Meals on Wheels and I've donated to veterans' associations, and that's worth a lot more than the $7,000 that you say is the tax cut that I'm giving to myself. Those tax cuts, up to that amount of money, don't come in until 2024-25. The whole fact is, who's to say that I'm going to be here to get the tax cuts? It's all right for you to dish it out but you're not prepared to take it back.


What did Labor do? The day following my speech supporting personal tax cuts, Labor commenced a rabid campaign against me in an attempt to cover the massive blunder they had made by not supporting tax cuts for their heartland workers. Labor robocalled Longman voters with the message that I had voted for the big end of town, which was understood by callers to my office to mean that I had already voted in respect of the government's proposal to give all companies tax cuts. They did not tell the truth to the people. It was nothing to do with the company tax cuts, and I have made that quite clear. One Nation will not be supporting company tax cuts. So I haven't flip-flopped. I said no originally, then I said yes. Then I have said no, and I've stuck to it.


Do you know what's wrong, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall? Bill Shorten wanted company tax cuts years ago. But Bill Shorten has changed his opinion now and said he won't give them, and so have a lot of the others on the other side. I have taken a well-managed approach to this. I will look at legislation and if I decide it's wrong I'm not going to apologise for backing down and saying it's wrong.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:17):  I rise to join this debate in relation to putting health and education ahead of the tax cuts.


Just firstly, I will address Senator Hanson's contribution. I think it's really important to note that, once again, she may be slightly confused about the Labor position. It's quite clear that Labor has indicated it would support stage 1 of the Personal Income Tax Plan. We wanted to split the bill. In fact, the tax cuts that we wanted to introduce were actually double those that the government is proposing. We understand that households are under pressure, and the relief that we want to provide is far more immediate and more significant than what the government is proposing. But what we don't want to do is to provide relief to the big end of town, where it's not needed and where it won't provide the stimulus to the economy that is actually required at this point in time.


Australia is at a crossroads, and we can either become a more equal society or a less equal society, the choice is with us. I think it is extremely important that Australians understand this crossroads that we are at, and this is a matter of public importance. I say that because I believe that the government is putting us in a position where their fiscal recklessness is endangering the underpinnings of our fair and equitable society.


Health and education are fundamental to the support that we provide to people. It's fundamental to aspiration. If you put those things at risk, then you are ultimately putting the stability of our society at risk. Why do I say those things are at risk? Because I believe, and as credible economic commentators have said, that stage 2 and stage 3 of the personal income tax cuts are particularly unsustainable and fiscally irresponsible. You don't have to believe me when I say that; go to the Grattan Institute submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the Personal Income Tax Plan. I think most people would accept that the Grattan Institute is not exactly a cheer squad for the Labor Party, but it has come to a position where it says it is concerned about the Personal Income Tax Plan, particularly stage 3. Mr Daley, when he gave evidence to our inquiry, said:


Six or seven years is a very long time and, economically, the chances of a significant economic downturn over the next six or seven years are pretty large—that's the law of averages historically.


He went on to say:


Inherently, the full package is going to cost the budget, on our estimates, a little over $22 billion in 2027-28.


That was based on the PBO estimates. He added it was going to cost 'about $24 billion in the following year', which is 2028-29. He then said:


It does mean that the Commonwealth budget will inherently have less flexibility in a significant downturn. And it's also an issue that Australia is going to probably go into the next economic downturn with much less of a buffer than it went into the last one.


This is the Grattan Institute. As I said, they're not exactly a cheer squad for the Labor Party, but they have expressed their serious concerns about whether or not these tax cuts are sustainable in the longer term. Most Australians understand that when you legislate significant changes down the track—we know stage 3 is the fastest-growing part of the tax plan, growing at 12 per cent per annum—and when you legislate for significant tax expenditure down the track that is going to grow at that sort of pace, then you are taking a gamble with Australia's future. At risk here is support for our health and education and other fundamental services that we rely on.


It's now, more than ever, that Australians need the protection that only a Labor government can provide. Right now our schools are under attack from this arrogant, out-of-touch Prime Minister, who is prioritising tax breaks to the top end of town over funding to our schools. With his Liberal-National colleagues, he is ripping $17 billion out of schools across the country. Is it a coincidence that this figure is exactly the same amount of money that he wants to provide to his mates in big business through tax breaks to the big banks? These are the same mates that this Prime Minister has shielded for so long, running a protection racket for the banks for 601 days before ultimately being dragged, kicking and screaming, into announcing a royal commission into the banks—once they gave him permission to do so.


How does this Prime Minister justify his protection of the banks? How can he possibly be advocating for billions and billions of dollars in tax handouts to the banks while we're in the middle of a royal commission that's uncovering such abhorrent behaviour? Here are just a couple of the headlines we have seen recently. The Financial Review reported yesterday about how ANZ forced 162 farmers from their land after expanding into agribusiness without adequate preparation or safeguards. On 31 May, we saw a Sydney Morning Herald article reporting revelations that NAB took proceeds from a customer's home sale, which they weren't entitled to, to pay down a small business loan. On 30 April, ABC News, along with many other outlets, reported the resignation of AMP's chairman in the wake of the shocking fee-for-no-service scandal—a dodgy practice also employed by the big banks. It's not just AMP that has to answer for this, but I haven't got all day and so I won't dwell on that issue. On 21 March, the AFR reported evidence that Westpac relied on verification of customer income and expenditure details by car dealers for car loans. Let's not forget the doctoring of kids' Dollarmite accounts by Commonwealth Bank staff who were under pressure to meet incentive targets. This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the behaviours being exposed by the royal commission, so how can we possibly reward the very same institutions with a tax cut?


When it comes to the education system, we believe that it has transformative power. I've said this in the chamber before, but I want to give a few examples of what these cuts mean in real terms to some of the schools in my duty electorates. I mention Maranoa, where we see that Warwick State High School will lose $770,000, Warwick West State School will lose $440,000 and Warwick Central State School will lose $240,000. Let's go to Flynn, currently held by Mr O'Dowd, a National MP. Gladstone State High School will lose $1.35 million over two years. Toolooa State High School will lose $870,000. Gladstone Central State School will lose $300,000. Gladstone West State School will lose $570,000. Closer to my home in Brisbane, looking at the outer suburbs, in Petrie and Dickson, held by Liberal MPs Mr Howarth and Mr Dutton respectively, Pine Rivers State High School has had $1.06 million ripped out of the budget, North Lakes State College will lose $2½ million and Dakabin State High School will lose $730,000.


I want to go through what these cuts mean in the Longman electorate, which is very topical. I have had the opportunity on a couple of occasions to go doorknocking with our outstanding candidate Susan Lamb in the seat of Longman. You don't have to talk too hard to the average voters of Longman to understand how out of touch this Prime Minister is and how out of touch this government are in terms of what their priorities are, which are twisted and so far removed from the day-to-day lives of the good people of Longman. In Longman state schools, we see the LNP cutting over $18 million over the next two years. If I had time, I would go through those.


We can talk about TAFE and universities as well. We're seeing $270 million in new cuts to TAFE, and the MYEFO froze funding for university places. These are cuts that Australia cannot afford. When it comes to health, there are hundreds of millions of dollars coming out of hospitals across the country. Caboolture Hospital will lose $2.9 million. Redcliffe Hospital will lose $4.2 million. Prince Charles Hospital at Chermside will lose $7.7 million. Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital will lose $14.3 million. Lady Cilento Children's Hospital will lose $6.5 million. These are examples of the twisted priorities of this government. As I said, Australia is at a crossroads. We need a federal Labor government to take us in the right direction.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:27):  I thought that this was a debate about health and education, but I heard Labor speakers, particularly Senator O'Neill, talking totally about tax. I find it surprising that Senator O'Neill would. I thought, perhaps, that if she were going to talk about tax she would talk about Labor's proposal for negative gearing, because she would know all about that.


Senator O'Neill spent most of her time attacking the big end of town, the very wealthy, but then we look at today's front page of The Australian and find that Senator O'Neill is part of the big end of town. She not only owns her own house but has five investment properties. Talk about big end of town! You see it in the Labor Party all the time. Their hypocrisy is breathtaking. Senator O'Neill, I have no objection to you having investment properties, and I know you've probably worked hard for them, but don't blame others for the faults of yourself and people in your position. Senator O'Neill, I'm very pleased to see that one of your investment properties is up my way, in the wonderful Cairns suburb of Yorkeys Knob. Only the wealthy can buy there.


I repeat what is now part of the Australian lexicon: Labor lies. Regrettably, you've just heard a lot of the Labor lies from my good friend Senator Ketter. He said that the Caboolture Hospital lost money, which is an outright, outrageous, direct untruth. The Caboolture Hospital is documented to be receiving more money than it has received in the past.


Similarly, talking about the electorate of Longman, because of the government's childcare policy there are 7,100 families in the electorate of Longman—part of the one million families across the country—who will get a benefit from the government's new childcare policy.


Senator Ketter says certain schools are going to lose money. I challenge him, and any one of those schools, to show what they are getting today and what they will get under the coalition government's new reforms, where all of those schools that Senator Ketter mentioned will receive more funding than they're getting at the moment.


I'm delighted that Senator Ketter mentioned Longman, because I'm so proud of our candidate there, 'Big Trev Ruthenberg'. 'Big Trev' is a man of the people. He understands the people there. I know that my colleague Senator O'Sullivan has been with him for quite some time. I've been up there. He understands. He listens to people. He doesn't go around telling lies. He has exposed the Labor allegation about the Caboolture Hospital for the lie that it is. The Caboolture Hospital is now getting more money than it has ever got before. Where Senator Ketter gets his fantasy tales from I have no idea.


I think what Senator Ketter and many Labor people do is say what Labor promises they're going to deliver to these people—I don't know when, as they're not in government, or how they're going to deliver these increases—and then work back from there. But if you go on the actual facts of what hospitals in Longman are getting today and what it will be under our proposals it will be much more than they've received ever in the past. The same goes for child care—



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  They are panicking, Senator O'Sullivan, you are quite correct. They know that in Trevor Ruthenberg the people of Longman have an outstanding candidate—one who's honest, who will listen to them and who hasn't denied the people of Caboolture.


She's been working in that seat and taking her pay for months—even years—when she knew she wasn't entitled to that pay. She knew from the very first time this citizenship issue arose that she was not eligible to sit in the Australian parliament and yet she continued to stay there, taking a handout, taking the taxpayers' money for wages and election support and taking allowances when she knew she wasn't entitled to them—



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Again, as my friend and colleague Senator O'Sullivan said, she did this with the full knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten. Mr Shorten went around Australia promising everybody that all of his team, including the member for Longman, were hunky-dory. No problem with the citizenship of this person and yet the member for Longman herself knew that she was not entitled to be receiving her pay cheque, she was not entitled to the allowances she was getting and she was not entitled to be down here pretending to represent the people of Longman.


With 'Big Trev Ruthenberg', that will change. He is an absolutely outstanding candidate—a man of the people. A man who's proved his worth to his community with the charitable works he's done all of his life and with the way he has helped people—real people—without thought of reward for himself. He is the sort of person that the people of Caboolture, of Bribie Island and of every other part of Longman need to represent them honestly and fairly in the federal parliament. I look forward to the day when he is sworn in to do exactly that.

  Thirty-seven years ago I brought a petition to the old Parliament House down the road to present to the then Minister for Primary Industry, Peter Nixon. In pre-social media days, 30,000 listeners to Melbourne's 3AW signed that petition calling for an end to live exports from Australia and it fell on deaf ears. The recent 60 Minutes expose, following on from Four Corners some years ago, showed that this cruelty still goes on despite what industry spokesmen are trying to tell you. I'm very proud that this year, nearly four decades later, well over 100,000 people have signed our petition for an end to this cruel practice. I thank those people from all over Australia for doing that, because this time I believe it will happen—phased in over five years, but it will happen.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:01):  In respect of the government response to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee report on arrangements for the postal survey, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I'm glad that we have finally got the government's report, some eight months after the postal survey was completed. The Finance and Public Administration References Committee made three recommendations on the arrangements for the postal survey. They were all pretty straightforward and all very strongly supported by the committee. I'll start with the one that the government has supported, recommendation 3:


The committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission actively engage with remote communities and Indigenous peak bodies to increase the number of enrolled people in remote electorates and to increase the participation of enrolled people in local, state and federal elections.


The government supports this recommendation, which is pleasing, because this is critical. We know that one of the by-products of the postal survey was that it actually did increase enrolments across the country. There were 100,000 new people enrolled through the process of the postal survey. But we know that, overall, these were overwhelmingly people in the cities rather than rural and remote people. We also know that participation in the postal survey was considerably lower in rural and remote communities, and particularly in Indigenous communities.


We are pleased to see the government's response to and support for that recommendation. However, it is disappointing to see the lack of support for the other two recommendations, in particular the first recommendation, the most important recommendation that we made. After having gone through the process of this postal survey and having seen the impact that it had on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer communities, the committee overwhelmingly recommended:


… that questions of human rights for minority groups should not be resolved by a public vote.


That was very clear. Although we've ended up with a good outcome—marriage equality in Australia; people being able to marry the person they love—the process that this government put our communities through should never be repeated again. There is ample evidence of the impact that the postal survey had on LGBTI communities. It was an unnecessary impact, because we did not need to go through this survey process. We did not need to have people's human rights put to a public vote. We should have had this parliament making the decision to legislate for marriage equality. But, no, we had huge impacts on the LGBTI community. There was an increase in the rate of vilification, particularly of transgender, lesbian and gay people. It is a massive amount of damage that was done, and this has been documented. Research has been undertaken looking at the impact of this survey on the LGBTI communities. It showed that significant damage was done to people's mental health and to their sense of belonging in the community and that there was an increase in the rate of harassment, vilification and prejudice against LGBTI people through the process of undertaking this survey.


We got through it. There were people who thought it wouldn't affect them very much. I know that there are some young people—in fact, I know one young person in particular who today is still feeling a bit shaken by the process he was put through, still feeling that he's having to process it. He's still seeking psychological support for having his whole identity, his sexuality, put under the spotlight of a public vote, of people making judgement on him as a young gay man. There was damage that was done. It is indisputable that damage was done.


That was why we would not recommend that this process be gone through again, that the human rights of minority groups should not be put to a public vote like this. So we are very disappointed that the government is only 'noting' the recommendation and then, in their response, they basically go on to say, 'Oh well, we ended up with a good answer.' In particular, they say that the exceptional level of public participation in the marriage survey showed a strong public endorsement for the process of the survey itself. Well, I beg to differ, because I think most people—the overwhelming majority of Australians who supported marriage equality before the postal survey—would have much preferred for the parliament to have done its job and to have legislated without putting the community through the process we were put through.


In particular, I had the opportunity of being one of the observers of the survey process and seeing the postal survey forms come in and the number of people who actually decided to vote informally or wrote comments on their postal survey papers. The overwhelming majority of those were actually saying: 'We should not be voting like this. We should not be putting the human rights of our fellow citizens to a public vote.' So, there was a lot of disquiet about it. Most people in Australia would have preferred us not to have gone through this process. Absolutely they wanted us to achieve marriage equality, but they would have much preferred for the parliament to have done its job rather than having the political fix. That's all this was. It was a political fix. It was so that the Liberal and National parties could get themselves out of a dilemma with the dinosaurs on their backbench who did not want marriage equality to go ahead. It was a political fix, and the LGBTI community was put through the ringer because of that political fix.


The final recommendation of our committee was that the Australian government consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey. The government, in their response, say they support and recognise the importance of ongoing funding for mental health treatment for all Australians, which is commendable. However, it does not address the gap in funding that is still there. It is still very difficult for LGBTIQ people to access the mental health support that many of them need because of the prejudice that's still there in the community, and there is a considerable increase in funding that is still required, way above and beyond what is outlined in this government response.


So, I implore the government. I call on them to really take a clear-eyed look at the need for supporting LGBTI people so that they can have that support that they need. And it's going to require a lot more money than is currently outlined. This is the sort of thing we should be spending money on, instead of having $200 billion of tax cuts—$200 billion through the personal and corporate tax cuts this government is proposing and legislating for, when we've got huge gaps in services, particularly in this instance the mental health services for LGBTI people.


Look, I'm pleased that we had a response. I'm pleased we have now finally, with this response, put to bed the whole process of the postal survey. I implore us to, please, not go down this avenue again. On issues of human rights, we as a society, we as a parliament should be able to see our way clear to legislate together rather than put the human rights of people to a public vote in the way that was done through this postal survey.

Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:10):  I also would like to speak briefly on the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into the arrangements for the postal survey that is before us and, indeed, the government's response. Although I'm a member of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, I'm not a member of the references committee so I didn't participate in this particular inquiry, but this does bring to an end a very, very important chapter in the political history of our country generally. More specifically, it brings to an end, it underlines, the very, very extensive and exhausting debate we had in our country in regards to how to give equal recognition before the law to same-sex relationships. I'm glad we ended with the outcome we did. I'm glad that the sun has continued to come up. Indeed, it goes down, comes up, goes down, comes up in a way that it did before we had the marriage debate and before we had the marriage legislation.


But it would be remiss of me, as someone who has come to the Australian Senate with a fervent faith in our parliamentary democracy, not to end this discussion with a reiteration of my strong and public view that plebiscites and, in particular, postal surveys have been a corrosive feature on our democracy. As I've been travelling the country since the marriage legislation passed, people have said to me, 'Senator Smith, you must agree the postal survey was necessary because we got the right outcome?' No. Not at all. Because the outcome could easily have been 49 to 51. What would that have done to the political debate? What would that have done to the social fabric of our country?


In coming to a very strong and clear view about why I opposed the plebiscite, as it was originally proposed, and why I opposed the postal survey was because, when you look at the history of our country and the plebiscites that were held in 1916 and 1917 on the very sensitive issue of conscription, when you read the history books—none of us were there, none of us can re-tell the stories from personal experience—it divided the country, it divided towns and it divided families. By the grace of God, this country pulled through and we got a wonderful result with the postal survey. I absolutely agree with the comments that the success of the postal survey process was because people endorsed the principles of fairness that underlined that marriage debate. It was not an endorsement of the process, nor was it an endorsement of the huge sums of money that were expended.


This country has much to be proud of in regards to its parliamentary history, and at the centre of that is the work of this chamber, the Senate chamber, and the other chamber in the House of Representatives. Plebiscites and postal surveys seek to undermine the work we do individually and collectively as parliamentarians. They are most definitely corrosive and undermine trust in the body politic. When people suggest that advisory plebiscites or, indeed, postal surveys can be used in the future to debate and come to a resolution on other important national issues, I will continue to oppose them with as much vehemence as I did the plebiscite and the postal survey in this case. Anything that undermines parliamentary democracy undermines the credibility and contribution of each and every one of us as senators and each and every one of us as federal parliamentarians. It is easier to hold your parliamentarian to account for his or her actions every three or four years, or in the case of senators, six. It is harder—near impossible—to hold your neighbour accountable for how they might conduct themselves in a postal survey or plebiscite. When people seek to hold their neighbours and the members of their community accountable, and not their federal parliamentarians, that great peace and stability that we've come to take for granted as a group of people is easily undermined and diminished.


This brings to an end a very, very important and historical part of our political process. It did bring pain to many families and to many LGBTI people. People who say that it didn't are either deliberately misleading or so far removed from the debate that their commentary is of little or no value. I was disappointed that the government didn't do more during the postal survey to support LGBTI people and their friends and family. That's a bruise that I take, as an LGBTI member of this government, very seriously. I'm deeply saddened by it, but this brings to an end an important chapter. I'm very grateful that, in bringing this chapter to an end, we were able to legislate for same-sex marriage in our country. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,21,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:01):  In respect of the government response to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee report on arrangements for the postal survey, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I'm glad that we have finally got the government's report, some eight months after the postal survey was completed. The Finance and Public Administration References Committee made three recommendations on the arrangements for the postal survey. They were all pretty straightforward and all very strongly supported by the committee. I'll start with the one that the government has supported, recommendation 3:


The committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission actively engage with remote communities and Indigenous peak bodies to increase the number of enrolled people in remote electorates and to increase the participation of enrolled people in local, state and federal elections.


The government supports this recommendation, which is pleasing, because this is critical. We know that one of the by-products of the postal survey was that it actually did increase enrolments across the country. There were 100,000 new people enrolled through the process of the postal survey. But we know that, overall, these were overwhelmingly people in the cities rather than rural and remote people. We also know that participation in the postal survey was considerably lower in rural and remote communities, and particularly in Indigenous communities.


We are pleased to see the government's response to and support for that recommendation. However, it is disappointing to see the lack of support for the other two recommendations, in particular the first recommendation, the most important recommendation that we made. After having gone through the process of this postal survey and having seen the impact that it had on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer communities, the committee overwhelmingly recommended:


… that questions of human rights for minority groups should not be resolved by a public vote.


That was very clear. Although we've ended up with a good outcome—marriage equality in Australia; people being able to marry the person they love—the process that this government put our communities through should never be repeated again. There is ample evidence of the impact that the postal survey had on LGBTI communities. It was an unnecessary impact, because we did not need to go through this survey process. We did not need to have people's human rights put to a public vote. We should have had this parliament making the decision to legislate for marriage equality. But, no, we had huge impacts on the LGBTI community. There was an increase in the rate of vilification, particularly of transgender, lesbian and gay people. It is a massive amount of damage that was done, and this has been documented. Research has been undertaken looking at the impact of this survey on the LGBTI communities. It showed that significant damage was done to people's mental health and to their sense of belonging in the community and that there was an increase in the rate of harassment, vilification and prejudice against LGBTI people through the process of undertaking this survey.


We got through it. There were people who thought it wouldn't affect them very much. I know that there are some young people—in fact, I know one young person in particular who today is still feeling a bit shaken by the process he was put through, still feeling that he's having to process it. He's still seeking psychological support for having his whole identity, his sexuality, put under the spotlight of a public vote, of people making judgement on him as a young gay man. There was damage that was done. It is indisputable that damage was done.


That was why we would not recommend that this process be gone through again, that the human rights of minority groups should not be put to a public vote like this. So we are very disappointed that the government is only 'noting' the recommendation and then, in their response, they basically go on to say, 'Oh well, we ended up with a good answer.' In particular, they say that the exceptional level of public participation in the marriage survey showed a strong public endorsement for the process of the survey itself. Well, I beg to differ, because I think most people—the overwhelming majority of Australians who supported marriage equality before the postal survey—would have much preferred for the parliament to have done its job and to have legislated without putting the community through the process we were put through.


In particular, I had the opportunity of being one of the observers of the survey process and seeing the postal survey forms come in and the number of people who actually decided to vote informally or wrote comments on their postal survey papers. The overwhelming majority of those were actually saying: 'We should not be voting like this. We should not be putting the human rights of our fellow citizens to a public vote.' So, there was a lot of disquiet about it. Most people in Australia would have preferred us not to have gone through this process. Absolutely they wanted us to achieve marriage equality, but they would have much preferred for the parliament to have done its job rather than having the political fix. That's all this was. It was a political fix. It was so that the Liberal and National parties could get themselves out of a dilemma with the dinosaurs on their backbench who did not want marriage equality to go ahead. It was a political fix, and the LGBTI community was put through the ringer because of that political fix.


The final recommendation of our committee was that the Australian government consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey. The government, in their response, say they support and recognise the importance of ongoing funding for mental health treatment for all Australians, which is commendable. However, it does not address the gap in funding that is still there. It is still very difficult for LGBTIQ people to access the mental health support that many of them need because of the prejudice that's still there in the community, and there is a considerable increase in funding that is still required, way above and beyond what is outlined in this government response.


So, I implore the government. I call on them to really take a clear-eyed look at the need for supporting LGBTI people so that they can have that support that they need. And it's going to require a lot more money than is currently outlined. This is the sort of thing we should be spending money on, instead of having $200 billion of tax cuts—$200 billion through the personal and corporate tax cuts this government is proposing and legislating for, when we've got huge gaps in services, particularly in this instance the mental health services for LGBTI people.


Look, I'm pleased that we had a response. I'm pleased we have now finally, with this response, put to bed the whole process of the postal survey. I implore us to, please, not go down this avenue again. On issues of human rights, we as a society, we as a parliament should be able to see our way clear to legislate together rather than put the human rights of people to a public vote in the way that was done through this postal survey.

Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



COUNTER-TERRORISM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2018


The Australian Government is committed to ensuring the safety and protection of the Australian community. Law enforcement and security agencies must have access to the tools and capabilities they need to manage the ever-evolving terrorist threat.


To this end, and consistent with the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM), this Bill extends the counter-terrorism powers and offences that are scheduled to sunset on 7 September 2018.


The control order regime, the preventative detention order regime, the declared areas offences, and the stop, search and seizure powers will continue for a further three years, until 7 September 2021.


Control orders under Division 104 of the Criminal Code are a key preventative tool to disrupt planning for terrorist acts. They allow for the overt, close monitoring of terrorist suspects who pose a risk to the community — either directly, or by facilitating others. Each of the controls in a control order must be reasonably appropriate and adapted to protect the public from a terrorist attack.


Preventative detention orders under Division 105 of the Criminal Code are also an important tool in preventing an imminent terrorist attack. They allow a person to be detained without charge to prevent a terrorist act or to preserve evidence of such an act. The gravity of these powers means that they can only be used where the AFP reasonably suspects an attack could occur within 14 days.


The declared areas offences in section 119.2 of the Criminal Code form part of the Australian Government's efforts to stop the flow of foreign fighters. They make it an offence to enter, or remain in, conflict zones in a foreign country in which terrorist organisations operate, and that is declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There are only very limited reasons for entering such an area, other than to participate in the conflict or train with terrorist organisations. The offences recognise this by allowing for a small range of exceptions.


Finally, the stop, search and seizure powers in Division 3A of Part IAA of the Crimes Act give police officers appropriate powers to act in the event of, or in anticipation of, a terrorist act. These powers allow police to request a person to provide their name, address and certain other details, stop and detain a person to conduct a search for a terrorism related item, seize terrorism related items in Commonwealth places such as airports, and enter premises without a warrant to prevent a terrorist act or avert a serious and imminent threat to a person's life, health or safety.


These powers and offences have been used rarely since they were enacted. Six control orders have been made since 2005. However, there have been no preventative detention orders made, and no incidents demanding the use of the stop, search and seizure powers. As the PJCIS and INSLM both recognised, the sparing use of these powers is not an argument that they are irrelevant. Rather, it underscores that the AFP and others have been appropriately judicious in exercising these powers, and that the extreme circumstances for using a number of them have thankfully not yet arisen.


The Bill will also continue the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's questioning, and questioning and detention powers, in Division 3 of Part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. These powers will be extended for a further 12 months until 7 September 2019.


This will enable the Government to consider the PJCIS's recommendations in relation to ASIO's powers. In the meantime, ASIO will continue to have access to these important tools in its efforts to gather critical intelligence to enhance Australia's counter-terrorism efforts.


Importantly, all the extended regimes will continue to be subject to extensive, and in some cases extended, safeguards and oversight.


Other technical changes


The Bill also makes a number of technical and procedural changes to implement other PJCIS and INSLM recommendations about control orders and declared areas.


The Bill will extend the minimum time period between an interim and a confirmation hearing for a control order from 72 hours to seven days. This will more realistically reflect the minimum time it takes for both parties to prepare for confirmation proceedings.


The Bill will also allow the person the subject of a control order or the AFP to apply to vary an interim control order, but only with the other party's consent. This is to provide flexibility for both parties to seek minor changes to the original terms of an interim order, but not the substantive terms of the order.


Further, the Bill will make clear that a court generally cannot order costs against the subject of control order proceedings. This reflects the AFP's long-standing practice, and recognises the significance of control order proceedings. However, the Bill will allow the AFP to seek costs where the subject of the proceedings has conducted their case unreasonably.


In relation to the declared area offence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be authorised to revoke a declaration of a declared area even where the legislative test for the declaration continues to be met. This will allow the Minister to revoke a declaration that may be no longer necessary or desirable, but where hostilities against a terrorist organisation may still be ongoing.


The Bill will also amend the list of legitimate purposes for entering a declared area so that it more clearly allows for the important role that the International Committee of the Red Cross performs in conflict situations.


Additional oversight


With such counter-terrorism powers and offences comes important responsibility. Therefore the Bill will require information on the exercise of these powers to be collected and introduce additional oversight measures.


The AFP will be required to notify the PJCIS in writing after the making of initial or continued preventative detention orders or a prohibited contact order. These measures provide the PJCIS with additional oversight of these orders.


The PJCIS will also have the power to report to Parliament on any declaration made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under section 119.3 of the Criminal Code at any time while the declaration is in effect, including during the disallowance period.


The Bill also implements PJCIS recommendations in relation to reporting on the use of stop, search and seizure powers in Division 3A of Part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914. There are currently no such reporting obligations. The Bill will require the AFP to report as soon as practicable after the exercise of these powers and require the Minister to table an annual report on the exercise of the powers. These measures will thus provide enhanced transparency and oversight.


The important functions of the PJCIS will also be further strengthened through amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The PJCIS will continue to have a duty to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the control order, preventative detention order, declared areas offences, and stop, search and seizure powers. As with its recent statutory review, the PJCIS will be required to provide a further report on the extended legislative regimes by 7 January 2021.


The PJCIS will also be empowered to monitor and review the performance by the AFP of its functions under Division 3A of


Part IAA of the Crimes Act, and the exercise of the Minister for Home Affairs' power to declare prescribed security zones.


Minor machinery of government changes


Finally, the Bill makes technical amendments to the Criminal Code to reflect the new division of responsibilities between the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs following the recent machinery of government arrangements.


Concluding remarks


This Bill ensures law enforcement and security agencies continue to have the capabilities to deal with the changing national security and threat environment while also protecting individual rights, including through further transparency and oversight measures.


The measures in this Bill implement the first part of the Government's response to the recommendations of the PJCIS and the INSLM's recent reviews. The second part of the Government's response to these reports—which concerns the creation of an extended supervision order scheme—will form part of a further Bill to be introduced later in 2018.


The PJCIS and INSLM have comprehensively examined the counter-terrorism provisions addressed in this Bill and have recommended, in light of the current threat environment, that they be continued. I acknowledge and appreciate the extensive and continuing work of the PJCIS and INSLM.


I also appreciate the ongoing partnership with states and territories in our joint effort to keep the Australian community safe.


To this end, this Government is unwavering in its commitment to ensuring Australia's counter-terrorism and national security framework continues to be as robust and responsive as possible.


TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (2018 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2018


The Government is committed to supporting the Australian innovation ecosystem by providing a tax and regulatory environment that will help innovative Australian businesses raise capital, grow and succeed; and get more Australians into more and better paying jobs.


This Government, the Turnbull Government, is the government of innovation, jobs and business creation. We want to see new businesses and new enterprises get off the ground and get going.


As promised in the Budget, we are putting in place the world's most forward-leaning regulatory sandbox for FinTech development.


The Turnbull Government sees an active FinTech sector as a critical driver of more competition in financial services. We want to see competition, because it will increase the pressure on financial providers — traditional and emerging — to be more responsive to consumers' needs and deliver better outcomes for Australians.


I am a strong believer that choice empowers consumers to seek the financial services that best suit their needs without being tied to businesses that don't listen.


The enhanced regulatory sandbox will allow firms to test new products and services without needing to obtain a financial services licence or a credit licence from ASIC first. It will allow trial and error in a controlled environment, giving firms a chance to confirm their concept through initial testing with clients.


In simple terms, this will help Australians and Australian businesses to access cheaper financing and better financial products so they can grow and invest. The productivity benefits that will flow from this will be huge. Most investment equals more jobs and better wages.


Those in business know the importance of meeting customer needs. The regulatory sandbox will provide a means to test market demand. It will give firms looking to do things differently — to do things better for consumers — a real leg up and clear air to get going. It will reduce the time it takes to make their products and services available to consumers' and it will mean entrepreneurs are more informed in making decisions on their offering before applying for a licence.


We have worked hard to develop a legislative regulatory sandbox which builds on ASIC's licence exemption. But we have also been mindful of ensuring the firms in the regulatory sandbox maintain protections for retail consumers.


The Government's enhanced sandbox is about helping FinTech businesses overcome the initial regulatory burden and costs of licensing that may otherwise hinder innovative offerings.


Schedule 1 to this Bill takes the first step. It extends the regulation-making powers in the Corporations Act, establishing the foundation for the Government's new framework.


The regulations will then set out the detail regarding eligibility criteria, the types of products and services that can be tested, and conditions that will need to be met during testing.


Prescribing the detail in regulations will mean timely adjustments can be made in response to the evolving market. This will ensure the regulatory sandbox stays fit for purpose in this rapidly moving sector. This approach, which combines legislative authority and flexibility, sets Australia apart from its international peers.


The draft regulations were released for public consultation between late October and November. The Government will consider those responses as we work to finalise the design of the regulations.


Under the proposal released for consultation, businesses will be able to test a wider range of new and innovative FinTech products and services. This includes holistic financial advice, the issuing of consumer credit contracts and facilitating crowd-sourced funding.


An extended 24-month testing timeframe was proposed and will give more time for businesses to adjust their offering as they evaluate commercial interest and test the validity of their concepts.


As I've mentioned, while businesses will be able to operate without a licence, they will still be required to meet key consumer protection requirements including responsible lending obligations, best interests duty, and to have adequate compensation and dispute resolution arrangements.


I believe the regulatory sandbox will be a game changer. It will support businesses that could revolutionise the financial services sector — right across the spectrum of innovation, including payments, insurance, credit, data and analytics and personal finance management.


Consumers are already benefiting from the emergence of FinTech firms. These nimble and consumer focused firms are putting pressure on traditional financial services providers to be more responsive and to deliver better outcomes for Australians.


I would like to thank the FinTech industry for their work with the Government to develop the regulatory sandbox and other initiatives we have progressed in the last two years.


The regulatory sandbox will no doubt be a source of many breakthrough innovations in FinTech in the coming years.


Schedule 2 to this Bill makes a number of minor technical amendments to the Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership, Venture Capital Limited Partnership and Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investor regimes to clarify the income tax law and ensure that these provisions operate in accordance with their original policy intent.


The Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors measure and the New Arrangements for Venture Capital Limited Partnerships measure were introduced as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. Together, these measures are designed to promote an innovative, risk-taking and entrepreneurial culture by providing incentives for investors to invest in Australian innovative, high growth potential start-ups and venture capital.


The amendments being made by this Bill will ensure that investors in innovative Australian businesses continue to benefit from effective, generous Government support and have certainty as to how these programmes are intended to operate.


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  I move:


That the provisions of the following bills be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 14 August 2018: 


(a) National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017; and


(b) Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017.


This motion seeks to refer two pieces of legislation, or provisions of two pieces of legislation—the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017—to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 14 August this year. The reason we're doing this is that this chamber, the Senate, is being asked to consider these pieces of legislation in an unholy rush. I'm relying on statements made by government ministers to back that up, those statements being that government intends to have these bills passed through the parliament this week but without offering any reasonable or rational justification for that unholy rush.


What's happened here, as often happens with bills that relate to national security, is that the closed shop of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security has got together and closed the doors on every single crossbencher in this Senate—none of us have a place on that committee—and, behind those closed doors, a cosy deal has been stitched up between the Labor Party and the coalition that, once again, will erode fundamental rights and liberties in this country. It's worth the Australian people knowing that in the past two decades there have been more than 200 pieces of legislation passed through the Commonwealth or through state and territory parliaments in this country that erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties that we actually used to send Australians overseas and sacrifice their lives to defend. These rights, freedoms and liberties are now being eroded, and they're being eroded by the Labor Party and coalition parties in zombie lock step. I'm very disappointed—very disappointed—in Labor senators because of the way this debate looks like going, and I warn Labor senators in particular that the chilling consequences of these two bills will be on their heads.


I only have a few minutes, so I'm going to run quickly through some of the issues. Not-for-profits that are not charities will have to register arrangements with sister organisations, apparently even if they're not associated with a foreign government. This is not only a significant regulatory burden but also non-compliance will potentially attract sentences of imprisonment. The espionage and foreign influence bill directly impacts on matters of concern: for example, criminalising protests in this country. So someone who protests against a new coalmine, for example, runs the risk of having that behaviour criminalised, even if it's done in a peaceful and non-violent way. They risk up to 20 years imprisonment for taking that protest action, even if that action is about sending a message to the world that we should not be opening new coalmines in Australia. This, again, will have a chilling effect on freedom of speech in our country and potentially is in breach of the implied right of political constitution in the Australian Constitution. The espionage and foreign influence bill also could impact on reporting by journalists on misconduct of the Australian government.


Let's be clear about this: these pieces of legislation are a continuance of a sustained attack on civil society in Australia. They are a continuance of the ongoing erosion of fundamental rights, liberties and freedoms in this country, and it is a matter of deep shame that Australia remains the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of bill or charter of rights to protect those fundamental rights and freedoms.


And of course corporations are exempt from these bills. According to the coalition and Labor it's okay to attack non-government organisations whose mandates are defending the environment, whose mandates are defending human rights, whose mandates are holding the government to account. Apparently it's okay to attack those groups, but hands off the big corporates. Again, we can see what big political donations buy in this place. Hands off the corporates because, of course, they are exempt from these bills, as are religious institutions, as are, shamefully, politicians. To suggest that for-profit businesses—be they involved in telecommunications, mining or pokies—let alone churches or the Vatican, have less influence on Australian politics than non-government organisations is either naive or woefully negligent. I urge the Senate to do its job and refer these bills for an inquiry. (Time expired)

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:25):  I understand the statements that other senators have made and I understand that they're not supporting this committee reference, so I'm not expecting my words to influence the outcome of the proposal by my colleague Senator McKim, which is, on the face of it, really quite simple: to have a more thorough examination of a very, very large number of amendments that are intended to be put and, potentially, passed by this chamber within the next couple of days on issues that go to some of the fundamental parts of our freedoms. I know the core of this legislation, the broader ideas of it, has gone before the joint security committee. If I'm correct, that's one that doesn't have crossbench representation.


I literally do have a grey beard so I probably am playing the 'old grey beard' role of the Senate here but this brings to me so many echoes of so many previous debates. I recall a number of times when former Senator Robert Ray, who was very ferocious in the way he put his arguments but very learned in his approach, would back up his position with facts rather than just hollow rhetoric. There was a view back then, and there still is today, that somehow security matters are the domain of just the two parties of the political establishment, and, for crossbenchers, it is, 'You can look at it all once we decide to give it to you in the chamber.' That would be okay if we then had adequate time to look at the detail of those matters. These are not minor matters—I won't repeat what my colleague Senator McKim just said about some of them. They are large in number. Perhaps this may give some senators some reason not to reconsider their position on this motion—I know that won't happen—but to at least consider ensuring that this debate, when it happens in this chamber, is not guillotined, that the amendments are properly examined and that, if necessary, it goes through to the next sitting in August. Unless a case is made for extreme urgency on the grounds of security, then it does merit proper scrutiny. Surely, if there's one thing that this chamber should still be able to hold its head up as being able to do properly, it is to properly scrutinise legislation.


The particular echo I had, in a strange way, folds back to the comments that Senator Dean Smith just made on a separate report. In the week that this chamber guillotined through the legislation to make same-sex marriage illegal, it also guillotined through two pieces of antiterrorism legislation, also under the guise that somehow this was super-urgent, super-necessary and just had to be pushed through. Right on the eve of the election, the chamber went right through to a Friday and guillotined it through. It was part of what made that particular week so distressing, because they were such serious matters. We all know how many more times we've had security legislation and antiterrorism legislation of all sorts continually put through this chamber since then. Each time it's justified as being necessary but each time it's also justified as being urgent.


Here we've got something with so much detail and on matters of such significance—areas where, frankly, it hasn't been proven that a lot of the past changes have been necessary. Surely, we can finally learn from those past mistakes and not just keep going over the same old problem. Maybe this will end up getting passed anyway by whatever combination of senators, whether it is both the traditional parties of the establishment or some mixture of the crossbench, but let's at least ensure that we have proper scrutiny.


The ideal way to do that on something of this level of detail and by something that enables broader scrutiny by a cross-section of the community—who are the people that will be most directly affected by this, not us in this chamber—is to send it to a Senate committee. But seeing that we're probably not doing that, I simply take the opportunity to urge the Senate to make sure that there is full scrutiny given to all these amendments; that, if necessary, it not be guillotined through this week and that it be given the level of sober and proper consideration that the Australian community deserves.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:30):  I indicate that I will support this motion to refer these two bills to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. They are very important bills. They have significant implications for our civil society and for our law—the way that we deal with spying and foreign interference. And they create new offences. Anything that creates new offences has to be taken exceptionally seriously.


Unlike Senator McKim, I have my reasons for this, which may be a little different, but there is a very legitimate complaint in relation to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. That committee does not allow other participating members—there is nobody from the Greens and nobody from the crossbench involved in it. Yes, we can read all the submissions—at least, the ones that are published; they're not all published—but we don't hear the evidence of the security agencies and we don't really know how it's all going to end up.


We've had this process reach its next stage this week, in which the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has introduced its recommendations and the government already has the amendments which are based on that report. We got exposed to them today, or yesterday, and we are being asked to vote on them this week. We are told that we've had ample opportunity to consider both the bills and the potential amendments. It's not true, and we haven't.


I have had the opportunity to consider these perhaps a little more than Senator McKim has because I've had briefings from the Attorney-General's Department and ASIO. I'm very grateful for those. I have to say that some of my concerns about the original bills, which I regarded as quite alarming in their content, have been allayed by the amendments based on the PJCIS recommendations. That's a good thing. But I've had, essentially, 24 hours to get my head around them.


Now, we've had this situation before—many times, as a matter of fact. I've been here for four years now, and we've had quite a raft of national security legislation and antiterrorism legislation. It's embraced or introduced things like control orders and preventive detention orders. Invariably, there has been some pretext that it be hurried up, that it was urgent. And then we would end up with control orders and preventive detention orders not being used. Nobody uses them. They're urgent, urgent, urgent—we have to get them into the books because there's some sort of national security crisis and then they don't get used.


What we do get, though, are free-speech restrictions. We saw, in the case of section 35P of the ASIO Act, unreasonable restraint on free speech. I railed against it at the time it went through. I knew it wasn't a good thing; I knew it was totally unnecessary, as a matter of fact. Nobody took any notice, of course, of just a crossbench senator. But then it went to Roger Giles QC, who said the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security legislation was inappropriate and had gone too far. So guess what? The government changed it. Then I drew attention to the fact that there was a similar provision in another act affecting the Australian Federal Police, and the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, to his credit, agreed to amend that without having a fight over it.


So fixing up the legislation later is one option. But another way to deal with it is to have a look at it in committee—where we can all participate, where we can all canvass our concerns—and deal with it in the normal process that we should be applying in this Senate. There is no case for urgency. We can conduct by-elections without this legislation. We have previously conducted many by-elections without this legislation and no-one can point to any adverse consequences of having done so. It is not necessary to rush it. We should take our time.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:36):  I rise to contribute to this debate in relation to the referral moved by my colleague Senator McKim. I would like to highlight the recklessness of the opposition and the government in refusing to allow this reference to go ahead. Only this afternoon we have had a package of bills presented to this place with 270 amendments that we are expected to vote upon as early as tomorrow. No-one in their right mind would think that 270 amendments whacked on the table only a couple of hours before we finish tonight, with the expectation that this bill will be brought on by the government tomorrow, would in any way be the appropriate avenue for debating something as important as foreign interference.


We know the reason why the government is rushing this piece of legislation. It is because, according to the Minister, Christian Porter, and members of Malcolm Turnbull's government, this all needs to be done and dusted prior to 28 July and the by-elections. But, of course, not everybody in the government thinks this. We know that Minister Pyne was dubious about whether it was urgent. Remember that? He either read the speaking notes and didn't agree with them or didn't read them at all. Either way, there is clear division, even within the senior cabinet, about whether the bills in this package of legislation are important and urgent enough to be rushed through and are up to scratch. And it clearly isn't up to scratch. Otherwise, we wouldn't have 270 amendments whacked on the table at a minute to midnight. So it is not as urgent, I would argue, as the government is proposing.


For the Labor Party to line up with the government to rush through such an extraordinary package of bills that cover such a breadth of Australian community, business and civil society groups is astounding. We know that there have been concerns from journalists, we know that there have been concerns from the media sector and we know that there have been concerns from academic institutions. There have been concerns from the artistic community in relation to the impact that these laws would have on their operations. They are worried that they are being caught up in this big broad net whether it was intended or not. So now we have 270 amendments to try and get through when we don't know what the implications will be. They require, in and of themselves, appropriate scrutiny and review. This is the job of the Senate. The job of the Senate is to review pieces of legislation put forward from the government, through the House and to this place. Our job is not to rubberstamp—no, no, no—our job is to review, to scrutinise, to approve, to change, to amend or, ultimately, to reject. That is our job.


Being told to do this now, at a minute to midnight, is just extraordinary. There are 270 amendments to this package of bills. It is not just one piece of legislation here; there are three bills. It undermines the role of the Senate. It undermines the role of the Senate to do its job and the responsibility that we all have as senators to ensure that pieces of legislation don't just pass this place, because the government wants a rubberstamp, because they're worried that they don't have anything else to campaign on in the lead-up to the 28 July by-elections. 


Is it any surprise that the government's in trouble in Mayo, and so what do they do? They pull out the national security card. That's what's going on here. When this government thought that they may have been ahead in the Mayo by-election with their dud of a candidate, Georgina Downer, they thought, 'Let's lock it in with some antiforeigner legislation'. Wrong move, you're going to lose it anyway.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator McKim, Business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2, be agreed to.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  I move:


That the provisions of the following bills be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 14 August 2018: 


(a) National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017; and


(b) Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017.


This motion seeks to refer two pieces of legislation, or provisions of two pieces of legislation—the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017—to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 14 August this year. The reason we're doing this is that this chamber, the Senate, is being asked to consider these pieces of legislation in an unholy rush. I'm relying on statements made by government ministers to back that up, those statements being that government intends to have these bills passed through the parliament this week but without offering any reasonable or rational justification for that unholy rush.


What's happened here, as often happens with bills that relate to national security, is that the closed shop of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security has got together and closed the doors on every single crossbencher in this Senate—none of us have a place on that committee—and, behind those closed doors, a cosy deal has been stitched up between the Labor Party and the coalition that, once again, will erode fundamental rights and liberties in this country. It's worth the Australian people knowing that in the past two decades there have been more than 200 pieces of legislation passed through the Commonwealth or through state and territory parliaments in this country that erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties that we actually used to send Australians overseas and sacrifice their lives to defend. These rights, freedoms and liberties are now being eroded, and they're being eroded by the Labor Party and coalition parties in zombie lock step. I'm very disappointed—very disappointed—in Labor senators because of the way this debate looks like going, and I warn Labor senators in particular that the chilling consequences of these two bills will be on their heads.


I only have a few minutes, so I'm going to run quickly through some of the issues. Not-for-profits that are not charities will have to register arrangements with sister organisations, apparently even if they're not associated with a foreign government. This is not only a significant regulatory burden but also non-compliance will potentially attract sentences of imprisonment. The espionage and foreign influence bill directly impacts on matters of concern: for example, criminalising protests in this country. So someone who protests against a new coalmine, for example, runs the risk of having that behaviour criminalised, even if it's done in a peaceful and non-violent way. They risk up to 20 years imprisonment for taking that protest action, even if that action is about sending a message to the world that we should not be opening new coalmines in Australia. This, again, will have a chilling effect on freedom of speech in our country and potentially is in breach of the implied right of political constitution in the Australian Constitution. The espionage and foreign influence bill also could impact on reporting by journalists on misconduct of the Australian government.


Let's be clear about this: these pieces of legislation are a continuance of a sustained attack on civil society in Australia. They are a continuance of the ongoing erosion of fundamental rights, liberties and freedoms in this country, and it is a matter of deep shame that Australia remains the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of bill or charter of rights to protect those fundamental rights and freedoms.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:50):  I rise to continue speaking to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. We've come a long way in our attitude towards higher education in this nation. In my days at school, there was a predominant focus on trades and jobs that relied on learning in the workplace. But, over decades, there has been a shift in our way of thinking and in the way in which we learn. As well, many jobs that existed are no longer, and many occupations now available weren't dreamed of then. Since the 1950s we have seen the number of students attaining university entrance in Australia raise from 30,600 to a whopping 1.3 million. Over the last 70 years, more than 28 million people have graduated from higher education in this country, and our universities have produced some of the greatest minds in the world. As well as this, our universities rate with the best in the world. Currently, we have a range of higher education providers across Australia, including 38 public universities and four others which are classified as private, plus around 125 other institutions providing a variety of higher education services.


Our nation's universities were originally established to provide qualifications in professions such as medicine and law, as well as traditional liberal arts learning. This is very different to our broad selection on offer today, including courses for careers that weren't even thought of in my day. Included in this is something called 'gender studies'. Why a university would offer a course on gender studies but not the study on the history of Western civilisation I can neither understand nor support. That aside, I'm pleased to say that higher education in this nation is no longer just for the well-off. It is now a choice within the reach of everyone who works to get there. This is because the government subsidises course fees in our 38 public universities to an average of around 58 per cent.


Students supplied with a Commonwealth-supported place can their borrow their contribution, which is half the real cost of their education, until they have a sufficient income to repay it. With generous subsidies and student loans available to students attending universities, financial status is no longer a barrier to post-secondary study. However, there still exist barriers according to postcode, with a greater discrepancy of rates for students from rural and regional areas—I'll return to this point soon. That said, this parliament has a duty to ensure the money we lend to students to ensure their financial security is recognised as a debt to the people of Australia, and to require that it is paid back as soon as possible. With more than 3.8 million students enrolled in 9,444 schools across Australia today, we have an obligation to them and to those who will be born tomorrow to ensure that the scheme is sustainable, that their access to higher education in the future is assured. Already we have areas of skills deficits, and professions which rely on overseas recruitment. If our economy is to grow, especially in regional areas, we need to think about how we can skill our young people to meet these needs.


What we do need to do is ensure that the training they get is in line with what Australia's industries need, and this is not necessarily all provided by universities. We need skilled tradesmen and others to be well skilled across a range of occupations and industries, for productive participation in our economy. A university qualification should not be the only career pathway provided to young people. They need to see that alternative pathways are just as worthwhile and will lead to a good life. But, to do this, there need to be quality training alternatives available to them.


Over the past decades, the TAFE system has been progressively downgraded by governments as more students have opted for a university education in preference to the occupational training that TAFE offered. We now have to move to reverse this through a stronger TAFE system, thereby giving a real choice to our young people in training and career aspirations.


The people of Australia are currently owed $42 billion for student loans. I'll repeat that: $42 billion for student loans. That's 2.6 million Australians with an outstanding student loan debt. The debt would have been $48 billion, but this government wrote off $6 billion of student loans in the last year. This was a lesson about what happens when there is insufficient accountability for public funds. Under the then VET loan scheme, too many young people were tricked by shoddy operators into signing up to dodgy courses and ended up with a debt they were unaware they had to repay. Thankfully, compliance measures now in place should protect against this in the future.


The Productivity Commission estimates that the value of outstanding student loans will quadruple to $200 billion by 2025. Let's face it, that figure will effectively negate any surplus this government thinks it will have in coming in years. From 30 June 2014 through until 30 June 2017, the level of debt not expected to be repaid rose from 17 per cent to 25 per cent. That equates to about $1 in every $6 lent, or now $1 in every $4 lent.


In the banking sector, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission mandates responsible lending. This is determined by two specific questions: (1) has the lender made reasonable inquiries about the borrower's financial situation and their requirements and objectives? And (2) has the lender taken reasonable steps to verify that the consumer's financial situation supports their capacity to repay? To relate this to the student loan scheme, the questions to be asked are: is there a reasonable expectation that the student will successfully complete the course; and will this lead to getting a job?


I'm not convinced that this happens, and in some cases young people with low entry scores are being enrolled. That is, they're being set up to fail. On top of this, there are those undertaking studies which have little likelihood of leading to a paid job. It is in everyone's interests that students are required to meet the entry levels set for their chosen course of study before they qualify for a loan. This, in turn, gives a reasonable expectation that they will successfully complete their studies and go on to get employment in their chosen field. We have an obligation, not only to the students who want to borrow money under this scheme but to the taxpayers who fund it. When one in four students will never pay back the money they borrow, I question whether we are doing the right thing by our young people. And, at the same time, we are setting this loan scheme up for failure. I won't sit back and see it fail.


Pauline Hanson's One Nation will be supporting this Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. I support the changes to rein in student debt under the scheme, but place on notice that I will be looking at ways that it can be further reduced. The new thresholds are well supported by facts. Those facts say that graduates easily have the means to start repaying their loans with an income of $44,999 or above. Remember, the bill proposes that at this starting level the required payment is only one per cent of their taxable income. That is only about $8 a week at the lowest income level.


According to the 2015 report released by Graduate Careers Australia, which details median starting salaries in various categories of graduate jobs, all but two categories will earn above the $44,999 starting income that the bill proposes, and these are 2015 salary levels. These include dentistry, optometry, medicine, education, earth science, engineering, mathematics, social work, law, paramedical studies, computer science, accounting, agricultural science, biological sciences, economics and business, physical science, psychology, veterinary science, humanities, social sciences, and agriculture and building. The lowest-paid graduate job category, art and design, shows a starting salary of $40,000 per annum. Every single one of these degrees will set graduates up with the prospect of a full-time job and the capacity to repay, at the very least, one per cent of the money borrowed to obtain their education. Let's remember that the earning potential of first-year graduates will only grow over time.


I want to comment on the second reading amendment by Senator Hanson-Young. This amendment claims that the government is cutting $2.2 billion from universities when it is not a cut but a freeze. I believe the freeze is warranted given the growth in funding to universities that we have seen in recent years, ever since they were given open slather in enrolling students regardless of their academic achievement. Sarah Hanson-Young's amendment also says that the bill 'makes students pay back more of their debt sooner'. No, they're not paying back more of their debt; their paying back their debt sooner. I expect nothing less from the Greens than a play on words, and not being really up-front and honest with the people.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  You've just lied!




Senator HANSON:
  So, yes, repayment of the student loan will start earlier, and so it should—as soon as income allows for it. I challenge anyone to say that $8 a week will be a hardship for someone who is on a taxable income of $45,000 a year. I'm sure they could go without a couple of coffees a week to pay back their obligation to the Australian taxpayer. I spoke earlier about salary levels for graduates in various professions—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Leyonhjelm
):  Senator Hanson-Young, a point of order.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I have a point of order when it comes to misleading the Senate. Senator Hanson has said that she doesn't believe that anyone would struggle with having to pay an extra $8 a week—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's a debating point, Senator Hanson-Young. Resume your seat.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  This is the woman who thinks she's meant to look after the battlers. She's a joke.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, resume your seat. I also heard you make a very unparliamentary comment about Senator Hanson, and I invite you to withdraw. I heard you call Senator Hanson a liar. Now, please withdraw.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I'll withdraw 'liar', and I'll say that she misled the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator HANSON:
  I'm surprised: $8 a week is not much, considering that they've been given the taxpayer funding to further their education and to get better jobs and a better life. I think that's great for $8 a week. I don't think it's any imposition. As I said, they could go without a couple of coffees a week and pay back their obligation to the Australian taxpayer.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Have you actually ever struggled in your life?




Senator HANSON:
  Senator Hanson-Young actually knows what it's like to pay back the debt to the Australian taxpayer, when it took her I think a year to pay back to the government the $15,000 or $20,000 that she owed the taxpayer because she overspent on her travel. So, she should understand what it is to pay back the Australian taxpayer when you do the wrong thing.


I spoke earlier about salary levels for graduates in various professions. Entry to these occupations and professions is by virtue of taxpayer funding. The student loan scheme in its various forms has given them a wonderful opportunity to pursue their chosen career path, and their loan should be repaid as soon as it is affordable to do so. 


I mentioned earlier my concerns about the lower level of access to higher education by students from rural and regional areas compared to those from major centres. I believe that Australia is well provided for by universities which have campuses in smaller centres and regional cities, and I applaud them for their initiatives geared to the needs of students from those areas. However, more can and should be done for our rural and regional areas. I visit areas of my state and talk to people about their needs. In too many areas, population levels are falling. When this happens, it becomes a domino effect. When schools close and medical services are cut back, it becomes harder and harder to attract and retain people. Communities need these essential services, and they need the skilled tradespeople and workers to keep them viable. I want to see higher education and vocational studies geared more closely to the needs of individual communities, and our regional universities are ideally placed to do this. 


In conclusion, the student loan scheme needs to remain viable so that kids in Queensland going through primary school today knowing that it will be there in years to come and that they'll be able to attend regional campuses like Central Queensland University, the University of Southern Queensland, the University of the Sunshine Coast and James Cook University—all of which are excelling in meeting the needs of our regions. I take my hat off to them for their efforts. Along with our other universities and higher education providers in Queensland, our young people have a real choice in tertiary education. The next step is to extend this choice through greater access to apprenticeships and vocational education and training. 


I am on record as supporting a substantial increase to the number of apprenticeships and urge the government to do more to provide better support to small and medium businesses, particularly in regional areas, to take on apprentices and train our future generation of tradesmen and tradeswomen. As I said before, let's move to build up TAFE so that our children will have real choice—choice will allow them to contribute to and be part of a strong future Australian society. This way we will provide real work choice to school leavers and ensure Australia's future economic growth.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (19:07):  I, along with my Greens colleagues, oppose the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. It should be self-evident from even the most cursory glance—and obviously any glance deeper than that—that this bill will impact most significantly on people on lower incomes. It will impact particularly the group of people on lower incomes who have undertaken higher education and training, which is exactly the sort of thing we encourage people to do. It particularly affects younger people, but it also affects older people who are trying to retrain, as they're continually told to do. The high priests of neoliberal fundamentalism that have been driving economic policy in this country since the 1980s demand exactly that of people. 


We've got a rapidly changing economy and a rapidly changing workforce where different skills are needed, so you go out and retrain. But, if you go out and retrain, we'll charge you for it and then expect you to pay it back before you've even managed to earn enough to get yourself back on your feet. It's just putting one extra burden on top of another for people who are already amongst those who are struggling the most. That, unfortunately, is a description that applies so consistently to this government that you may as well just put it on play and repeat for pretty much every second piece of legislation—certainly anything that relates to economics in this place. 


Last week, of course, we had massive tax cuts—big piles of money—made available to people on the highest incomes, and this week we have this government wanting to make more billions of dollars available to the biggest corporations. At the same time, the government want to push through legislation that will make people who are earning less than the median wage have to pay more if they've had the temerity to try and improve their education. Often it's a necessity to undertake education and training to try and get employment. We all hear it time and time again, the ridiculous mantra from the government benches. I heard it time and time again 10 years ago and 20 years ago: 'The best form of welfare is a job. What these people need to do is get a job.' But when they try to get training or to get an education to enable themselves to get a job, they get more debt. Now the government wants to force them to pay back that debt before these people are even earning enough money to get by as it is.


I am one of those—again befitting my literal greybeard role—from the era when university fees were not charged in the 1980s. It was in my final year at the University of Queensland that the Hawke Labor government brought in tertiary fees again. One of the great legacies of the Whitlam era, along with Medibank, was free tertiary education, which the Fraser government kept free. It was the Labor government, under the spell of the neoliberalism philosophy that is now so massively discredited, that introduced tertiary fees back in the late 1980s. It is a matter of folklore now that Mr Joe Hockey, who as Treasurer liked to talk about the 'end of the age of entitlement', was a student politician at that time in the 1980s. I remember how he protested against tertiary fees. So did I and many other people. Many people were spun the line, 'It's only a small amount,' and, 'You won't have to repay it until you're earning well above average wages, so it's completely fair and just.' Many people knew it was, quite rightly, a classic case of the thin edge of the wedge. And that is what we have seen ever since. The fees go up and up and up, the threshold at which you have to start repaying that debt gets lower and lower and lower. This is yet another stage in that process.


We all know that more and more people, particularly younger people, cannot access secure, permanent, full-time work. We all know how much more difficult that makes it for them, not just to get a loan to buy a house but also to get credit and loans to buy all sorts of things, to be able to get business loans and generate all those other different ways of trying to build a different way forward. When you've got that extra debt on top of it, it just makes it that much more difficult.


The Greens' policy is that we should be reversing this trend with regard to university fees, but the legislation before us is going even further in the wrong direction. With the tax cuts to big businesses and the massively wealthy people who run them, the current government is only going to increase the large wealth disparity that we see plaguing this country. This is another measure that will simply increase inequality. Surely all of us here now know that inequality is one of the major challenges, economic as well as social, facing this country.


An important factor of this legislation that needs to be noted is that it will impact more significantly on women. The lowering of this repayment threshold will be forcing 185,000 additional people to start paying back their fees earlier, when their income is below the median wage. Often, because they've undergone study, they've foregone the opportunity for a full-time income. It is almost impossible to have a full-time income and study full time. It is incredibly expensive to study with all of the extra costs associated with study apart from fees, so the vast majority of students, unless they happen to have wealthy families, are already in economic difficulties as part of going through that. That is fine if it provides the opportunity to come out the other side with greater opportunity to gain employment, but we all know, under the workplace laws that have been in place since Labor was last in government and the way they've now played out under the current coalition government, more and more graduates are finding it difficult to obtain jobs—certainly permanent, stable, full-time jobs. And even when they do find work, wages are stagnant.


The National Foundation for Australian Women found that the proposed changes will have disproportionately more negative impacts for young women attending university. They've stated that graduates caught between these policies will experience considerable financial stress. Graduates who are currently earning $51,000, more of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income than someone without a HECS debt earning $32,000. To reflect on the remarks of the previous speaker, who seemed to think that this should all be okay—'If people buy one or two fewer cups of coffee a week, they'll be fine to get by on $32,000 a year'—in any location where there are high housing costs, transport costs, caring costs, medical costs or the other challenges that so many people face, it is incredibly difficult. It will also negatively affect young mothers, in particular, who are already financially constrained by the costs of child care, and may be a further disincentive for them to enter the workforce.


For all the narrative that we hear from others in this place about the need to incentivise people to get a job, what we're actually doing is making it harder and harder for them, putting more and more disincentives in place, and continuing the regime of punishing the poor. As the second reading amendment from my colleague Senator Hanson-Young states, this is another indication of this government's war on young people and the poor. They are quite happy to hand out large amounts of money to their benefactors, to their corporate mates and to the wealthy while, at the same time, saying, 'We've got a budget crisis, so we've got to keep squeezing the poorest.' It's a stereotype, but it's so true. It is, of course, the easiest thing to do. It takes no courage to make changes that assist the wealthy and those that are already influential, but, as others have said prior to me, what does take courage is to make changes that support and assist those that are most in need. This parliament, time and time again, has its priorities very much the wrong way around, because these changes will indisputably make life more difficult for a specific group of low-income earners: people who have chosen or, in some cases, basically been forced, to undertake further or higher education or to upgrade, diversify or broaden their skills. We punish them further for trying to improve themselves.


We are in a situation where young people in hospitality and retail are having their penalty rates cut. They're having their incomes cut, yet some of those very same people, who are already struggling to get by, will now also be expected to be paying more on lower wages. These are young people who can't buy a house or who, if you're a student, certainly can't afford to rent a house unless they're doing it with a group of other people. Today I was talking to a young student named Gabby, who had just finished studying on the Sunshine Coast, about the immense financial challenge of getting through the studying process and coming out at the end of it with an enormous debt. Let's not forget the size of the debts we're talking about here. The previous speaker talked about it as though this is money that people owe the Australian taxpayer. Well, they do, unfortunately, but they shouldn't have to. People shouldn't come out of higher education or upgrading their skills with a massive debt. They certainly shouldn't have to repay that debt when their own income is below even the median full-time income. When they're low-income earners, we're expecting people to pay back a debt that they really shouldn't have incurred in the first place.


The whole argument—which has been shown over the years to be very flawed—that supposedly justified HECS was that people get an economic benefit out of being able to go to university. Certainly, some people very much do, but, if they get a higher economic benefit out of it, they should pay something back to the public through HECS fees. But we're now trying to force people to pay back it when they're not getting a higher economic benefit, when they're actually under the median wage and when they're a low-income earner. That is the bizarre logic that is trying to be applied here to justify squeezing more money out of people who are on low incomes.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-06-26,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:50):  I rise to continue speaking to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. We've come a long way in our attitude towards higher education in this nation. In my days at school, there was a predominant focus on trades and jobs that relied on learning in the workplace. But, over decades, there has been a shift in our way of thinking and in the way in which we learn. As well, many jobs that existed are no longer, and many occupations now available weren't dreamed of then. Since the 1950s we have seen the number of students attaining university entrance in Australia raise from 30,600 to a whopping 1.3 million. Over the last 70 years, more than 28 million people have graduated from higher education in this country, and our universities have produced some of the greatest minds in the world. As well as this, our universities rate with the best in the world. Currently, we have a range of higher education providers across Australia, including 38 public universities and four others which are classified as private, plus around 125 other institutions providing a variety of higher education services.


Our nation's universities were originally established to provide qualifications in professions such as medicine and law, as well as traditional liberal arts learning. This is very different to our broad selection on offer today, including courses for careers that weren't even thought of in my day. Included in this is something called 'gender studies'. Why a university would offer a course on gender studies but not the study on the history of Western civilisation I can neither understand nor support. That aside, I'm pleased to say that higher education in this nation is no longer just for the well-off. It is now a choice within the reach of everyone who works to get there. This is because the government subsidises course fees in our 38 public universities to an average of around 58 per cent.


Students supplied with a Commonwealth-supported place can their borrow their contribution, which is half the real cost of their education, until they have a sufficient income to repay it. With generous subsidies and student loans available to students attending universities, financial status is no longer a barrier to post-secondary study. However, there still exist barriers according to postcode, with a greater discrepancy of rates for students from rural and regional areas—I'll return to this point soon. That said, this parliament has a duty to ensure the money we lend to students to ensure their financial security is recognised as a debt to the people of Australia, and to require that it is paid back as soon as possible. With more than 3.8 million students enrolled in 9,444 schools across Australia today, we have an obligation to them and to those who will be born tomorrow to ensure that the scheme is sustainable, that their access to higher education in the future is assured. Already we have areas of skills deficits, and professions which rely on overseas recruitment.

A university qualification should not be the only career pathway provided to young people. They need to see that alternative pathways are just as worthwhile and will lead to a good life. But, to do this, there need to be quality training alternatives available to them.

We now have to move to reverse this through a stronger TAFE system, thereby giving a real choice to our young people in training and career aspirations.


The people of Australia are currently owed $42 billion for student loans. I'll repeat that: $42 billion for student loans. That's 2.6 million Australians with an outstanding student loan debt. The debt would have been $48 billion, but this government wrote off $6 billion of student loans in the last year. This was a lesson about what happens when there is insufficient accountability for public funds. Under the then VET loan scheme, too many young people were tricked by shoddy operators into signing up to dodgy courses and ended up with a debt they were unaware they had to repay. Thankfully, compliance measures now in place should protect against this in the future.


The Productivity Commission estimates that the value of outstanding student loans will quadruple to $200 billion by 2025. Let's face it, that figure will effectively negate any surplus this government thinks it will have in coming in years. From 30 June 2014 through until 30 June 2017, the level of debt not expected to be repaid rose from 17 per cent to 25 per cent. That equates to about $1 in every $6 lent, or now $1 in every $4 lent.

This, in turn, gives a reasonable expectation that they will successfully complete their studies and go on to get employment in their chosen field. We have an obligation, not only to the students who want to borrow money under this scheme but to the taxpayers who fund it. When one in four students will never pay back the money they borrow, I question whether we are doing the right thing by our young people. And, at the same time, we are setting this loan scheme up for failure. I won't sit back and see it fail.


Pauline Hanson's One Nation will be supporting this Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018.

In conclusion, the student loan scheme needs to remain viable so that kids in Queensland going through primary school today knowing that it will be there in years to come and that they'll be able to attend regional campuses like Central Queensland University, the University of Southern Queensland, the University of the Sunshine Coast and James Cook University—all of which are excelling in meeting the needs of our regions. I take my hat off to them for their efforts. Along with our other universities and higher education providers in Queensland, our young people have a real choice in tertiary education. The next step is to extend this choice through greater access to apprenticeships and vocational education and training. 


I am on record as supporting a substantial increase to the number of apprenticeships and urge the government to do more to provide better support to small and medium businesses, particularly in regional areas, to take on apprentices and train our future generation of tradesmen and tradeswomen. As I said before, let's move to build up TAFE so that our children will have real choice—choice will allow them to contribute to and be part of a strong future Australian society. This way we will provide real work choice to school leavers and ensure Australia's future economic growth.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-26,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (19:07):  I, along with my Greens colleagues, oppose the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. It should be self-evident from even the most cursory glance—and obviously any glance deeper than that—that this bill will impact most significantly on people on lower incomes. It will impact particularly the group of people on lower incomes who have undertaken higher education and training, which is exactly the sort of thing we encourage people to do. It particularly affects younger people, but it also affects older people who are trying to retrain, as they're continually told to do. The high priests of neoliberal fundamentalism that have been driving economic policy in this country since the 1980s demand exactly that of people. 


We've got a rapidly changing economy and a rapidly changing workforce where different skills are needed, so you go out and retrain. But, if you go out and retrain, we'll charge you for it and then expect you to pay it back before you've even managed to earn enough to get yourself back on your feet. It's just putting one extra burden on top of another for people who are already amongst those who are struggling the most. That, unfortunately, is a description that applies so consistently to this government that you may as well just put it on play and repeat for pretty much every second piece of legislation—certainly anything that relates to economics in this place. 


Last week, of course, we had massive tax cuts—big piles of money—made available to people on the highest incomes, and this week we have this government wanting to make more billions of dollars available to the biggest corporations. At the same time, the government want to push through legislation that will make people who are earning less than the median wage have to pay more if they've had the temerity to try and improve their education. Often it's a necessity to undertake education and training to try and get employment. We all hear it time and time again, the ridiculous mantra from the government benches. I heard it time and time again 10 years ago and 20 years ago: 'The best form of welfare is a job. What these people need to do is get a job.' But when they try to get training or to get an education to enable themselves to get a job, they get more debt. Now the government wants to force them to pay back that debt before these people are even earning enough money to get by as it is.


I am one of those—again befitting my literal greybeard role—from the era when university fees were not charged in the 1980s. It was in my final year at the University of Queensland that the Hawke Labor government brought in tertiary fees again. One of the great legacies of the Whitlam era, along with Medibank, was free tertiary education, which the Fraser government kept free. It was the Labor government, under the spell of the neoliberalism philosophy that is now so massively discredited, that introduced tertiary fees back in the late 1980s. It is a matter of folklore now that Mr Joe Hockey, who as Treasurer liked to talk about the 'end of the age of entitlement', was a student politician at that time in the 1980s. I remember how he protested against tertiary fees. So did I and many other people. Many people were spun the line, 'It's only a small amount,' and, 'You won't have to repay it until you're earning well above average wages, so it's completely fair and just.' Many people knew it was, quite rightly, a classic case of the thin edge of the wedge. And that is what we have seen ever since. The fees go up and up and up, the threshold at which you have to start repaying that debt gets lower and lower and lower. This is yet another stage in that process.


We all know that more and more people, particularly younger people, cannot access secure, permanent, full-time work. We all know how much more difficult that makes it for them, not just to get a loan to buy a house but also to get credit and loans to buy all sorts of things, to be able to get business loans and generate all those other different ways of trying to build a different way forward. When you've got that extra debt on top of it, it just makes it that much more difficult.


The Greens' policy is that we should be reversing this trend with regard to university fees, but the legislation before us is going even further in the wrong direction. With the tax cuts to big businesses and the massively wealthy people who run them, the current government is only going to increase the large wealth disparity that we see plaguing this country. This is another measure that will simply increase inequality. Surely all of us here now know that inequality is one of the major challenges, economic as well as social, facing this country.


An important factor of this legislation that needs to be noted is that it will impact more significantly on women. The lowering of this repayment threshold will be forcing 185,000 additional people to start paying back their fees earlier, when their income is below the median wage. Often, because they've undergone study, they've foregone the opportunity for a full-time income. It is almost impossible to have a full-time income and study full time. It is incredibly expensive to study with all of the extra costs associated with study apart from fees, so the vast majority of students, unless they happen to have wealthy families, are already in economic difficulties as part of going through that. That is fine if it provides the opportunity to come out the other side with greater opportunity to gain employment, but we all know, under the workplace laws that have been in place since Labor was last in government and the way they've now played out under the current coalition government, more and more graduates are finding it difficult to obtain jobs—certainly permanent, stable, full-time jobs. And even when they do find work, wages are stagnant.


The National Foundation for Australian Women found that the proposed changes will have disproportionately more negative impacts for young women attending university. They've stated that graduates caught between these policies will experience considerable financial stress. Graduates who are currently earning $51,000, more of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income than someone without a HECS debt earning $32,000. To reflect on the remarks of the previous speaker, who seemed to think that this should all be okay—'If people buy one or two fewer cups of coffee a week, they'll be fine to get by on $32,000 a year'—in any location where there are high housing costs, transport costs, caring costs, medical costs or the other challenges that so many people face, it is incredibly difficult. It will also negatively affect young mothers, in particular, who are already financially constrained by the costs of child care, and may be a further disincentive for them to enter the workforce.


For all the narrative that we hear from others in this place about the need to incentivise people to get a job, what we're actually doing is making it harder and harder for them, putting more and more disincentives in place, and continuing the regime of punishing the poor. As the second reading amendment from my colleague Senator Hanson-Young states, this is another indication of this government's war on young people and the poor. They are quite happy to hand out large amounts of money to their benefactors, to their corporate mates and to the wealthy while, at the same time, saying, 'We've got a budget crisis, so we've got to keep squeezing the poorest.' It's a stereotype, but it's so true. It is, of course, the easiest thing to do. It takes no courage to make changes that assist the wealthy and those that are already influential, but, as others have said prior to me, what does take courage is to make changes that support and assist those that are most in need. This parliament, time and time again, has its priorities very much the wrong way around, because these changes will indisputably make life more difficult for a specific group of low-income earners: people who have chosen or, in some cases, basically been forced, to undertake further or higher education or to upgrade, diversify or broaden their skills. We punish them further for trying to improve themselves.


We are in a situation where young people in hospitality and retail are having their penalty rates cut. They're having their incomes cut, yet some of those very same people, who are already struggling to get by, will now also be expected to be paying more on lower wages. These are young people who can't buy a house or who, if you're a student, certainly can't afford to rent a house unless they're doing it with a group of other people. Today I was talking to a young student named Gabby, who had just finished studying on the Sunshine Coast, about the immense financial challenge of getting through the studying process and coming out at the end of it with an enormous debt. Let's not forget the size of the debts we're talking about here. The previous speaker talked about it as though this is money that people owe the Australian taxpayer. Well, they do, unfortunately, but they shouldn't have to. People shouldn't come out of higher education or upgrading their skills with a massive debt. They certainly shouldn't have to repay that debt when their own income is below even the median full-time income. When they're low-income earners, we're expecting people to pay back a debt that they really shouldn't have incurred in the first place.


The whole argument—which has been shown over the years to be very flawed—that supposedly justified HECS was that people get an economic benefit out of being able to go to university. Certainly, some people very much do, but, if they get a higher economic benefit out of it, they should pay something back to the public through HECS fees. But we're now trying to force people to pay back it when they're not getting a higher economic benefit, when they're actually under the median wage and when they're a low-income earner. That is the bizarre logic that is trying to be applied here to justify squeezing more money out of people who are on low incomes.

Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  I rise this evening to commemorate the life of a mother, a wife, a friend and a Liberal, Maureen Elizabeth Bennetts, who died aged 51 on 16 June this year—far, far too young. Maureen is the mother of Lyreda, Gene and Gil, and the wife of Richard Bennetts, who works in my office and has worked as an electoral officer in this building for some time. Maureen and her husband, Richard, had also been selectors for Eden-Monaro in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party.


We commemorated Maureen's life in the Adaminaby Memorial Hall last Friday. Maureen was a Gilbert from the land around Adaminaby. The family still farms in the district, while the Bennetts have a house in the town and still own Creek House, the old family home.


Maureen left Adaminaby to go to school and university and made many lifelong friends there—especially at university—many of whom spoke in her memory on Friday. In particular, Anna, Mary and Michelle spoke fondly of school, university and about Maureen's travel in the UK as a young girl—our generation's rite of passage. Her good friend Matthew Mason-Cox MLC spoke of their long friendship from university onwards. Maureen's husband, Richard, and her son Gene spoke devotedly of their wife and mother, reflecting the fact that such all-encompassing sadness in mourning is the price we all pay for a loving relationship.


I met Maureen at the country shows we attended as Liberals in Eden-Monaro over the last five years. Maureen's dedication and highly principled approach to New South Wales' conservative politics was obvious to all during and after my preselection on the Senate ticket before the 2016 federal election. Maureen was also able to effectively reach across the entire New South Wales division. The words spoken to me by Senator Marise Payne, amongst others, reflect the extraordinarily high regard in which Maureen was held.


Maureen combined the best that country people bring to our community—worldly wise, knowledgeable, traditional values, passionate family orientation and never losing that earthiness that we associate with those who make a living from the land, the people of the Monaro. Rest in peace, Maureen.
