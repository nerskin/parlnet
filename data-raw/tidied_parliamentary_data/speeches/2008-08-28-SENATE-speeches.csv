"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2008-08-28,"—Yesterday, during debate in the Senate on the motion for a reference to the Community Affairs Committee about the Exclusive Brethren, the Acting Deputy President Senator Carol Brown undertook to refer to me a point of order raised by Senator Bob Brown. He asked that I give a ruling on the accuracy of a statement by Senator Abetz, who refused leave for Senator Milne to incorporate a document, said to be a previously circulated letter to the Prime Minister, in Hansard. Senator Abetz stated:
But by giving leave, every senator in this place would be vouching for that information and allowing it to have privilege.
It is clear that, by granting leave to incorporate a document in Hansard, every individual senator does not vouch for the information in the document. While the publication of a document by the Senate, including by allowing its incorporation in Hansard, is protected by parliamentary privilege, the composition, content and any previous publication of the document is not protected by parliamentary privilege. The composition and content of a document is protected only where the document is composed for the purpose of submission to a house or a parliamentary committee. This is made clear by section 16(2) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.",SENATE,<title>PRIVILEGE</title>,<title>Statement by President</title>,Privilege,0,1,speech

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-08-28,"—With your indulgence, Mr Temporary Chairman, I will make a brief contribution in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 and raise some issues. I had the opportunity to have a brief but very useful discussion with the minister yesterday. My consideration of this bill has raised concerns about inconsistencies in relation to time frames for judicial review, but before I address these I will speak briefly on the substance of the bill. I appreciate that it is an omnibus bill that is to tidy up and rectify impracticalities within the Migration Act, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act and the Customs Act, and I support the general thrust of the bill: improving the effectiveness of migration and citizenship legislation by addressing and rectifying a range of problems that have been identified in the legislation over the years. Therefore, I am sympathetic to and supportive of the broad intentions of this bill.
I wish to note aspects of the first schedule of the bill which the government proposes to remove by amendment. Items 30 to 35 sought to amend the time limits imposed on applications for judicial review from 28 days to 35 days. I am pleased that the government proposes to remove these items, as I would not have been able to support them. But that leaves uncertainty around the matter of time limits and extensions. I have been informed that the government will address these matters in future legislation. It also raises issues about the history of judicial review of migration decisions in Australia. For many years the legislation has excised judicial review of migration decisions from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and placed it within the Migration Act. In doing so, the right to judicial review for applicants was significantly constrained. Most notably, tight time lines were introduced for submitting applications for review, with no exemptions or consideration of other factors. However, the changes in this legislation will still not permit the courts to allow an application to be lodged outside the set time period. I refer the committee to the High Court ruling in Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration 2007, which relates to the issue of time limits. It reads:
... the limitation structure provided by section 486A does not allow for supervening events which may physically incapacitate the applicant or otherwise, without any shortcoming on the part of the applicant, lead to a failure to move within the stipulated time limit.
This points to an unfair situation, which the government must fix substantively rather than administratively. This could result in an inconsistency, as time extensions can be granted for consideration by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—which handles visa issues related to business—but cannot be granted for the Refugee Review Tribunal, which handles refugee visas, or the Migration Review Tribunal, which handles migrant visas. We have a situation where there is provision for extension for applicants for review of any decision made by any Commonwealth department unless they are a refugee or migrant. I want to make it clear that I am not advocating for changes to the criteria by which refugee or migrant status is granted. What I am calling for is a fair go, for there to be an onus on the government to explain why migration judicial review decisions have different conditions from those of any other department.
I have been approached by the Circle of Friends group in my home state, who have highlighted the cruel edge of this policy inconsistency. I have informed the minister’s office in broad terms in relation to this case and today I will forward the specific details to the minister and request an urgent response. The man in question was assisted to escape Afghanistan by his mother and uncle in 1999 and now resides in Australia. In retribution for assisting him in his escape, the Taliban executed both his mother and uncle and then took his orphan brother captive. After many years this man, with the assistance of the Red Cross, was able to locate the boy in Pakistan and in July 2004 instructed his migration agent to lodge the documentation for a subclass 117 orphan relative visa. What followed was a series of acts of incompetence by the migration agent—the details of which I will also forward to the minister—which ultimately resulted in the migration agent being suspended for three years. Most importantly, the migration agent’s negligence included failing to lodge applications for appeal within time.
Due to the lack of provision for any time extensions, the Migration Review Tribunal now cannot hear this case. While the man has the right to sue the migration agent, this is little comfort while his orphan brother is left in Pakistan. With this man, we do not see a case for changing the criteria for refugee or migrant status; we see a case for the criteria we already have being amended. This man wants not favouritism but a fair go. His is a situation where bureaucracy and inconsistency are adding to a family’s pain and may well be putting a young life at risk. That is the nub of the concerns of Circle of Friends, and I appreciate that the minister will be looking at this as soon as those details are forwarded to him. I look forward to the minister’s response, if not in the committee stage then at some subsequence stage, to this and other matters. I thank the committee for its indulgence.",SENATE,"<title>

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-08-28,"—I will sum up the debate. I thank Senator Ellison and Senator Xenophon for their contributions and their cooperation in progressing what is quite complex legislation made more complex by the government moving its amendments. I wanted to make a couple of points. I am happy to take up—as I indicated to Senator Xenophon—the individual case of the Afghan citizen that he raised. Circle of Friends I know are very active in arguing for and supporting refugees and refugee issues. I have a lot of correspondence from them and we have a lot of interaction with them. It is always good that people take an interest in these matters and advocate on behalf of those in need of support. I am happy to have a look at that particular case and deal with it on its merits.
On the question of effective time limits: as Senator Xenophon quite rightly pointed out, proposed government amendments (2) to (7), which dealt with these issues, were withdrawn. I want to make it clear, though, that we are still very committed to having effective time limits in the legislation. They are important for an efficient and cost-effective litigation system. They provide a balance between giving the applicants an opportunity to seek judicial review of migration decisions and ensuring timely handling of these applications.
One reason we have people in long-term detention is that they have pursued extensive litigation. They are people who, I think on any measure, ought not be allowed to remain in Australia. They are often people with criminal and other histories, not those that people would traditionally regard as refugees. Some have been in detention for three, four or five years as a result of their pursuit of litigation. It is a real issue for me, for the department and for the system to see that litigation does not lead to long-term detention. It is a complex matter.
Quite frankly, a series of recent court decisions have largely made the Migration Act’s current time limits ineffective. We think reinstating the effectiveness of those time limits is important and does act as a disincentive for people to take advantage of litigation delays and to wait until removal is imminent before lodging an application review. In many instances people wait until they get the notice that they are about to be removed in two days time and then they lodge another application. We want to give people fair process but we do have to have the capacity at some stage to reach a final decision and for the law to be effective. So it is about a balance between time limits and procedural fairness, and we will come back to this issue at a later time in another piece of legislation. We have been affected by the fact that the recent Sales decision has created an urgency about this bill, most particularly schedule 4. Therefore we want to proceed with the bill and we have withdrawn those issues that relate to the time lines.
In summing up, I remind the Senate that schedule 4 to the bill amends the Migration Act so that the character cancellation provisions in section 501 apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas. Under section 501 of the act, where a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test I have been given the direction to refuse or cancel a visa. This section and this power have been much in the news in recent times. In exercising this power I have a responsibility to the parliament and to the Australian community to protect the community from criminal or other reprehensible conduct and to refuse to grant visas or to cancel visas held by noncitizens whose actions are so abhorrent to the community that they should not be allowed to enter or remain within Australia.
It has always been intended that the minister’s powers under section 501 to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds would apply to all visas. There was no doubt about that at the time of the bill’s introduction. Doubt has been cast on this by comments in the May 2007 full Federal Court decision in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The full Federal Court decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 17 July 2008 gave effect to these comments in Moore. As part of what was a highly technical judgement, the full Federal Court found in the Sales case that a transitional permanent visa cannot be cancelled on character grounds because it is a visa that is held rather than granted. These visas are instead held by operation of law. For the nonlawyers this is terribly confusing but as a result of this decision in Sales some 20-odd people, including Mr Sales, were released from immigration detention. The department, based on legal advice, decided not to appeal the judgement in the Sales case. The advice was that that was not a wise course of action. However, the amendments in schedule 4 anticipated this difficulty and ensure that the character cancellation provisions apply to all temporary and permanent transitional visas and provide validation of all past character cancellation decisions in relation to such visas. This maintains the minister’s ability to protect the Australia community.
I have spoken previously on the government amendments and the rationale for them, and I thank the Senate for its support for those amendments. As I indicated, because of recent court decisions this bill is now quite urgently needed to allow us to administer migration law in this country in the way I think the public would require of us. It is certainly my view that these amendments are very necessary. I appreciate the contribution of senators and their cooperation in dealing with this bill. I appreciate the wider issues raised by Senator Xenophon. Obviously, it is not appropriate to try to deal with some of those highly legal issues on the run. His legal skills will probably be tested when we get to test those issues because migration law—I think Senator Ellison made this point—is as complex as the tax act, and as a result employs thousands of lawyers and migration agents in very comfortable circumstances around the country. It is very frustrating for the minister and at times for the parliament more generally.
I intend to bring a series of pieces of legislation before the parliament that fundamentally look at reform of the act. I think there is a case for a major overhaul of the Migration Act. We have had amendment after amendment built on each other. The complexity now and the interaction of 20-odd years of amendments have made the case for major reform of the act. In addition to that, of course, the Labor government has a very large reform agenda in detention and migration policy that will be reflected in legislation we hope to have this parliament carry. I can assure senators that there will be plenty of opportunity in the next couple of years to debate migration issues and to address any concerns they have as we seek to bring fundamental reform to migration policy in this country. I thank senators for their support. I apologise for the need to make extensive government amendments to our bill and I look forward to its passage.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-08-28,"—To continue from where we were yesterday in the debate with respect to the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008, I was talking about, in particular, the concern of the committee and many in the medical profession in relation to the use of pharmaceuticals off label. It was quite disturbing to hear in that inquiry, in the day of hearings, that in paediatrics nearly all medicines are used off label. I acknowledged the work of the advisory groups in working with palliative care particularly to the extent where once upon a time in palliative care nearly all medicines used were off label. That is now down to something in the order of 50 per cent. But there still remains a lot of work to be done for Indigenous people.
Obviously if a medicine is not licensed to be used for a particular indication, the pharmaceutical companies cannot promote a medicine for that particular use. That does not mean that a doctor cannot necessarily provide a prescription for that medicine, and that is quite often the case, but technically under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme it should not be provided under the scheme for those off-use indications.
So you have in paediatrics almost all medicines used being off label; in palliative care it is 50 per cent; and there is an unknown number—but most, I think—with respect to Indigenous people. Again, I commend this government, the previous government and the PBAC for the work that they are doing to try to resolve that, but I do express some concern that fees for the additional indications may provide a significant disincentive for companies to put some of these products up for additional approvals.
It is also important to note that it is not just the pharmaceutical companies that provide submissions for these indications. You are put in a situation where sometimes small groups of individuals in the community or professional bodies decide that it is important that they put a submission in for listing for a medicine for a certain use, and at this point in time it is not specifically clear how those are going to be treated.
We know that there is some discretion in the regulations. The committee has had those regulations only for a week and, as I mentioned earlier in my presentation, the committee was effectively prohibited from completely interrogating this measure because the real workings of it are in the regulations. Even the industry, which has had them for only a week, has not had a chance to look in detail at the regulations, so they cannot tell us yet what their implications will be. That again demonstrates quite a disturbing element in this whole process.
The government seems to be very keen to have this legislation passed; as we heard during the inquiry and as has been indicated during the debate so far, it was announced without warning and without consultation on budget night for implementation on 1 July. The government is now trying to have the legislation passed through the Senate when the real workings of the measure are in fact in the regulations, which we received last Friday afternoon after the report that criticised the government for not releasing the regulations or using the regulations in their consultations with industry was tabled. The question on notice came to the committee after the report was tabled. Now the government wants the legislation put through the parliament this week without the opportunity for the industry, much less the parliament, to effectively scrutinise the regulations. It is very disappointing that we have been put in this position. The consultation was, I think, insufficient. I do not believe that the government could simply pick up this measure as if nothing had happened. The only indication the industry had from the government was the statement from the minister that I read out earlier.
The other concern is how this measure fits in respect of cost recovery. There were a number of submissions from industry, not necessarily from the manufacturers but from the College of Physicians, Palliative Care Australia and the Pharmacy Guild, who indicated their concerns about how this particular measure fits in with the government’s cost recovery guidelines. The government obviously continues to maintain that it does, but I think that good evidence was given to the committee that it does not meet the cost recovery guidelines. It certainly does not meet the cost recovery guidelines when it comes to consultation because one of the key elements in the cost recovery guidelines actually relates to consultation with industry. So the government clearly have not done that. They seem to be trying to rely very heavily on guidelines from the Productivity Commission rather than on their own published cost recovery guidelines. I find that of concern. Cost recovery guidelines have been submitted for consideration by the public, by industry and by people who might have those measures imposed on them, and yet the government are relying on some guidelines put out by the Productivity Commission—and that is relied on very heavily in their report.
I believe that the government needs to give the industry some time to satisfactorily look through the regulations. I would not rule out the possibility that the Senate will want to have another look at the regulations. That could be potentially a reasonable aspect for us to consider. I know that we were not able to properly consider this measure when it came before the committee because we did not have the regulations. Effectively, all we had was the product of some consultation between government and industry since the budget. There were some promises to consider these particular matters—things like additional indications being registered and the way that certain medicines would be considered with respect to fees—but all of this leads to considerable uncertainty, particularly for those who are looking for quick access to the pharmaceuticals.
I am not convinced that this additional layer of costs will not prohibit medicines from being brought to the market or to the PBS in a timely way. I think that this additional layer of red tape is going to take additional time, despite the department saying that they do not believe that it will. I do not believe that that is the case. Any additional work that has to be done and any negotiation over what classification the medicines may have when applications are submitted will take additional time.
On my reading of the regulations at this point in time I think that there is scope for them to be amended. I know that the Senate does not have the opportunity to amend the regulations; that has to be done through a negotiated process between the government, the industry and perhaps even the Senate itself. We can disallow parts of a regulation or disallow or approve the whole regulation, but we cannot amend them. This approach of putting up a bill that allows for the implementation of regulations really does prevent the Senate from doing its job in respect of making modifications to the measure. I would like to see the industry given some time.
I am not sure exactly what the government’s intentions are with respect to the legislation at this point in time, and I would appreciate their letting us know that. I think we need more time for proper assessment of the regulations that were released but, as I said earlier in my presentation, I do give the government credit for doing that. I would have appreciated it having occurred much earlier in the process so that we could have looked at it through the Senate process. That would have been very helpful. But we do need time to understand properly what the impact of these regulations will be if the legislation is passed. I would prefer that the legislation not be passed until we and the industry have had the opportunity to properly interrogate the measures. In that circumstance, I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting the legislation at this time. We believe that there is real scope for additional work to be done on this particular measure, and that needs to be done before we could support it.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-08-28,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 seeks to amend the National Health Act 1953 to allow the recovery of costs incurred by the process of listing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, commonly known as the PBS. The Australian Greens have a long history in this chamber of defending the public health system and its three main pillars: public hospitals, Medicare and the PBS. It is a firmly held belief of the Australian Greens that we need to enhance and protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The PBS is an essential pillar of the public health system, and it must remain viable so that it continues to deliver to the community the drugs and medicines that we require to maintain our health, to treat serious disease and to reduce suffering. These drugs must be accessible to all in the community who need them.
The Australian Greens also wish to see the ongoing independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, commonly known as the PABC, and we believe it must be able to operate in a transparent way that inspires confidence in its integrity. We therefore frame our concerns regarding this move towards cost recovery measures in the context of our commitment to the public health system and the guaranteed availability on the PBS of listed drugs to people who need them. The Australian Greens commitment to preserve and enhance our public health system and to guarantee the necessary medicines are listed on the PBS and are available to those who need them is fundamental to our approach on measures that affect the public health system. Our evaluation of these measures and the concerns we express about the implementation of this scheme are firmly grounded in these key objectives.
Treasury spending projections indicate that the cost of the PBS will grow over the next 40 years to become the single greatest item of health expenditure. That was articulated in the Intergenerational report of 2007. The people of Australia have every right, therefore, to know and expect that the money is being spent wisely and to the benefit of those who need those items. Any change that may impact on the viability and the integrity of the PBS must therefore, we believe, be very carefully considered. As the Minister for Health and Ageing explained in her second reading speech on 29 May this year, gaining a listing on the PBS delivers a high degree of commercial certainty to pharmaceutical companies. According to the minister, the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in Australia each receive, on average, $223 million from each product successfully listed on the PBS scheme. The Australian Greens therefore welcome the move towards cost recovery in the case of high-volume commercial applications for drugs and medicines, believing that that is a cost of producing the drug.
However, pharmaceutical companies are also involved in developing other medicines that are less commercially successful but are of great need to our community. These drugs may be of benefit to only a small proportion of the population, often those people who are the most vulnerable in our community and those who would be least able to meet the full cost of these medicines if they were not listed on the PBS. They may be people, for example, who need a specialist drug in palliative care. They may be Indigenous Australians, many of whom live in remote areas that do not have good access to ongoing medical care and need their medicine delivered in different forms. Or they may be children suffering from rare forms of cancer. These drugs are specialist drugs and are only made in low volumes. We do not want to put those people’s health and wellbeing at risk, and we expect our government to make sure that they are not put at risk by the move towards cost recovery.
The Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the bill heard evidence from Palliative Care Australia, who were understandably concerned for the people they represent. Their submission stated, in part:
Palliative medicines, and palliative care, have some important differences from many other medicines and types of health care, in that their purpose is fundamentally not to seek a cure, but to seek relief from pain and other symptoms associated with terminal conditions.
The Australian Greens want to be, and through the inquiry process sought to be, reassured that the development and availability of drugs such as these are not put at risk by the imposition of application fees. To this end, the Australian Greens support an approach to cost recovery that recovers costs from profitable pharmaceuticals but protects the availability of those less commercial medicines that are of great need to the community—in other words, those highly specialised, low-volume and, we acknowledge, sometimes very high cost medicines. We still think that they should be made available.
The Greens sought to scrutinise this legislation so that we could be reassured that these measures were in fact in place. Unfortunately, as Senator Colbeck has articulated, from the time of the inquiry up until only last Friday—six days ago—the draft regulations were not available. Committee members sought availability of those draft regulations through the inquiry process and they were made available on Friday afternoon. Therefore, the industry, the committee and the broader community did not have time to properly read those regulations. I acknowledge the fact that the minister subsequently provided a briefing on the draft regulations and I thank the minister.
It became apparent when we were reading those draft regulations that if you were knowledgeable and understood the dialogue and previous history then you could probably read the regulations. However, even some people in the industry had some misinterpretations of the draft regulations. So the Greens will seek from the government reassurance on record about some of the interpretations of those draft regulations. I understand that the explanatory memorandum or explanatory material that goes with the draft regulations is not available. That causes the Greens concern because if we pass this legislation only on an understanding that we have been given on the draft regulations, how are we to be reassured that in fact that will be what happens?
So we are seeking on record an interpretation of those draft regulations. For example, what does ‘substantive change’ mean in the draft regulations? This is a fundamental point in respect of drugs that are being put in for assessment through this process. What do ‘major change’ and ‘minor change’ mean? We are told, and I have no reason to doubt the department, that they are clearly understood by the industry. It sounds as if they are not clearly understood by some players in the industry, and they are certainly not clearly understood by community members. So we would like to be reassured as to what a major change and a minor change are, and we seek that on the public record.
As with much legislation in this place, and increasingly so, the trend is for details of legislation to be encompassed in the draft regulations. Unfortunately, as happened in this case, most of those draft regulations are not available for us to comment on at the time we were dealing with the legislation. I think it is a fundamental flaw in the legislative process that so much is now done by regulation and the legislators do not get to see the draft regulations. It was impossible to judge through the committee inquiry process on this legislation whether the issues that were raised and the issues that senators had with the bill were legitimate or whether the concerns were in effect unfounded.
The reason bills are referred to committees is so that we senators can look at them and see if there are unintended consequences and if they actually deliver the policy outcomes that the government is saying they are trying to deliver. How can we do our job properly as senators and as committees of inquiry—I have articulated this issue before—if we do not have all the information available? It also makes it a waste of time. Many people are now very deeply concerned about some of the implications of this bill. We are told that they are unfounded concerns; we have all been ‘getting our knickers a knot’, as they say, around some of these changes. The concerns could quite easily have been resolved if we had had the draft regulations at the time. We would potentially have been much further along in this debate and we could have dealt with the legislation in a much more expeditious manner.
The Greens were, as I have said, very concerned that the draft regulations were not available to the committee inquiry. As the majority report stated:
... in the absence of the regulations which contain the detail of the implementation and operation of the cost recovery arrangements, it has been difficult to appropriately assess the possible implications of the legislation.
As I have said, we do not believe this is good practice. As legislators we need to be assured that legislation is doing what it is supposed to do and not have unintended consequences. Fortunately, the regulations were provided, but only six days ago; not even a week. I hate to point that out to Senator Colbeck but it has not been quite a week since we saw the draft regulations. We have since heard, and I hope that this will be clarified during the ongoing debate, that the regulations are now to be made available for public consultation. I understand it was originally to be for two weeks but I think it is now to be for four weeks of consultation with the appropriate stakeholders, which is a very significant step in the right direction. This is an improvement, but it still means that in this place we are yet to be reassured publicly and on record that our concerns have been met.
I appreciate the fact that the government has given reassurances that orphan drugs and lifesaving drugs will not be affected by the move towards cost recovery. Orphan drugs are extremely low-volume, highly specialised drugs and are already protected by the TGA process. However, we are seeking to clarify the availability of some of the non-orphan drugs. These are particular drugs that do not automatically achieve orphan status but whose economic viability may be threatened by the imposition of application fees because they are being used for other purposes that are not necessarily those for which they were originally listed. They are subsequently used for other purposes and are extremely important, as I have said, for palliative care, rare cancers and those sorts of things. We are seeking to be reassured that those drugs will have protections under the draft regulations. Their use might benefit only a small population and at low volume, so they may not be commercially viable in that particular formulation or that particular use. The problem arises when these drugs are required to go through a second listing process when another use for these drugs is found.
Under these circumstances, while it is clearly in the interests of a small number of patients for the drugs to be listed, it might not be of commercial interest for pharmaceutical companies to go through this next process. So we are seeking a commitment from government that these drugs will also be covered under the regulations if this legislation is to pass prior to those regulations being finalised. I understand that the instrument is a disallowable instrument but, as I think Senator Colbeck also articulated, it is not amendable by this place. We can either disallow a regulation or let it go through. That is a very blunt instrument. I would prefer to see that the regulations were right from the start. Therefore, we are seeking reassurance from the government that these drugs will be protected. We need to be reassured about definitions of substantive change. While I understand the process, some in the community do not. We seek reassurance that there is a proper definition for what are major and minor changes, and that these particular types of drugs will be protected.
One of the other issues that came up during the committee process was the independence of the PBAC. We mentioned that in our minority report on this bill. We are reassured that there is a separation from the department in this process in terms of the independence of the PBAC. We would like to make sure that that is protected in the future. We have circulated an amendment in the chamber because we think that these changes could have some implications for the costs of drugs, which was raised during the committee inquiry. We are proposing that there be a review of this new process on the second anniversary of these changes and that review would look at the impact of the implementation of the cost recovery measures.
There are a number of issues listed that we think should be reviewed. We want to make sure that the cost recovery measures that are implemented are not having an adverse impact on the less commercially viable non-orphan drugs. We seek to make sure that in fact the cost recovery measures are not having an impact on the costs of medicines. That was raised in the committee. The department and the government say that it is not going to have an impact. We think that we need to review that to make sure that it is not having an impact into the future. We would also like to get the review to ensure the continued integrity and transparency of the PBAC. We also want to allow the community to have input into that review.
I will reiterate our concerns to ensure that the non-orphan, low-volume, high-cost drugs that are needed for specialist conditions are protected. We seek that assurance from government. We also seek a commitment from government to review this process in two years time to ensure that the policy outcomes the government desires to see from this legislation are achieved with no negative impact on the PBS or on those sections of our community that are the most vulnerable and need these low-volume, high-cost drugs. We need to ensure that they have been adequately protected by this legislation. If the government is confident that this legislation will do that, I do not see any reason why it would not support such a review to ensure confidence in the PBS, which every Australian places such a high value on.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-08-28,"—I rise to speak in support of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008. This bill amends the National Health Act 1953. Its purpose is to provide authority for the cost recovery of services provided by the Commonwealth in relation to the exercise of powers for listing medicines, vaccines and other products or services on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, and designation of vaccines for the National Immunisation Program.
The PBS, which was a Labor initiative 60 years ago, is a vital element of Australia’s national health system. The PBS has been an outstanding success story. It has played an enormous part in ensuring that all Australians have benefited from the therapeutic advances in prescribed medicines and other PBS listed drugs that have occurred over the past 60 years. It is a scheme that has ensured that taxpayers’ money has been well spent.
Apart from the therapeutic benefits provided by the PBS, the scheme has been an essential factor in ensuring that the cost of prescribed pharmaceuticals in Australia has remained significantly lower than in many other developed nations. Figures published by the Department of Health and Ageing show that Australia’s pharmaceutical expenditure, as a percentage of total health expenditure, is only approximately 13 per cent compared, for example, with that of Canada, where the cost of pharmaceuticals makes up approximately 18 per cent of that country’s health expenditure. On a per capita basis, expenditure on pharmaceuticals in Canada is approximately 30 per cent higher than in Australia, and in the USA it is over 80 per cent higher. Similar levels of expenditure in Australia would add several billion dollars annually to Australia’s health budget and would undoubtedly put pressure on the funding of other essential health service needs.
In Australia, a new medicinal drug must gain approval for supply in accordance with the requirements of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Approval is also required to extend the indications of an established drug. Applications are dealt with by the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. For prescription drugs, advice is sought from an expert committee known as the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, the ADEC.
Once a prescription drug is approved for marketing, the company concerned usually applies to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to have the drug listed on the PBS. The PBAC is an independent statutory body established under section 100A of the National Health Act 1953. Its members are selected from consumers, health economists, practising community pharmacists, general practitioners, clinical pharmacologists and other specialists. This remains unchanged.
The role of the PBAC is to make recommendations and give advice to the minister about which drugs and medicinal preparations should be made available as pharmaceutical benefits. No new drug may be made available as a pharmaceutical benefit unless the committee has so recommended. The committee is required by the act to consider the effectiveness and cost of a proposed benefit compared to alternative therapies. In making its recommendations, the committee, on the basis of community usage, recommends maximum quantities and repeats, and may also recommend restrictions as to the indications where PBS subsidy is available.
When recommending listings, the committee provides advice to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, the PBPA, regarding comparison with alternatives or their cost effectiveness. It is the task of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority to negotiate the PBS price of the drug with the sponsor company. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority consists of government, industry and consumer representatives.
After agreement is reached, the Australian government considers the advice of both committees and makes a decision on whether the drug will be listed on the PBS. The processes for listing a drug on the PBS are rigorous and detailed, as they should be. These processes have served the Australian public exceedingly well over many years and are processes that the pharmaceutical industry is now well attuned to. They are of course not without significant cost to government.
For the pharmaceutical industry, achieving a product listing on the PBS is very valuable and provides a high level of commercial certainty to a company in relation to that product’s sales. It is worth noting, for example, that in 2006-07 the top 20 pharmaceutical companies, by total cost of payments, each received, on average, $223 million from the Commonwealth via the PBS subsidy. The government has therefore decided that the time has arrived when these costs should be recovered and should no longer be an impost on the taxpayer.
Cost recovery is not a new policy. Cost recovery arrangements have been applied with success to many departments and agencies at state and federal level including, for example, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The Productivity Commission has commented that, by ensuring those who use regulated services bear the costs, cost recovery can promote economic efficiency and equity by instilling cost consciousness among agencies and users. In this case it is expected that cost recovery will provide benefits to both government and industry—for example, potentially increasing the compliance of submissions with the PBAC guidelines and reducing time and costs associated with resubmissions.
Revenue from PBS cost recovery will depend on the number and type of submissions brought to the PBAC for consideration. As a general rule, the more complex and time consuming the evaluation and price negotiation, the higher the fees. Once fully operational, annual revenue from fees is expected to be about $9 million in 2008-09, rising to around $14 million a year in following years. It is expected that fees will be indexed annually and a full review undertaken within five years, in accordance with cost recovery guidelines.
The amount of cost recovery fees with respect to the listing of drugs on the PBS needs to be measured against the cost to government in providing subsidised medicines and fully funded vaccines to the Australian community. In 2006-07 the Commonwealth paid $6.4 billion to approved pharmacists, hospitals and medical practitioners for the subsidised supply of medicines under the PBS. This expenditure amounted to approximately 84 per cent of the total cost of prescribed PBS listed medicines. In this regard it is worth noting that over 70 per cent of the cost of the PBS is for the provision of prescribed medicines for the least well off in our community, including aged and disability pensioners. Without the PBS many people would not be able to obtain the drugs they need. In addition, in 2006-07 the Commonwealth provided a further $280 million to the states and territories for the fully funded supply of vaccines under the National Immunisation Program within their respective jurisdictions.
There has been some comment about the ability of drug companies to pay the fees to be set under PBS listing cost recovery arrangements without detriment to the availability and supply of prescribed pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical industry is by most standards a very profitable industry. In this regard it is relevant to compare the levels of drug company expenditure on what the drug companies refer to as ‘education events’ with total expected PBS cost recovery fees. Publicly available information suggests that in any one year drug companies spend well in excess of $60 million on educational and promotional activities. These activities are viewed by many people as being more akin to direct and active marketing to the medical profession of particular drugs than to simply educate. This expenditure has drawn the attention of the ACCC, which moved in 2006 to require much greater transparency from the pharmaceutical industry with regard to this expenditure.
A study undertaken in 2006 by University of New South Wales researchers, and reported as being the most comprehensive research ever conducted into the link between Australian medical professionals and drug companies, found that ethical guidelines were often breached. The survey of 823 medical specialists from across the country found that 96 per cent received offers of food, 94 percent were offered items for the office, 51 per cent reported offers of gifts for personal use and 52 per cent were offered travel support to attend conferences. As well, one in 20 reported offers of personal gifts or activities that were in clear breach of the guidelines, such as offers of wine, flowers, tickets to entertainment or sporting events and funds in exchange for accepting promotional visits. Other findings included that 52 percent of respondents were offered travel expenses to both international and national destinations, with a mean value of $7,559 for international travel and $1,395 for domestic travel. In some cases business class and first class airfares were provided. It was found that 15 per cent of specialists requested financial support from pharmaceutical companies for activities and items including conferences, travel, educational activities, salaries and donations to specific funds; and 18 percent were offered equipment, including video editing technology, cameras and blood pressure monitors. The lead author of the study commented:
Even though the majority of gifts and requests for support do comply with the guidelines, this research shows that the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and medical specialists is a very cosy one indeed.
He went on to say that previous research showed that doctors are influenced in their prescribing by gifts, even when they think they are not.
In 2006 the ACCC, in authorising Medicines Australia’s code of conduct, imposed a new requirement making it compulsory for Medicines Australia to provide six-monthly reports on behalf of its members detailing an itemisation of health professional educational events and expenditure. The latest report for the six months to 31 December 2007 shows that in total drug companies spent over $31 million on these events, including over $16 million on hospitality. While I am not suggesting that there is anything improper regarding this expenditure, it does indicate that there should be more than enough scope within the drug companies’ bottom lines to meet the costs associated with obtaining PBS listings. It is also worth noting as a matter of interest that in 2006-07 the Medicines Australia code of conduct committee imposed fines of approximately $1 million for breaches of the code of conduct. This money was used to defray the cost of monitoring the code of conduct—in other words, Medicines Australia, within its own operations, is committed to cost recovery and the user pays principle.
For its part, the Rudd Labor government is very attuned to the importance of a strong and growing pharmaceutical industry in this country. The Australian pharmaceuticals industry is Australia’s second largest manufactured goods exporter, with exports of almost $4 billion a year. The industry employs 34,000 people, spends $752 million a year on R&D and has a turnover of over $18 billion.
Senator Kim Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, recently announced the establishment of a Pharmaceuticals Industry Strategy Group. The strategy group will be headed up by Dr Brian McNamee, the Chief Executive Officer of Australia’s largest pharmaceuticals company, CSL. The strategy group will examine the drivers and barriers to attracting new internationally competitive and sustainable manufacturing and R&D investment in the pharmaceuticals sector. It has been asked to present a draft report to the minister by September and a final report by the end of the year. Members of the strategy group will be drawn from all segments of the bio-pharmaceuticals value chain. Leaders from the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and generic medicines industry have asked to participate, along with union representatives. The chief executives of Medicines Australia, AusBiotech and the Generics Medicines Industry of Australia will be members of the group.
As well, Senator Carr together with the Minister for Health and Ageing have committed to reconvening and revitalizing the Pharmaceuticals Industry Working Group. The working group is being co-chaired by the two ministers. The Rudd government wants the Pharmaceuticals Industry Working Group to become the premier forum of pharmaceuticals industry policy advice, which regularly discusses strategic issues and develops solutions to the challenges of tomorrow. In summary therefore, this bill needs to be seen in the context of the Rudd government’s commitment to the rigorous economic management of government funded health services and particularly the PBS, alongside its very strong commitment to encouraging and supporting the future development of Australia’s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.
Finally, in the model reflected in the bill the independence of the PBAC is guaranteed. The government will continue to directly fund all the activities of the PBAC and its subcommittees. The PBAC will have no role in setting fees and it will not receive any revenue from industry. All revenue collected from cost recovery will be paid directly into consolidated revenue. As the minister in the another place has said, this bill is all about ensuring that the PBS continues to be able to provide reliable, timely and affordable access to a wide range of medicines for all Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-08-28,"—I rise to indicate a much greater level of uncertainty and concern about the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 than Senator Sterle seems to feel about it. I see a piece of legislation which has not been well consulted on, the effect of which is likely to be felt in the hip pockets of Australian consumers of pharmaceuticals, and which has not been handled in a way which I would consider to be a model for the way in which legislation should be brought forward. I am referring there particularly to the way in which the government has handled the question of tabling regulations—that they should give, in this case, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs confidence that what is being done is appropriate and within the government’s own guidelines for cost recovery. I will come back and explain what I mean by that in a moment.
I will start by making the observation that before the federal election last year Labor made a great deal of its capacity to attack the waste and inefficiency in the way the Howard government ran agencies and departments. It claimed that there was a great deal of wasted expenditure, that we were spending profligately and that the cost of government could be reduced substantially by cutting back on this waste and efficiency without affecting the quality of services delivered to the Australian community. What we saw in the first Rudd-Swan budget was the eschewing of the clinical, surgical removal of fat. Instead, they went for the cutting off of whole limbs—measures which were crude, direct and which simply took out operations, irrespective of their efficiency or effectiveness—and the imposition of an increased efficiency dividend which, of course, was imposed equally on inefficient and efficient areas of government.
This legislation is an example, I think, of that crude policymaking. The previous government looked at the question of cost recovery. It undertook consultation to see whether cost recovery was a good idea. It came to the view, listening to that consultation and looking at all the evidence, that it was not a good idea and that it was not going to work.
—You didn’t tell anybody.
—Well, it did not proceed. We undertook the consultation in 2005 and there was no cost recovery pharmaceutical benefits bill, Senator. So I think it is fair to assume that we came to the view that it was not a good idea.

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—Senator McLucas, you have made your point.
—I am surprised Senator McLucas could not work that out, but that is what happened. If Senator McLucas had sat through the evidence that was presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs she would have seen very clearly that the stakeholders in this industry were concerned. I do not mean just the pharmaceutical companies themselves but people like those in the Australian Medical Association were concerned about the direction of this legislation and the impact that it might have on the availability particularly of low-volume drugs in the Australian marketplace and the off-label uses of a number of those drugs in all sorts of settings in Australian medicine. We discard or put aside those concerns expressed by industry at our peril.
Obviously the government has put forward legislation which seeks to increase the cost of delivering medicines to the marketplace. That is the inevitable effect of this legislation. The question is whether that additional cost will be absorbed by the pharmaceutical companies themselves or whether it will be passed on to the consumers. It would have been nice to hear, in the course the community affairs committee inquiry—perhaps we might hear it here it in the course of today’s debate—from the government that it has assurances of some sort that these measures will not translate into higher costs of medicines and that it has discussed this with the industry and has obtained such an assurance or that it has some other understanding of the economic modelling at work here which would lead us to believe that there would not be higher costs. But I have not heard that evidence as yet, and I frankly do not believe that evidence is available, because I do not think there is anything that would lead us to expect that these costs will not be passed on, ultimately, to Australian consumers.
As I have mentioned, the bill was analysed by the community affairs committee. The absence of draft regulations made it difficult to complete that task appropriately and to the standards which that committee has set in the past, and made it difficult to assess the extent to which the new arrangements would be capable of delivering medicines without increasing costs. One has to be just a little bit cynical about the timing of the tabling of the regulations. Had they been tabled a few days before last Friday, it might have been possible for the committee to look at those regulations and make some comments about them, however rudimentary. Had the regulations being tabled a few days after they were actually produced, it would not have allowed the committee to make the point that the inquiry was done without the exposure of the regulations. By tabling them on the day that the committee report was tabled, out of session, it allowed the government to say: ‘Oh, the regulations are there; we’ve made them available. We just didn’t get them to the committee in time for it to have a look at them as well.’ One can be a little bit cynical about that kind of process.
The other point about consultation that needs to be made is that since November 2007 there has been no indication, none whatsoever, that the government was going to change its policy on cost recovery or introduce this element of cost recovery into the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—in fact, quite the contrary. The only public policy statement by the government prior to the budget announcement—which did not support the implementation of cost recovery—also places the measure at odds with the guidelines. Although the scheme was considered previously, in 2005, as I have said, the lack of consultation with industry in this case I think reinforces concern about whether this is actually based on a properly considered and consulted-on model or on an ideological view that the industry can just wear these extra costs, on a hope and a prayer that the costs will not be passed on to consumers.
Of course, since the former government undertook its consultation in 2005, there have been a number of key changes in this area. There has been a renegotiation of the prices that the government pays for PBS medication, for example. It was interesting to see the submissions and the line-up of witnesses to the inquiry almost unanimously opposing what the government was trying to do. There was one supporter of the government’s proposals, Professor Tom Faunce—only one—and even he made it clear that he felt that this was only going to work if the savings or extra revenue the government generated by this measure were ploughed back into measures to do with better health outcomes. The government has offered no assurance that that is going to be the case at all, and simply pointing to another area where more money is being spent is hardly the kind of hypothecation that I think Professor Faunce was really getting at.
A major concern is the lack of detail in the proposals, as mentioned by previous speakers, including Senator Colbeck. Drugs used for paediatrics, palliative care and in Indigenous settings may be hardest hit, as they often fall into the low-volume indications. Medicines Australia have indicated that the cost recovery measures may run counter to the government’s own cost recovery guidelines, including lack of consultation on them and their cost-effectiveness, and the fact that they would create an unnecessary delay in bringing drugs to market and stifle competition through exacerbation of ‘free-ride’ effects. Exemptions granted for listings for low-volume drugs or indication expansions might be passed on to other, non-exempt submissions, thus hiding the disincentive of this measure from the Australian public. As exemptions are in the regulations, the committee’s inability to scrutinise the regulations before the report was brought down was of concern.
And that is why the opposition has decided that it will not support this legislation. It is not simply a question of poor process, with the government having left the guts of the legislation off the table until it was too late for the parliamentary scrutiny process to do its job. It is also because fundamentally it betrays the concept of a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is capable of delivering medicines at the most affordable rates to the Australian community in a timely way—because, whatever you might say about this arrangement, it is an added cost to the cost of bringing a drug to market and, in my view, it is simply inconceivable that these costs will not be passed on to Australian consumers.
The fact is that this legislation betrays two elements of Labor policy announced before the last election. One was that Labor was going to look after Australian consumers. It was concerned about the rising cost of living in Australia. It wanted people to have some relief from the way in which costs were rising. Now, if this move does result in higher costing medicines—and it would be very hard indeed to measure; no-one can say with any certainty that it will, no-one can say with any certainty that it will not—then Labor has betrayed that promise it made to the Australian community about those costs. The other is that Labor made a quite explicit statement about its concern about the proposal for cost recovery in this area. The now minister said, on 31 May last year, when she was shadow minister:
The PBAC needs to be independent of government and of industry, and we cannot see the justification for this move to the cost-recovery model. I have asked the government to reconsider this approach given the risk to the independence of the PBAC, or even to consider if cost sharing, perhaps between the government and industry, being the major stakeholders in the PBAC, would be more appropriate. I note the AMA has recently backed this call to ensure that independence is maintained.
If independence were simply a matter of making a small change to the legislation then presumably the then opposition would have done that, or suggested or proposed that, but as far as I am aware they did not do that.
—There was no legislation to do that.
—Well, you did not put forward suggestions as to how you might do it, did you? You did not say, ‘We will support legislation—

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—You could have gone back to the minister and said, ‘We will support legislation if you build in the independence of the PBAC.’
—What, blanket approval?
 (Senator Troeth)—Order, Senator McLucas and Senator Humphries!
—I have to say that I think that the government, the then opposition, wanted to obtain the assurance of the sector that it was against this dreadful cost recovery measure, wanted to neutralise opposition to it perhaps at the last election and then bring this measure forward subsequently when it was in government. It suddenly needed to find those dollars that it had promised were somewhere else, salted away in the bowels of an inefficient department of health, and then it discovered the dollars were not there at all when it got to the government benches. The other point of course is that this measure, to the extent that it adds to the cost of medicines, will fuel inflation. It has also claimed to be the low-inflation party. We have seen no indication of it actually honouring or supporting that claim in anything that has been done in its first budget.
I note that the Australian Greens have moved some amendments to the legislation. The opposition will be supporting those amendments. I am not sure that Australia needs another review but that is what an amendment does deliver. I will point out, however, that in reviewing the things that this amendment foreshadows—such as the average number of times a submission is presented before gaining approval, the average cost of submissions by type of submission, the number of applications received for non-orphan drugs et cetera—it does not, and obviously cannot, encompass a review of the number of drugs which are not presented for exemption. It cannot find out, by such a process in any case, how many times drug companies decide that particular drugs are too low-volume to warrant taking to the marketplace, if they have to meet a cost in actually bringing them to that marketplace.
I note that these late regulations provide a capacity to waive fees, and that is good, but my reading of these regulations—and perhaps the minister can indicate whether I have misread them in some way—is that the fee has to be paid at the time that the application is made, or shortly thereafter, and a decision is made independently as to whether the fee can be waived. If the fee is not waived after the application is made, there is no capacity by the applicant to withdraw the application on the basis that it would not be economic to proceed with that particular application. In other words, if you are a drug company and you have a low-volume drug that you want to introduce to the marketplace for a handful of people who happen to need that drug and you think, ‘It might be worth putting this forward, but we don’t have any certainty that we’re going to end up with the fee being waived,’ you might just as well say, ‘In that case, let’s not worry about it. It’s only a handful of people that this would benefit. We will leave the drug off the market altogether.’
The regulations say the department may waive a fee payable if the application involves the public interest and the payment of the fee would make the application financially unviable. I would like to know why the government has not said it will waive the fee in those circumstances. If it is in the public interest, why not make it compulsory to waive the fee? If it is in the public interest and the fee would make the application financially viable, why shouldn’t an applicant have the certainty that they will have the fee waived? I think this is an issue which again reinforces the sense that the government is after the money; it is not interested in the long-term Australian patient who uses drugs and the effect of the measures that it has introduced into the Senate.
I am concerned about this. I think that this is a leap in the wrong direction. It was considered by the previous government; it was not proceeded with for very good reasons. I think it is a little bit galling to have the new government, which continually criticised our lack of consultation and our inability to consult with people, now telling us that our consultation, which led to us not proceeding with this measure, was satisfactory for them to make a decision now, three years later, that this measure can go ahead, despite the obvious lack of support from any of the stakeholders in the sector. The Senate should reject this legislation. If it does support it, it should certainly support the amendments and should consider what direction the Labor Party is taking with these sorts of measures. Is it grabbing for the dollars or is it trying to improve health outcomes for the Australian people? The former conclusion is very hard to resist.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-08-28,"—I rise to contribute briefly to the debate on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, which was an initiative of a Labor government and has been operating in Australia for over 60 years. It was designed to facilitate affordable and timely access to prescription medication. The PBS has become a key feature of the modern Australian healthcare system on which Australians rely heavily. The aim of the PBS remains the same as it was when the scheme was first introduced by Labor over 60 years ago: to ensure all Australians have access to affordable, high-quality medication. Indeed, the very concept of the PBS finds its foundations in the long-held Labor notion of universal health care: that affordable health care, including services and products, should be available to all Australians, not just those who can afford to pay a given price. In light of this, the PBS, by subsidising the cost of an array of prescription medicines, has operated to facilitate the implementation of universal health care when it comes to access to medicines. The positive effect that the PBS has had should not be underestimated. Hundreds of thousands of Australians suffering from a wide variety of health conditions—including those suffering from chronic illnesses such as asthma and arthritis—have unquestionably benefited both physically and financially from the ability to access subsidised prescription medication.
The same can be said for the hundreds of thousands of Australian men, women and children who have benefited from being immunised under the National Immunisation Program. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that countless lives have actually been saved because of the operation of the NIP, which provides fully funded vaccines for major preventable diseases. Indeed, it is through the operation of the government health initiatives such as the PBS and the NIP that this country has been able to establish a reasonable, basic standard of health and wellbeing for a majority of Australians. The government recognises the immense value of the PBS and the NIP and is dedicated to ensuring that initiatives continue to operate to ensure that all Australians enjoy a decent standard of physical health and wellbeing.
The specific purpose of the bill we are debating here today is to amend the National Health Act 1953 by introducing provisions allowing the Commonwealth government to implement cost recovery arrangements for the services and activities related to listing medicines on the PBS or designating vaccines for the National Immunisation Program. On 25 August, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs handed down its report on the bill. The majority report recommended that the bill be passed, with an additional recommendation that the regulations contained in the bill:
… should incorporate specific measures, whether through exemptions or waivers or some other form, to ensure that there is no disincentive for companies to lodge applications to list low-volume medicines, or to change or extend the indications of listed medicines.
I fully endorse the recommendations contained in the majority report. During the course of the inquiry the committee heard evidence from a number of stakeholders regarding the possible impact cost recovery may have on the PBS listing process. At present, to be listed on the PBS a pharmaceutical must receive marketing approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration—the TGA—and obtain a positive recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, or PBAC. This recommendation goes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority—the PBPA—and then to the minister for final approval.
Until this point, the costs associated with lodging an application for PBS listing, regardless of whether the application succeeded or failed, were borne by the Australian taxpayer and not the pharmaceutical company lodging the application. When combined with the actual cost of providing subsidised medicines and fully funded vaccines under the PBS and the NIP, this equates to a significant financial outlay for the Commonwealth government and taxpayers. Indeed, in the 2006-07 budget cycle the Commonwealth government paid $6.4 billion to approved pharmacists, hospitals and medical practitioners in the form of subsidies for the supply of medicines under the PBS. A further $280 million was provided by the Commonwealth to fully fund the supply of vaccines under the NIP. Undoubtedly it is this large financial outlay by the Commonwealth government which led witnesses during the inquiry, such as Associate Professor Thomas Faunce, to highlight the importance of the introduction of cost recovery arrangements to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the PBS.
Under the proposed amendments contained in the bill, the onus of the costs associated with lodging an application for PBS listing will be shifted to the companies seeking the listing. Under the changes, the Commonwealth government will be entitled to recover both the costs associated with lodging a submission to the PBAC and, subsequently, the costs of the processes that arise from those submissions in relation to new listings or changes to existing listings. Under the model contained in this bill, as opposed to that proposed by the previous Howard government, all revenue collected from cost recovery will be paid directly into consolidated revenue, guaranteeing the independence of the PBAC, which will have no role in the setting of fees and will not receive any revenue from the industry.
It is important to note that the government was in opposition when the previous government sought to introduce cost recovery for the PBS and NIP. At the time, we shared some reservations with some of the stakeholders about the previous government’s proposal—in particular, the possibility that the independence of the PBAC could be threatened. However, as I have mentioned, under the model contained in this bill the independence of the PBAC is guaranteed. Under our model, cost recovery will not affect the structure or the operation of the PBAC, nor will it compromise the independence of the committee decisions.
Once the legislation is fully operational, it is estimated that the annual revenue regained from cost recovery fees will be around $9 million in 2008-09, increasing to around $14 million in the following years. It is important to note in saying this that the government is committed to ensuring that there is due process to make sure that the fees that are levied are fair and reasonable. The government believes that this is not an unreasonable burden for pharmaceutical companies to bear in light of the significant financial benefits which such companies enjoy if they are successful in having a product listed on the PBS. Indeed, pharmaceutical companies have had years to prepare for the introduction of PBS cost recovery fees, since the previous government, despite its delay in introducing the initiative, never once told the industry that it was off the policy agenda. It is likely that making pharmaceutical companies, rather than Australian taxpayers, accountable for the costs associated with lodging a submission will encourage companies to prepare better quality submissions.
There were some concerns raised during the course of the inquiry that the addition of cost recovery fees to the process of listing medicines on the PBS may present companies with a disincentive to develop and list new medicines—specifically, low-volume medicines. However, as the Minister for Health and Ageing pointed out, cost recovery is not a new process. Indeed, the experience of the TGA, where cost recovery fees have been applied successfully for the past 15 years and new products continue to be registered, highlights the viability of the cost recovery process. The department noted in their submission to the committee that the financial incentive of being listed on the PBS, in most cases, outweighs any disincentive in relation to cost recovery fees. However, it also noted that niche products designed for a smaller market will, under the legislation, be given consideration under the cost recovery arrangements which would allow for a discretionary waiver of fees on those grounds. In its final report the committee recommended that the bill be passed, but it also recommended:
… that the regulations should incorporate specific measures … to ensure that there is no disincentive for companies to lodge applications to list low-volume medicines, or to change or extend the indications of listed medicines.
While the bill in its current form provides some scope for a waiver of cost recovery fees where it may be in the public interest, the proposed amendments would simply make it absolutely clear that there will be no disincentive whatsoever to smaller pharmaceutical companies lodging submissions or for any company to lodge submissions for lower volume medications.
The government agrees with the committee that the regulations should provide for the protection from fees for applications seeking to list orphan or low-volume products. The minister has released the draft regulations, and I understand that the period for consultation on the draft regulations will continue until 19 December. A number of drugs will be granted exemption from cost recovery fees. For example, TGA designated orphan drugs and drugs approved for temporary supply will attract automatic exemption. Medicines used in palliative care, medicines used to treat conditions common to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations and paediatric medicines will also be exempt. The draft regulations show that the department can waive fees where it is in the public interest and where the payment of a fee would result in the application not being financially viable.
The Productivity Commission has pointed out that, by ensuring that the pharmaceutical companies that are regulated bear the costs associated with making a submission, cost recovery under the PBS can promote economic efficiency and equity by promoting cost consciousness among agencies and users. Obviously, by passing on the cost burden in the majority of cases these measures also promote the longevity and sustainability of the PBS, which has served the Australian community for over 60 years. Therefore, under these measures Australian men, women and children will continue to enjoy affordable and timely access to a wide variety of medications. Indeed these measures will ensure that the PBS—which has become the keystone of the Australian health system—continues to promote, as far as possible, universal access to quality health care in terms of both products and services. The measures contained in this bill are in line with the Rudd Labor government’s broader commitment to improving access to affordable quality healthcare services in this country. The government introduced these measures in its May budget and their implementation has already had significant financial consequences. The opposition is being completely hypocritical by not supporting this bill. As I have said, I support the recommendations of the Senate community affairs committee majority report and hence the passage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-08-28,"—I was interested to hear Senator Carol Brown tell us that the government is committed to due process in this move on PBS cost recovery. The government has a reputation for being all about process, for being about reviews, inquiries, workshops and talkfests. Yet, the opposition’s objection to this bill is about the lack of process. There are no draft regulations and still there is no explanatory memorandum for the draft regulations. Witness after witness when they spoke at our inquiry said that they had no idea what this was going to mean in practical terms. How was it going to work? No-one knew. Where were the draft regulations? It is a fundamental flaw in the legislative process of this government that there are no draft regulations. You only need to look at the government majority report from the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry. It says:
The committee shares stakeholders’ concerns that the proposed regulations, containing the detail of the implementation of the cost recovery arrangements, were not available for examination during the course of this inquiry. As a result, it has been difficult for the committee to appropriately assess the implications of the proposed arrangements.
Yet the government happily claims that it would be hypocritical not to vote for this legislation. The government majority committee report says, ‘We cannot appropriately assess the implications of the proposed arrangements.’ The report from the government members of the community affairs committee goes on to say:
The committee has raised concerns in previous reports regarding over-reliance on subordinate legislation to implement significant amendments and reform, and has ... noted the importance of timely provision of subordinate legislation for committee scrutiny.
Unfortunately—or perhaps I should say fortunately—the opposition is not about to simply accept the government’s view that they are committed to due process. The government say: ‘Don’t you worry about that. The regulations will be all right because we tell you so.’ As Senator Colbeck pointed out, there has not been time to properly scrutinise the regulations, nor were any of the witnesses in a position to comment on what they might have perceived as flaws in those regulations. These are the people who have some expertise in appearing before the PBAC and making submissions to the PBAC. They were all very concerned about what it would mean. For instance, I turn to comments by Professor Ravenscroft, from Palliative Care Australia. He said:
My personal comment is that to leave this open for the bureaucracy to make these decisions—
that is, about what constitutes an orphan drug, about what small volume drugs should have extensions to their indicator use—
may end up producing a result that is less than satisfactory for the patients who need these drugs.
The problem that has developed is that we have no idea how any of this will work in practice. The people who have the best expertise and the best chance to tell us how this would work in practice had no opportunity to tell us this information because it was not available. We are, I am afraid, somewhat cynical about the government telling us: ‘Don’t you worry about that. We’ll get it right.’
I would like to talk a little about the effects of this on the smaller groups such as the palliative care part of the health industry in Australia. There are 135,000 or so deaths in Australia every year. About 100,000 of those are related to people who have had an illness before they die. We know that presently 40,000 to 50,000 people a year in Australia need care in the terminal phase of their illness. Of those people, 25 per cent die at home being cared for by their families and loved ones. A perhaps more disturbing figure is that 80 per cent of those 50,000 people would like to stay at home, they would like to be treated at home, and yet only 25 per cent are. These are people suffering from a wide range of terminal illnesses and certainly in need of our support, our empathy and our help.
There was some evidence given during the inquiry that told us that many drugs that are currently used in large population groups, such as for epilepsy, could be of benefit being used for pain management purposes in the palliative care market. To do this requires a new submission, for an extension of the indicators, to the PBAC. Right now there are people with terminal illness being treated in hospitals because the drugs they need cannot be administered anywhere except in hospital because they are not on the PBS. We have that problem right now. How much worse can that get when orphan drugs, drugs for low-population groups, may in fact not get to be submitted to the PBAC? Yet this is a situation that we currently have no clarity whatsoever around. What is the public interest? Who decides? Where is the transparency in the draft regulations that are currently in place?
Professor Ravenscroft explained the situation to the committee. There are many drugs that currently exist to help palliative patients undergoing palliative care but the clinical studies for those drugs have not been done for palliative care purposes. There needs to be new data generated, at a cost. There need to be trials of the use of the drug, at a cost. If and when enough data is generated then these drugs go to the TGA for extension, at a cost. They go to the PBAC potentially, at a cost. Who is going to do this when we are talking about a low and disparate population group? We are talking about roughly 50,000 people. They have numerous problems—numerous needs for numerous different drugs. So we are talking about very, very small population groups that are not going to attract the attention or the funding that is needed from the drug companies.
There was also evidence given that community and industry organisations are free to bring submissions for listing with the PBAC to the PBAC. From the evidence given it appears that this has never happened. The palliative care medical profession at one stage investigated doing this because of the need for drugs in the palliative care industry and the fact that it is such a low-volume industry, but they could not get the funding needed to undertake the work that had to be done.
So the PBAC assessment process means that, in fact, most medicines are submitted to the PBAC for their major indicator. It is the first thing sought by the companies. There are many examples where drugs that have been used in palliative care are used off licence by palliative care physicians because the drug, whilst registered for the PBAC, still has not been through the regulatory mechanism for use by people having palliative care.
Two examples given during our evidence are worth bringing to the Senate’s attention because, in my view, they put a personal face, a real human aspect, to the sorts of issues we are currently talking about. The drug gabapentin is a reasonably new anti-epilepsy drug that is used for resistant epilepsy in the broader Australian community. It has proved to be a good drug for pain control in some areas. Currently, the palliative care group are asking whether, as an orphan drug, this drug would be able to work its way through the system. Will it be allowed to go through the system in a free way? We do not know. That is the point—we do not know. They cannot tell. No-one knows whether this would go through the system or not.
A second drug is octreotide, which has been approved for growth hormone treatment and for the treatment of a specific type of tumour. It is not available to the palliative care market, except in this off-label way. It is used much in the palliative care market for treating terminal gut obstruction where the patient has a tumour that is blocking their intestines and therefore causing the person to vomit copiously and to be in severe pain most of the time. The only place someone can get that drug right now is in a hospital, and a regular dosage of it outside the public system would cost well over $300 a week.
We are talking about one group of people here. Gut obstruction in the palliative care area affects about 10 per cent of those 50,000 people we were talking about before. This is not a group that any drug company is going to be seeking to make a submission about to the PBAC. In fact, we were given evidence that whilst the palliative care industry had asked the company to submit on this basis they were not prepared to do that, even now in the current system, because of the cost to the company. We need a lot more certainty than we currently have about what will be considered an orphan drug or a low-population drug and therefore will be able to be put through at someone’s discretion. We are not entirely sure whose discretion it will be. It will be discretionary, but at whose discretion we do not know.
The other thing that witnesses were concerned about was the stage of the process at which they would know whether there would be costs involved with submitting to the PBAC. Why would a drug company go through the effort of putting up submissions, for instance, around what they considered to be an orphan drug or a low-population drug to subsequently discover that it was not to be assessed in that way? At what stage, at what point in the cost cycle, would companies know whether they had to fork out for their submission or not?
I suggest that the government might like to consider some of the other ways that companies in other countries go about putting medication into the system. There is, for instance, a process under the FDA where companies are given priority for listing low-population or orphan drugs depending on the work that they have done in the larger and wider community. A company might look at listing a low-population or orphan drug to potentially earn brownie points towards the listing of another drug which is going to be more profitable and therefore a way for them to write off or subsidise the costs of putting the orphan drug or the low-population drug into the system.
The coalition, as Senator Colbeck has pointed out, will not be supporting this legislation. We certainly accept that the PBS has ever-increasing costs and that these must be recouped, must be controlled and must be monitored. These costs will continue to rise. However, it is irresponsible to say: ‘Let’s worry about controlling the costs irrespective of the processes. We do not care what this is going to do or how it is going to do it. Let’s just get it in. Trust us. It will all be all right in the end because we say so.’ We would say to the government, a government so keen on process: ‘Sorry, get the process right and then this legislation will be very worthy of consideration—but when the process is right.’ Without careful analysis of the regulations, especially by those bodies that will have to live and be assessed under these regulations, it would be hypocritical of the government, I would suggest, to think that rushing this through makes some sort of positive difference to the PBS system. Clearly, a delay in here to do this properly would have cost very little in monetary terms. It would have given a lot of comfort to the industry and it would have been a very sensible way to progress this issue.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-08-28,"—This is a threshold issue in terms of change in legislation and it is important just to remind people about the scheme of which we are talking. There is no disagreement in this place or indeed, I think, in the community about the value of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The committee had on evidence the honour and the respect with which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is treated by the industry, by the people who are using the system, by the pharmaceutical industry itself, by the health system and also by a number of people who are consumers. We heard valuable evidence in our inquiry about just how convinced people were that the system needed to work well, how it needed to be well resourced and how there also needed to be a sense of engagement with the system. This shows us that for about the 60 years in which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been in place it has served Australia well.
Consistently in this place over many years I have heard arguments from both sides of the chamber, in particular from the then government, about the rising costs of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, how we had to be careful and how we had to be sure that this scheme was well resourced by government. There was always some concern that the ever-increasing expenses relayed to the dynamic industry of pharmaceuticals would have some impact on the ability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to supplement the cost for consumers.
That is a given. There is no doubt that the rising cost of the scheme over the years has been of deep concern to the government and, I believe, to governments. There has got to be some ongoing acknowledgement that the scheme itself continues to need to be reviewed closely and that there needs to be ongoing commitment from all parties involved to ensure that there is effective funding for this scheme. We know that last year over $6 billion was spent on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme alone in this country and that anticipated costs into the future will grow. In a number of contributions to this debate we have heard about the marvellous scientific advances that have occurred and the growth in the capacity of medication to adapt and also to respond to the illnesses that people are working through in their lives.
Senator Boyce has just given us examples of drugs that have come onto the market in the recent past. Our committee received evidence, both in writing and at the inquiry, from a number of the large pharmaceutical companies that are members of Medicines Australia, the umbrella organisation, about the horrific—and I use this term deliberately—cost of research and development for medications. They also told us about the fact that for the few major successes in the field, of which people speak with great pride—and we in this place have heard about major successes where drugs have been researched and come on the market and provide immense benefit to people—many years of research and trials can be put into the development of drugs that do not result in a good product coming forward. But that is part of the industry.
In terms of understanding this industry, we believe that it is an industry based on research and on decisions that are made, almost on a daily basis, about effective profit margins. We are not talking about some form of charity in the pharmaceutical area. We are talking about effective and highly successful business decisions. Within that business environment, there is no doubt that the range of costs that must be contributed to ensure that a final result is received is built in. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008, which we are considering here today, looks at inserting one level of cost into the bank of costs that must be seen by the industry as they make their daily business decisions about what they are going to do in the market. And it is not an overwhelming cost. Indeed, there will be a cost; that is what the legislation is about. No-one has run away from that. It is not a new concept. It has actually been in discussion in this country since 2005.
The previous government had on record a proposal in previous budgets to bring forward a very similar costing proposal. There were a range of discussions at the time, as the department explained to us at the inquiry, about the interaction with the industry, with consumers and with the various people who have interests in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the National Immunisation Program. And there are a range of people who share the interest in the industry. The discussion has been going on for a couple of years and we have indications of where it occurred and what the basis of the discussions was.
It is fair to say that in 2005 the industry did not like the introduction of a costing program, and they do not like it now, because it inserts a realm of costs. But the argument that the government is putting forward is that this is part of the contribution that players in this market must make to ensure that the program continues to be strong, well resourced and effective and provides what Australians have come to believe is their right—that they will have access to the best possible medications and that they will have certainty that they are safe, that they are well tested and that their government, whatever the government of the day is, will provide effective financial support so that the cost will be supported.
We know that at the present time a large percentage of the drugs and medications available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are directly supported by the government. We also know that patient contributions make up about $1.15 billion of what is provided. If I had the figures I would work out what that would be if there were no PBS. I am sure people will do that. We have heard in this place on a number of occasions just how much individuals are prepared to pay for medications that will provide a cure or support or alleviation of symptoms and also contribute towards having as strong and as healthy a life as they possibly can. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which we support in Australia, gives certainty to consumers that programs are there for them. Indeed, across the world the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is the envy of many countries. Stories about the way it operates have actually been written up in industry papers.
One of the core things, I think, that came out of our inquiry was the strong desire that regulations be available with the legislation so that the actual detail of the costing regime would be available for everybody. I agree completely. The best possible process when we are looking at primary legislation that is supported by a range of secondary legislation and regulations is that we would have in front of us all of that information when we are making our decisions. The reality is that for the very short time of six years during which I have been in this position and working on this committee I have never seen regulations provided to any community affairs legislation or reference committee along with the primary legislation that it was considering. We have of course asked for it.
I share the opposition’s view in their strong statement in the committee report and in today’s debate about it being essential that we always have regulations or guidelines in front of us when we are looking at legislation. I support their position entirely. That unfortunately has not been their position for the last six years. I welcome their coming on board so that in future debates of this kind we will be able to say this with certainty to the departments supporting our debate and the various bodies working to develop the legislation, and to come forward with all the information we have. We will be able to say that if we as a considering committee are truly going to see the full detail of the impact of any new legislation, it would be very, very welcome to have all the regulations. When asking the department during Senate estimates and in many other committees whether or not we could see regulations at that stage of the consideration—I do not recall the number of committees but I do recall asking this in committees on which you sat, Acting Deputy President Hutchins—we were consistently told that, from the department’s point of view, it would be quite likely that the regulations would be formulated with the legislation and most particularly after the legislation is agreed so that all the details can then be put in place for implementation. With great politeness, various departmental officers have told me that they would take note of our concern and that they would see what they could do and would get back to us.
I am so pleased that we now have the regulations for consideration. It would have been better if we had had them longer; nonetheless, we are talking about people who are very skilled in this process. I hear concern from various industry groups and people from the opposition about how they would like to have more time to look at the regulations in detail and to consider them. I understand that the people who are saying this have significant resources and have the ability, the knowledge, the interest and the commitment to this system to be able to have a look at these regulations and immediately respond. With them having years of experience in working in the area, if there is something there that concerns them at this stage—and I know, having talked with the departmental officers over many years, that regulations evolve—the department will work with industry, with the government, with opposition and with anyone interested in the process to make sure that the process is as effective and as responsive as possible.
The Senate Community Affairs Committee totally agree that to have full knowledge of how this legislation will work, down to the detail of how the process will operate, it is an advantage to have the regulations, and in future it would be good to have them at the time of the committee inquiry process. But we have them now, and I have looked at the regulations and had discussion with departmental officers about the issues that were raised in general during the committee, including how various delegations would operate; how orphan drugs—which is a term that I do enjoy saying; they are the kinds of medications not linked to major pharmaceutical companies that have quite small areas of use—will be considered; how people will be able to waive fees.
The committee heard evidence from the department and from a range of experts in the field, and it was quite clear that everybody at the committee inquiry understood that this is not a one size fits all; that there would be the ability to respond to the different kinds of medication brought forward, that there would be flexibility and that there clearly would be the ability of the delegate—the trained, professional, aware delegate—to provide waivers when a case put forward listed all the things that we have heard about in debate in the last day or so. Those are all things that are a part of this business: the special need, the particular area, the overwhelming cost.
Everybody will be aware of the rules, and in fact the rules themselves have not changed. What we have is a pricing regime put into the process at this level of getting approval for pharmaceutical assistance, the PBAC process. So whilst it is an impost, it is not something of which people are ignorant. People are all too well aware of what this means. They understand where they fit into it, and now that we have had the regulations provided we will be able to see the detail of exactly how it will work, which is something that we have not seen in many other pieces of legislation.
One of the really positive elements of the committee—and it continues to astound me and make me very proud to see—is the way that our legislation engages a range of people in the discussion and how deeply they care for the process. From hearing evidence from people like Carers Australia and the palliative care association and from reading statements from people who work in Aboriginal and Islander health you become aware that they are all very involved in the process. And what they asked when they came before the committee was: would their particular need be taken into consideration during this new pricing regime? The government can say, with absolute authority: yes. People’s individual circumstances will be taken into account when they apply for any process through the PBS, exactly as is done now. A whole range of issues will be taken into account.
Whether people will get the answer that they want all the time, I cannot say; that is part of the decision-making process. But to presume that this is some uncaring, separate process which will be put in over the top and not take into account any of the issues about how this process operates now is just not accurate. That tends towards a scare campaign to get people worried about how it will work and to take the real object of the process off the agenda. The object is to ensure that our system remains well resourced and strong into the future. We hope that we will be able, through this process, to get an agreement on an element of contribution from the major pharmaceutical companies when they apply to go onto the assistance scheme. When they have gone through the process of getting their drugs approved for safety and for being able to be efficiently used and they are looking for government sponsorship so as to mitigate costs for consumers, there will be a cost involved. The details of that are in the regulations. It will operate as people put forward their applications.
The committee was made most aware of the concerns raised by the pharmaceutical area about where their future would be and also of the concerns raised by various specialist groups. In our recommendation, which is in the report, we say that the regulations should incorporate specific measures, whether through exemptions, waivers or in some other form, to ensure that there is no disincentive for companies to lodge applications to list low-volume medicines or to change or extend the indications of listed medicines. That was a clear recommendation in the majority committee report. That has been taken on board by the drafters of the regulations.
I know now that there has been an extended time for people to consider the regulations. We now need to move effectively forward so that there will be understanding and security. We have heard the word ‘security’ a number of times in the debate. It will be security for all participants in the process about exactly what their responsibilities are, what their charges will be and what their responsibilities will be in the future of medicines in this country. I was deeply concerned by the response from some of the pharmaceutical companies. They tended to say that if this charge came in they would have to seriously consider their availability and their ability to provide this service into the future. That is of concern; we have to look at business need. But we also have to look at community need, and in this debate we are looking at ensuring that safe medications are available, that we have the best possible medical research and that Australian consumers can be secure that their PBAC system is well resourced, strong and engaging for all participants.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-08-28,"—The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a world-leading scheme that we can all be proud of. The scheme helps protect Australian families from the soaring prices of prescription drugs that we see in other parts of the world. The affordability of the scheme for the family needs some more attention, and I should note that Family First expressed concerns about changes to the safety net threshold levels under the previous government which increased costs for families.
With regard to this bill, the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008, Family First does support the concept of cost recovery outlined in the bill. That is a principle that Family First supports, but the detail is also important. We have heard throughout this second reading debate from both sides of the chamber about the regulations having only come out since the Community Affairs Committee report on the bill was finalised. Family First has concerns with some of those regulations. The issue here is that even the committee report found that there was concern about making sure there were no unintended consequences. What this gets down to is: will there be some drugs in the future that will not be available for vulnerable Australians because making applications to get those drugs on the PBS could be cost prohibitive to the company applying? That would be of concern especially in Australia where we have a sense of a fair go. I understand about the orphan drugs, but I am worried about things falling in the gap and whether there will be unintended consequences through these regulations. Now that we have the regulations I wonder whether we should actually have a good look at them and see whether there is some way of bridging that gap or hole.
It is very hard for us when we get information last Friday night and then are in here debating a bill that actually unfolds the regulations that follow it. It would be very good for this Senate and for Australia to look at those two items together. That way we can get off on the right step rather than doing a half step with a few holes probably into the future. I am going to leave this problem for the government to solve. As it stands, Family First is looking for—I hate to say it—the topic that the Rudd government likes, which is another inquiry. I would hate to be the first person to stand here today and say, ‘Family First is suggesting an inquiry.’ But these regulations came out last Friday, and even the committee report was seeking government assurances:
... the regulations should incorporate specific measures, whether through exemptions or waivers or some other form, to ensure that there is no disincentive for companies to lodge applications to list low-volume medicines, or to change or extend the indications of listed medicines.
All that is gobbledegook to a lot of people. What that basically says is that there could be some Australians missing out on getting drugs through the PBS because of this cost recovery principle—and, while we agree with the principle, we need to make sure that somewhere in the regulations we have some way of making sure that does not happen. I will not go through suggestions; I will let the government come up with suggestions. However, I think we need a short, sharp inquiry into the regulations that came out on Friday, as we have already had the bill looked at and a report that came out on Friday—just to make sure that when we pass this bill we understand the regulations that we are passing along with it. We have heard in debate here today that when the regulations go forward we can change them through disallowance. That is a very, very messy way of doing it. This is a significant change and I think we need to make sure we are actually on solid ground moving forward. So I appeal to the government that they support—even propose themselves—a short, sharp inquiry into these regulations because without that inquiry Family First cannot support this bill as it stands.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-08-28,"—I thank all senators for their contributions in this debate. I hope in my summing-up that I am able to respond to a range of questions that have been raised in debate. Senator Fielding, I know you may want to go from the chamber but I will canvass the issues that you have raised. Can I also offer you the opportunity to speak with my advisers so you are assured that those issues you have raised will be addressed and give you the opportunity to rethink your indication about how you are intending to vote on this bill. I take the point that you made in your opening that you essentially support cost recovery in this area, and we are pleased about that. The concerns you have raised I will address in my summing-up speech, but I also offer you that opportunity to be able to receive information from my advisers in the next few minutes.
I thank all senators for their contributions and hope that I address all of the questions or points that have been made. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 amends the National Health Act to provide authority for the cost recovery of services provided by the Commonwealth in relation to submissions for the listing or amendment to a listing of medicines, vaccines and other products on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, and the National Immunisation Program, the NIP. These amendments will ensure that applicants, mostly pharmaceutical companies, may be charged fees when they seek services from the Commonwealth in relation to the exercise of a power by the minister under section 9B of the act in relation to the designation of a vaccine on the NIP or a provision in part 7 relating to listings or a change to listings for a medicine or other product on the PBS.
As we have heard this morning, the bill has been subject to a detailed examination by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which took evidence from a range of stakeholders. I thank on the record all people who submitted and gave evidence to that inquiry. After careful scrutiny of the evidence presented to that inquiry, the committee has recommended that the bill proceed in its current form.
The government agrees with the Senate committee and notes its findings that the regulations supporting the legislation should provide for the protection from fees for applicants seeking to list orphan drugs or low-volume products with small patient populations. This finding accords with the government’s own thinking. The minister has circulated the draft regulations showing that they will contain provisions to exempt from fees applications that seek the listing of orphan drugs. That is part 4, sections 14 and 15 of the regulations.
The regulations also show that the Department of Health and Ageing can waive fees where it is in the public interest to do so and where the payment of the fee would result in an application not being financially viable. The government has provided a copy of a draft version of the regulations to the Senate committee, the contents of which demonstrate the government’s intent to minimise the impact on fees upon the listing of orphan and low-volume products. It has also provided them to interested stakeholders, mainly the industry.
I note Senator Fielding’s concern that drugs may not become available as a result of the application of cost recovery. Senator Fielding, that concern is shared by the government. That is why we have taken a lot of trouble in those two parts of the regulations, which I am happy to provide to you, to ensure that the application of this cost recovery regime would not in fact lead in any way to a limiting of access to medications by anyone in the Australian community. I am quite sure that the way in which the regulations have been formulated provides that protection.
I also thank Senator Moore for her history lesson about the provision of regulations to committees. I thank Senator Moore for indicating to the Senate that, in her time as chair and member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in its various forms, she has not known regulations to be provided to that committee. I thank her for acknowledging that this government has provided those regulations for the committee’s use. We acknowledge that it would have been terrific to have been able to get them to the committee earlier. However, they were provided when it was possible to do so. We are keen to be open and transparent. We are keen for there to be scrutiny of this legislation. We are keen for comment.
In that vein, within the next week, the department will release to stakeholders a draft explanatory statement for the regulations. That will further assist with understanding the issues that Senator Siewert has raised. Stakeholders and any other interested party will be able to provide comment on the draft regulations and the draft explanatory statement until 19 September—that is, the consultation period will be four weeks from around now.
Examples of low-volume drugs where exemptions from fees would be granted are medicines used in palliative care, medicines used to treat conditions common to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population and paediatric medicines—issues that have been raised by a number of contributors to the debate and concern for which is shared by the government.
A number of contributors talked about a concern that the independence of the PBS might be threatened. Senator Xenophon has raised that privately with me as well. In the 2005-06 budget, the previous government sought to introduce cost recovery of services associated with listing on the PBS and the NIP. We shared at that time the reservations of some stakeholders about the model that was proposed by the previous government. It was arguable at that time that the independence of the PBAC could be threatened if it was reliant upon the pharmaceutical industry for its funding. However, now in opposition, the originators of this proposal purport to be concerned about the impact of cost recovery on the independence of the PBAC.
The PBAC’s independence is now guaranteed in the government’s model, which is reflected in this bill. The inquiry found and the government affirms that the expertise, integrity and sense of propriety that PBAC members bring to their task will not change as a result of cost recovery. The PBAC will continue to provide expert advice on medicines, independent of government and of industry. The arrangements for funding the PBAC directly through the budget will continue and the PBAC will have no role in setting fees and will take no part in discussions with companies over fees. Cost recovery will not affect the structure or the operation of the PBAC and nor will it compromise the independence of PBAC decisions. Cost recovery has been implemented successfully in many government agencies, including the TGA, without any loss of independence.
The cost of providing subsidised medicines and fully funded vaccines to the Australian community is a significant financial burden to the Commonwealth. In 2007-08, the Commonwealth paid around $7 billion to approved pharmacists, hospitals and medical practitioners for the subsidised supply of medicines under the PBS. A further $543 million was provided by the Commonwealth to the states and territories for the fully funded supply of vaccines under the NIP within their respective jurisdictions.
Australian pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors with medicines or vaccines listed on the PBS and the NIP receive considerable financial benefits from the supply of their products to the Australian community. The Senate committee heard evidence that the proposed cost recovery fees would impose a financial burden on industry. I think we should put this into a bit of perspective. We are talking about a revenue gain from an industry that has an annual turnover of more than $18 billion. The cost recovery impost on that annual turnover of $18 billion is $14 million. To those people listening, yes, those figures are very large, but let us again put that into perspective. The cost recovery is 0.008 of a per cent of the annual turnover. People should think about the maths. They should think about their grade 7 schoolteacher’s advice when they are making the assertion that this would place a financial burden on industry that would be too big to bear.
We also have to remember that the pharmaceutical industry spends a lot of money informing and educating medical practitioners. There has been some discussion about how appropriate that is. The cost of that informing and educating of medical practitioners on an annual basis is $60 million. That is $60 million for conferences, dinners and events where doctors and other medical practitioners are educated. We are talking about a cost recovery impost of $14 million compared to that expense of some $60 million. Eight one-thousandths of one per cent of the annual turnover is the figure that we are talking about.
Pharmaceutical companies receive much by way of benefits from the Australian taxpayer once products are listed on the PBS and they have considerable financial capacity to absorb these charges. It is not unreasonable that they contribute financially towards maintaining the architecture of the PBS. Achieving a product listing on the PBS provides a high level of commercial certainty to a company in relation to that product’s sales.
Fees will reflect the amount of effort required in evaluating submissions. The more complex and time-consuming the evaluation and price negotiation, the higher the fee. Of course, the major determinant for the fee structure, whether a submission is minor or major, where the submission includes substantive change, is very well known to the industry and simply reflects both current practice and PBAC guidelines.
The Senate committee also heard concerns about access to and affordability of medicines for ordinary Australians, whether they be hardworking families or the frail elderly near the end of their lives. I assure the Senate that the government is committed to ensuring that the PBS is accessible to those who need support while remaining affordable to taxpayers. It is important to note that as a result of this measure the Australian community, the beneficiaries of the PBS, will not be required to pay any extra for PBS medicines or vaccines. Patient co-payments are currently $5 for concession card holders or up to $31.30 for general patients. They will not be affected by cost recovery arrangements, which will be administered separately to the PBS.
The opposition argue that the measure is being introduced without consultation with industry. I am afraid that it becomes a little bit laughable when they are arguing that position on that side. The pharmaceutical industry has had plenty of time to prepare for the introduction of cost recovery, which was first introduced in the 2005-06 budget. In addition, extensive consultation occurred with pharmaceutical companies in 2007. In respect of Senator Humphries’s claim that this issue was taken off the former government’s agenda, at no time did the previous government ever tell the pharmaceutical industry that cost recovery was off the agenda and the Department of Health and Ageing has continued to consult with them since the budget announcement.
In accordance with Australian government cost recovery guidelines, the department will introduce ongoing monitoring mechanisms to ensure that fees remain based on efficient costs. The department has also met with industry and agreed to establish a consultative mechanism with industry on cost recovery. A full review of the fees will occur in 2010-11. The government is committed to ensuring that there is due process to ensure that fees are levied in a fair and equitable way. The regulations will therefore provide for a review of administrative decisions made in relation to cost recovery. In consultations with industry there was broad agreement on a simple, internal dispute resolution mechanism for negotiations between the parties. In the first instance, if a matter cannot be resolved through discussion, the department will ask someone in the office who was not part of the original decision to review the case and make a fresh decision. If this still does not satisfy the company, they will have the right to take their case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
Revenue from PBS cost recovery will depend on the number and type of submissions brought to the PBAC for consideration. If the measure had started on 1 July 2008, as the government intended, revenue from fees in 2008-09 was expected to be around $9.4 million, rising to about $14 million in the following years. However, the referral to the committee meant that this measure did not commence on 1 July as planned. The delay has caused disruption to the government’s implementation plan and the government acknowledges that some pharmaceutical companies who had planned for the introduction of cost recovery have experienced confusion as a result of the referral of the bill to committee. The government has therefore asked the Department of Health and Ageing to liaise with industry before finalising an implementation date. That also takes into account the consultation process that will occur on the explanatory statement that goes with the regulations that I mentioned earlier.
The minister will announce the date of implementation, following passage of the legislation, as soon as practicable to allow industry time to prepare. The financial consequences of not implementing this measure as originally announced are significant, with savings identified in the budget through this measure being short by several million dollars.
There are a couple of other issues that various senators addressed in their contribution, which I want to respond to. Senator Humphries suggested that pharmaceutical companies would not apply to have medicines or vaccines listed on the PBAC, the PBS or the NIP at all if they did not know, prior to the application, if the fee would be waived. Can I put his mind at rest. The application for a waiver is made at the same time as a submission is made. The department would then consider and advise the applicants of the waiver of a fee if it was applicable, and then the applicant has 14 days, from the advice about whether the fee will be applied, to withdraw their application. In terms of that suggestion, I do not think that is an issue that would stop anyone accessing a medicine or anything being listed. He also asked the question, ‘Why do the regulations say that the fee may be waived?’ He was suggesting that it should say in the regulations that the fee ‘must’ be waived, rather than, as it says currently, that it ‘may’ be waived. Part 4, section 14 indicates what fees are exempt, and section 15 indicates where the waivers will be. I say to Senator Humphries that that is normal drafting language; that is what you say. We cannot say that you must waive a fee when the application has not been received or even assessed. I think that Senator Humphries is trying to find another argument to fill up his page rather than something that truly is a problem. You cannot say that you will waive a fee without doing an assessment of the application.
Senator Siewert requested an interpretation or a definition of the words ‘substantive’, ‘major’ and ‘minor’ change. I direct Senator Siewert to pages 2 and 3 of the regulations, in the listing of the definitions, where the words ‘minor’, ‘major’ and ‘substantive’ are indicated. These words come directly from the PBAC guidelines of several years, and industry is very familiar with them. The Department of Health and Ageing and industry, in fact, developed these guidelines together. Finally, this is an important piece of legislation— (Time expired)

Leave granted.
—In my summing up speech I referred to the cost recovery as a percentage of overall revenue—the $14 million cost to the industry as opposed to overall revenue of $18 billion. Unfortunately, the calculator was broken and I said 0.008 per cent. The figure was actually 0.078 per cent or 0.08 per cent rounded up to two decimal places. It is not a lot of money in the scheme of things, but the calculation was incorrect and I wanted to correct the record.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-08-28,"—The Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 is supported by the coalition. It is a particularly important piece of legislation. It has been through the lower house and received the support of all parties there. I will not go through the terms of the bill in full, but it does implement in Australia the protocol of the 2003 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, generally known as the Supplementary Fund Protocol. It also introduces amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act, known as the MARPOL amendments. It has amendments to the ship levy legislation relating to the definitions of an ‘Australian port’ and ‘collector’.
We as a country have every reason to be a signatory to the international maritime conventions ensuring adequate compensation is in place in the event of an oil spill in Australian waters. The introduction of a third tier of compensation will ensure adequate compensation is available. Compensation liability is currently limited and has in instances proved insufficient for major oil spills. The supplementary fund will be financed through levies on public or private entities in receipt of more than 150,000 tonnes of contributing oil per year in contracting states, but levies, interestingly, will only be collected after the oil spill has occurred and after the first two tiers of compensation are exhausted. There was some discussion upon whether collecting the levies after the event is the appropriate way to do it, but I understand that after lengthy debates at the international level the world community has been convinced that those who would have to pay would pay after the event.
Why I particularly wanted to speak on this bill was to again highlight how important the protection of our sea is to Australia. We are an island continent, we have one of the largest coastlines of any country in the world and by world standards our waters are clean and pristine. Although some in Australia would at times denigrate the efforts of various governments—most notably the efforts of the last government—to protect the marine environment, it is acknowledged worldwide that the waters in Australia are amongst the best protected anywhere. And thanks to former environment ministers Senator Hill, Mr Kemp and Senator Campbell we have, over the last 11 years, built up a series of pieces of legislation and arrangements to protect our very pristine waters. There is still more that we can do. One of the great initiatives of the Howard government was the setting up of marine national parks around Australia. These were not without controversy and they were not without some opponents, but we proceeded with that in what is again an international first. And the number of marine parks we will have around Australia over the next decade or so will be a leading example to the world of Australia’s innovation in protection of the sea.
It is particularly important that we do that for places like my own state of Queensland, which relies very heavily on the tourism attracted to our marine assets—particularly the Great Barrier Reef. But I hasten to add that the beaches of the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, plus the Great Barrier Reef and the adjacent towns and communities, are real magnets to international tourists. For all of those reasons it is essential that we do what we can to protect and enhance those fabulously attractive and pristine beaches and marine ecologies. Fishing, pearling and coastal communities are also all dependent upon our marine environment and an oil spillage would have enormous financial and environmental implications for Australia. It is when you are faced with a situation like that that you realise the implications and the vulnerability of our seas, our marine environment and our coastline. And it is times like that that we understand why we, as a parliament and as a nation, must be prepared to make a commitment to sign up to protocols like those that are the subject of this bill. Australia has very busy ports and shipping channels and we have the fifth largest shipping task in the world, so it is essential that we become involved in these areas.
I mentioned the beaches of the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. Quite substantial shipping comes into the Port of Brisbane, but those of you who understand the Brisbane port will realise that on coming out of the Brisbane River the ships turn north and go along the inside of Moreton Island, up to Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast, before they turn west and out into the open sea. Real care needs to be taken to ensure those shipping lanes are maintained in the very best manner, in the very best way. Right along the coast we have enormous shipping, both inside and outside the Barrier Reef. There is even domestic shipping coming from Weipa, around the top of Cape York and down to Gladstone carrying the very precious raw commodity that ends up as aluminium. It is very important that we have pilots, where necessary, both inside and outside the reef. It is very important that we take on all of these measures.
This bill shows Australia’s commitment to cleaning up any oil spills if they should ever happen. We hope and pray that there is never an oil spill, that there is never any need whatsoever to call upon this fund to clean up after an oil spill. We would hope that all of our precautions have ensured that oil spills do not occur, but if they do occur anywhere around Australia’s pristine coastline then we need to have the funds necessary—and enormous funds would be required—to ameliorate the impact of a spillage from an oil tanker. This bill does have the support of the coalition, it is a bill that I think will have the support of all Australians and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTION OF THE SEA LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-08-28,"—In summing up the debate on this important piece of legislation, I thank Senator Macdonald for his contribution and for his acknowledgement that the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 is being supported by all parties. It is an important piece of legislation and one that needs to be put in place. The supplementary fund protocol was adopted in 2003 by the International Maritime Organisation, and it entered into force internationally on 3 March 2005. It goes without saying that it is a long time between 2005 and this legislation actually coming into the parliament. It is a piece of legislation that this government was certainly keen to ensure was enacted as quickly as possible.
The bill will ensure that compensation to Australian victims following an oil spill from a tanker incident is maximised and that adequate financial resources are provided for clean-up costs, economic loss, property damage and to help with the natural recovery of Australia’s affected marine environment. From a global perspective and for our international reputation, it is important that Australia becomes a contracting party to the supplementary fund protocol because our ratification will add support to the protocol and will encourage more countries to become parties—so it is a very significant piece of international legislation from our perspective.
We are very fortunate, as Senator Macdonald said, that we have not had any oil spills in Australia on the scale of some of those that have occurred overseas. The two most significant incidents involved the Princess Anne Marie off the Western Australian coast in 1975, where approximately 15,000 tonnes of oil were spilt, and the Kirki, also off the Western Australian coast, in 1991, where approximately 18,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilt. Since that time we have been free of those kinds of disasters and we certainly want to ensure that, in the unfortunate circumstance such an oil spill were to occur again, we have comprehensive arrangements in place to respond. Yet, in spite of the dedication and professionalism of the men and women involved in response activities, there is still the potential for significant pollution damage and for this to affect a range of industries and, of course, our pristine marine environment.
The bill, as we have heard, creates a third tier of compensation for damage resulting from spills of oil from an oil tanker so that the maximum amount payable increases up to 750 million special drawing rights—approximately $1.3 billion per incident. The bill also ensures that compensation to Australian victims following an oil spill from a tanker incident is maximised and that adequate financial resources are provided for clean-up costs, economic loss, property damage and to help with the natural recovery of Australia’s affected marine environment. The bill also amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Navigation Act 1912, giving effect to those MARPOL amendments, and it amends the ship levy legislation relating to those important definitions of what is meant by ‘an Australian port’ and a ‘collector’, and to that end it is very good legislation for our environment and I certainly commend it to the Senate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-08-28,"—The Senate is considering the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Annual Charges) Bill 2008. The bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989 in relation to the imposition and collection of annual charges and also the exemption from paying a charge. The Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, conducts a range of activities in order to ensure that medicines and medical devices available here in Australia meet acceptable standards and to ensure that Australians have access within reasonable time to therapeutic advances. In doing so, the TGA has responsibility for compiling and maintaining the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, or ARTG, where medicines must be either registered or listed, and where medical devices are included. As of 23 May 2008, there were approximately 54,000 products on the register and accordingly I am sure that we can certainly appreciate the volume of work that is undertaken by the TGA to maintain such an extensive and necessary register. I must emphasise again that this work is completed with the aim of protecting Australian consumers while also demanding high standards within medicinal and therapeutic innovation and advancement.
Under the current legislation, annual fee payments are set as the date of entry of production in the ARTG or the date that the manufacturing licence was granted and then the anniversary of that date annually. One part of the proposed amendment will change this to legislate for a uniform date—1 October—for all annual payments. It is proposed that this change to the payment schedule will result in much greater administrative efficiency for the TGA, though I do note the Bills Digest, and in turn the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s own website, indicates that this legislative change simply brings the legislation into line with what is current administrative practice for the TGA. Currently the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act contain provisions for a reduction or waiver of annual charges. This bill repeals the provisions from the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act and inserts them into the Therapeutic Goods Act for the purposes of consistency and readability. The power for annual charges to be reduced or completely waived for goods or devices which now have low volume and low value ensures that sponsors are not discouraged from registering or listing goods and devices that can bring benefit and relief to consumers but which, for certain reasons, face challenges in the commercial world.
Despite the clear merit of the exemption and waiver provision, I do welcome the amendments to this bill, which are aimed at improving the scrutiny, accountability and transparency associated with such applications. I note the concerns raised by the Australian National Audit Office in its financial statement audit report for 2006-07 for the Department of Health and Ageing in relation to the lack of third-party confirmation. Under the amendment there will now be the ability to request additional information from applicants seeking an exemption and from those already granted an exemption. There will also be the ability to cancel exemptions and require payment of the annual charge. These provisions will ensure the exemption mechanism is not abused by unscrupulous applicants while at the same time ensuring that the TGA obtains all charges to which it is entitled. With those remarks, I advise that the opposition will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ANNUAL CHARGES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-08-28,"—I thank Senator Colbeck for his remarks, his contribution to the debate and his indication that the opposition is supporting this legislation. The Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Annual Charges) Bill 2008, as we have heard, amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989 to provide administrative efficiency for both the TGA and its stakeholders in the way annual charges are imposed and collected and to provide more transparency and accountability in the granting of exemptions from liability to pay annual charges because of the low-value turnover of the therapeutic goods.
The bill makes a number of changes to the existing regime relating to the imposition and collection of annual charges by allowing for the setting of a uniform date for the payment of annual charges. These amendments will, for example, allow sponsors of therapeutic goods that are entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods to pay all annual charges on one particular date instead of on different dates within the financial year that are based on the anniversary dates of the entry of those goods. The bill introduces changes to the current exemption from liability to pay annual charges because of the low-value turnover of the therapeutic goods. The changes include requiring persons applying for, or who have already been granted, an exemption to provide evidence certified by an approved person to support their eligibility for such an exemption. The bill also provides for the making of regulations that will set out additional details on the processing, granting and cancellation of the exemption. These amendments will therefore provide greater clarity, transparency and accountability in the processing and the granting of an exemption.
The bill also makes other technical and consequential amendments and includes a clarification that an annual charge can actually be set at a nil amount. On that basis, I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-08-28,"—This is a very important piece of legislation because it deals with a truly Australian icon, one of the wonders of the world. It deals with the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest and arguably most complex ecosystem—some 2,900 individual reefs, 760 fringing reefs around islands or mainland, and some 900 islands within the marine park. It is managed for multiple uses, including a very important tourism industry which provides the means for 1.9 million visitors from Australia and around the world to experience one of the most spectacular ecosystems on the planet. It is worth nearly $6 billion a year to the regional and Australian economy. The reef supports a diverse fishing industry—important commercial line, net and trawl industries—and is widely used by fishers, including many families, along its more than 3,000 kilometres of coastline. The recreational fishing industry generates some hundreds of millions of dollars of income for communities along the Barrier Reef and for our nation.
As well, the reef has particular cultural significance to Australia’s Indigenous peoples and we have a profound responsibility to manage the environmental, social, cultural and historical contexts of the Great Barrier Reef and also to manage very carefully the evolving pressures as more and more people wish to access the reef. The outcomes of the 2006 review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 are aimed at delivering modern legislation for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to ensure that we are capable of the long-term protection needs of the future.
This is a bill that evolved during the management of the previous government and it started way back in Dr David Kemp’s time as minister and even before that when Senator Robert Hill was the minister. Certainly the bulk of the work was done by Dr David Kemp and was carried on by Senator Ian Campbell. A lot of work was done by the environment department and Mr Borthwick, its secretary. The review was a very complete one and one which suggested certain amendments to enable the proper protection of the reef. So, quite clearly, the coalition will be supporting the general thrust of this bill and nearly all of the amendments.
However, at this stage, for the convenience of the government, the Greens and the two Independent senators, I want to very briefly indicate the way that the coalition will be dealing with this piece of legislation. Later on, Senator Scullion, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, will be moving a second reading amendment to refer the bill to the Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for inquiry and report. Senator Scullion will speak to that later. I will not say any more except to alert the chamber that that will be raised later as a second reading amendment.
When the bill gets to the committee stage the coalition has several amendments that we will be moving. I appreciate that at this time in debate I do not need to alert the chamber to what we are doing, and some may say that it is unwise to do that—that it is always useful to catch your opponents off guard—but I think this is such an important issue that I want, in this second reading debate, to alert others to what is happening so that they can be properly informed and can properly assess the approach the coalition is going to take.
There is an amendment that I just wish to mention briefly. In relation to the board of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the proposal in the bill is that the number on the board be increased from three to five. Of course we support that. One of those members, according to the legislation before us, is to be an Indigenous person. We will be moving an amendment to say that, as well, one of those board members should be a person with experience in the tourism or another industry associated with the Great Barrier Reef.
This amendment has come forward after consultation with those who are vitally involved in the proper management of this Australian icon, and it is an amendment that I would hope would find support from the government as well as from the minor parties and Independents here. I think it is essential, in making sure that we have the best people in charge of the authority, that we have a wide range of experience, and I think it would be remiss of the parliament if we did not insist that those in whose interests it is to make sure the reef is very carefully managed are given a say on the board. I appreciate it is not a representative board; it is a board of people with skills to do the right thing—but we are signifying an Indigenous person there, and I think we should also ensure that one of the appointees is someone with experience in tourism or one of the other businesses that deal with the reef.
The other coalition amendment that I will be moving, also on behalf of Senator Boswell, is again an amendment that I would hope would find favour with the government, if not the Greens. I certainly hope it would find favour with the Independents as well. It relates to the early stages of the rearrangement of the Great Barrier Reef. I will go into this in more detail when we are dealing with the amendments at the committee stage, but I just wanted to alert people to where we were going.
When the new zoning arrangements to the reef came in just prior to 2004, I think it was, it meant a whole new range of zones were put in place in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. They ranged from green, no-take zones to yellow zones, which allowed some recreational fishing—different zones for different things, in accordance with what is seen as best practice in managing a very fragile marine environment like we have in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. They were very controversial in some cases, and I know my colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce will be talking, among other things, about the impact those zones had on the fishing industry, on the lives of many families and on the economies of many communities up along the coastline that hosts the Great Barrier Reef. They were controversial. They were subject to a lot of discussion, a lot of arguments, but they were eventually implemented by regulation in this parliament, and the regulation was never disallowed by this parliament, so they stood.
There was a lot of angst about the management of those zones—and, again, others will tell you about them in the course of the debate. But I want to briefly go to the issue of enforcement. Once these plans came in, there were a number—the figures vary—of charges laid against people who were alleged to have breached the rules for these new zones. In many cases, in accordance with the legislation, fines were imposed and convictions were recorded. Although some of those charged disputed they had done anything wrong, the general feeling was that if you have to go to court and have to engage a lawyer it will cost you an arm and a leg, and the fines were not thought to be particularly large, so a lot of people just let them go through to the keeper.
One person did challenge them many years after the event, and a court determined—and I speak very broadly here; I am not going into the detail—that determining someone’s position on the ocean via GPS was not a proper substantiation of their entry into a zone where they should not be, and the court ruled against the conviction in that instance. Now, if any others had decided to challenge those charges in court, they might have had the same result. But a lot of them did not, and that is understandable; it is very difficult at times to justify the financial burden of taking these issues to court.
However, many people—in fact, I would suggest, most people—did not realise that the offences with which they had been charged were indeed criminal offences, which had the result of giving them a criminal record. To that in itself you might say, ‘So what,’ although it does have some implications when applying for jobs. But it does have a more serious consequence in that we received reports that people convicted of these offences who applied for visas to foreign countries had been knocked back on the basis that they had a criminal conviction. This was far from the intention of the legislature, of the government, and, I am sure, even of the prosecutors when these offences were recorded. So there has been this unintended and quite serious consequence, a record of criminal conviction, for actions which, although they might have been offences, are a bit like speeding offences almost.
So as a result of a lot of work by my colleagues, particularly, I have to say, Senator Boswell, this issue was raised and we have been trying to work out how we can ameliorate the effects of these convictions. During estimates in May of this year I raised these issues with both the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, who deals with pardons, and the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, and sought their advice on how you can go about getting pardons. I want to be fair; I do not want to verbal them and say that they agreed that, yes, we should do this; but the answers I was given in estimates suggested to me that it was appropriate for these people to apply for pardons and that if applications for pardons were made they would be seriously considered. To that end, I put a proforma on my website, inviting people to use it as an application to the minister. I have no idea of the outcome; it is a matter between the convicted person and the minister. I have no idea how many applied or even whether they applied. Senator O’Brien, I think it was, mentioned yesterday that there were only four who had applied for pardons, and I accept that he is telling the truth on that. I understand, although this has not been confirmed, that none of those applications have been successfully dealt with or acceded to by the Minister for Home Affairs—but, again, I do not know that.
Anyhow, the coalition will move amendments to this act to try and ameliorate those very harsh and, I suggest, unintended consequences of convictions under section 38CA of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 by expunging the records of convictions. I say this deliberately to alert the government and the minor parties to the fact that I have circulated two amendments, the first of which will call for those who were convicted during that period, under that section, to receive a free and absolute pardon by the Governor-General in the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy. I would hope that that amendment will attract the support of the majority in this chamber and, indeed, in the other chamber. I have circulated an amendment to give other parties time to consider it, look at it and perhaps alert me if we have not covered all of the legal implications that adoption of that amendment might bring. In all fairness, to try and get to a result in this issue, I speak briefly about that now.
I also have what I would call a foreshadowed amendment. If for some reason the majority of the Senate is not prepared to go as far as a pardon, I have a foreshadowed amendment which asks that those convictions be treated as spent convictions, under part 7C of the Crimes Act, meaning that, although the convictions stand, the record of those conditions will be expunged from the record so that they do not have to be disclosed by anyone. Whether that will have an impact on foreign countries dealing with visa applications, I do not know—that is a matter for the law of other countries—but I think it is the best we can do. I hope the pardon amendment will receive favourable consideration; if not, there is a fallback position. I mention those openly in advance so that other parties, including Independents and the Greens, can have a look at those issues.
With those amendments, the coalition will be supporting the bill. As I mentioned earlier, and Senator Scullion will speak more about this, we hope that a committee of the parliament could have a closer look at the bill. I know Senator Joyce has concerns about some definitions, and he will no doubt tell the Senate about that later. It is something that could be looked a little more closely without interfering with the appropriate passage of the bulk of this bill, which I think all the parties do support.
In conclusion, I make the point that the Great Barrier Reef is part of our environmental heritage and it is part of who we are as Australians. It is our responsibility to protect it. All Australians—Indigenous and other Australians—are custodians of the reef and we have to play our part in ensuring that it is properly protected. The bill, as I said, introduced by the current government, has taken four or five years to draft and present to the parliament. Even after all that time, it still has issues that need to be further addressed, and they will be addressed by my colleagues in speaking to the bill. Ultimately, it is legislation which the coalition proposed and it has been adopted by the current government, with some amendments. It is the result of the desire of all of us to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef continues to be maintained in the best possible way. I commend the bill to the Senate and urge the Senate to seriously consider the amendments that I have foreshadowed for the bill.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-08-28,"—I want to bring to the attention of the Senate some of the issues that are contained in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 that have, I believe, serious consequences, not only for those involved with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority or those adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef but also for those who live adjacent to the coastline—in fact, adjacent to any fishing area—and those who have an interest in the law itself.
I just go back to the start of where GBRMPA comes from. As everybody knows, in 2002 the Democrats held the balance of power in the Senate. As a result, they negotiated an agreement which would allow the government to go ahead with the GST in return for a one-third closure of the reef and the removal of sulphur from diesel. The decision to close a large portion of the Great Barrier Reef was not based upon scientific or economic analysis; it was based upon a needs analysis and was based purely upon a deal. At that time the Great Barrier Reef was being fished at a level that was under one per cent of the UN’s recommended sustainable level. The level of fishing has reduced further since. The decision came at a cost to taxpayers of about $220 million when it was initially anticipated that it would cost GBRMPA about $2 million to pay out certain fishing licences and compensation.
The Barrier Reef bill, as it stands, still refers to the enjoyment of the area for social and economic activities. As such, you would suspect that it would still have recreational and commercial fishing as part of it. The reef is a huge renewable resource and, as it is adjacent to the people of North Queensland, it is absolutely vital that it not be turned into some sort of total exclusion zone, leaving those people totally isolated from one of their most important means of recreation. You have to remember that in this area there are stingers, which preclude a lot of people from swimming in the area. We have the effect of crocodiles in the estuarine area. If you take away the joy of fishing, you start to take away a whole means of recreation for those people. It would be like banning surfboards at Bondi Beach, but we have started to head towards it in this bill.
There are a couple of things that I find completely onerous in this piece of legislation, and I would like to bring three of them to the attention of the Senate in detail. The first is item 9 of schedule 6, an amendment to section 3(1) of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, which is the definition of ‘fishing’:

fishing means any of the following:
searching for, or taking, fish—
not actually catching it, but searching for a fish—
attempting to search for, or take, fish;
engaging in any other activities that can reasonably be expected to result in the locating of … fish;
placing, searching for or recovering fish aggregating devices or associated electronic equipment such as radio beacons;
any operations at sea directly in support of, or in preparation for, any activity described in this definition;
aircraft use relating to any activity described in this definition except flights in emergencies …
Let us just think about it. Let us take out the word ‘fishing’ and, for the sake of argument, put in the word ‘kissing’: ‘“Kissing” means any of the following: searching for a partner; attempting to search for a partner; engaging in any other activities that could reasonably be expected to locate a partner.’ You see how ridiculous, all-encompassing and onerous this definition is. It is not a case of catching somebody doing something wrong; it is a value judgement as to whether you think they are doing something wrong. It is a value judgement as to whether you consider that they might be going to do something wrong. Yet the Greens are going to support this, and this is the sort of stuff that would leave our terrorism laws for dead. This is an absolute ripper, where I can go up to you and determine that you might have a thought in your head that involves fishing, and therefore you may end up with a criminal conviction for what you thought.
I do not care if you take fishing away from this whole scenario. In that structure, this amendment to section 3(1) is onerous on its own and should be knocked out, not because of fishing but because it is a contemptible paragraph in our legislation books that I think should be struck out. If you make an excuse to put that sort of thought-police material into a piece of legislation, you have created the imprimatur for it to go into other places. That is one of the concerns that have worried me deeply about this legislation, and I expressed the same to the joint party room the other day. I really wonder if even the Greens agree with this piece of legislation. If they and other members in this chamber agree with this amendment to section 3(1), they should be called to account, especially if, at a later stage, they find contentious other things that regard the security of the nation and that would possibly mimic that. You can all see the sort of mimicry that could be attached to that with regard to terrorism offences, and you can see how we leave ourselves wide open in an area which we should be ever vigilant against—that is, the area of thought police.
This idea of the thought police is further enhanced in item 12 of schedule 1, another amendment to section 3(1) of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, with the so-called precautionary principle:

precautionary principle means the principle that lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing a measure to prevent degradation of the environment where there are threats of serious or irreversible … damage.
All of the end sounds flowery and wonderful, but the front end of that clause is the part that stings. It means that the principle is that lack of full scientific certainty—that is like saying ‘lack of full evidence’—or lack of the capacity to prove an issue is a reason to convict. The precautionary principle is not precautionary; it is dangerous. If you cannot prove something on environmental or socioeconomic grounds, you cannot just say, ‘Because I have an inherent fear, it is an issue.’ I think that is something that is of major concern, and that is a part of the drafting of this legislation which should, at the very least, be the subject of an inquiry and of wider discussion and ventilation so that the people of Queensland and the Australian people in general can have their say about this issue.
I was disappointed—given that we talk about the process of the Senate, respecting the Senate and all these things—that, when there was an inquiry suggested before, it was knocked out. It never got through. Why? Because the Greens did not vote for it. The Greens, the people who put themselves up as the arbiters and protectors of freedom, voted against an inquiry. It is amazing how the worm turns. The Greens voted against an inquiry that would, in essence, deal very seriously with the issue of the insertion of the thought police into our legislation. It is an interesting world we live in. The Greens voted against an inquiry that would talk about a section of the legislation amending the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to create section 61AEA, ‘Directions limiting access to Marine Park’. This is the so-called ‘three strikes and you’re out’ clause.
Legislation similar to this would suggest that, if you were caught committing three driving offences, you would not be allowed to drive a car again ever. That is the sort of legislation that is currently being devised in this chamber, and it is going to go to the Australian people without an inquiry and without any further discussion. I want to read to you some information on the criminals we are catching with this sort of legislation:
Fact: D was a master of a vessel with one passenger. He was fishing but didn’t catch anything. A passenger, his grandson, was not fishing. He was aware of the zoning but couldn’t understand it. He did not own a zoning map. He thought he was in the right zone to fish. That man ended up with a $1,000 fine and a criminal conviction.
There must be something wrong with that. Surely that rings a bell somewhere. Surely the punishment should be something similar to a speeding ticket rather than a criminal conviction. That gentleman now could be precluded from obtaining a passport. That is the sort of legislation that the Greens do not want an inquiry into. We must be completely vigilant about this. We are going to make another attempt to get an inquiry into this issue. We are going to make another attempt to see whether the Greens have an issue with the thought police. We are going to make another attempt to see whether the Greens believe that a grandfather and his grandson should get a criminal conviction for accidentally fishing in an area. It was probably just adjacent to the coast where the grandfather lives. We are going to make another attempt to find out whether the Greens want an inquiry into the ‘three strikes and you’re out’ clause. We will make another attempt to find out whether the Greens believe in the precautionary principle—that is, the so-called ‘even if you can’t prove it, it doesn’t matter’ principle.
This is so important. If we let this legislation pass here it will become the legislation for Tasmania, it will become the legislation for Western Australia, it will become the legislation for other fishing grounds and it will become the premise for the creation of other like legislation for other areas. I do not know whether this should go to the Senate environment committee; I think it should go to the legal and constitutional committee. They should look at it in the area of, ‘Look at what we’ve devised today.’
We have to see this for what it is. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is a park, not a zoo. For tens of thousands of years there has been interaction between the people living adjacent to the reef and the resources of the reef. I will also inform the Senate that some of the people who have been convicted were convicted when they were teaching their sons to spear fish, so we are looking at something that involves members of the Indigenous community. We have changed the whole nature and concept of the way the Great Barrier Reef has worked for tens of thousands of years. We in the south have, by our own mechanisms, made a decision for another part of our nation that probably has not taken in—in any way, shape or form—the reality, the custom and the practice of how the reef has worked.
It is going to be an interesting vote, and I hope that those who are following the debate know that this is not just a debate about the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. This will be a vote about jurisprudence, about a new direction in law. When onerous clauses like this come into our legislation there is always a noble purpose. There is always a wonderful purpose as to why we should put greater caveats on the freedom of the individual. That is so much so now that we are putting caveats on how people think. It will be interesting to see whether those who in the past have risen in this chamber as ardent protectors of a greater breadth of freedom and have admonished laws, especially around things such as terrorism, will in the same breath—and this is not so much about whether they vote for a law that is about thought police—not allow a committee of inquiry to discuss it further.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-08-28,"—The time is short—in fact, there are probably only two minutes—but I will endeavour to fill in that time. It is very good to follow Senator Macdonald and Senator Joyce. They both analysed this legislation very well and indicated primarily that this is a path we should not be going down. Some time ago the coalition decided that they would do a review of this legislation, and that was done on 14 December 2006. Prior to that, this legislation was introduced after GBRMPA came around and saw members of parliament. It said to them: ‘We only want 25 per cent of the reef. Yes, we’ll put in these biodiversity zones and zones that people aren’t to fish in. Don’t worry about it, Senator Boswell. We’ll look after you. We’ll go and talk to all the fishing people. We’ll find the particular areas where they fish and we’ll let fishing continue.’ So everyone was lulled into a false sense of security.
I took GBRMPA at its word, which is the worst thing I ever did. That was the biggest mistake I have made in this parliament. When the maps came out, we found some terrible failures of GBRMPA to honour their commitments to the fishing industry and the amateur fishermen. They took 33 or 35 per cent of the reef. We were then forced to go and reduce the fishing effort, because you cannot lose a 35 per cent area and still have the same effort.

I refer to Minister Ferguson’s spokesman’s comments on Woodside’s possible investigation by the ACCC as reported in the Australian yesterday.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-08-28,"—Thirty years ago a few companies got a tax exemption for condensate. I repeat: that was 30 years ago. That proposition is no longer needed and is now delivering windfall gains not available to anyone else. These are windfall gains that belong to the Australian people. After 30 years of this tax exemption, the North West Shelf project is now mature and profitable, and the companies benefiting from this concession are enjoying huge profits from rising international oil prices. There are members opposite—Liberals opposite—who seem to care more about the windfall profits that are gained from one project than they do about lowering inflation and interest rates for working families who are doing it tough. For example, the windfall gain between 2001-02 and 2006-07 was around $1.4 billion and would now, on present-day figures, be even higher. If Woodside had paid the condensate tax this year their profit would have been $950 million instead of $1 billion. That is still $340 million more than its profit this time last year.
The proposition is simply this: the measure that the government has proposed removes a tax exemption for condensate which is not, as was stated yesterday, a tax on gas. Those opposite have been told this measure will not be putting up gas prices. The CEO of the North West Shelf Venture told the Senate: ‘Our current domestic contracts are in place and will be honoured—and that is for many, many years; they are long-term contracts.’ The Treasury have made it clear to the Senate Economics Committee that they do not expect there to be any impact on prices outside those contracts.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1,answer
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-08-28,"—The position, as I have outlined, is that there are long-term contracts in place which Woodside said it will honour. This was a particular exemption given to Woodside effectively over 30 years ago which only a few companies were able to attract and is no longer needed.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2008-08-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cash today relating to the proposed condensate tax and the North West Shelf project.
There are very, very few business operations in this country that could deal with and survive a $2.5 billion tax take over four years without notice. In fact, you could probably count them on one hand. This government has perpetrated the most direct picking of the pockets of Western Australians in Federation history. This company, Woodside, on the North West Shelf, and its joint venture partners have absolutely no alternative but to pass on this $2.5 billion slug. The only recipients of its domestic gas supplies are the people—including the mums and dads, and the pensioners—of Western Australia. They will be paying for this slug from Canberra. There is absolutely no doubt.
Can I say that, since the Varanus Island crisis, whereby the gas supplies to Perth were seriously reduced by virtue of a fire, Woodside has had to increase its output of domestic gas into the Perth market to make up for the shortfall. There is a shortfall of gas, and Western Australia is more dependent on energy generated by gas than any other state. Accordingly, the people of Western Australia are going to have to foot the bill for this tax slug. You cannot attack the bottom line, the balance sheet, of any corporate entity’s operational project without expecting them to pass it on. The really important issue is that, in every boardroom and on the desk of every CEO of every large oil and gas developer and explorer there has been a massive shudder, because until now our great country was viewed as a reliable sovereign risk in competing with Qatar, Kazakhstan, African countries and South-East Asian countries—but no longer.
Two very important things have happened in the very short nine months that the Rudd government have had the chequebook. They have single-handedly and successfully undermined Australia’s international reputation as a safe haven for large investment projects. Where in the world would you, without notice, see a government on a budget night simply go to a project, saying, ‘We’re taking $2.5 billion out of your bottom line, and you are also going to have to deal with our emissions trading scheme and we’re not going to provide you with any comfort in terms of you being a trade affected industry.’
Liquid natural gas is the best way to immediately reduce our carbon emissions. It is the best way to reduce the carbon emissions of China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. And what have we done? We have done the same as we are doing to the rail industry: we are giving it no assistance in the face of this green paper. So on two fronts, to the boardrooms in the United States, Japan, Europe and China, we are saying: Australia is now very questionable as a reliable place to build oil and gas projects. We have over $100,000 billion of investment on the table for places like Gorgon and Browse, projects at the North West Shelf. Investment in this country has stalled since this government was elected.
—It’s at record levels and you know it.
—It has absolutely stalled. It has stalled because the boardrooms of these companies have no possibility of working out what their cashflow bottom line is, given the question mark of an emissions trading scheme and given the conduct of this government.
—Rubbish. There are record investments coming into this country and you know it.
—This government is a group of people who just see a cash cow and reach their hand in and grab it—a most dishonest—

Senator Mark Bishop interjecting—

—And a senator from Western Australia is defending them. Of course, that is the problem: there is no proper representation in this place from the government, from Western Australia. That is the issue. They have not stood up for us for one second and, accordingly, these tax-hungry Labor politicians from Canberra—(Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-08-28,"—I rise in response to the taking note motion by the opposition. I start by saying that this opposition failed when it was in government to move this country forward in terms of productivity, innovation and excellence. It never really had a grip on actually managing this country to the best of its ability. It showed that today in question time when it was not even able to get its ducks in a row and ask questions properly to us here in government. It wasted question time like it wasted its many, many years in government. Not only that, it either did not know the standing orders or refused to abide by the standing orders by seeking leave to ask a question of the chair of the economics committee. It really goes to show that the people in opposition, and rightly so, do not really have a handle on what is best for this country. I would have thought question time would be an ideal opportunity to ask questions of the minister, and if you choose to ask questions of committee chairpersons at least do the Senate the courtesy of abiding by the standing orders. We had question time wasted today, like we have had years in government wasted by the Liberal and National parties.
But we cannot have it both ways. The Liberal Party cannot have it both ways if it wants to raise this issue. Let me just put on the table some facts for people about this whole propensity that goes to the fact that Western Australian families will be paying higher gas prices, which is not right and is quite contrary to what happened some years ago. Thirty years ago, we had a few companies getting a tax exemption for condensate that is no longer needed. It delivered them windfall gains not available to anyone else. An agreement was struck 30 years ago on a tax exemption that applied then and still applies now. These are windfall gains that actually belong to the Australian people.
After 30 years of this tax exemption, the North West Shelf project is now mature and profitable—in fact, extremely profitable—and the companies benefiting from this concession, particularly Woodside, are enjoying huge profits from rising international oil prices. It is quite evident from the questioning today from the Liberal and National parties on the other side of this chamber that they care much more about the windfalls gained from one project than about lowering inflation and about interest rate rises that affect families who are doing it tough. They choose to waste their question time asking us questions about this, which is really not an issue that needs to concern us if you have a look at the history and the facts. The windfall gain between 2001-02 and 2006-07 was around $1.4 billion and would be even higher now. So, if Woodside had paid condensate tax this year, its profit would have been not $1 billion but $950 million. That is still $340 million more than its profit at this time last year.
Let me say that this measure removes a tax exemption for condensate. It is not a tax on gas. Those opposite have been told that this measure will not put up gas prices but, of course, they will not believe or accept it and want to raise this as an issue when it is not an issue. Even the CEO of the North West Shelf Venture told the Senate that our current domestic contracts are in place and will be honoured. The contracts are all for many, many years and are long-term contracts. The Treasury told people on the public record, at the Senate Standing Committee on Economics hearing in Canberra on 11 August, that they would not expect it to have an impact. In case anyone is starry eyed about these companies, back in 2001 there was a tax cut worth $460 million that was not passed on as lower prices to consumers. You cannot have it both ways. This government believes that it is fair enough to have incentives to get major resource projects up and running, but once they are up and running the Australian people must have fair value from them, and we make no apologies for making sure that that happens. As everyone knows, there is no justification for Woodside to claim that domestic prices will increase as a result of this tax, and the ACCC, under the Trade Practices Act, has the power to investigate prices and anticompetitive conduct.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-08-28,"—Congratulations, Mr Deputy President, on your election. Gas seems to be the theme of what we are talking about in taking note of questions today, and I would like to speak about gas issues coming from the federal government and gas issues affecting the state Labor government in Western Australia. Senator Johnston talked about the impact of the decision to impose a tax generating $2.5 billion in revenue on condensate as it affected Woodside. It is absolute nonsense for Senator Crossin—who, I see, is fleeing from the chamber—to suggest that an impost of $2.5 billion on any company could not be passed back to the consumers and customers that that company serves. It is total nonsense to think that Woodside could do anything but plan to pass on that $2.5 billion impost, which has come out of the blue in the first budget of the Rudd government.
As Senator Johnston said, this is a breach of a financial agreement. There is no doubt at all that, when the North West Shelf project was set up, the agreement was that Woodside would be exempted from condensate tax as a means of helping the project get underway. In return, I understand, the joint venture partners said that they would provide gas at cost price, or a low price, to the domestic consumers of Western Australia. The federal government appears to have broken one side of the bargain, so in view of this decision of the federal government I do not see anything wrong at all with Woodside charging increased prices for the gas that they supply to domestic customers in Western Australia.
Senator Johnston talked about the fact that there was a sovereign risk matter in this decision. Australia has always had a great reputation as a very safe place to invest and a place where government agreements would be honoured. This decision undermines that reputation, and I think the Rudd government should hang their heads in shame for having been the government which broke the reputation of Australia as being a good country for sovereign risk.
We now have a situation where, contrary to all that the ALP said about their greenhouse credentials, they are going to tax condensate, which is a relatively greenhouse-friendly energy source compared to many others. It seems to me to be a little bit inconsistent that this government should be imposing this tax on condensate.
The other matter which I want to refer to is the Varanus gas explosion in the north-west of Western Australia and the total and utter incompetence of the Carpenter government in Western Australia in dealing with this terrible event, which the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia estimates will have cost the Western Australian economy no less than $6.7 billion when all costs are assessed and when the gas is restored. The story of the Varanus Island gas explosion is very much a story of incompetence by the Carpenter government. This incompetence covers the failure of the government to heed warnings. The Carpenter government was given warnings by the Department of Industry and Resources in Western Australia according to Elizabeth Gosch, writing in the Australian on 13 August. There were repeated ‘warnings that Apache Energy was not complying with safety standards at its Varanus Island facility’, and the Department of Industry and Resources was asked to write to the operators of that facility asking them to carry out inspections on their facility.
That was not done. The Carpenter government failed to provide an alternative supply of energy in Western Australia, even though they knew that the gas pipeline could be compromised. They were incompetent in the way they dealt with the matter and have sought to delay the report on the explosion, which was due on 27 August, until after the state election. Politics comes into this because the Carpenter government have got a lot to hide. But they will not be able to escape the consequences of this. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-08-28,"—Mr Deputy President, before making a contribution to this discussion, let me offer my best wishes to you on having been elected Deputy President of the Senate. It is no mean feat to retain the support of your party room both as President and as Deputy President, so I give my best wishes to you for the duration of your term.
Having opened with those pleasantries, let us now turn to Senator Johnston’s motion. I think the first question to ask is this: who are the owners of the North West Shelf project? From memory, the three principal companies that have been involved in the development and exploitation of that project for many years are Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and Japan LPG. There are one or two other foreign companies, but they have been the mainstays of the operation for the best part of 25 years. If one looked at their balance sheets from any time in the last 20 years, you would see that each of those companies is well capitalised, is well diversified and has continuously given exceptionally high returns to shareholders over many years. Indeed, when you break it up further and go into the bowels of their annual reports, you will see that the returns from the North West Shelf project for many years have been a significant contributor to the welfare of those companies.
One only has to look at how well major companies—in the resources, infrastructure and finance sectors—in this country are doing. Over the last two or three weeks we have had annual reports from BHP Billiton, Rio, Woodside, Woolworths, CBA and ANZ, to name a few. Without exception each of those companies has been in a high investment phase, a high return phase and a high growth phase. Business is doing well in this country and will continue to do well under the Rudd Labor government. Resource companies in particular—whether they be BHP, Rio, Woodside or any of the whole range of juniors in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory—are doing well under the regime that allows exploitation and development of natural resources. In that context it is fair to note that yesterday’s profit result from Woodside—from memory—was up by over 80 per cent on the previous year. The figure of more than $1 billion is extraordinarily welcome, and I am sure it will be very welcome to their shareholders when they pass on the dividend in the next month or so. Clearly, from those introductory remarks, Australia is a wonderful place for business to invest. It is a wonderful place to invest. It has been for many of the past years and continues to be, particularly in the resources sector in the key states of Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and, increasingly, the Northern Territory.
Let us now turn to the issues raised by previous speakers. One must observe that the issue of condensate and of whether or not Woodside want to pay the extra figures to the government is being highlighted for one reason and one reason only—that is, up until Saturday week we are in the process of a four-yearly election campaign in Western Australia. For some unknown reason the opposition seem to be of the view that they can make some headway on this issue when they did nothing in the 10 to 12 years they were in government. Senator Johnston referred to sovereign risk. Apparently sovereign risk is attacked when a government imposes a new or a different tax regime on a particular industry or company. I happen to recall that last October and November both major parties went to the people promising fundamental change in the areas of emissions trading regimes and carbon taxes, and both major parties gave an undertaking that there would be consequent financial and structural changes introduced which would have an immediate impact on companies.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-08-28,"—I wish to take note of the answer given by Senator Carr to the very good question from Senator Cash in relation to the tax grab on the North West Shelf joint venture project. At the outset, when Senator Carr attempted to rewrite history, we should note what the CEO of Woodside said. Mr Don Voelte said in an announcement:
This is not a loophole which is being closed, or a free ride which has come to an end. This is a negotiated fiscal arrangement which formed the basis of Australia’s largest resource development ...
Over 31 years there has been a regime in place where royalties, excise and taxes have been paid quite properly. This government has without notice moved those goalposts and said to the industry, ‘You now have a $2.5 billion tax.’ One can only imagine how that affected potential investors in LNG, oil and other resource projects in Australia. There is a projected increase of 83 per cent in demand for LNG in the Pacific basin. Right in the middle of that, we are well placed to provide those resources. But we will not be able to if people think that Australia has a government that will change the goalposts. Indeed, APPEA, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, in evidence likened that to an act more in line with those of the governments of Venezuela and Trinidad. So at the outset we sent a clear message to people: do not invest in Australia.
More important is the fact that this will be passed on to the consumer and it will increase gas prices in Western Australia. Gas, of course, is used for the generation of electricity. We will see electricity costs rising across the board and average Western Australians will be affected by this cost for essential power. We only have to think of pensioners and those who are least able to afford this increase to realise the impact that it will have on the community in Western Australia.
The question by Senator Cash related to the statement by the spokesman for the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Ferguson. That statement was reported today as saying that any price increase by the North West Shelf venture partners to offset the loss of the condensate subsidy could justify an ACCC action. That is an outrageous attempt to stand over a group of companies that have brought wealth and employment to this country and have given Australia the sound economic base which we enjoy today.
We have to ask: is the minister threatening an ACCC investigation if the joint venture partners pass on an increase in their costs? He is part of a government which has just imposed $2.5 billion of tax on them. Is he now saying that he will send them off to the ACCC to investigate that passing on of the cost? Mr Ferguson himself has said that the North West Shelf partners jointly market between 60 and 70 per cent of WA’s domestic gas. Presumably he is alleging that the decision to pass on the cost of the loss of the subsidy somehow amounts to a price-fixing arrangement. Is he saying that under section 45A(2) of the Trade Practices Act this is a matter which requires investigation? Similarly, is he saying that the decision to pass on the costs of the tax being imposed on industry is something else which should be investigated?
If this is not what he is suggesting, he must clarify what issues he would be asking the ACCC to investigate and he has to outline exactly to the resources industry of this country whether this government is pro development of resources for the benefit of all Australians or whether it is about imposing on the resources industry a tax which will not only be inflationary but impede further important investment in this country.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2008-08-28,"—I seek to make some remarks in relation to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee’s report on peacekeeping. I am aware that other senators have made contributions in relation to the report but as the deputy chair of the committee I want to make my own set of observations.
The committee undertook this inquiry in the context of two very important trends in international affairs. The first was Australia’s own very extensive contribution to peacekeeping activities over a long period of time. Indeed, Australia’s experience here reaches back 60-odd years to 1947. Throughout that period of time we have had a regular involvement in peacekeeping activities in various places around the world over various periods of time and in a range of different kinds of guises using various elements of Australia’s capacity. We now still have 11 peacekeeping missions around the world and so we have made over a long period a very considerable contribution to peacekeeping as an activity of the international community.
The second broad trend which I think prompted the committee’s inquiry is the intensity of peacekeeping activities virtually since the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War provided an opportunity for the United Nations to reassert itself as an element or an instrument of peacekeeping, and we have seen over the last 10 to 15 years that the United Nations has sought to exercise that opportunity. It has declined somewhat in recent years but there has been an intensity in relation to the United Nations’ peacekeeping activities which has been one of the foundations of examining Australia’s own role in peacekeeping. These particular realities have been the foundations for this inquiry.
We received a relatively small number of submissions to the inquiry but they were, I think, of uniformly high quality. The consequence of that was that it has enabled the committee to make a very comprehensive set of findings with regard to peacekeeping activities. Indeed, we have examined the whole plethora in a report that was rather more extensive, perhaps, than I anticipated it might be when we began the inquiry. We have ended up with a report of some 375 pages with 38 recommendations, and because the report is so thoroughly comprehensive it is almost impossible to deal with it at any length in the time that is permitted to me. But I do commend it to the Senate because I think it covers a range of issues which are of vital importance to Australia’s security and certainly of critical interest to those who have an interest in the peacekeeping activity.
Perhaps I could just take the opportunity to mention a couple of issues that I think are of importance. The first of these is that the inquiry discovered that peacekeeping was an increasingly complicated activity. In the early years of peacekeeping it was often an activity that took place in the context of two states that had a conflict and had been separated for a period of time. A peacekeeping force was injected between them to lay the foundations for, perhaps, further peace negotiations and a settlement further on.
Today, 40, 50 or 60 years on from that, we are in an environment where they are not just military activities. In fact, they are increasingly anything but military activities. They often involve the fortunes of failed or failing states and they are not just matters of military interest; they frequently involve questions of economics, of social structure and of aid activity. That is certainly true of some of the peacekeeping activities in which Australia is engaged in—in the Solomons, for example.
So they are increasingly complicated activities for any state that seeks to involve itself in peacekeeping activities. This means that mounting a peacekeeping operation is an increasingly complicated exercise. It is complicated from the perspective of the state in organising the elements of the force which will contribute to peacekeeping, but it is also complicated from the perspective of undertaking the peacekeeping mission itself.
The inquiry looked very closely at the range of new dimensions to peacekeeping. One of its encouraging conclusions, I think, was that Australia had adapted very effectively to the challenges that it now confronts as it becomes engaged in peacekeeping activities. The coordination of Australian agencies and the bureaucracy is very effective, the resources that are deployed to peacekeeping missions are substantial and the institutions that are involved in peacekeeping have adapted to the challenges. An example is the Australian Federal Police, where the International Deployment Group has become a very important element of the way in which Australia can respond to the challenges of peacekeeping. And, indeed, in AusAID, a new division, the Fragile States Division, reflects something of that change.
The second broad area I wanted to touch on relates to the particular challenge that peacekeeping poses for military establishments. In the early years this was a pretty straightforward situation. Peacekeeping activities required some kind of military intervention and states that were prepared to contribute used their military forces, which were generally structured around high-end missions in relation to the use of lethal force. They inserted those forces into those situations and they had virtually little alternative but to use that high-end lethal force capability. As peacekeeping activities have increased, military forces have increasingly looked at the need for, perhaps, doctrinal change or structural changes to force structures.
I think the general consensus of the inquiry is that, where countries have chosen to structure a force around peacekeeping particularly, it has been ineffective. Australia has resisted that choice and I think the committee was unanimously of the view that that was the correct decision for Australia. We support the decision that Australia continue to structure its defence forces around a very wide spectrum of missions, which includes high-end use of lethal force down to what might be called the low-end missions closer to which peacekeeping occurs.
The challenge for any military force, however, is how long it can engage in peacekeeping activities over a long period of time when it has a need for military forces for other deployments and activities. It seems to me that this is probably an activity that is going to require continuing investigation by military forces and, I think, by Australia’s military forces. We should resist any temptation we might have to restructure the Australian military establishment or the force structure around peacekeeping activities, but I think we need to be alert to the possibility that, if peacekeeping activities are going to be an increasingly important part of the demands on the Australian military establishment, we might have to make more comprehensive arrangements for providing those force deployments.
The final thing I will mention is the need for increased understanding of the challenging nature of peacekeeping. Australia has a peacekeeping centre at Williamtown, but the new Asia Pacific Centre for Civil-Military Cooperation ought to be a foundation for expanding our deeper understanding of peacekeeping operations, for developing doctrine, for research, for training and for engaging with other countries that have similarly engaged in peacekeeping activities and, indeed, have peacekeeping centres around the world.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-08-28,"—Despite not being a member of the class of 2004, may I add my support for Senator McEwen’s comments about your new position, Madam Acting Deputy President Fierravanti-Wells. I appreciate that people have other engagements and other places to be, but I wanted to speak as soon as I had the opportunity regarding a visit I made to the Torres Strait region during the winter recess. As a Queenslander and as an elected representative of Queensland, I am ashamed to say that I had never visited our Torres Strait islands until after my election nine months ago.
During the November 2007 election campaign, I first had the opportunity to spend a short time in the Torres Strait. But during the winter recess I made an opportunity to return to this very remote part of Australia. The Torres Strait islands are just five kilometres from Papua New Guinea waters and they are 80 kilometres from Indonesia. The islands are now administered by two councils: the Torres Strait Islands Regional Council, covering the 15 outer islands of the strait, and the Torres Shire Council, which covers the most populous islands—Thursday Island, Horne Island and Prince of Wales Island.
Almost 9,000 people call the Torres Strait islands home. It is one of the most geographically scattered and remote areas of Australia. Because of its position, the Torres Strait plays an important strategic and quarantine role for the rest of the country, but from the attention the Torres Strait receives from the Queensland state government and from the federal government you certainly would not know it. On one interisland ferry trip recently, a Victorian tourist, kicking back, basking in the wonderful warmth and the great views, commented: ‘You might as well be in another country.’ The trouble is the state and federal Labor governments seem to take the same view, that the Torres Strait is another country. There is chronic underfunding of services and training at almost every level.
The biggest scandal currently existing in the Torres Strait relates to the state government’s shameless use of CDEP—Community Development Employment Projects—funding to save on their wages bill for the Torres Strait. As senators would be aware, the CDEP is designed to assist unemployed Indigenous Australians transition to work and to undertake training that will assist them in working. But, in the Torres Strait, the Bligh state government are using CDEP funds to save themselves millions in wages. Of the 1,800 people employed by the two local councils of the Torres Strait, 417 receive CDEP funding with a top-up of their wages from the state government. This means that there are 417 Torres Strait workers doing the work of state government agencies and departments but their wages are being subsidised by CDEP funding. I was told by island leaders that, if an island community needs a full-time teacher’s aide, Education Queensland will say to them, ‘We’ll fund the position for two days a week, but tell the community to request CDEP funding for the other three days.’ I was told that CDEP funds subsidise the state government’s wages bill to the tune of $6 million a year.
Apart from this shameless approach, there are also the savings the government make by the fact that they do not pay superannuation costs and other on-costs associated with paying proper, full-time wages to these people undertaking state government work. CDEP employees in the Torres Strait who are providing basic services include teaching staff, health workers and community police—the only police on most islands. It is not a situation that would be countenanced in mainstream Queensland or the rest of Australia and it is a situation that I believe the Bligh state Labor government should be ashamed of. But, of course, the government seems to treat the Torres Strait as though it has a different set of rules, with a lower standard for the people of the Torres Strait.
Many of the people who are on the CDEP subsidised wages have been training for years without any chance of being given a real job by the state government unless they leave the Torres Strait. I was told that the police senior sergeant at Yorke Island had been in a CDEP position for more than 10 years and that he had been put in that position as part of a pilot program to look at improving policing on the island. A pilot program for 10 years—I think perhaps the state Labor government may have been able to work out by now whether that was successful and to pay and train properly and decently the people who serve the communities in the Torres Strait. Most of the island community police positions, as I said, are occupied by CDEP funded staff, with little opportunity for any one of them to gain real policing positions. Every island leader I spoke to raised the need for fully and appropriately trained police to deal with the issues that arise in the Torres Strait, but their requests fall constantly on deaf ears.
Despite the shocking neglect in this area, the most pressing issue of all that was raised by all the leaders I spoke to in the Torres Strait was the cost of living. On Thursday Island I did my own spot survey comparing the prices of a basket of groceries in August in the Thursday Island supermarket with the cost of that same basket of groceries in Cairns. I have a ShopSmart website that looks at prices in regional centres in Queensland. In Cairns the ShopSmart basket of groceries cost $64. On Thursday Island the cost for that same basket of groceries was $91. I think that is a small indication of the extreme costs that people in the Torres Strait bear. You cannot find out any of this, of course, by looking at the government’s GROCERYchoice website because they give you the average price of goods from Mount Isa to Cape York to Cairns. It does not tell you much about costs of living in other centres.
Broadband also is almost non-existent in the Torres Strait, strangling private business initiatives. At Horn Island the private aircraft enterprises told me that it sometimes takes them up to eight hours to download tenders that they need to apply for to keep their businesses going. The lack of broadband also undermines council attempts to introduce efficiencies. The councils have now, as I said, been merged. You have 15 councils using dial-up trying to get pays done on Thursday Island on the same day. What it means often is that people are paid up to two days late on some islands because of the time involved in processing the pays.
There are many other examples of contributions to the high cost of living in the Torres Strait. I will not speak of those here. Local leaders have asked me to push for an inquiry into the complex factors affecting the cost of living in the Torres Strait. They suggest that perhaps a freight and passenger subsidy similar to the one that delivers $140 million a year to Tasmania might assist. We are ignoring and neglecting these 9,000 people. It is at the hands of the state Labor government that this is primarily happening. This is 48,000 square kilometres, an area bigger than Tasmania. It is an important strategic and quarantine area. They deserve better than they are currently getting. (Time expired)
