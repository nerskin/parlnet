"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-09-08,"—I ask that general business notice of motion No. 240 as amended, relating to reproductive health services, be taken as a formal motion.
—Is there any objection to the motion as amended?
—Yes.
—There is an objection.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-09-08,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Allison from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 240.
I am not altogether sure why there would be an objection to this motion being taken as formal. Notice was given of it and I have not received any indication from Senator Boswell, who has objected, that there is a problem with it. I will work through that motion. It says:
That the Senate—
recognises that the United Nations (UN) Secretary General’s report on achieving the Millennium Development Goals, In larger freedom, calls on governments to ensure universal access to reproductive health services;
acknowledges that in January 2005 the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reaffirmed the vision of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) for human development, social justice, economic progress and environmental preservation and called on the international community, national governments and private philanthropic organisations to prioritise the ICPD Program of Action; and
recognises that access to sexual and reproductive health is also a critical strategy towards achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment, the third of the Millennium Development Goals.
Why we should not pass this motion in this place at this time is hard to understand. We have all been talking a great deal about poverty this week. We are very much aware that it is important for the Millennium Development Goals to be achieved and for sexual and reproductive health to be part of that, particularly for women. In places where there is poor reproductive health for women, it is almost impossible to achieve any reduction in poverty. This is not just a question of reproductive health but of sexual health as well. It embraces a whole range of areas such as HIV and women’s ability to manage and be part of their economic development. As the motion indicates, the Prime Minister himself has reaffirmed the need for sexual and reproductive health to be part of these Millennium Development Goals.
We hope that the Prime Minister will go the UN conference and that this will be part of his speech. It is my understanding that it is likely that he will go. This will be a great step forward, both for women and for alleviating poverty world wide. This is critically important. I attended a conference in Strasbourg in October last year on this very subject and there is global support for us acknowledging how important it us that sexual and reproductive health be part of those Millennium Development Goals.
It would be very disappointing if this motion was not supported, because the eyes of women everywhere are upon parliaments right round the world. They want to see this important phrase expressed in the Millennium Development Goals. This is not just symbolic; this is about the way that services are delivered. There is no doubt in my mind that if this is not achieved we will do very little to alleviate poverty world wide.
I am hoping that this motion is allowed to be put as formal. As I say, it will be a very important statement on the part of the Senate. As I understand it, a similar statement will be made in the House of Representatives. The group on population and development has endorsed this approach and has worked very hard to this point to see that it is included in the kinds of statements that our Prime Minister and this place make. I want to emphasis the importance of this going to the vote and of this vote being successful. I want to indicate, too, that Mr Downer’s office has just this morning given us his support for this statement and that it is critically important that it is made.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-09-08,"—I want to make the point that this amendment was circulated about one minute after we came into this place. Let me make this clear so there can be no misunderstanding: if you vote for this resolution, you are voting for abortion on demand. That is the decision that everyone has to make. This is the moment of truth for many people. Recognise that the UN Secretary-General’s report on achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the report In larger freedom call on governments to ensure universal access to reproductive health services. There is no doubt about it: this is abortion on demand. Anyone who votes for this motion will be voting for abortion on demand.
I put questions on notice and we found out that there are 91,000 abortions per year in Australia. That is one abortion for every two live births. Everyone, even the most ardent pro-abortionist, would suggest that that is far too many. Now we are being called upon by the Democrats to vote for abortion on demand.
—The motion has the support of the minister.
—I am sorry; I do not care who says this: I am not voting for abortion on demand. I object to this coming in five minutes after the start of the Senate. It does not give anyone the opportunity to debate it; it does not give anyone the opportunity to take it back to the party room.
—Then why don’t we debate it?
—I am debating it now, clown.
—Vote for the motion and then we can have a full debate.
—I am certainly not supporting this motion, Senator Brown, and I do not think many people want to support it. This is an ambush. It was brought into this place five minutes after we started. It has never been to any party room. At least we should have a conscience vote on it if we are going to have a vote.
I do not believe this resolution reflects the true meaning of what was voted for in the United Nations. I have done some research on it. With five minutes to go, I certainly have not got the ability to explain what the resolution really said and really meant. This is an abbreviation of what it did say, and I do not think it deserves the support of the people who have gone out there and said to the people, ‘If you elect us to the parliament, then we will stand for pro family values.’ I know many of us down here have to change and have to move. In a coalition, there is give and take. That will always be there. But there are some areas that are no go, and this is one of those areas. If you want to debate it, we can debate it more fully. But I certainly will not be a party to supporting this motion.
—A point that I wish to make before the debate proceeds is that the motion moved by Senator Allison is a motion to give precedence to the consideration of a debate of this issue. I draw that to the attention of the people who are participating in the debate.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2005-09-08,"—I am astounded that there is any opposition to this particular motion being made formal and being voted on immediately. There is some urgency with regard to this matter because of the impending meeting relating to the Millennium Development Goals and it is essential that we express a view on this.
I am shocked that Senator Boswell is so unaware of the AIDS pandemic that is spreading across the world. He should get on a plane and go to Africa right now. He talks about family values. He should go down the streets in Johannesburg; he should go down the streets in Durban. He would then see all the children who are without parents because they have died of AIDS. Go into the large areas in Africa where you have huge game parks that have no rangers left because they have all died of AIDS. Talk to the grandmothers who now have to bring up families when there is no capacity for them to do so. The whole culture is on its knees because the middle generation is dying of AIDS.
Go down to a cinema in Canberra and have a look at the documentary showing there right now called Darwin’s Nightmare and look at what is happening to those communities around Lake Victoria, where the women and their families are dying of AIDS. Why are they dying? They are dying because of the dislocation of their economic system by virtue of the trading in arms, with arms flying in from Europe and fish being flown out. Communities are dying. Women are driven to prostitution. The spread of AIDS is unmanageable. Listen to Nelson Mandela. He stands up all the time and talks about the crisis in Africa, and the crisis is the AIDS pandemic.
If we do not stand up in this Senate and support the women, children and families of the world who are struggling at this very moment to deal with the AIDS crisis, then I do not know what we are doing as legislators taking on national and global responsibility. That is what this motion is about. It is also about the families in PNG and the Solomon Islands. AIDS is spreading rapidly in our region. It is not just happening in Africa; it is happening throughout the world. Unless we can educate people about sexual and reproductive health, how are we ever going to deal with the pandemic that is wiping out a whole generation in Africa?
I urge every single one of you who is thinking about voting against precedence for this motion to go and watch Darwin’s Nightmare. What is more, in that film the young woman who is a prostitute and is dying of AIDS is murdered by her Australian client. How wonderful! What a reputation for us. That film is going to film festivals throughout the world and showing exactly what is going on in those African communities. Anyone who has any compassion at all—anyone who reads anything at the moment in terms of the millennium goals, in terms of achieving sustainable development, in terms of achieving global wellbeing—will understand that if you do not deal with the AIDS pandemic you cannot deal with poverty and you cannot deal with children who are forced to live on the streets because their families have died of AIDS.
So, Senator Boswell, I am passionate about family values, I am passionate about women and children, and I am passionate about the AIDS pandemic, and that is why I want our Prime Minister to go to this meeting on the Millennium Development Goals and stand up for food security, for global security, for the women and children of this planet and for women having access to education about reproductive health.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2005-09-08,"—I have heard a very passionate speech, and I acknowledge a lot of what has just been said. However, this motion has just been circulated, and there is another member in this chamber—the Family First member—who I am sure would have loved to have been here at the start, had this been circulated beforehand. We have at first blush seen that this could be dealing with abortion on demand, and, as such, it crosses a fundamental moral principle that I hold. Maybe no-one else in this chamber does hold it, but I hold it and I feel, absolutely first and foremost, that you should be able to stand behind something that you believe in.
If this is just dealing with AIDS and issues such as that, we will let it go forward—it is a good, moral and just motion—but if it is dealing with and touches on abortion on demand then we are dealing with the rights of other human beings; we are dealing with people who do not have a choice about whether or not they live. We always have to be mindful of those who do not have a voice. The life of a person in this world is not a bell curve. You do not start with no rights, attain all rights at about the age of 34 and then have those rights slowly diminish until you die. Your rights are a constant, and we must believe in the absolutely immutable right of a person to go through this life without having that taken away from them.
If this motion is in code, if this has been deceptive, if this actually talks about abortion on demand yet does not have the capacity, fortitude or strength to say so, then we must knock it out. If you really believe in abortion on demand, then say so. Say, ‘This is a motion about abortion on demand.’ If it has nothing to do with and no relation to abortion on demand, then say so. Stand up in this chamber and say, ‘This has absolutely nothing to do with abortion on demand.’ But you will not say that, and the reason you will not say that is because it does, and, as it does, The Nationals—Ron Boswell and I—will be opposing this. I do not know who will come across to help us out. I do not know. It is going to be an interesting time in this chamber. It is the most important thing in this chamber today. It is more important than Telstra or anything else, and I will be standing up in support of families and the families that are not yet born. So help me, that is where I will be.
—Before I give Senator Stott Despoja the call, I remind people involved in the debate that the debate is about a suspension of standing orders to give precedence to the motion. I make that clear so that, when we finally get to a determination of the debate that is currently before the chair, people are under no illusion as to what is being debated.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-09-08,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I am guided by your words. On that note, when it comes to the issue of precedence, obviously I am supporting the move by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Allison, to suspend standing orders. I agree that this is a critical and important debate, and it should take precedence. I am strongly in opposition to the denial of formality to this particular motion, and I gather from the comments of the previous speaker that he also suggests that this is such a significant and important debate that he will be supporting the suspension before us—and I suggest that it is the same for his National Party colleagues.
There are two reasons why this is urgent. One reason has been touched on by Senator Allison and Senator Milne, and that is that next week these are the issues that will be dealt with in the context of the UN statement and the UN world summit from 14 to 16 September. So we need a resolution from this Senate that clearly articulates the Australian perspective in relation to these particular critical issues—and I use the word ‘critical’ because it is in the motion and in the amended motion—in relation to sexual and reproductive health services. This is not about abortion per se, even if The Nationals would like to make some kind of misleading suggestion that it is about abortion on demand.
As for precedence, this debate is making me pretty angry, because if some people had been here for five minutes they would have learnt how to read a Notice Paper as well as read an amended motion and recognise that the words that are so confronting for some so-called honourable male conservative senators in this place are in the original motion. The amended motion is a shorter version—a watered-down version, we might suggest—of the original. So those senators who dare come in here and say, ‘It was circulated five minutes ago, and I find it really difficult to read three lines or three paragraphs in less than 30 seconds’—
—It is Bozzie!
—I acknowledge that interjection.

Senator Boswell interjecting—

—Well, I withdraw it then, Senator Boswell. But the point is that you of all people—through you, Mr Deputy President—know how to read a motion and an amended motion. So look at (a) to (d) in the Notice Paper and recognise the difference between that motion and the amended one. The so-called offensive words are in both. The version that we have before us is no more difficult to read—it is easier—and it is not radically different. So in terms of precedence, if that is the best excuse that some senators give for denying formality or for even voting against the suspension of standing orders, it is pretty pathetic.
One thing I do take from Senator Boswell’s speech is when he says that this is a test for the chamber. He is not kidding. This is the first. This is the flag. This is the first signal to some of us in this place, men and women, that this is what the next three years—potentially longer—are going to be about. It is about seeing everything through the prism of women’s rights, particularly women’s reproductive rights, and it is the first king hit. It is the first test for those of us who believe that men and women are equal and that women have the right to ‘sexual and reproductive health services’. They are the words that some blokes in this place today find offensive.
That is what we are voting on today: a basic statement of principle. And it is not about abortion on demand; it is about sexual and reproductive health services. It is about things like prophylactics, condoms and all those other bad words that some people cannot cope with in this place. It is about issues like health and poverty. This is what Senator Allison and I were talking about: how do we talk about alleviating poverty, honestly and realistically, without talking about sexual and reproductive health—women’s health—not just in countries like ours but in the developing world?
If we are going to squirm at those words and squib on those issues then we are not good global citizens. And if that is the case then I want our Prime Minister to take that message to the UN next week and make it clear where Australia stands. I will be embarrassed—but I do not think it will be the case, because I know that the minister himself and the government, through the whip and through the coalition today, have indicated their support for this motion. Yes, they are supporting it! So who does not support it? Who is defying their government on this? Who are the anachronistic, outdated conservative people in this place who will deny women their rights and indeed will not put forward positive, constructive ways of alleviating poverty, death, disease, AIDS, HIV—the works? Stand up and be counted now, gentlemen, because I am ready for this debate. If the next three years are going to be seen in this prism whereby you are going to vote down a motion like this—a motion that is inoffensive, progressive, constructive and supported by government—bring on the fight, guys!

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-09-08,"—I stand to oppose the motion and the suspension of standing orders. I am very concerned about the motion and the wording of it. I respect that other people in this chamber have a different view on these matters. What is not clear to me is the definition of ‘sexual and reproductive health’ as set out in parts (a) and (c) of the motion. Based on past experience and on precedent, that definition of sexual and reproductive health has included abortion—the definition of those words has included abortion. If it can be made clear to this chamber by the proposer of the motion and by other people that it does not in any way, shape or form include abortion on demand or abortion, then that would allay many of the fears that I and perhaps others in this chamber hold. I respect the views of Senator Stott Despoja, and I know her views are different to mine with respect to abortion. Her views and comments were quite strident with respect to those that opposed her own, and it sounded very much like much of the rhetoric in favour of women’s choices and abortion.
—Are you opposed to women’s choices?
—I am opposed to abortion on demand—very much so. That is on the public record, and I say it again today. That is why I would like clarification. I would like it made categoric so we know exactly where we stand, because otherwise I will certainly be opposing the motion.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2005-09-08,"—Just briefly, the situation is that the government will be opposing the suspension of standing orders in this matter. That will enable time to clarify a few issues which have been raised today. I think that will give us some time to look at what is a very important issue. We acknowledge that and we take it very seriously. If the suspension of standing orders is denied then the mover of the motion can consider whether or not to bring that back, but the government is of a view that we need further time to look at the wording of this motion as there are some issues which have been raised. We need time to look at that.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I just want to make a couple of brief comments on behalf of the opposition. There has obviously been some confusion around this motion this morning. I understand that was partly as a result of a late amendment. We have had some concerns about late amendments previously, where senators do not get a chance to see the amended motion. As I say, I do not agree with a lot of what Senator Boswell had to say, but, given the way this debate has gone, it is sensible that we do not suspend and that the matter comes back up next week when people have had a chance to look at the resolution and they actually know what they are voting on.
What I have always opposed inside the Labor Party and inside the Senate is senators having to make critical votes on important issues of conscience without having time to consider them. I make the same argument in relation to Telstra, I make the same argument in relation to industrial relations, and I look forward to Senator Boswell’s support when the government seeks to bring on the Telstra bill later on today when we have not even seen it yet. The sort of argument that you put is very convincing to me, Senator Boswell. I look forward to the consistency of your position.
This is a serious matter. It has raised concerns. I think some of the claims made about what the motion covers are a bit fanciful, but the reality is that a lot of senators are now concerned. They do not know quite what they are voting on and they have not seen the amendment. As I understand it, procedurally it has already been called ‘not formal’, so it is a question of whether you support the suspension. I indicate on behalf of Labor that we will not support the suspension procedurally, but we will support the resolution coming on again next week. Our position on that resolution will be determined once we have had a chance to look at the resolution.
We again highlight to people that moving amendments and walking into the whip’s office minutes before it is voted on and saying, ‘We have agreement to an amendment,’ is not acceptable practice. It is certainly not acceptable practice in terms of highly emotive issues. While Labor was involved in the formation of the resolution et cetera, we need to allow all senators time to consider those issues. So I say that, while some of the claims contain some emotive hyperbole, the reality is that we ought to stop, take stock, see what we are voting on and come back to it next week. Labor will not support the suspension but we will support Senator Allison bringing forward something on this issue early next week.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-08,"—What a situation we have here, with Labor caving in to the government because there is a split in the government on the matter—to articulate directly what is being stated opposite—of whether or not this motion involves women’s choice when it comes to abortion. That is a matter that the government has to work out for itself. At stake here is the preparedness of this government to represent this nation at the United Nations Millennium Forum next week, where the Bush administration is pulling the rug from under a unified world position that we do something about the disgusting poverty and disempowerment around the world which is visited, more than anything else, on women. We have a comfort debate over there on the other side, saying: ‘Let’s have time to get together and have a comfortable, largely old boys presentation to the Senate next week, where we can fudge on this matter.’ This motion is about women in disgusting poverty around the world being able to make choices about their survival and about their ability, along with men, to look after their kids.
I ask those opposite—through you, Mr Deputy President—to consider the millions of kids who have no parents because we in the West have done nothing for them—neither for their poverty nor for their ability to look at reproductive options. There are millions and millions of them—tens of millions, growing to 20 million to 40 million kids—many of them with HIV as well because they had no choice in the reproductive anarchy that exists around the world because we in the Western world, people like those in the Bush administration and the Vatican, have said: ‘You shall not have a choice because we have precepts which we want to visit on you. We want to make that choice for you. So you can live without your parents and you can live without your rights, provided it makes us comfortable back in our rich, Western society.’
There are hard choices here—very tough choices. This is complex. It is not simple, and leaving it until Monday is not going to make it any easier. This motion speaks for itself. This is something the government should have had on the agenda of the Senate months ago in the lead-up to this millennium conference, but it is left to Senator Allison and Senator McLucas to bring it forward. Now we get here, on the eve of this conference, and the government is split and says: ‘We do not know what to do. Please give us time.’ I will tell you why: because this is not an agenda item. The rights of women and the rights of kids to have parents are not on the agenda of this government. This government, remember, has one of the lowest aid allocations compared to the rest of the world. The millennium goal was 0.7 per cent. It is 0.23 per cent under this government.
—Order! The time for the debate has expired.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Allison’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,10,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-09-08,"—We now have further evidence today of how arrogant and out of touch this government is. It has now sought to move a motion which, not even halfway through the sitting pattern for the second half of the year—in fact, in only the third week of the sitting pattern—seeks to vary the hours. Hours motions are normally dealt with at the end of a sitting pattern when there is a requirement to deal with legislation that might have built up through the sitting period.
We now have an arrogant government who have said, ‘We want a group of bills, the Telstra bills, to go through by the end of next week.’ To get us to this point, the government have also moved a motion, which they used their numbers to push through, to exempt the bills from the cut-off so that they can be dealt with as urgent bills. However, the legislation is not needed until next year, as we are told even in the urgent motion. There is a logical inconsistency in that, because the government effectively asked for exemption from the cut-off before the bills had even been introduced. The parliament had not seen the bills. The government did that rather than do it in two motions—that is, introduce the bills then ask for an exemption. Then the usual way is to ask for a discussion with the opposition and the minor parties on how best to deal with the bills.
We had already suggested to the government that the best way to deal with the bills was to allow a reasonable amount of time for the legislation to be examined by a committee. The government chose to ignore that, amend that motion and do what I have just indicated. They then sought to say, ‘Look, you can have the hours that you want.’ We are not asking for hours to deal with the bills. This is a government request. In fact, what they did was to write a letter. The usual practice and procedure in the Senate at the end of a session is to call a meeting and say, ‘Do we require additional hours to meet the requirements of getting legislation through that might be deemed urgent by the government?’ But, no, they threw that out and said: ‘We will write you a letter and tell you what we want. We want these hours to deal with these bills and we will then move a motion in the Senate to immediately grant that to us. We have the numbers; we will just bludgeon you with those numbers without a discussion, without a request.’ They are saying: ‘These are the numbers. These are the hours. Thanks very much.’
This is the family friendly Liberal Party speaking. This is the Liberal Party that says, ‘We want to ensure that there are reasonable hours to work within this place.’ This is the Liberal Party that says, ‘We want to be reasonable about how we act in this place.’ This is the Liberal Party that says, ‘We’re not going to use our numbers to bludgeon the Senate; we’re going to allow reasonable scrutiny of legislation; we are going to allow all of these proper processes to continue.’ In the third week of the session, three votes later, they have thrown that all out completely and utterly. The reason they want to do this at this point in time is to shunt the Telstra legislation through this parliament. They want to ensure that it is not scrutinised. They have done a deal with Senator Joyce to sign off on it as quickly they can, before he gets away on them again, so that they can go to their meetings and say: ‘We’ve got the sale of Telstra in the bag. We did it as quickly as we could. Thanks very much.’ End of debate.
But we are not talking about one bill; we are talking about five. There is the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005, the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Amendment (Industry Plans and Consumer Codes) Bill 2005 and the Appropriation (Regional Telecommunications Services) Bill 2005-2006. After these bills have been introduced today they will go to the committee tomorrow and will be dealt with next week. That is what the government has sought to do. That is what the government is using its numbers for. Excluding Saturdays and Sundays, that leaves only a matter of hours for each bill to be given reasonable scrutiny. It is a farce. The government knows it; the government accepts it.
Only extreme legislation would be rushed through by an extremist government in this way. We are not talking here of a matter of national emergency. The government have said that the bills are urgent. The only reason that they are doing it in this way is to stifle debate and to ensure that the grubby attempt to cover up profit-stripping by this government is not exposed to public scrutiny. That seems to be what they are doing here.
The opposition will not be supporting this motion. The government have not done what they should have done, which is to come and consult about it. That is the way the Senate has worked in the years I have been here. Even this morning we saw them throw in another bill with exemption from the cut-off, without consultation. It seems that there are no rules that the Liberal Party are going to abide by. You can see that in the way they operate outside this place. The New South Wales Liberal Party do not have any rules. They work in the way they want to work. Now they are dragging their lack of rules into this place.
These are important bills that need proper debate and proper scrutiny. We have seen the debate about these bills in the media over the last couple of days. That needs to be clarified. The government needs to come to the party and explain in the Senate the true position of Telstra, the truth about how Telstra is coping with ensuring that the public receive telecommunications that are world standard. As I have said, Labor will not be supporting this motion to extend the sitting hours. We will not be participating in the government’s cover-up. The Liberal Party is determined to turn this place into a rubber stamp. I want Minister Hill, Minister Coonan and Minister Ellison to come into this place and claim that they are upholding the dignity of the Senate by, in truth, emasculating it in this way. I will come to some of their statements in this place shortly.
Labor will always take the fight up to an incompetent government such as this. The government is out of touch and becoming increasingly dodgy in the way it deals with these issues. Labor, in the alternate, has always sought to rebuild our infrastructure, whether that be our crumbling telecommunications system or our public institutions, like the Senate, which are now being undermined by this government. This is just another example of this government trying to use its numbers in this chamber to take the power away from the Senate and turn it from being a house of review into a sausage machine. It has been a longstanding principle in the Senate to have its hours scheduled. What this government has now sought to do is throw out that principle, throw out the way this chamber has worked, and use its Senate majority to abuse its power and wield it like a club in this place.
In this instance, there is insufficient time to enable proper debate on the legislation. The government knows it. But we will rise to the challenge to ensure that, to the best of our ability, it does receive that scrutiny. The government is trying to cover up, stifle and hide. It is trying to scurry away into the dark corners where it feels comfortable. (Quorum formed) This is about scrutiny and review, which is not what this government is about. I saw government senators come down here for the quorum and now they are all scurrying away again into their dark little offices. That is what they are doing because they do not want to be part—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I thought Senator Ludwig had finished and that you had called another speaker.
 (Senator Forshaw)—No, Minister. Senator Brown rose to his feet and took a quorum call, and that is why Senator Ludwig resumed his seat.
—Oh! I thought he might just be repeating his speech, because I have heard all of this before.
—There is no point of order.
—It is an interesting point you take, Minister, because clearly it has not got through. That is why it may need to be repeated a couple of times and why you need to listen: you should be dealing with the Senate in the way that it has been dealt with over the years. The principles of this place should be upheld. Clearly, that has never got through to the senators on the other side. It is outrageous abuse of power and it is hypocrisy at its best. Let me remind senators how the government approached the issue of Senate liberties when it became clear they were going to have four out of six senators in Queensland. This is what the government said then, Senator Ian Macdonald:
We certainly won’t be abusing our newfound position, we’ll continue to listen to the people and we’ll continue to stay in touch with the public that has invested great trust and confidence in us.
They have run away from that, as they have run out of this chamber today. That was the Prime Minister speaking then, in a doorstop interview. Have a look what we now have. In all that this government do you have to read the detail, because if they believe they can deceive they will hide the mess, they will cover it up at will. What they say is simple legislation is often, under scrutiny, an extremist ideology shrouded in fine print. That is what they do: they fine print everything out and then close the debate down. They do not want to suffer scrutiny at all. They are of touch with the Australian public. Labor are determined to take the fight up to them and hold them to account.
That is why we are arguing this point today; that is why we are not going to let it go. That is why we are going to ensure that you hear this point again and again. What you do not seem to understand is that this Senate will not be treated in the way that the Liberal government is choosing to treat it. It has a place to scrutinise legislation. It has a role to ensure there is proper scrutiny. It has a role to ensure that the government of the day is held accountable for its actions and that its legislation is examined in detail. That is the role this Senate has. It is not your sausage factory. If Senator Hill had had a shred of dignity he would have recognised this embarrassing predicament and dispatched this abuse of the Senate in line with the promise that he made.
Let me remind the Senate, the gallery and the public of that promise by Senator Hill. He promised:
... the parliament has the right to have a reasonable time to consider that legislation. I do not care whether we are in government or the Labor Party is in government in this regard: when masses of bills are guillotined through either chamber without the parliament having time to consider them, the process does not operate well. We should all regard that as unsatisfactory. We simply do not accept that a government putting good faith into practice cannot organise its program in a way that allows the parliament to fulfil its responsibility.
Given his party’s behaviour in the Senate today and yesterday—and let us not forget about the question time imposition—where in the place of consultation is another letter, you can chalk up another broken promise by this government. They seem to delight in writing letters saying: ‘This is our view. This is the extent of the consultation that we are going to have with the opposition and the minor parties.’ And in some instances it looks like they even forget to write the letter. They simply move the motion in the chamber and that is the first we see of it. There is no consultation; they do not even inform us anymore. They are becoming more arrogant than you could even imagine they could become. That is what this government have turned into.
I imagine that someone on the other side will get up in this debate and explain how the proposed hours are family friendly, that they are a family friendly government and that they will utilise those hours for the debate. They miss the point about how the procedures in this chamber should operate. The government have their sights on the target and are pushing everything out of the way to get to it, but not even in a strategic or smart way, I have to say. There are a couple of smarter ways they could have got to the same point, but they have chosen to ignore them. It is the same old case of them saying: ‘This is a handy club. We do not want to think this through with any great detail or strategy—we will just bludgeon our way through.’ And it seems that that is what is going to happen.
But there is time to stop. The government can get up today and say, ‘We recognise that this is a bit out of kilter—a bit extreme,’ and ask for consultation about how these things should proceed, indicate that they are going to be more reasonable about how debates proceed in this place, or say that they are not going to use their numbers to crunch through procedures such as this again and again. But I doubt I will hear much from them about that. They are going to sit there pat and in silence and simply not provide a reasonable answer in this debate.
—If you sit down I might have a go!
—And I hope you take you your full 20 minutes in the debate, Minister.

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—Order! Senator Ludwig, your remarks should be directed through the chair. Minister, you will allow Senator Ludwig to be heard in silence.
—I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. We understand that the bill will be debated shortly, and I indicated at the outset that I would not take up my full 20 minutes in this debate. This matter is important, and a marker has to be put down. The government have to be held accountable. I am not going to extend the debate just for the purpose of ensuring that I mark all the points, because there are a lot more. It looks like I am going to get a number of other opportunities to put these markers down, because I do not see this government turning away from being arrogant and out of touch.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,BUSINESS,16,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-08,"—The Democrats also oppose this motion. It is the latest in what has already become a long line of deliberate attempts to undermine the processes and integrity of the Senate. I have made speeches already—on Monday and Tuesday—about two other motions that also committed what I believe are grievous sins against the core role of the Senate as a house of review. This is the third, and I think each time it happens it should be marked and clearly indicated. A spotlight should be shone on it and it should be condemned.
The motion before us simply attempts to allow the government to fulfil its intent to get the Telstra legislation passed. That is fine: if you have the numbers to pass a piece of legislation then you have the numbers. We can make comments about whether or not that is good for the public when we get to that debate. But it is not just a matter of passing law; it is a matter of it being done in a way that prevents scrutiny. This motion allows limited scrutiny and debate, and what debate we do have will occur in the dead of night. It seeks to extend the sitting hours of the Senate until 11 pm on Monday and Tuesday so that even the limited scrutiny there is will occur in the dead of night, when there is less opportunity for people to be aware of the facts that are coming out about the detail of the government’s package and what the consequences of it will be. That is why it is a bad idea.
As Senator Ludwig said, it is clearly outside the usual process. It once again shows that the government’s comments and the pledge of the relevant minister, Senator Coonan, that an appropriate process would be followed and that normal procedures of scrutiny would occur were simply false. Those pledges, those guarantees made to the public and the Senate, have been shown to be incorrect and to be just others in the long line of misleading statements this government has grown infamous for.
As I have said about previous unacceptable motions, in many ways it is far more unacceptable to be allowing a perverted process to occur in passing the sale of Telstra legislation than it is to support the sale. At least you can make an argument for the policy of selling Telstra. It is not an argument I or the Democrats agree with, but at least it can be put. But the government is trying to prevent the argument from even being put and to prevent proper scrutiny of the facts behind that argument. Frankly, that says more clearly than any words how flimsy the government’s case for selling Telstra is.
If they knew they had a good case, if this proposal was as fantastic as The Nationals are trying to portray it to be, they would gleefully be welcoming the chance to have it fully examined, explored, detailed and debated. But what they are doing is preventing any sort of reasonable Senate inquiry. They are preventing any sort of attempt to properly scrutinise the legislation and they are attempting to limit debate. We all know what will happen next week: in addition to the travesties that have already occurred this week, we will have the guillotine brought down. We will have the government—with the support, one assumes, of the National Party senators who made such a song and dance about standing up for their constituency—silence the voice of their constituency and silence any attempt to spotlight what they are really doing and what the facts are about this issue.
It is unacceptable. It is deeply disappointing. I have to say, in all genuineness, to those in the government and the National Party who are supporting this attempt to sell Telstra, if they think they have a hard job convincing people that it is a good thing, it makes it 10 times harder for people to believe that you are genuinely doing a good thing if you do it in a way that prevents people from looking at it properly before it happens. We have the absurdity of the Senate committee inquiry happening on Friday—for one day—into legislation that is yet to be produced. It will only be tabled this morning, so people will have less than 24 hours to examine it before they are meant to give their views on it to the Senate committee—for those who even have the opportunity and resources to get together submissions and get to that Senate committee hearing. That is patently unacceptable, unrealistic and unreasonable in anybody’s language. It is a perversion of process.
As the name of the Democrats as a party implies, we strongly believe in democracy over and above virtually anything else. This is a perversion of democracy and for that reason we will strongly oppose this motion and do everything we can to draw to the attention of the public the disgraceful way that this issue is being handled by this government and the extreme arrogance, total contempt for due process and total contempt for the Australian people that is being shown by this process. (Quorum formed)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I too will speak for a short time in opposing the government’s motion to extend the sitting hours on Monday and Tuesday. I do so to make a more general point than one about the hours but, starting on that subject, I indicate that the traditional courtesy of the chamber, which has been observed for many years now, is that the management of the chamber has been done in a cooperative way: the Leader of the Government in the Senate has called a meeting of leaders and whips from all parties and had a discussion about the program, how we would arrange the hours, what priorities the government wanted and what bills they thought needed to be passed in a particular session, and there would be a general agreement reached about how this would proceed.
All that has changed is that the numbers have changed. The government now has a majority in the Senate. In the last 10 days we have seen an abuse of every process and a shredding of any Senate procedure or process that does not suit the government, to the point that there is now no consultation and no discussion. A range of longstanding traditions, practices and procedures in the Senate have been shredded. In 10 parliamentary sitting days a range of very serious processes that have been developed over the years under successive governments and by successive parliaments have been absolutely abandoned in this government’s exercise of its total control of the Senate.
The question of the sitting hours is a relatively small matter; we will sit whatever hours the government wants to sit. But we make the point that there has been no consultation and that it is very unusual to ask us to sit longer hours at this stage in the cycle of the parliament. We assume, although it was not made clear in the letter, that the only reason is that the government has stated publicly that it wants the Telstra bills passed next week. I assume the intention of the motion is to allow more time for debate so the government can argue there has been time for parliament to consider the bills.
We have not actually seen the bills we are supposed to have completed by next Thursday. They will be introduced, hopefully, later today, although the government could have done that at any stage in the last few days. It has not sought to use its power in that regard to allow the Senate to see the bills but it has used its power to abuse every other process that the Senate has established. Obviously, the motion on the hours will go through and that is fine. Then, some time next week, the government will move the guillotine to ensure that the debate is curtailed in order to get the vote on its Telstra bills some time next week.
In the normal course of events a debate on a major package of bills like this takes longer than four sitting days, particularly as we have not seen some of the bills yet and there will not be a proper committee stage. Clearly, that is not the government’s intention. Clearly, at some stage the guillotine will be introduced and the Senate will be forced to vote on the bills before it has had proper time to consider the detail of five bills, three of which were introduced into the House of Representatives, I believe yesterday, and two of which have yet to be introduced into the Senate. It is a major package with a lot of detail about the regulatory regime. There is of course the in-principle question of the sale. Labor’s position on that is clear: we do not believe privatising Telstra is a good idea. We will oppose it. There is a lot of detail in the other bills that needs to be examined and that is not going to occur.
I put on record the abuse of Senate process, the railroading of the Senate and the total arrogance and abuse of power by this government in 10 sitting days. John Howard assured us that his would be a moderate government, that he would act within the traditions of the Senate and that there would be no sense of an abuse of power. Let me list what has occurred in 10 days of parliamentary sitting. We started with the government writing to me to advise me that they had changed the rules for question time. They have reduced the number of questions that could be asked by the opposition and minor parties. The President gave effect to that the following day. The first thing they did before the parliament resumed was to change the rules of question time and reduce the number of questions available to the opposition and minor parties and increase the number of dorothy dixers asked by government senators. Over the last 10 days we have all suffered some of the most inane questions ever asked in the parliament so ministers can tell us how good they are or spend four minutes trying to abuse the Labor Party or accuse the Greens of being drug runners or whatever else comes to their mind at the time. It is a total waste of time and not at all assisting the accountability of the executive. At least in the questions from the opposition and minor parties there is some attempt to hold the government accountable. The first thing was the arrogant changing of the rules of question time. There was no consultation; it was just bang, we have the numbers, and questions were reduced and accountability was reduced.
The second and most famous incident was that involving the government Deputy Whip, Senator McGauran, who in a famous metaphor for the government’s attitude to the Senate raised his index finger towards non-government senators. It was a display of their arrogance and total control and of how they viewed any opposition or criticism that might be levelled towards them.
The third disgraceful thing we saw was the attack by Senator Abetz on the Clerk of the Senate in a committee inquiry. It was one of the most outrageous, scurrilous attacks seen in the history of the parliament by a minister of the Crown on a clerk of the parliament. The lack of discipline and the absolute shrillness in the abuse with which Senator Abetz attacked the Clerk beggars belief. He demanded that he be prepared to resign. He accused the Clerk of doing the Senate a disservice, of demeaning his position and of being partisan in his remarks. He said he no longer had any confidence in the Clerk. All this was because the Clerk sought to raise some concern—over a year ago, I might add—at the government’s failure to get proper approval for its politically motivated industrial relations campaign. So the third abuse was the government showing that not only will it not brook any criticism from the opposition parties or allow any accountability in the parliament but it will also not allow the clerks of the parliament to fulfil their traditional role in serving the whole Senate and protecting the institution.
Then we saw the government’s handing of the Telstra legislative inquiry. They said, ‘Of course there will be an inquiry.’ Their original proposition was that the inquiry go from nine o’clock until two o’clock on Friday. This is an inquiry into bills we have not seen yet, that the public has not seen yet, and it will occur tomorrow. The government are saying that they are open and accountable and they are going to have a proper committee inquiry into the state of the Telstra bills. That will happen tomorrow. I have not seen the bills yet but tomorrow at nine o’clock the committee will get the opportunity to consider the legislation in detail and they will have to report back to the Senate by Monday.
That gives one working day to consider five complex pieces of legislation that deal with the sale of $30 billion worth of taxpayers’ assets. One day for an inquiry into five bills, two of which are not yet public. There will be a one-day fraud of an inquiry to provide a fig leaf of protection for the government that they have paid some sort of lip service to Senate process. We all know that the inquiry is a fraud, that there is no meaningful consideration of the issues at stake and that there is no opportunity for the community to respond. People will not be able to get a copy of the bill until later today. They will have to lodge their submissions by tomorrow, so they will have to stay up overnight if they want to make a coherent submission. The committee will report to the parliament on Monday.
It is a complete fraud and a farce. It is totally against all of the traditions of the Senate and it is highly undemocratic. But the government’s answer is: ‘We’ve got the numbers, boys—don’t you worry about that. It is 39 to 37; we’ll ram it through.’ I note that all non-government senators have voted against most of these measures taken by the government. It is not just the Labor Party. The Greens, the Democrats and Family First are all concerned at the way the government are riding roughshod over Senate practice and procedures.
In addition to the Senate legislative inquiry farce, we have the government seeking exemption from the cut-off. I do not want to go into the great detail. This is one for the aficionados of Senate practice and I understand that people do not follow the detail. But they do get the message that the government is arrogantly abusing long-established processes to get its way and is using its power to fulfil its political objectives, whatever the cost in terms of normal practice and examination and accountability mechanisms that are long-established. The cut-off allows that legislation cannot come into parliament immediately but lies on the table for a while so that people get a chance to see what it is about. That was abused in the case of the Telstra legislation. As I said, we will be debating it later today, 20 minutes after we see it. That is the sort of process this government is now committed to.
Now, of course, we have this debate on the sitting hours. Again, as I mentioned earlier, normal process is not followed. There is no consultation. We are just told that we are sitting longer hours on Monday on Tuesday. We are advised by the government that that is to occur. The government is arrogantly advising us, not consulting or discussing. We know what that is about. Again, it is driven by the need to get the Telstra bills through, and I am sure that is driven by its need to try to keep the National Party in the cart until such time as they realise that there is a lot of devil in the detail and they have been sold a dud. It has to rush the legislation through because it is not sure that it can keep The Nationals corralled. It is going to ram it through as quickly as it can and abuse and override any process that the Senate has established to provide accountability. It is going to abuse any process that allows the wider community to understand what is going on and what is contained in legislation or that allows them the chance to critically examine it.
We have also had a debate inside the Liberal Party about the question of an inquiry into the industrial relations legislation. Mr Andrews, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, said that there would be a proper Senate inquiry because it is useful for examining the legislation and it might help to raise any problems that are in the legislation. He was quickly shouted down by people such Senator Brandis, who made it clear that they were not in favour of such democratic processes. They were not prepared to support those processes in the Senate. The Prime Minister has also made it clear that he is not interested in discussion and examination of the detail. He is not interested in any critique of the government. He has the power and the numbers. He will do what he wants. He does not want to be checked or scrutinised and he will not allow the Senate to play that role. So again on the IR inquiry we have seen that.
In 10 days, nearly every procedural protection to ensure accountability, examination of legislation, proper inquiry and proper process has been overridden by the government. There is one to go. There is, of course, the question of the use of the guillotine to limit debate. I am sure we will see that next week. I am sure they will finish off the package next week and use the guillotine to prevent the Senate from having a proper look at the five Telstra bills. As I said, we have not seen two of those bills yet.
What we have here is a pattern of behaviour. Within 10 days of the parliament sitting, it is revealed that the government is prepared to shred and abuse any Senate practice and procedure that has been introduced, often with the support of the Liberal and National parties, to allow the Senate to do its job properly. That is all gone. John Howard has spent much time since July assuring the public that he would use his new power wisely. In 10 days it is all gone. There is no hiding the fact that this arrogant government has sought to shred any capacity of the Senate to hold it to account and examine legislation and any capacity of members of the Australian public to scrutinise legislation before it is passed by this parliament. It is all gone in 10 days. That is how long the Liberal and National parties’ commitment to Senate process, accountability and democratic procedures lasted.
Ten days and it is all gone—shredded—because, in the interests of power and getting its way, nothing is allowed to prevent the government from achieving its goals. Any process or established precedent, procedure or practice of the Senate is to be sacrificed. All of those speeches—and I will not bore people with them now—that Senator Campbell, Senator Hill and others have made over the years about the importance of the Senate and Senate processes and where they have argued for half of the things they have shredded in the last few days have all been abandoned. Why? Because the government has the power. They say that all power corrupts. Certainly we have seen that today and we have seen it over the last 10 days. In 10 days of parliamentary sitting, nearly every process has been abused. This is arrogance never seen before. It has usually taken governments with the numbers in the Senate a long time to get to that point, but this government—the Howard government, which is so wracked by internal divisions—is so preoccupied with an ideological agenda that is not supported in the wider community that it feels forced to ram through all it can as quickly as it can as far out from an election as possible.
This government is in so much disarray. This morning was a classic example. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, had approved a resolution to be moved by Senator Allison from the Democrats. His office had approved the resolution. Then Senator Boswell of the National Party comes in and objects. That is the discipline inside the government. The government has no way of controlling The Nationals on such issues. Senator Boswell abandons the discipline that the government normally applies. Senator Boswell overturns the decision of the minister for health. The government weakly capitulates to that and Senator Boswell is allowed to get away with it. That is a matter for the government, but it is a sign of the disarray that is occurring. It is a sign of the tension between the Nationals and the Liberals. We have seen them spraying each other publicly and taking pot shots at each other, and it is not edifying. I think it is a sign of the tensions inside the government. I am sure that lots of it is fuelled, as always, by the leadership tension between Mr Howard and Mr Costello. All of that is making for what seems to be a fairly chaotic performance by the government.
But the one thing they are all united on—the one thing they are all clear on—is that they will abuse their power in the Senate chamber. We have not seen one senator demur as the government has crushed each of these processes, each of these procedures and each of these precedents inside the Senate. I know this is not an issue that fires the imagination of the public. But I also know that a lot of Australians are uneasy about the government having total power, having control of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
A lot of people who voted for the government are uneasy. They were a bit surprised when they woke up after the election and found that the government had total control. A lot of them express the view to me that they do not think that is necessarily a good thing. They ought to be worried; they ought to be very worried. What we see now is what that has done. We see the abuse, the arrogance and the government riding roughshod over any practice or procedure that provides any check on the government.
These are minor checks. At the end of the day, the government have the numbers. They can roll through what they want. What we know is that they will ride roughshod over any minor check—be it the cut off, be it the hours, be it numbers of questions or be it inquiries and the role of the legislative and reference committees. Nothing is sacrosanct; nothing that they have supported in the past is to be supported now. They have a view that they have power and they are going to use it.
The debate inside the Liberal Party is about how Malcolm Fraser wasted the opportunity back in the 1980s to ram through a radical ideological agenda, and they are not going to waste the opportunity on this occasion. So we see at the top of their list things like abolishing student guilds at universities. I have not had many people raise that issue in the street with me. I do not know that many people struggling to earn a living and raise their kids are all that motivated about it.
—It is about voluntary membership.
—I know even Senator Eggleston has had cause to think again about whether this ideological agenda is actually good politics or in fact good government. What we have seen is an ideologically driven agenda and a rush to abuse their power and to not allow the Senate to provide any of the checks and balances or accountability that we have traditionally provided. That is a decision for them. While I think it is terrible for the Senate, I think it will rebound on the government. I do not think people like it. They smell the arrogance. They sense the abuse of power. They know this is a government out of control and that the tensions inside it are driving it to do things that are not in its long-term political interests.
My concern is that they are actually dismantling the capacity of the Senate to act as a check and a balance and to hold the government to account. We will not win a vote in this parliament unless one of the government members crosses the floor, so they know that at the end of the day they have the numbers. They know they have the capacity to win a vote. I do not dispute that. That was a result of a fairly held election. I do not dispute at all the government’s numbers in the Senate. They were properly elected. But I do object to the abuse of power—the use of those numbers to undermine the role of the Senate, to undermine democracy and to undermine accountability.
If ever there was a metaphor for that, it is the way this Telstra legislation has been handled. We have not seen the bills yet. The inquiry will be held tomorrow, without people having seen the legislation. They will report on Monday and the government wants the bills through by Thursday. And that is for five complex bills that go to the future of telecommunications in this country and that go to $30 billion of taxpayers’ assets, with the share price in freefall because of the government’s incompetence in handling these issues. I say to people, ‘Be very concerned.’ (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,BUSINESS,16,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-09-08,"—Firstly, can I congratulate Senator Evans on fulfilling his need to speak for his full allotted time. We once again see the Senate debating a motion in relation to how we are going to handle the debate. I wanted to respond to Senator Evans. Senator Evans and previous Labor speakers, such as the opposition manager, Senator Ludwig, like to use the words ‘arrogance’, ‘extremism’ and ‘out of control’. It is good rhetoric. They work on the Orwellian theory that if you repeat something often enough people will believe it.
The trouble for Senator Evans and the Labor Party, however, is that they do not believe what they are saying. They know very well when they raise the issue of guillotines and gags that the Australian Labor Party used those as devices in this place on regular occasions for year after year when they were in power. When they brought to this chamber legislation that they had promised to deliver to the people before the elections they won in 1983, 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993 and they decided that the legislation needed to be voted on, they used a guillotine.
Senator Robert Ray is over in New York at the moment in a grand display of massive arrogance. The general word around New York and the United Nations when I was there was that the mission that Senator Robert Ray was on last time was one of the laziest missions to the United Nations in the history of Australian delegations to the UN.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Senator Campbell, you are speaking to a motion with regard to changing the hours. While clearly one can take a broad view of that motion, I do not think it extends to what might be happening in New York. Please return to the motion.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is a follow-up to your own point of relevance. The minister has reflected adversely on a member of the chamber and I would ask that he withdraw.
—Senator Conroy, there is no point of order. But I think Senator Campbell should return to the matter before the chamber.
—Thank you for that guidance. I know that Senator Conroy is very touchy when it comes to people attacking his mentor, Senator Robert Ray. But we know that Senator Robert Ray is at the United Nations. We know that when Senator Chris Evans was—
—Senator Campbell, I have ruled there is no point of order. But I have also requested that you return to debating the issue before the chair. You are getting rather close to reflecting upon a member of this chamber. It would be best if you return to the matter before the chamber.
—Thank you for your ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President. I just say that Senator Evans made reflections on question time, for example. The reality is that prior to 30 June the opposition would generally ask around six questions in question time. Since the new Senate was elected, on 9 August ALP senators asked six questions, on 10 August they asked six questions and on 11 August they asked six questions. Basically, I am not sure what they are complaining about. The opposition is getting the same number of questions. What Senator Evans is really saying in this argument is that during question time senators who happen to be elected on a Liberal or National Party ticket should not be allowed to ask questions of the executive. That is very unfair.
For example, yesterday he reflected on a question I was asked, on National Threatened Species Day, about what the government was doing about National Threatened Species Day. I will share something a bit private with you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson. Senator Russell Trood came to me recently after a question he asked me in relation to another one of the government’s very important environmental programs and said that he has constituents who are very concerned about bilbies. He asked whether I could give him some information about bilbies and whether I would mind if he moved a notice of motion about bilbies. There is a senator elected on the Liberal Party Senate ticket in Queensland who cares deeply about national threatened species and the environment who wants to ask a question in question time so that he can communicate the answer to his constituents, yet Labor and the Greens seem to think that, if you get elected on a Liberal or National party ticket, you should not be allowed to ask questions in question time, when your constituents may well be listening to the radio.
Constituents might be listening to Senator Alan Eggleston ask me a question about the environment in the Kimberley. Because Senator Eggleston has a close interest in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions, many of his constituents may well want to know that their senator from Western Australia, with a long history in the north-west, is doing his job, standing up in the Senate and finding out about government policies that affect the Kimberley or the Pilbara. People across the Kimberley and the Pilbara can listen on the radio or can watch on the television at night, and they want to know that the senators that they elect and pay are doing their job. But Labor and the Greens are so arrogant that they say, ‘No, if you get elected as a Liberal or National Party senator you should not be allowed to ask a question.’ That is an absurd proposition.
They are saying that, because we have actually had more and more Liberals and Nationals elected over consecutive elections—and that is why we happen to have a majority: the people of Australia, state by state, election after election, have elected more and more Liberal and National party senators—we should ask fewer questions. The founding fathers wrote our magnificent Constitution, which Labor and the Greens on regular occasions during our history wanted to tear up. The founding fathers envisaged that you could get a majority. Yet Labor and the Greens have the gall to come in here today and complain about Liberal and National senators, who have a majority, asking questions in question time.
They are complaining about the process that led to that majority, whereby they were elected in democratic elections at the last two elections—because half the Senate gets elected at every general election. Yet the self-same senators have had, as part of their platforms and policies over recent years, provisions that would stop the Senate having the power to block supply. I do not know whether that is still Labor Party policy. I think it is Democrat and Green policy. I am not sure about that—I do not want to misrepresent Senator Brown again.
It is important for people to understand that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say that we want to tear up the Senate’s powers by removing its powers to block supply—and in fact many Labor senators have said over many years that they would get rid of the Senate altogether—and then come in here and say that, after winning election after election and having more and more Liberal and National senators voted in, we should not have the right to bring forward our legislation and have the Senate deal with it in a reasonable time. As I said, this is the very same Australian Labor Party that, when Robert Ray managed government business as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, used all of the processes available within the standing orders to make sure that the programs of the Hawke and Keating governments were put through the Senate in a reasonable way.
So, if and when the government do bring forward time management devices such as the guillotine, we will see the Labor Party get up and yell and squeal, but we know privately that Senator Robert Ray used to come to me when I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate and tell me that I had a lot of guillotines to pass before I came anywhere near his record. He brags about his record of use of the guillotine. I will be getting all of the statistics from Scott Faragher, an adviser to me when I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I will be getting from Mr Faragher all of the details—pages and pages of them—of the guillotines that Senator Robert Ray, Senator John Faulkner and then Senator Bob McMullan used when they managed things. They will rave and rant about the use of the guillotine, and we will remind the Australian people that these people speak with what can only be called forked tongues. The people of Australia will not take them seriously when they try to run this false argument about the government’s use of the Senate, because the Australian Labor Party know very well—and that is why they do not do it with very much sincerity, quite frankly—that these are devices, parliamentary standing orders, parliamentary protocols that are used year after year by all of the political parties.
The use of the cut-off motion is another example of members of the Australian Labor Party speaking with forked tongues. They vote for cut-off motions—this is the exemption from standing order 111—on hundreds and hundreds of occasions. Every week they vote for dozens of them. Yet, because they have an ideological obsession against one piece of legislation, they come in here today and say: ‘We’re not going to support it now. It is some sort of abuse. It is some sort of arrogance.’ Senator Brown knows this. We should agree on this. Senator Brown has sought to stop cut-off motions on regular occasions for his own reasons, and he has criticised both parties for the use of them. He knows that the Labor Party are talking with forked tongues on this, because they support 99 per cent—probably 99.99 per cent—of cut-off motions, or what is known to people who live inside the beltway as the exemption from standing order 111. So that is an absurdity.
In relation to the Telstra bills that Senator Evans talked about and how the Labor Party has this opposition to the sale of Telstra, again Senator Brown and I know that Labor speaks with a forked tongue on privatisation. This is the party that started privatisation in the federal government of Australia. This is the party that sold the Commonwealth Bank. This is the party that sold Qantas. This is the party that sold Australian Airlines. This is the party—and it was actually, I think, the leader of the Australian Labor Party when he was the minister for communications—that decided that we needed to create a telecommunications corporation called Telstra. He corporatised it.
The Australian Labor Party corporatised Telstra. They turned it into a government business entity. This was when they were selling Qantas, Australian Airlines, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the Defence Housing Authority. These people privatised like there was no tomorrow. And, while they were doing all that privatisation, they were also doing corporatisations.
How do governments go about privatising things? It is a two- or three-step process. The first part of it, if it is not corporatised, is to corporatise it. The second part of it is to privatise it. And of course we all know that Mr Keating and Mr Beazley had plans to look at the privatisation of Telstra, either part or whole. And we know that if they had won the 1996 election, Telstra would have been privatised. They speak with forked tongues on privatisation. They privatised with both hands. They were the great privatisers. Paul Keating went to the Labor Party conference in, I think, Adelaide and said, ‘We’ve got to sell these airlines. How can they raise capital? How can they invest?’ And the same applies to Telstra.
The other thing, as I reminded the Senate of yesterday, is that the government have been open, honest and up front about the sale of Telstra. It was our policy in 1996, it was our policy in 1998, it was our policy in 2001 and it was our policy in 2004. We promised the people of Australia we were going to sell it. And yet we get abused when we try to bring the legislation in by people saying that we are arrogant. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw, that to not bring the legislation forward would be arrogant.
We are actually doing something that the Australian Labor Party had struggled with for years when they were in power—that is, we are keeping our promises. That is something that is an absolute anathema to the Australian Labor Party. They used to go to elections and say, ‘I promise no child will live in poverty by the year 1990.’ That was a great promise by Mr Hawke. He did not keep it. ‘I promise there will be no capital gains tax.’ There is capital gains tax. They went to the 1984 election and said: ‘We’re opposed to privatisation. We hate privatisation; we’ll never privatise.’ They actually got that fantastic comedian Graham Kennedy to do ads for them to say how bad privatisation was. When they got back into power, within months they were out flogging off the silver, flogging off everything they could find—anything that moved. And if they could not sell it, they would corporatise it. And that is what they did to Telstra. The hypocrisy is just overwhelming, and you cannot let it go by.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! I think the motion before the chair is in relation to the hours of meeting of the Senate. You have touched on it briefly, but I would ask you to confine your comments to the motion before the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I did note that the previous Acting Deputy President, Senator Forshaw, allowed the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Evans, to debate issues such as a notice of motion, Senator Boswell’s interest in it and a whole range of things.
—The chair did give you the opportunity to respond.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is a motion that deals with sitting hours in relation to the Telstra bills. Senator Evans did make the point in the debate that Labor were opposed to the sale of Telstra and opposed to privatisation. I was responding, I think appropriately, by saying that there is a certain amount of hypocrisy in the Labor Party promoting two concepts. The first concept is their opposition to the sale of Telstra, when they of course sold the Commonwealth Bank, sold CSL, sold Qantas, sold Australian Airlines and sold the Defence Housing Authority. I was drawing attention to the fact of that significant hypocrisy and to the fact that there is significant hypocrisy from the Australian Labor Party in relation to the management of the hours.
They cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, ‘We want more time to consider the bills but we do not want to sit extra hours.’ That is the mother of all hypocrisy. It is extraordinary. We are going to have a vote on extra sitting hours, but they are saying, ‘We want more time to debate the bills, but now we’re going to have a long debate about how long we’re going to sit for.’ It is really quite absurd. I also say that Senator Ellison, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, has, as I understand it, tabled or read into the record the details of committee hearings into bills.
You will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, that in around 1990, when the Australian Labor Party brought into the parliament the Corporations Law reforms to set up a single national regulator in ASIC, they brought the legislation in on one day and had a hearing on a Wednesday night, as I recall. We had the departmental officials from Attorney-General’s Department and a number of other people in. This was legislation, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, to set up a single national regulator, to totally transform the whole corporate regulation for every single incorporated business across the whole of Australia, getting rid of six state corporate affairs offices across Australia and setting up the securities commission nationally.
That was a huge piece of legislation which has transformed corporate regulation in Australia and, one might say, the world. It was a great achievement of the Hawke government, supported by the coalition in opposition. It was massive, highly complicated legislation—far more complicated than a sale bill for Telstra that has been before this parliament on at least four occasions before. It is not a new piece of legislation; it is a Telstra sale bill. We had it in 1996, we had it again in 1998 and we had it again in 2001—the same bills—yet they are saying, ‘We haven’t seen the bills. We need more time to consider them.’
Yet with corporations legislation, along with hundreds of other pieces of legislation, we did exactly what the Senate planned to do when we changed the Senate committee system in 1990. We pulled out of sitting on Fridays. When I first got here in May 1990, the Senate used to sit on Fridays. We would go home on Friday night. You would remember this, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think in their wisdom they said, ‘Let’s make Friday a committee day. We’ll break up into legislation committees and deal with legislation in detail on Fridays.’ So the regular course of action was to refer a bill off. It would go to a detailed consideration on a Friday and then of course it would come back and the Senate would deal with it the following week. That is why we stopped sitting on Fridays.
But then, when Labor went into opposition, they started this concept of having enormously long hearings into legislation as a form of obstruction and delay. The Medicare bills last year were a classic example—they were kept out of this chamber for half a year for an inquiry. As we were talking about complex pieces of legislation, I go back to the example of the Corporations Law. It went off on a Wednesday night to a committee chaired by Senator Barney Cooney and we had a thorough hearing. In fact, out of that hearing I came up with the suggestion of having the thing called the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. I got that put into the law and that committee, now chaired by Senator Grant Chapman, does very good work. That is one of the things that came out of the committee hearing: ‘Let us have parliamentary oversight of the new body.’ It was passed through this chamber on the Thursday and came into force, I think, on 1 January 1991.
That is how Labor did it in power—and it was not an abuse of process, it was not arrogant. It was good process, and that is what this is. This is respecting the role of the Senate, ensuring that there is a committee inquiry and ensuring that there are plenty of hours to consider bills that have already been considered by the Senate on four previous occasions. I strongly endorse the motion that Senator Ellison has moved in relation to the hours and I strongly urge people to look very closely not at what Labor do or what they say but at what they actually do. Do not listen to what they say; look at what they do and you will see a massive conflict, a massive hypocrisy, and them speaking with forked tongues.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,BUSINESS,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-08,"—What a world it would be if we were to say that any malefaction is okay because somebody else practices it. I have heard this so often in parliament, but here we have the Minister for the Environment and Heritage saying we can do whatever Labor did wrong in its period in office because that justifies us doing it now. The fact is that the government is going to guillotine the debate on the Telstra legislation next week. That intention was exemplified by the minister just speaking for 20 minutes on a procedural matter.
I listened to the news last night and heard the word ‘filibuster’ come up frequently: that the opposition, the Greens and the Democrats were involved in a filibuster to slow down debate on the Telstra legislation. Well, (a) the Telstra legislation was not available and (b) it was not a filibuster. A filibuster is obstruction by using unnecessarily long speeches and bringing in irrelevant matters. What we have just heard from the minister is as close as you can get to that. Will we hear tonight that the government is involved in filibustering to delay and minimise debate on the Telstra bills? No, we will not. The government put it around the press gallery yesterday that there was a filibuster taking place, and some people ran with it, but it was wrong reporting.
Thank goodness we have a 20-minute restriction on speeches in this parliament. Otherwise, filibusters might occur. But they cannot and do not, unless you accept that what the minister just did was a full-on filibuster to try to minimise the amount of content debate there will be about the Telstra bills once they are brought into this place. They have not been brought in because the government has been engaged in manoeuvring the Senate into a position of minimal debate. That is what we are talking about at the moment. To try to excuse itself from the use of the guillotine on this day next week, the government is saying, ‘Well, we will have everybody sit on Monday and Tuesday night to deal with non-urgent legislation.’ The background is that the Prime Minister, amongst others, says that there may be no sale of Telstra for 12 months. Goodness! It might not be for years. The Future Fund might absorb it all. He wants to maximise the sale of government shares but reduce it so that the government no longer has a majority, because he has shown himself to be totally incapable of handling that authority wisely and with due prudence—witness the events of the last few days.
Senator Coonan, who is going to be in charge of the legislation, has said repeatedly in the last week in this place that the Senate will follow due process. This is not due process. She said that the normal processes of the Senate will be followed. This is not the normal process of the Senate. She said that we have to take a very measured approach. It is not a measured approach if you are aiming to gag debate in the Senate. And she said, ‘We will not abuse Senate norms.’ Senate norms are being abused here. So the truth is not in the words that are coming from government ministers; it is in the actions that say that they have a majority in the Senate. National Party senators are at the moment, without exception, absent from the debate in the chamber on the process of the Telstra legislation—and I think I should draw your attention, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, to the state of the House. Maybe some National Party people will then come in for this debate. (Quorum formed)

While we proceed without National Party senators in their seats, before I sit down I nevertheless just want to respond to one thing that the minister was talking about a while ago—that is, events earlier today. I recommend to the government that the National Party has its whip attend the whips meetings—we are talking about Senator McGauran, in particular—and then the government will not get into the mess that it got into this morning over the motion from Senator Allison and Senator McLucas on the millennium goals.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—Senator McGauran, in a three-second visit to his seat—he has gone again—said that it clashes with him being in the Senate. He needs a deputy who can go to the meetings, otherwise the government is going to find itself in even more embarrassing situations in the future, and the Senate is going to be delayed. Debates like this are going to be delayed not by the Greens or the opposition but by the government’s mismanagement, which was so evident this morning.
Very briefly, I want to say this: let us not have any hogwash about there being a government in control of the Senate that thinks of itself as having responsibilities to the Senate which would see that a fair go pertains in here. That is not what this is about. It is simply the sledgehammer of a majority government converting the Senate into a rubber stamp. It would have been foolish to have thought otherwise, and that is what we are seeing here. The Prime Minister’s and the government’s time-honoured process is not to do it in one go; it is to do it by slow steps. We are seeing the erosion of the proper forms and proper debate of the Senate as a house of review and as a watchdog on government legislation by a government that treats the House of Representatives as a rubber stamp. And why would you not expect that? Of course that is what is going to happen.
Of course we are going to see the guillotine used repeatedly in this place, as we have not seen it used in the last 10 years. The government has a majority and, whenever it wants to, it is going to guillotine debate in here. Why is it going to do it next week? Because it is embarrassed about the public debate and it is embarrassed by the Prime Minister’s failure of performance in the last few days on Telstra—failure to be open with the people of Australia and, in particular, failure to ensure that important information about shareholdings got across to the minority shareholders in Telstra. That is just not embarrassing; it is totally wrong process. The Prime Minister has failed in his responsibility not only to the people of Australia but to Telstra shareholders. He has put them in a totally unfair and invidious situation. There will be more about that in the debate coming up.
The Greens do not support the changing of the sitting hours of the Senate for a non-urgent bill in a situation where the government has refused to hold a proper Senate inquiry process. That is a breach of good process. Senator Coonan’s asseverations of the last few weeks that the norms of this place would be upheld, and the Prime Minister’s similar public utterances over the last nine months that the Senate would not be abused, collapsed in a heap today.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ian Macdonald’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,BUSINESS,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-08,"—The principal aim of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005 is to correct a disparity in taxation and excise treatment between locally produced grape wine product and imported fresh wine product. That is a very important principle and I am going to make some remarks a little later about it, because it is not carried through with all alcohol products and it should be. The second principal aim is to more stringently define grape wine product, including an upper limit of 22 per cent alcohol content. The third principal aim is to remove a three per cent customs duty on imported business inputs without a domestic substitute which are subject to a tariff concession order.
The financial impact of the first two items is either difficult to quantify or negligible. But the financial impact of the third item is very substantial. It is estimated that the amendments relating to the removal of the three per cent customs duty that applies to goods which are the subject of a tariff concession order will result in duty forgone of $290 million in 2005-06, $320 million in 2007-08 and $340 million in 2008-09. I raise the quantum deliberately because the Democrats support this change. But, in supporting it, we recognise that the removal of inequities in taxation regimes, which also produce inefficiencies, is often costly. It is no good the government refusing one set of changes because of the cost to revenue when another set of changes, as a result of more effective or more intensive lobbying, is agreed to. The principle is right—if there is something in the law which needs correcting then correct it, even if it is at some cost.
I want to draw the attention of the chamber to an inequity in the spirits market which has emerged as a result of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. The agreement requires the abolition of the five per cent ad valorem customs duty applicable to imported bourbon. There is no similar provision for a reduction in customs duty for Bundaberg Rum exported from Australia and imported into the United States. United States ad valorem import duty will be phased out over nine years. This will disadvantage exports of Bundaberg Rum to the United States because of the immediate duty reduction of Australian import duty on imports of bourbon to Australia. That is one problem with rum.
Now let us look at a problem with cognac and French brandy. The system of taxation of brandy is not something that I agree with. I moved unsuccessfully to amend the 2002 act to remove the concessional excise duty rate for brandy. The Democrats position since 1999 has been that there is no policy reason why brandy should not be taxed at the same rate as spirits. Incidentally, that would produce additional revenue for the government. The concession favours imported French brandy, which pays a lower volumetric customs duty rate than the imported spirits with which the imported brandy competes. I do not think this should be a situation that the government continues with. At that time—and I have not had a look at the estimates since—the additional revenue was somewhere in the order of $3 million to $4 million. But a lot of that additional revenue would have come from imported brandy and would have resolved an anomaly in the system. The Treasurer’s view is that it is correct that brandy is taxed at a lower rate than other spirits. Why is brandy regarded as a more beneficial spirit in Australia than rum? It is a pretty weird policy decision. The government says that this concession was introduced to support the domestic industry and the government does not intend at this time to make any changes.
Then we have the situation with imported spirits. I have also recommended that the five per cent ad valorem protected tariff for imported spirits and imported ready-to-drinks be abolished. There is no similar protective rate for imported beer and there is no evident policy justification for retention of this discriminatory revenue-raising tariff. The answer from the government is that there is no protective tariff on imported beer because Australia made a commitment to the World Trade Organisation in the Uruguay Round to not introduce a tariff on imported beer and no such commitment was given on imported spirits. But you do not do one thing because you have made a commitment elsewhere and then, in the same broad category of alcohol product, do another thing. All I am saying to the government is that it has done the right thing in this bill by addressing anomalies, removing inequities and making the system clearer and more coherent. But it still has more work to do in the areas of imported spirits, brandy and beer.",SENATE,"<title>

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-09-08,"—Labor supports the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005, which will insert an upper limit for the alcoholic content of grape wine and also remove the three per cent customs duty which currently applies to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concession order. The bill amends additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 of the tariff to insert the upper limit of alcohol content of grape wine of 22 per cent. The financial impact of the proposed amendment to addition note 3(a) to chapter 22 is difficult to quantify. But it is expected that it may result in a small increase in government revenue.
Item 1 of schedule 3, which amends the upper alcohol limit of grape wine, will bring the tariff into line with the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 to ensure imported wine made from fresh grapes will attract customs duty at the same rate as the locally produced product. The bill will also define grape wine products.
Items 2 and 3 relate to the definition of mock Irish cream and wine based cream beverages. While the financial impact of these measures relating to the insertion of references to additional note 4 into tariff subheadings is negligible, it is important to clarify a point in the Attorney-General’s speech. People going back to look at that speech may seek to understand the effect of this bill through it or through the explanatory memorandum and it could in some way lead to—dare I say it—confusion as to the treatment of products collectively known as ‘Irish cream’.
Real Irish cream is made from whiskey and has an alcohol content of around 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Bailey’s Irish Cream and Feeney’s Irish Cream are examples of such products, although Irish creams are certainly not limited to those excellent products. The imported spirit based Irish cream is subject to the excise equivalent rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol plus a five per cent customs duty. A similar locally manufactured product is subject to the excise rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol. These whiskey based products are not affected by these changes.
The product referred to by the minister is an imitation product with a substitute grape wine base and has an alcohol content of between 11 per cent and 12 per cent. Names are the only way of describing the product, and O’Mara’s Irish Cream is an example of such a product—I am certain it is not the only example. Imported wine based Irish cream was subject to the excise regime and paid the excise equivalent rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol plus five per cent customs duty. Similar locally manufactured products attracted the wine equalisation tax—the WET, as it has been commonly referred to, plus GST.
Post 1 July 2005, wine based products will be subject to the wine equalisation tax, at a rate of 29 per cent of the value of the taxable importation, which is based on customs value plus customs duty—in this instance, that is zero—plus international transport insurance plus GST. Labor supports the removal of the customs duty on business inputs which are subject to the tariff concession order.
Australian businesses will benefit from the removal of this duty and will save almost $300 million this financial year from this change. It is estimated that the amendment relating to the removal of the three per cent customs duty that applies to goods which are subject to a TCO will result in forgone duty of about $290 million in 2005-06 and up to $320 million in 2007-08 and $340 million in 2008-09. That represents a real saving for Australian businesses and Labor is pleased to be able to support that.",SENATE,"<title>

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to speak on the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 and the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. I indicate at the outset that the Labor Party supports these measures with one very serious reservation.
The purpose of the bills before the Senate is to ensure a more efficient handling of asbestos-related condition common-law claims against the Commonwealth. These bills seek to centralise the management of asbestos-related condition common-law claims against the Commonwealth within Comcare. It will achieve this by transferring the liability for such claims from the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities to Comcare, and the bills will give Comcare the legislative authority to manage common-law claims against the Commonwealth. Comcare will also have the authority to manage claims from former waterside workers whose asbestos claims are currently managed by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. That is one of the issues raised in the legislation with which Labor has concerns.
The majority of common-law asbestos claims against the Commonwealth are currently managed by the particular agencies against which the claims are made. It is estimated that the Commonwealth’s asbestos liabilities over the next half century will be nearly $1 billion. We understand from advice provided by the government that this legislation is not expected to have any significant effect on the level of asbestos liabilities.
The government has proposed that Defence related common-law asbestos claims continue to be managed by the Department of Defence, as delegated to by Comcare. These arrangements will be reviewed by July next year. The fact that this is occurring is an aspect that is relevant to the issue that the shadow minister, the member for Perth, has raised with the minister and also in the other place.
Statutory claims made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 are not included in the application of these bills, and claims made under those acts will continue to be managed by Comcare and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. For good reasons, in the past the Commonwealth has treated these areas as specialised and separate areas and it is proposed under this legislation that two of them continue as such.
As indicated, the area where Labor has serious reservations is the proposed repeal of three pieces of legislation which support the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee and the proposed abolition of the committee itself. The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee currently resolves common-law claims from waterside workers or their widows which arise from exposure to asbestos related cargoes. The government is proposing in this legislation that these claims would become the responsibility of Comcare. If one goes to some of the background work that was done in preparation for the drafting of these pieces of legislation—and I refer particularly to the interdepartmental committee—one sees that a report was prepared by Trowbridge Deloittes on the Australian government asbestos liabilities. This was prepared at the request of the Department of Finance and Administration and led to the establishment of the interdepartmental committee. That report makes it clear that stevedoring related claims are a very specialised case of asbestos claim. At page 55 of this report, dated October 2003, in attachment 1, the following appears:
... the vast majority of the Australian Government’s—
or the Commonwealth’s—
claims cost is managed in ... two places—the Defence Asbestos Litigation Cell (ALC) and the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (SIFC).
Under this legislation, the government has obviously found good reasons to keep the Defence Asbestos Litigation Cell, or the defence area, compartmentalised and specialised. Our concern is that the Commonwealth government has not put its mind carefully enough to whether or not that should continue to be the case for the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. It is estimated in the actuarial report to which I have referred that the ongoing potential liability to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is over $230 million. That is out of a total estimated cost of just under $1 billion—effectively almost a quarter of the Commonwealth’s liability.
Our understanding is that there has been inadequate consultation with both the stevedoring industry and the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. This committee is made up of an independent chairperson, representatives of both stevedoring employers and stevedoring employees, and a representative of the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Essentially, it is what I would describe as a tripartite committee—employer, employee and government, something this government perhaps has some difficulty with. The Department of Transport and Regional Services provides secretariat support to the committee on a cost recovery basis.
The committee is responsible for resolving common-law claims from waterside workers or their surviving partners on fair, just and responsible terms arising from exposure to asbestos related cargoes. In the course of its activities, the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee attempts to recover contributions from industry third parties or from insurance companies. The record of the committee is such that it is well regarded and it has established a well-earned reputation amongst both employers and employees in the stevedoring industry. Its reputation is one of a committee that resolves claims quickly and fairly. This is one of the great strengths of the specialised nature of its activity in this area.
One of the great tragedies and traumas of asbestos related diseases is that the incubation period is long but, once the adverse consequences of the disease come to light, it is a terribly debilitating disease and affliction. We have learnt over the years to, firstly, bring to those victims a degree of certainty, and, secondly, do our best to ensure that liabilities and damages are assessed by negotiation, by agreement or by settlement rather than by having ongoing adversarial claims. The great strength of the activity of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is that it deals with these matters quickly, fairly, equitably and in a way which minimises the ongoing trauma for the victims of these terrible diseases and also for their families. In a letter to Kevin Andrews, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, which I believe was previously discussed in the other place, the National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia made the following point:
... it is essential that the accumulated knowledge acquired over many years is retained to continue to assist claimants to achieve prompt, just and reasonable treatment in the processing of claims.
You would appreciate the nature of the illnesses that sustain such claims and the importance of responding in a manner that treats these workers with care, dignity and respect.
It is a straightforward question as to whether, given the ongoing and specialised nature of the stevedoring industry and the high regard in which people hold the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee in dealing with these claims in a prompt, efficient and just manner, the same arguments for specialised treatment for Defence and veterans’ claims also apply to the stevedoring industry. The lack of consultation makes it all the more important. We believe this issue ought to be considered seriously.
In closing, we flag that Labor in committee will be proposing that the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee be treated in a manner similar to that of the Defence committee under this bill—that is, that liabilities be transferred to the Commonwealth and delegated back to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee for management, and that a review of this be conducted by 31 August 2006, which is reasonably consistent with the review which will be conducted of Defence, which is to undergo review by July 2006. The Labor Party considers this should occur to enable the committee to continue with its work and to ensure the prompt, just and reasonable treatment of persons in the processing of claims. The review will also enable appropriate consultation with all the affected parties.",SENATE,<title>ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS (MANAGEMENT OF COMMONWEALTH LIABILITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-08,"—The Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 and the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 implement recommendations made by an asbestos related disease interdepartmental committee established in 2002 to review the management of asbestos related compensation claims against the Australian government. Together these bills facilitate the transfer of the Commonwealth’s common-law liability for claims for asbestos related conditions from federal agencies and government business enterprises to the Commonwealth’s statutory authority responsible for workplace safety, rehabilitation and compensation in the Commonwealth jurisdiction—Comcare.
The explanatory memorandum explains that Comcare is established as a separate legal entity with the legal liability to pay compensation to employees or former employees of the Australian government in accordance with the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. As I understand it, the bills will allow Comcare to assume the whole of the Australian government’s common-law liability not only for government employees or past government employees with asbestos related conditions but also for any person or dependant who claims to have suffered damage from exposure to asbestos for which the Australian government may be liable. That seems a sensible principle. This would include former waterside workers, contractors and subcontractors, tenants of Australian government owned and/or constructed premises, family members of employees who were themselves exposed through contaminated clothing or other means, visitors, bystanders, and dependants of persons in any of the above categories.
As noted in the Bills Digest to these bills, the scale of the asbestos compensation problem in Australia was highlighted in 2004 by the inquiry commissioned by the New South Wales government into the management of asbestos related liabilities by the James Hardie group of companies. However, as the Bills Digest also notes, asbestos claims are not limited to those who worked in asbestos mines and factories. Former power station, shipyard and dock workers; railway labourers; and members of the Defence Force, especially the Navy, are at significant risk from asbestos related diseases.
Asbestos was used widely throughout Australia last century. It is a dangerous substance. Unfortunately, asbestos related diseases may still take many more years after exposure to manifest themselves. As noted in the Bills Digest, mesothelioma is especially insidious. Very slight exposure to asbestos fibre may cause it, and the disease may not manifest itself until 40 or more years after the exposure but, when it does, the course of the disease is most often short, very painful and fatal.
It was not only in Australia that asbestos was treated far too casually. In the Middleveld of southern Rhodesia, as it was called then, there were two asbestos mining villages in Mashaba and Shabani. I remember as a schoolboy at my boarding school in nearby Fort Victoria, now called Masvingo, being taken on a school excursion to these asbestos mines. We were taken down and around the mine with no hard hats, no safety clothing at all, just in our normal school clothes. It is amazing in retrospect, but nobody thought anything of it at the time.
The Bills Digest also notes that, since 1945, about 7,000 Australians have died from this disease, estimated to rise to 18,000 by 2020. Other asbestos related cancers may present in around 30,000 to 40,000 people by the same time. Those are huge numbers. For those people affected by asbestos now and in the future, it is critical that the Commonwealth is able to meet liability and provide appropriate compensation efficiently and in a timely and kindly manner. It is my understanding that the asbestos related disease interdepartmental committee made the recommendation to transfer liability for asbestos related claims to Comcare based on the view that the decentralised approach was resulting in some inefficiencies and inconsistencies in case management across portfolios, including inconsistent admissions of liability. Once again, that seems a reasonable conclusion to draw.
It is also my understanding that the transfer of all Commonwealth common-law liability claims for asbestos related conditions will result in the centralisation of the management of these claims and will presumably lead to more consistent decision making efficiencies and more and better outcomes. Where appropriate, the Democrats do support the centralisation of regimes and agencies that deal with similar issues and laws. For example, the Democrats supported a single national approach to finance, corporations and trade practice law, just like we support a single national industrial relations regime because it would reduce the complexities and inefficiencies of six separate systems with overlapping laws and regulations. The Democrats support the intent of these bills and believe they will result in speedier claims for sufferers of asbestos related diseases and their dependants—and I hope our belief is proven to be accurate.
I note from the government’s second reading speech in the House of Representatives that the government proposes that statutory claims made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986; and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 are not included in the application of these bills, and claims made under these acts will continue to be managed by Comcare and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I also note that Defence related common law asbestos claims will also continue to be managed by the Department of Defence at the delegation of Comcare, pending a review of these arrangements by July 2006. As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I should remark that we often have to deal with Defence’s inefficiencies and inadequacies on many fronts as identified by the Auditor-General. I do hope the Department of Defence are better in this area than they are in some other areas which have drawn criticism from all sides of Senate and parliamentary committees.
As has already been mentioned by Labor, there are concerns within the stevedoring industry that shifting responsibility for processing claims from the industry specific Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to Comcare will result in delays. It is my understanding that the stevedoring industry, along with Defence, have the vast majority of claims at present, so there will be a significantly large number of people affected by these bills. I have also been told that the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is well regarded and that it has established a well-earned reputation within the stevedoring industry of resolving claims quickly and fairly. This is a valuable attribute when dealing with sufferers of asbestos related illness and their families.
The government argue that the SIFC claims are not considered as sensitive to national security as those claims made with Defence, which is why there is a review process for Defence to give Comcare the experience of handling asbestos claims before Defence’s responsibilities are transferred. We are told that, if SIFC as well as Defence were excluded from centralisation, only 25 per cent of the government’s asbestos liabilities would be centralised. The government believes that excluding the SIFC’s claims is likely to make the centralisation initiative non-viable as there needs to be a certain volume of claims in order to achieve the benefits of centralisation. I do not have the means to test that opinion, but it does not seem a plausible argument, at least on the face of it.
Others have raised concerns about the possibility of caps on the amount of compensation available as a result of the bills. While Comcare’s liabilities are governed by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which prohibits a court from awarding a payout higher than $110,000 for non-economic loss, these bills are expressly concerned with common law claims from non-Commonwealth employees, which are not governed by the SRC Act. Even if a dependant of a Commonwealth employee made a claim under the SRC Act, it seems they could expect to receive up to $320,000 or more, based on the statutory benefits payable. The cap only applies if the dependant or his estate elects to sue for non-economic loss in lieu of accepting the statutory benefits for permanent impairment. The likelihood of this seems remote.
I was concerned to hear that, despite the establishment of a task force, the key stakeholders within the stevedoring industry and the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee believe that they were not adequately consulted. Once again, I have no means of testing that proposition. The government have reported that they had consulted extensively with the Department of Transport and Regional Services, who were on the interdepartmental committee examining this issue. The transport department briefed the SIFC on developments and made the SIFC aware of the government’s intention to centralise management of asbestos common-law claims, but the transport department probably did not consult as adequately as it should have.
I think, given some of the valid issues raised by the industry, it is not unreasonable for the stevedoring industry to be given the same treatment as Defence and, like Defence, for the arrangements to be reviewed by July 2006—which is only nine months away. I will listen carefully to the minister when the minister speaks to the bills in the committee stage but, as things stand at present, it is likely that the Democrats would be inclined to support Labor’s amendment to allow the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to process claims for the stevedoring industry until July 2006, when the arrangement should be reviewed. Having said that we would support the amendment, we do of course support the bill.",SENATE,<title>ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS (MANAGEMENT OF COMMONWEALTH LIABILITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to speak to the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 and the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 to make some brief remarks in respect of this issue. The issues of asbestos disease and how the Commonwealth deals with claims are vital for thousands of Australian workers. For many years asbestos was a hidden killer, and I am sad to say that in the years and decades ahead asbestos related diseases will claim many more lives. There is currently no known cure for asbestos-caused diseases and, as we now know, there is no safe level of exposure to asbestos. As little as one fibre lodged in the lung is enough to kill. Asbestos diseases can take 10 to 75 years to appear, and generally there are no symptoms at all until the victim becomes ill.
The Commonwealth must have an effective system in place for dealing with asbestos related disease claims. Sadly, this is because Australia already has the highest rate of asbestos disease in the world. Tens of thousands of Australian workers are dying, or have already died, as a result of exposure to asbestos during their working lives. It is expected that 40,000 Australians will contract asbestos related diseases over the next 40 years. More than 14,000 are expected to develop the deadly disease mesothelioma. At least 10 Australians die each week from an asbestos disease and in the coming years this could increase as a new wave of victims joins those who were exposed to asbestos in the workplace. Those figures relate to those that are known cases. There are many, many thousands of Australians who have died in years past with asbestos related diseases that have never been diagnosed in that form.
Who are these people? They are you, they are me, they are our neighbours, they are our colleagues, they are our friends and they are our relatives. Estimates are that up to two-thirds of homes built in Australia up to the mid-eighties contained asbestos products. How many of us have engaged in that great Australian pastime of do-it-yourself around the house? How many Australians have been exposed while innocently putting a screw in a wall to hang a picture of their loved ones? It is a sobering thought that even the most innoxious of chores around the home, of placing tiles or nailing up a family photo, could have led to any one of us being exposed to asbestos fibres.
I do not want to be alarmist about what we face, but neither am I prepared to see us put our heads in the sand. That is why Labor supports the Asbestos-Related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005. This bill centralises the management of asbestos related common-law claims against the Commonwealth within Comcare. Comcare, rather than the Commonwealth—Commonwealth authorities or government business enterprises—will now be liable for claims. The bill also provides Comcare with the additional function of assuming and managing all Commonwealth ARC liabilities. Furthermore, it will provide financial arrangements for Comcare to meet all its assumed liability. With the Commonwealth’s asbestos liabilities over the next 50 years estimated to be in the region of nearly $1 billion, this is very timely legislation.
Labor hopes that this bill will eradicate the inefficiencies and inconsistencies that currently exist due to claims being handled across different portfolios. Integrating the management of asbestos claims against the Commonwealth will lead to more consistent decision making and more equitable and efficient outcomes. It should result in a much-needed standardisation in the Commonwealth’s approach to management of asbestos claims.
But as well as having a responsibility to effectively manage its own asbestos liabilities, the Commonwealth must also ensure that industry does the right thing by Australian workers. We all know about James Hardie’s attempts to avoid their responsibilities to thousands of Australians. Corporate restructures, asset stripping, PR campaigns and innumerable other dirty tricks were employed to deny former workers their rightful compensation. James Hardie CEO Peter MacDonald even went as far as to tell the media that he believed Hardie’s had no legal or moral obligation to the victims of asbestos disease. Fortunately, with the help of Labor state governments, the ACTU and, most importantly, a wonderful response from the Australian community, Hardie’s were forced to back down and come to an agreement with their victims.
Quite frankly, this situation should never have happened in the first place. Hardie’s were able to ruthlessly exploit loopholes in the federal Corporations Law that allowed them to establish asset protection schemes to avoid paying employee entitlements when their companies collapsed financially. Again, strong rumours abound that this company—despite what has gone on in the past, despite the promises made to victims of asbestos diseases, despite the negotiated agreement with the ACTU and the state Labor government of New South Wales—is still trying to find a mechanism in order to avoid its liabilities into the future.
This government must act to ensure that this company or any other company are never able to dodge their responsibilities to workers who have contracted an asbestos related disease in the workplace. This legislation is a positive step forward, but the fact remains that this government’s responsibilities do not end there. The Commonwealth must remain vigilant and prepared to act to ensure that all Australian victims of asbestos related diseases are treated fairly and equitably and that companies like James Hardie are not able to use loopholes in the law in order to avoid the responsibility that they have for every worker who, in the course of making profits for James Hardie, has been condemned to a much shorter life as a result of their exposure to asbestos.",SENATE,<title>ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS (MANAGEMENT OF COMMONWEALTH LIABILITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I indicate that Labor and I broadly support the bills before the Senate today: the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 and the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. Labor support the intention of dealing with all asbestos related condition common-law claims made against the Commonwealth under the umbrella of one central agency—in this case, Comcare. It makes sense for the Commonwealth and it makes sense for the victims. Labor can see the potential cost savings in this exercise but, more importantly, we can see the potential to avoid inconsistencies in the management of claims. Integrating the management of asbestos related claims made against the Commonwealth will lead to more consistent decision making and more equitable and efficient outcomes. As it is today, claims are dealt with by the agencies against whom the claims have been made. This has led to inconsistencies in the outcomes of claims across the agencies, and that is not right.
Comcare’s current legislative authority allows it to manage asbestos related disease claims only from current and former employees of the government, and their dependants. This legislation will make Comcare, rather than Commonwealth authorities or government business enterprises, liable for all asbestos related condition common-law claims. It will provide Comcare with the additional function of assuming and managing all Commonwealth asbestos related liabilities and it will provide financial arrangements for Comcare to meet all its assumed liabilities. The Commonwealth’s asbestos related liabilities over the next 50 years have been estimated to be nearly $1 billion, the majority of which will be common-law claims. Comcare will be fully funded for the cost of managing these claims.
The government has proposed that defence related common-law claims will continue to be managed by the Department of Defence as delegated to by Comcare. This is due to the specialised nature of most of these claims and the expertise possessed by the Department of Defence in dealing with them. More than a quarter of the Commonwealth’s asbestos related liabilities over the next 50 years are expected and predicted to be defence related. The government proposes that this arrangement be re-examined in July 2006. Likewise, statutory claims made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 are not included in the application of the bills before us, and thus claims made under these acts will continue to be managed by Comcare and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
The other area of asbestos related specialisation that the parliament for many years now has carved out from being dealt with generally are claims related to the stevedoring industry, and this has been for a very good reason. The government, with these bills, seeks to undo that arrangement and bring stevedoring asbestos related claims under the Comcare umbrella. Labor does not support this move. The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, established as a statutory authority in 1977, is a tripartite committee comprised of an independent chair, representatives of both stevedoring employers and employees and a representative of the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The predominant function of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is to resolve common-law claims from waterside workers or their widows on fair, just and responsible terms arising from exposure to asbestos related cargos. In the course of its activities, the committee seeks to recover contributions from industry, third parties or their insurance companies. The committee is well regarded and it has established a well-earned reputation among both employers and employees for resolving claims quickly and fairly.
The government did not undertake consultation with key stakeholders in the stevedoring industry before committing to this new arrangement. Labor does not believe that that is at all acceptable. The stevedoring industry is an equally specialised area to that of defence, and like defence the skill set and the experience possessed by those involved in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, acquired over many years, has ensured that claims have been dealt with promptly, justly and reasonably.
There is a risk that, by bringing stevedoring claims under the auspice of Comcare rather than that of the committee, significant expertise will be lost and claims may not be processed as efficiently and as justly as they are under the current arrangement. It is estimated that around a quarter of the Commonwealth’s asbestos related liabilities in the next 50 years will be related to stevedoring. Labor have an amendment before the Senate which, if passed, would give effect to the continuity of the arrangement in place currently and would have this arrangement reviewed in July 2006, the same time as the review in the defence related system would be taking place. This, we believe, is a sensible approach.
Why are we actually in this situation today? Why do we have to deal with the prospect of around $1 billion in liabilities due to asbestos in the first place? It is because companies such as James Hardie Industries were mining asbestos. Even after acquiring knowledge of the lethal effects of the product in the 1930s, it continued to mine and sell it. As a result, over the past 75 years, millions of Australians have been exposed to asbestos at work or through their jobs and at home, at schools and at many other public places around the country. More than 2,500 asbestos-caused deaths occur in Australia each year now. Sadly, this number is on a steep incline and will continue on that course for some time. Due to the long latency period between the exposure to asbestos fibres and the manifestation of asbestos related diseases, which is often up to 30 years or more, the epidemic of these diseases is yet to peak in Australia. It is expected that this will occur in or around the year 2023. As a society and as a community, we have another 20 or so years until we hit the peak of the problem. As many as 45,000 people, it is expected, may die from asbestos related diseases in Australia over the next two decades if effective medical treatments are not found.
By way of background, asbestos is a generic term applied to some mineral silicates of the serpentine and amphibole groups, whose characteristic feature is to crystallise in fibrous form. Until the late 1960s, Australian industry used both types of asbestos at rates of 75 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Subsequently, the use of chrysotile increased to approximately 95 per cent, while the use of blue and grey asbestos declined to five per cent. Asbestos is one of the most useful and versatile minerals known to man, mainly because of its unique properties—flexibility, tensile strength, insulation from heat and electricity and chemical inertness. It is the only natural mineral that can be spun and woven, like cotton or wool, into useful fibres and fabrics.
Over the years, more than 3,000 asbestos products and their uses have been identified. Most Australian homes contain asbestos products in one form or another. Asbestos has been used in fencing, asbestos pipes, thermal insulation, fireproofing, paints and sealants, textiles such as felts and theatre curtains, gaskets and friction products such as brake linings and clutches. During the peak building years, the fifties, sixties and seventies, asbestos found its way into most public buildings, including hospitals, schools, libraries, office blocks and factories. Workplaces such as ships’ engine rooms and power stations were heavily insulated with sprayed limpet asbestos. As such, asbestos diseases are no longer considered a problem isolated to the miners of the product.
Occupational exposure to lethal asbestos among former workers of the asbestos manufacturing industry, government railways, electrical commissions, wharves and building industries and among defence personnel in the Navy, Army and Air Force is now producing lung cancers, mesothelioma, asbestosis and pleural diseases of quite significant proportions. Tragically, asbestos related diseases not connected to occupation are also now emerging within the broader community. That is why we are facing this predicament now and that is why this legislation is so necessary.
The issue of asbestos and victims’ compensation is one that is close to my heart and one that I have addressed numerous times in the Senate since I took my place here. I have spoken at length about the appalling nature of James Hardie’s commitment to victims and about its lack of responsibility for its role in denying for so long, despite its own knowledge, the lethal effects of asbestos; its willingness to trade the product regardless of the consequences that it would cause; its dodgy corporate restructuring to avoid paying compensation to victims; and its refusal for so long to face its responsibilities and negotiate an outcome that would adequately compensate its victims. The saga continues today and it is still not resolved.
Despite the overtures of James Hardie, it alone is responsible for failing to sign the agreement negotiated between itself and the New South Wales government last year, still to this day. Its latest distractions are quite disgraceful. Let me take this opportunity to read into Hansard the editorial from 21 August this year in the Sunday Herald Sun under the headline ‘Shame the shameless’:
Building products company James Hardie Industries has again acted like it cares less for victims of asbestos than for its bottom line.
It has turned in another woeful public relations exercise—blaming delays in the finalisation of its compensation package on hiccups in negotiations with the NSW Government and a pending federal tax ruling.
In place of answers demanded by widows and fatherless children, Hardie has offered more excuses a year after promising a solution.
While announcing a big jump in profit, the company has fuelled perceptions of arrogance by flirting with the disposal of Australian assets because its domestic performance has been flat due to union bans and customer concerns over its asbestos policies.
Potential beneficiaries of compensation are entitled to be furious with frustration and indignation on the back of chairwoman Meredith Hellicar’s assertion last year that an end to the anxiety was at hand. Now, in response to rumours about Hardie fleeing Australia, she says: ‘I don’t know if the sun will rise tomorrow morning.’
Chief executive Louis Gries had as much regard for asbestos victims, as opposed to Hardie shareholders, when he refused to rule out the 110-year-old company’s exit from Australia. His limp response: ‘Like any other CEO, I cannot tell you what may happen in 40 years.’
So much for victims of asbestos-related diseases in which death is an agonising process involving pain and panic. So much for their loved ones who are helpless to do more than share the torture.
I must say that I do not usually subscribe to the editorial policies of the Herald Sun, but on this occasion I could not agree more with its sentiments. This company, as I have said on many occasions, is an absolute disgrace. In seeking to have the Australian Taxation Office and/or even the Australian government write off James Hardie’s $600 million corporate tax bill for compensation payments made to victims, James Hardie is proving how low it is willing to go to avoid its responsibilities and to prop up its bottom line. Why should the Australian taxpayer forgo $600 million in corporate tax revenue to prop up James Hardie’s bottom line, despite that very company’s lack of respect for Australia and its Australian victims?
James Hardie has been in negotiations with the ATO for around eight months now, and that is eight months during which victims have continued to wait for compensation or even the prospect of the agreement regarding compensation payments being signed. While it is an unconscionable act by any decent standard, this is just the form we have come to expect from this disgraceful company. Following my speech to the Senate on 25 November 2003 regarding Asbestos Awareness Week, in which I first canvassed concerns about James Hardie’s inadequate funding of the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, I received a letter from Mr Greg Baxter, the Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs, of James Hardie Industries.
In my speech I referred to a number of quotes made by Mr Peter Gordon from the law firm Slater and Gordon in an advertorial featured in the Herald Sun on 25 November 2003. In his letter to me dated 28 November 2003, Mr Baxter put to me:
Mr Gordon also claims that James Hardie set up a company with “clearly inadequate funding to deal with compensation...”. This is also incorrect. The Foundation that was established by James Hardie was vested with all of the assets of the two former subsidiaries that had manufactured asbestos containing products, as well as an additional $90 million beyond any legal obligation owed by these subsidiaries. This additional amount, enabled the Foundation to be established with assets that actuarial advice indicated would be sufficient to meet all expected future claims.
As I said subsequently, that claim was proven to be nothing more than a sick joke. In February last year, the New South Wales government launched a special commission of inquiry into the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, the fund set up by James Hardie to compensate asbestos victims referred to in Mr Baxter’s letter. At page 7 of his report, under section 1.4, Commissioner Jackson QC stated:
The Foundation’s funds are being quickly used up in the payment of current claims against Amaca and Amaba.
These are the two subsidiary companies referred to by Mr Baxter in his letter to me. In the opinion of Commissioner Jackson:
... they will be exhausted in the first half of 2007 and it has no prospect of meeting the liabilities of Amaca and Amaba in either the medium or the long term.
Indeed, the commission of inquiry proved Mr Gordon’s claims correct after all. In doing so, the commission totally debunked Mr Baxter’s claims and left him and his argument with no credibility whatsoever. Mr Baxter’s letter, full of mistruths and disingenuous statements as it was, did indeed make one fair point. In closing his letter to me, Mr Baxter wrote:
We believe it is not only important that the facts about James Hardie and asbestos are widely known and well understood, we think it is also imperative that a comprehensive solution is developed to address the broader issues now confronting the wider community.
That is true, and that comprehensive solution, by way of the agreement negotiated between the New South Wales government and James Hardie Industries last year, is still awaiting James Hardie’s signature. It is high time James Hardie let up on its diversions, signed the agreement and faced its compensation responsibilities.
The other point in Mr Baxter’s letter I would like to refer the Senate to is the responsibility that he tried to transfer from James Hardie to the government and to the legislature. I think this is a fair warning to all members of parliament and senators. I quote one section of the letter, which I will seek leave to incorporate so that all senators who are interested can look at it:
Mr Gordon cites medical evidence as long ago as the 30’s that proved that asbestos was ‘toxic’. If this evidence had been widely accepted, why was asbestos not banned in the 30’s. Equally, why was it used by hundred of companies in Australia in more than 3000 products (as you yourself noted), for another 50 years? And, why was the use of asbestos regulated by Australian state and federal governments and specified by government authorities for use in government enterprises in industry, utilities, defence, housing and for other applications?
The use of asbestos by former subsidiaries of James Hardie was regulated in accordance with the various government health and other regulations at the time and government health inspectors regularly reviewed and approved the manner in which asbestos was being used and the exposure levels that existed in the facilities managed by former subsidiaries of the James Hardie group.
Let us not be under any doubt—James Hardie, which deliberately denied public knowledge of the evidence of how lethal this product was—knowledge that it was well aware of and that it knew about in the 1930s—kept it from government, kept it from the community and then has the audacity to write to me and try to put the responsibility on to the legislature for not banning the product and using the fact that it had not been banned as justification for discounting the evidence that was available at the time.
I think it is an appalling situation for a company to be in. I do not know whether Mr Greg Baxter is still the Executive Vice President of James Hardie. He ought not be the executive vice president of any company, in this country or anywhere else. James Hardie is a disgrace. There is an interesting comparison this week, with the Prime Minister, John Howard, labelling Telstra a disgrace for simply telling the truth. Well, I have labelled James Hardie a disgrace for peddling a product which it knew would kill people. It knew it would kill people’s families, it did not tell people and it does not responsibly live up to its obligations. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of the letter to me from Mr Greg Baxter dated 28 November 2003.
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
28 November 2003
Senator The Hon. Gavin Marshall
Dear Senator

Re: Asbestos Awareness Week

We read with interest your statement to the Senate of Tuesday November 25, 2003 about Asbestos Awareness Week.
We agree with you that asbestos related diseases are a serious issue and that there is a pressing need for further education and better health care and that those responsible for causing these diseases compensate those affected.
It was interesting that you quoted from an advertising article in the Herald-Sun of November 24 by Mr Peter Gordon of the law firm Slater & Gordon in which he was highly critical of James Hardie. Your comment that “this company is an absolute disgrace” suggests that you subscribe to Mr Gordon’s view.
We have written to the Herald-Sun about Mr Gordon’s advertorial. Many, if not all of the assertions made by Mr Gordon about James Hardie companies are unsubstantiated and incorrect. I will deal with a few examples here to illustrate.
Mr Gordon claims that the James Hardie group’s corporate restructuring in 2001 was a way for it to limit its liability. It was not, as the substantial amount of documentation on the public record will demonstrate. We are happy to provide you with copies of this material and also note that the corporate restructuring, which was unrelated to asbestos, was approved by FIRB and ASIC and involved a Scheme of Arrangement that required court and shareholder approval. As a result, the restructuring was the subject of substantial public documentation and considerable public and media scrutiny.
Mr Gordon also claims that James Hardie set up a company with “clearly inadequate funding to deal with compensation...”. This is also incorrect. The Foundation that was established by James Hardie was vested with all of the assets of the two former subsidiaries that had manufactured asbestos containing products, as well as an additional $90 million beyond any legal obligation owed by these subsidiaries. This additional amount, enabled the Foundation to be established with assets that actuarial advice indicated would be sufficient to meet all expected future claims.
The Foundation was vested with $296 million in 2001 and still has about $250 million according to its latest accounts, filed with ASIC in October. This amount, of course, will continue to grow as it generates returns over time. The total available for claims over the long-term will therefore be well in excess of this amount. Clearly there is no funding crisis today, and claimants can apply to and receive compensation from the Foundation.
Additionally, even though the Foundation now claims that its funds may be insufficient, it has not disclosed the details of this and it should be noted that its latest forecast of future claims costs is in fact based on the accounting standard it is required to use to assess its contingent liabilities. The amount of the contingent liability does not mean that this it what claims will ultimately cost.
Mr Gordon also claims that one of the insurers to former James Hardie group companies, sued because the dangers of asbestos had been concealed from it. This is also incorrect. In fact, that claim was settled in favour of the relevant James Hardie entity.
Perhaps Mr Gordon’s most offensive claim is that the company knew that its asbestos products would maim or kill people and knowingly did nothing about it. This is also wrong. There is too much evidence in this respect that can be sensibly summarised here. But, by way of example, the following is relevant.
Mr Gordon cites medical evidence as long ago as the 30s that proved that asbestos was ‘toxic’. If this evidence had been widely accepted, why was asbestos not banned in the 30’s. Equally, why was it used by hundred of companies in Australia in more than 3000 products (as you yourself noted), for another 50 years? And, why was the use of asbestos regulated by Australian state and federal governments and specified by government authorities for use in government enterprises in industry, utilities, defence, housing and for other applications?
The use of asbestos by former subsidiaries of James Hardie was regulated in accordance with the various government health and other regulations at the time and government health inspectors regularly reviewed and approved the manner in which asbestos was being used and the exposure levels that existed in the facilities managed by former subsidiaries of the James Hardie group.
Your statement to the Senate rightly refers to the widespread use of asbestos by both the public and private sector, and the widespread exposure from many, many sources that occurred that is now having serious health consequences across the wider community.
The two former James Hardie subsidiaries that manufactured asbestos products are just two of about 150 private companies and government entities that now appear as defendants in asbestos cases. And, these two former subsidiaries—that are now part of the Foundation—are involved in only about 15% of the claims now appearing in Australia.
If the Foundation is correct in claiming that the incidence of asbestos diseases is growing rapidly and that it may not have adequate funds to compensate those affected, it is reasonable to assume that this is a national, community wide problem, with implications for the many private and public sector entities involved, including of course the 85% of claims that do not involve the former subsidiaries of James Hardie.
This wider issue is where public attention should be directed. There needs to be greater community awareness, more funds for medical research and fairer, faster and more efficient ways of dealing with claims, so that claimants are the primary beneficiaries. Blaming James Hardie will not achieve any of these outcomes.
Mr Gordon goes on to accuse James Hardie of doing nothing to ease the pain and suffering of people suffering from asbestos diseases. He fails to mention that James Hardie has done more than any other company in the world to minimise the effects of asbestos and was the first company in the world to find a replacement for asbestos fibres in its products. Nor does he mention that James Hardie companies have been and remain the largest contributors to medical research into asbestos diseases in Australia.
Mr Gordon’s article, and your interpretation of it, positions James Hardie as responsible for all of Australia’s asbestos problems. This is clearly incorrect.
We have made numerous offers in recent weeks to brief Federal and State governments and the relevant Opposition spokespeople about how and why the Foundation was established and to explain the company’s current position. We are happy to extend this offer to you personally. If you are interested, we will readily travel to your offices in either Victoria or Canberra to conduct this briefing.
We believe it is not only important that the facts about James Hardie and asbestos are widely known and well understood, we think it is also imperative that a comprehensive solution is developed to address the broader issues now confronting the wider community.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours Sincerely

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-09-08,"—There are more than 2,500 asbestos-caused deaths in Australia each and every year. It can take up to 30 years, sometimes longer, after asbestos exposure before diagnosis of asbestos-caused disease, so the epidemic of those diseases is yet to peak in Australia. That peak will not be until around the year 2023. Unless effective treatments are found, asbestos-caused disease will kill as many as 45,000 people in the next two decades.
In my home state of Western Australia, we are in the unfortunate position of having the highest rate of malignant mesothelioma in the world. The majority of those diagnosed will be dead within 12 months, and fewer than 15 per cent will live more than five years. The people who are diagnosed with this disease are many and come from all walks of life.
I would like to acknowledge the great work that is being done by the Asbestos Diseases Society and its advisory service in Perth in providing support and counselling for victims and their families, as well as raising community awareness of the issue and fundraising for research into the illness. The Asbestos Diseases Society has been doing an outstanding job of keeping our community informed about the issue, providing independent assessments of risk and balancing the extremes of public opinion. The society helps many people who have been diagnosed with asbestos-caused diseases, and their families, and has some terrible stories to tell.
For example, on race day in Wittenoom—a former mining town in Western Australia—mine workers and residents would compete to shovel asbestos tailings into oil drums. The race track was covered with asbestos tailings, as was the airport. Original settlers in the town used asbestos tailings throughout the town in order to break the monotony of the harsh, red Pilbara dust. Some families have lost three generations to asbestos-caused disease. One woman cared for both her father and her sons as they died of diseases caused by asbestos exposure, only to be diagnosed with mesothelioma herself a few years later.
Another woman was diagnosed at 39 and died less than 12 months later. Her only exposure was playing in the backyard as a child while her father tore down an old asbestos shed. There are the people who worked on nearby farms, who recycled the bags once used to carry asbestos. They would shake them out, then reuse them. Often, it was the children who helped with that job. There is the meticulous housewife who scrubbed her asbestos house clean and washed the blue dust from her husband’s work clothes, and the children who played in their blue sandpits—who ran to greet dad with a hug as he came home covered in blue dust from the mine. Then there are the workers.
By 1918, overseas insurance companies had begun to refuse life insurance policies for workers who were exposed to asbestos. It seems that they were noticing their unusually short life spans. By the 1930s, there was a substantial amount of scientific knowledge accumulated about the risks of asbestos exposure. None of this deterred industry from mining and manufacturing numerous products for domestic and industrial use. The member for O’Connor, a fellow Western Australian, claims that for many years asbestos was considered to be not only benign but very valuable.
While the risks may have been completely unknown to those who worked in and lived near the mines, during the life of the Wittenoom mine they were very well known to the mine owners and the insurance companies. I do not share the member for O’Connor’s view that ‘we have allowed this issue to go a little too far.’ Conditions in Western Australia’s Wittenoom mine were appalling. People who worked at, lived near, or visited the mine were exposed to lethal levels of blue asbestos a thousand times higher than occupationally regulated at the time. It is now estimated that over 25 per cent of all the men who worked in the mines will die of asbestos-related diseases.
Masks and hard hats were worn for promotional photos but were not a daily requirement at the mine. Unofficial photographs from the time show the miners, wearing nothing but shorts and shoes, packing blue asbestos into hessian bags. It was 20 years before CSR bothered to bore an air hole to supply the mine workers with fresh air. The dust in the mine often got so bad that workers needed floodlights to see through it. The men worked in conditions like this for hours on end, even though one minute of such exposure would have been enough to cause lung cancer or mesothelioma. There are even stories of workers using the raw asbestos fibres as dental floss.
It is not just miners who were put at serious risk from asbestos exposure. Many more were exposed on the waterfront where raw asbestos was brought from Australian mines and from overseas. The manufacturing workers who created products that were then sent to construction sites and workshops—builders, carpenters, tradespeople, labourers, fitters and welders—were exposed. Then there are the workers, teachers and students exposed to deteriorating asbestos insulating material in offices and schools across the nation. These are the people who built this country, and they are paying with their lives and the lives of their families.
Research into asbestos-related disease is virtually non-existent—except in Western Australia. Professors Bill Musk and Bruce Robinson and their colleagues have won a number of awards for their work, and the asbestos related disease research at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital is more advanced than anywhere in the world. There are three standard treatment strategies for any cancer: surgery to remove it, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Unfortunately, none are effective with mesothelioma. Surgery is ineffective because it is impossible to remove it all, and even removing most of the tumour does not really improve the chances of survival—it simply adds an operation to the list of things a patient must endure. The tumour is very resistant to radiation, although radiation can help alleviate symptoms in some circumstances.
The mesothelioma research unit has developed a chemotherapy protocol in Perth which involves using several drugs which they have shown to be capable of killing mesothelioma cells in the test tube. Whilst this type of therapy has a good chance of shrinking mesothelioma tumours and reducing symptoms, at this stage any benefits are only temporary and, of course, the patient must still suffer the effects of chemotherapy. The researchers are currently investigating treatments which enhance the body’s own defences against cancers such as mesothelioma.
Given the importance of work like this, the lack of federal government support for this program is, in my view, inexcusable. The Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia sum it up well when they say:
The lack of financial support by the Federal Government condemns at least 2500 Australians per annum to a premature death (it is a national disgrace).
During the 2004 federal election, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, promised $35 million for research into asbestos related diseases. So far, none of the promised money has been spent. On the other hand, the Gallop Labor government should be congratulated for its support for this world-class program, and I call on the Howard government to stop neglecting this important program.
The majority of people afflicted with asbestos-caused diseases have these diseases because companies ignored scientific research that proved that exposure to asbestos could be fatal. These people deserve to be compensated, and those companies that are accountable must stop avoiding their responsibility. Labor supports any attempts to make this process of claiming compensation easier and more equitable for victims, and I am pleased to see the government taking on its share of the responsibility for this problem. However, it is of some concern that the people who are yet to discover an asbestos related condition may be unable to use clause 15 to seek additional compensation, thus effectively putting a cap on the amount of compensation they are entitled to. Given the long latency of the disease, this is obviously of great concern to those who have been exposed in the past. The Howard government has yet to resolve this issue, and I hope that it will do so soon.
Given the short life expectancy following diagnosis, it is not good enough to leave this issue to be decided in the courts. It is very clear that liability has been established. It is therefore important that victims are given a sense of certainty and compensation claims are assessed by negotiation rather than by protracted legal battles in the courts. Asbestos-caused diseases are being diagnosed at an increasing rate, and currently there is little good news for those diagnosed. Workers and their families, residents of mining towns and consumers of asbestos products have all suffered due to the negligence and greed of people who knew better. In the future, as I have said before, the numbers will continue to rise. The Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 and the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 are an important step in ensuring that some of the victims are provided with the compensation they are owed. I hope that the government will continue to pursue companies like James Hardie—as referred to by my colleagues Senator George Campbell and Senator Gavin Marshall—who have failed to take responsibility for their own negligence.
I would like to reiterate my appeal to the Howard government to provide funding to assist the mesothelioma research unit at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. These brilliant researchers are the best chance we have of finding an effective treatment for these terrible diseases, and they need our support. To neglect this important work is highly misguided. The people who stand to benefit from it deserve better.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-09-08,"—In question time yesterday Senator Marshall asked me a question about Telstra’s superannuation and I undertook in my answer to get him further information. I seek leave to incorporate the further information into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The additional information read as follows—
Senator Marshall asked me yesterday whether superannuation benefits for Telstra employees will continue after any sale of the Government’s remaining shareholding.
In March 2004, the Australian Government paid the Telstra Superannuation Scheme $3.125 billion in return for extinguishing the Australian Government’s liabilities to the Scheme.
I emphasise that this payment is to the Telstra Superannuation Scheme, not to Telstra itself.
Once the Australian Government ceases to hold majority ownership of Telstra, superannuation arrangements for Telstra employees will be a matter for Telstra. Telstra has an obligation, like all employers, to make contributions in respect of its employees.
Issues relating to membership of the Telstra Superannuation Scheme are also a matter for Telstra.
For those Telstra employees who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, membership will cease once the Australian Government ceases to hold majority ownership of Telstra, but the Government will continue to be responsible for meeting the obligations, going forward, in respect of the past service of those employees.
This is consistent with the agreement between the Government and Telstra referred to by Senator Marshall in his question yesterday.
It is also consistent with long standing Government policy, that contributory membership of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme ceases in circumstances where the Government has ceased to have control of a business unit, such as QANTAS.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,23,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked today relating to Telstra.
The position of Senator Coonan and, I am afraid, the Prime Minister over the question of the sale of Telstra is completely untenable. Mr Howard, Mr Costello and Senators Minchin and Coonan have known since at least 11 August this year of the state of the Telstra books, the state of the work force and, most importantly for my constituents, the state of the network. They have known the facts and they have taken the thoughtful, shall we say, decision not to disclose to the Australian community or, importantly, the current shareholders of Telstra the facts about the state of the network, the work force and the finances of Telstra. Those facts are absolutely central to the future of our communications system in this country and the Australian community was explicitly denied those facts by these people.
Yesterday, I am afraid, Mr Howard reverted to typical form in trying to hide behind some so-called legal advice that he ostensibly had that would not allow him to provide that information to the Australian community. Once again it has come back to the Labor Party to show Mr Howard the way and to explain to Mr Howard that not only was he legally entitled to provide that information to the Australian community and to shareholders, he was probably morally required to do so.
I am afraid it should not have been a question about legal responsibility. It should not have been a question about whether Mr Howard, Senator Coonan and others were legally bound not to provide the information to the community. Surely it was a question ethics. Surely it was a question of principle. Surely it was a question of honesty. This government should have come clean with the Australian community and told us all what the actual state of the books was, what the state of the work force was and what the state of the network was.
Mr Howard, Senator Coonan, Mr Costello and Senator Minchin were told on 11 August that Telstra has an ageing work force, it has underinvested over the last five years by up to $3 billion, 14 per cent of the lines of Telstra have faults, 14.3 million fault calls are received annually and the dividend policy that was in operation was unsustainable. What did the people who received this information from Telstra do? They took a conscious decision to do nothing and not provide that information to the Australian community and to the mum and dad shareholders that Mr Howard talks so caringly about all of the time. They made sure that those people who have invested in Telstra on the advice of this government were not provided with that information and could not make sensible decisions about their investment.
Why did they decide not to provide that information to the Australian community? They had to buy some time. Between 11 August and now, a deal had to be struck with the National Party. A deal had to be made between Senator Joyce and others and the government on the full sale of Telstra. They bought time in that period of time. Senator Joyce and others should be quite quizzical now. We are now in a situation where Senator Joyce has agreed to the sale of Telstra without knowing the state of the business—without knowing that the network is underinvested in and that the fault levels are much higher than any of us ever thought they were or than had previously been disclosed.
The voters of Australia should be truly concerned at the language we saw on Lateline, for example, last night. Senator Joyce is obviously trying to convince himself now that the deal he has apparently done with the government is something worth having. This deal delivers exactly what is being invested by the government in the network at the moment. The CEO, Mr Trujillo, says that the network is substandard and that, if we continue to invest at the rate we are investing, it will continue to be substandard. This is no deal that Senator Joyce has done. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-09-08,"—Today is a great day because from this debate we finally have an understanding of what the Labor Party’s telecommunications policy is. We have been searching for this for years. The Labor Party’s telecommunications policy is that they do not support $3.1 billion of investment in telecommunications infrastructure. I thank Senator McLucas for at least coming clean and telling us what that policy is. There was one little other one they talked about, but no-one actually believed them when they said they wanted to spend $5 billion on dial-up internet access. That was such a stupid joke that no-one took seriously.
I think that one of the great tragedies about this debate on telecommunications is the crocodile tears we have had from the other side in expressing sympathy for the mums and dads of Australia. They are doing every single thing in their power to ensure that the share price falls. They are luxuriating, as only the Labor Party can, in the demise of the share price of Telstra. They are getting behind closed doors back in their offices, seeing the share price and rubbing their hands together, saying, ‘Beauty, our campaign is working!’ You should be ashamed of yourselves and the crocodile tears you have been shedding in this debate.
If there is one other example of crocodile tears being shed, we had one yesterday, when Senator Evans came into this chamber and confected anger in relation to the referral of these telecommunications bills to a committee. It was the end of democracy as we knew it and the end of Senate process as we knew it! Some would say that I need to get a life because I listened to all 20 minutes of that speech. I thought that, when they call in the big guns—they had had Senator Conroy—like the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who is the most senior Labor Party person in this chamber, they must be serious about this, so it deserved my attention for 20 minutes and I should hear what he had to say. You can imagine my utter disbelief when, for 12½ minutes, there were only two people in this chamber sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. There were two people behind the most senior Labor Party member in this chamber, with his confected anger about due process, telecommunications, mums and dads and the reduction in the price of their Telstra shares. Two people came in to listen to it. One of those people had to be there because she is the Opposition Whip. Senator Carr was the only other person.
After about 12½ minutes, Senator Stephens came in. Do you know how long she lasted? Forty-five seconds. Her seat was barely warm before she left. She was obviously totally uninterested in this as well. It got even better. It was so dramatic sitting behind the most senior Labor Party member in this house that they had to get Senator Bartlett to go and sit beside the opposition whip, so at least there was someone behind Senator Evans. I do not mind having a sensible debate about telecommunications in this country, but I am not going to be lectured by a group of people who simply do not care, who have no policy and who have no intention of bringing one in.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,24,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2005-09-08,"—That was probably a ministerial performance, Senator Ronaldson. I am not sure how long you will have to wait to achieve your ambition of getting down onto the front bench. If you had the opportunity to sit on this side and look at your colleagues’ faces, I do not think that you would have to wait too long. You should see your coalition colleagues’ faces when Senator Coonan gets up and answers a question. For a start, Senator Minchin, Senator Macdonald and Senator Campbell clearly wince. I cannot work out what happens on Senator Kemp’s face because it always looks a little blank; I am not sure what is going on there.
I can tell you that there was a very strong move on today. I saw the kingmaker from New South Wales, Senator Bill Heffernan, and Bill’s head was hanging down. Every time Senator Coonan tries to make a point, struggling as she does every time she is given an opportunity by us to answer pertinent questions on this massive sale of government assets, she mucks it up. She clearly cannot answer the questions; she clearly cannot sell this policy. You should see the faces on the other side.
I have been advised by my colleagues in the House of Representatives that it is actually even worse there. Acting Deputy President Chapman, you probably know better than I do that whenever you see the Prime Minister—your party leader—under pressure or telling a little porky or two he physically reacts. He waves his arms about a bit like this. He is not as kempt as he normally is. Sometimes he does not comb his eyebrows. He acts a little sheepish because he is being sheepish. My colleagues tell me that it has been a particularly pathetic performance in the House of Representatives over the last few days.
The one thing the coalition is missing at the moment is a bedrock or an anchor. Where is he? Where is that anchor? Where is Peter at the moment? Peter is up in Indonesia getting his foreign affairs credentials so that when inevitably he attempts to take on the coalition leadership he will be able to present that to the waverers in the coalition as evidence that he has the necessary presence. My colleagues in the House of Representatives look at those on the other side in that chamber and also see them wince.
And it is not just the senior cabinet ministers who I have nominated this afternoon who wince in this chamber because Minister Coonan is here. The backbench, who are looking at unemployment if this charade continues, wince when they see the Prime Minister act in the way he has been acting. Why is that? It is because there is no bedrock for them. There is no-one to lift their spirits; there is no-one to take us on. It is a charade at the moment.
Can you believe that less than 10 weeks ago, with the fanfare of Imperial Rome, we were told that there was a brave new world about to start in this country because the government have control in the Senate? Only 10 weeks ago they said that this was going to assure authority and stability in this place. But what has happened? It has been a sham. What has happened in terms of this whole Telstra sale? We have the farcical situation where the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is today actually raiding Telstra offices and pulling out emails. We have had one of these imported Yanks who have been put on the Telstra payroll telling people that he would not advise his own mother to buy shares in Telstra. They are not prepared to guarantee jobs or services once this organisation is sold.
This has happened since you have had total power in this country. What a complete joke this coalition government is. As I said, when we see Senator Coonan attempt to answer questions in this place, we can see the nooses at the back. I am glad we saw a good strong performance from Ronno today because he is clearly coming down here shortly. (Time expired)

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2005-09-08,"—For five minutes, we hardly heard a thing out of Senator Hutchins about the Telstra sale proposal. Instead, he concentrated on attacking the integrity of some government members. Senator Hutchins mentioned Senator Ronaldson moving to the front bench. It would be very difficult for anyone from the back bench to move forward, as we have such a solid, well-performing team who we are all proud to sit behind and support.
Senator Hutchins commented on the Prime Minister’s grooming. Obviously, they are scraping the bottom of the barrel if they need to talk about the Prime Minister’s grooming. The Prime Minister is a great performer for this government. Senator Hutchins used the term ‘bedrock’. The Prime Minister exemplifies the foundation of this party. Our Treasurer is performing important work overseas. Because we have such talent on our front bench, we can with great comfort disperse senior ministers to other parts of the world.
I want to talk about Telstra. That is the object of this discussion this afternoon. Let it be said that we have faced the people on several occasions with the following objective in mind: to fully privatise Telstra. Going by the result of the last election, the people have overwhelmingly decided that this government has the authority to do so. It is a longstanding government policy to do this. Some of the reasons we need to do this have been made apparent this week through the controversy being raised by the opposition. We cannot be both the regulator and the owner. It is very difficult to have a situation where we police the industry as well as own the majority shareholding in the largest player in the market.
Every time we have spoken about the sale of Telstra, we have guaranteed three things, and these three things will happen: the services in rural and regional Australia will have to be adequate before the sale proceeds, there will be value for the taxpayers when the sale takes place, and we will have legislative authority from the parliament for the full sale of Telstra. We are not going to change this. That is something that we have promised to the Australian people, and we will stick to that.
The misnomer that service levels are linked to government ownership of Telstra is exactly that. The less the government has owned of Telstra, the more services have improved. I know what phone services were like in this country 20 or 30 years ago, and they are infinitely better today, as they will be in the future. It takes a lot to run a company of this size and magnitude. The telecommunications industry is not perfect, as every industry is not perfect. However, we are certainly striving to make sure that this industry is the best possible industry it can be, and telecommunications in this country far exceed the level of service that we expect on every occasion. There will be mistakes. There is always inadequacy of service from time to time across every single field. However, this communications industry is one that we should be very proud of. Once full privatisation takes place, we can sit back as a parliament and govern the industry as we should and not be a player in the industry. It is crucial that we do that.
—We can kill the goose that lays the golden egg as well!
—Strategies are in place to ensure that any proceeds from the sale of Telstra will be placed in such a way that the country will be the beneficiary. Owning Telstra indefinitely is not in the best interests of this country. Legislative safeguards will continue to apply to Telstra, irrespective of ownership, and this is our prime role. Our prime role is not in ownership. Our prime role is in the supervision of the regulation of the telecommunications industry across the board. Where the market will not go, the government will continue to use targeted investment to ensure the best possible services in rural and regional Australia. We have invested $1 billion in telecommunications services, and that investment will continue.
Competition is something we should talk about. I come from the private sector, where competition ensures adequate service delivery, and competition is the best means for driving innovation, lowering prices and improving services, and this is across the board in rural and regional Australia as well as the metropolitan areas. I am prepared to discuss Telstra. I wish Labor would discuss it more constructively.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,24,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I too rise to take note of the answers to questions without notice made today by Senator Coonan. I join in the concerns of those on this side of the chamber regarding the absence of any real courage in terms of the responses today, because we know exactly what is going to happen with this whole process. It has gone from bad to worse over the last few days, and I certainly have to admit to feeling a little for Senator Coonan today as she tired to defend the indefensible, because already we can see just what is going to happen.
I remind senators that the second tranche of Telstra, T2, actually cost $160 million. We can only assume that the cost of the sale of T3, the remaining part of Telstra, is going to exceed that. We expect that the Telstra sale is going to cost taxpayers $1.1 billion. That is a complete contradiction to the Prime Minister’s claim before the election that there would be no additional costs. Treasury is already considering how bad the Telstra sale is for the budget. Full privatisation will incur a net loss for the nation’s finances, and Treasury has already worked out that selling Telstra will show a minimum loss to the public coffers of $140 million a year. How can that possibly be good for the national economy? We have had an extraordinary range of dividends already paid, which are of huge concern when we know exactly what else has been going on. The idea that we would be borrowing to pay dividends is beyond belief.
I am very concerned about what is happening regarding the process of the Telstra privatisation inquiry. Senator Coonan was not really able to address those concerns today either. We know exactly what happened yesterday when the cut-off was finally pushed through the Senate. The government rushed off and placed advertisements for this phoney inquiry that is to happen tomorrow. In their haste they actually managed to get an advertisement into the Australian. I have it here. It is quite an extraordinary advertisement for the Telstra privatisation bills. However, we discovered that the government missed the cut-off for today’s Australian Financial Review, so it was not submitted to that paper—or to any other papers. I wonder how the people in Western Australia will feel, if they did not purchase the Australian or are not readers of the Australian, when they discover that an inquiry was going on and there was a process for making a submission which they did not know about. It is the same in Queensland, Tasmania and if you are somewhere where you do not get today’s Australian until tomorrow.
However, it gets even better than that. Besides the fact that it is International Literacy Day today and the advertisement talks about the ‘Snate’ not the ‘Senate’—which is an irony that is not lost on anyone—the ad invites submissions by midday tomorrow. Maybe people got up this morning and actually read the Australian on their way to work, and that meant that they had 24 hours or so to write a submission inquiring into the bills which are dealing with the sale of $30 billion of taxpayer assets. If they read the advertisement and then went to the web site to see what they could do with the terms of reference, what did they discover? They discovered that the terms of reference do not even permit a submission into the question of privatisation. What a joke that is! We have democracy in action here in a way that no-one has ever seen before. There is no chance to read the bills, no chance to make a submission, and no chance for the committee to consider any submissions that do get there and to have a hearing, and the committee gets to report in one working day. As I say, this is democracy Howard style, and it certainly is a democracy that is of great concern to Australia for the future.

The documents read as follows—
Government response to the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee—

Voting on trade: The General Agreement on Trade in Services and an Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.


Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the Government have more regard to the negotiating needs of, and the capacity and resource constraints on developing countries that participate in the WTO processes. Given that the WTO is a body that operates by consensus, Members from developing countries in particular need sufficient time and resources to develop appropriate responses to complex trade issues.

Response

The Government supports reform of the WTO where it would improve the current processes and welcomes the current review of WTO processes being undertaken by a Consultative Board of eminent persons, chaired by Peter Sutherland, former WTO Director-General. The Consultative Board has been charged with preparing a report on how to institutionally strengthen and equip the WTO to respond effectively to future systemic challenges brought about by an increasingly integrated global economy. This process was initiated by WTO Director-General Supachai on 19 June 2003. The Government is concerned to ensure that any efforts to reform the WTO contribute to its core objective, namely the effective operation of the rules-based multilateral trading system.
The Government recognises the difficulties some developing countries face in responding to issues raised by the WTO. The Government attaches a high degree of importance to providing technical assistance and capacity building to assist developing countries maximise the opportunities of the Doha round. Since 2001/02, the Government has provided multi-year commitments in trade-related assistance worth $275 million, including an estimated $32 million in 2004/05, an increase of over 50% since 1996/7.
Since 2002, Australia has contributed $A1.96 million, including $A500,000 in 2005, to the WTO Global Trust Fund, as well as $A1 million to the Agency for International Trade Information and Cooperation (AITIC) to assist developing countries not resident in Geneva to participate in the Doha Round. The Government also has a $A1 million program to assist African countries increase their agricultural competitiveness and food security and a $A3 million (2003-06) WTO Regional Capacity Building Project to enhance trade policy capacity in South East Asia.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Government introduce legislation to implement the following process for parliamentary scrutiny and endorsement of proposed trade treaties:
Prior to making offers for further market liberalisation under any WTO Agreements, or commencing negotiations for bilateral or regional free trade agreements, the government shall table in both Houses of Parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives, including comprehensive information about the economic, regional, social, cultural, regulatory and environmental impacts which are expected to arise.
These documents shall be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for examination by public hearing and report to the Parliament within 90 days.
Both Houses of Parliament will then consider the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and then vote on whether to endorse the government’s proposal or not.
Once Parliament has endorsed the proposal, negotiations may begin.
Once the negotiation process is complete, the Government shall then table in parliament a package including the proposed treaty together with any legislation required to implement the treaty domestically.
The treaty and the implementing legislation are then voted on as a package, in an “up or down” vote, i.e. on the basis that the package is either accepted or rejected in its entirety. The legislation should specify the form in which the government should present its proposal to parliament and require the proposal to set out clearly the objectives of the treaty and the proposed timeline for negotiations.

Response

Under Section 61 of the Australian Constitution, treaty making is the formal responsibility of the Executive rather than the Parliament. However, the Government considers that it is only proper that Parliament has a role in scrutiny of trade agreements. The constitutional system ensures that checks and balances operate, through Parliament’s role in examining all proposed treaty actions and in passing legislation to give effect to treaties and the judiciary’s oversight of the system. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT)—a committee initiated by this Government—provides for Parliament’s involvement. In those cases where an agreement might go beyond existing regulation, the Parliament has the right to vote on legislative change required as part of that agreement.
The Government considers the efficiency and certainty of the current process enables it to negotiate with its overseas counterparts with authority and credibility, and contributes to Australia becoming a source of influence in the treaty’s negotiation. This is particularly important in trade negotiations which are often characterised by offers and counter-offers, for which negotiators require some level of flexibility to respond.
The Government considers the report’s recommendation on trade treaties and the Parliamentary process would be unworkable. It would circumscribe the capacity of the Government to secure the best possible trade outcomes from trade negotiations. It would undermine the Executive’s constitutional authority to sign treaties. Furthermore, it is not clear why trade treaties should receive additional scrutiny to any other treaties.
The Government is committed to ensuring that information on trade negotiations is made readily available to the community and to consulting those likely to be affected by the Government’s negotiating position. While all treaties are tabled in both Houses of Parliament for at least 15 sitting days prior to binding treaty action being taken, since negotiations for major multilateral treaties are generally lengthy and quite public, parliamentary debate often takes place for a much longer period than this, as the issues become publicly known. In cases when implementing legislation is necessary prior to ratification, Parliament has a further opportunity to debate the treaty. The Government makes its decision on whether a treaty is in the national interest based on information obtained during consultations with relevant stakeholders. Inevitably, the final decision necessarily involves a balancing of competing interests. The Government considers that the objective of ensuring both that the Government is able to energetically pursue opportunities for trade growth, and that appropriate consultation on negotiating objectives is undertaken with the broader community, are best met by current Parliamentary and consultation processes and practices.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Government commission multi-disciplinary research to evaluate the socio-economic impact of trade liberalisation in Australia since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.

Response

The Government does not consider a new research project along these lines is warranted at this stage, a decade after the conclusion of the Uruguay round. The case for trade liberalisation and a new trade round—the Doha round—has been established and is well accepted. In the past, a large number of reports have been produced which analyse the impacts of trade liberalisation on Australia. In 1997, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), in conjunction with the Centre for International Economics, produced a study on the impact of trade liberalisation on the Australian economy entitled, “Trade Liberalisation: How Australia Gains”. This study found that trade liberalisation had boosted Australia’s international competitiveness and provided significant gains to consumers and families. A range of other reports have also been concluded including a 1999 CIE report “Global Trade Reform” as well as a significant body of research on the agricultural sector undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE).

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Government clearly define and make public its broad interpretation of Article I.3 of the GATS so that the public is aware of the basis on which future negotiations are undertaken.

Response

The scope of the GATS does not extend to services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority. The GATS is based therefore on the right of governments to provide, fund and regulate public services.
The Government believes that the GATS provides adequately for the co-existence of publicly and privately provided services, even within the same sector. The Government does not believe that article 1.3(c) derogates from this. Public services are generally provided to pursue social policies. The purposes of provision of public and private services are different, even if they exist side by side. The GATS does not set standards for public service; that is up to individual governments.
The GATS features no mandatory obligation for governments to privatise or open up public services to competition and it does not dictate any specific role for the public and private sectors. Australia is free to decide what service sectors are reserved for the State or state-owned enterprises. Under the GATS it is up to Member governments to decide whether and to what extent they open sectors to foreign competition and whether and to what extent they afford foreign suppliers the same treatment as domestic suppliers in their GATS schedules.
When the GATS was negotiated, this provision was included to ensure the capacity of governments to deliver services under their authority. We believe other WTO members view the agreement in a similar way. That is well demonstrated by the fact that it has not been raised as an issue—certainly not through dispute settlement or otherwise.
The Government would like to make very clear that it is firmly committed to doing everything in its power to preserve Australia’s rights to provide public services, as was provided for in this Agreement.
The Government will continue to make the above points in consultations with stakeholders and in public presentations.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that in its future public consultation processes on trade issues, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade publishes submissions it receives, or a list of submitters with information on how to obtain copies of submissions, on its website.

Response

This recommendation raises the issue of the privacy of those making the submission and the contents of that submission. Subject to the agreement of submitters, DFAT will in future publish submissions or list submitters on its website. Submitters will be asked to indicate their willingness to have their names or submissions made publicly available. It will be made clear that submitters will not be disadvantaged on the basis of whether they choose to have their submission made public.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consult widely with industry groups, unions, non-government organisations and other relevant bodies prior to preparation of Australia’s offers and requests under the GATS, and provide constructive feedback to all organisations about how their views have been taken into account in the preparation of Australia’s negotiating position.

Response

DFAT will continue to consult widely with industry groups, unions, non-government organisations and other relevant bodies in the request-offer phase of the GATS negotiations. The Government provides constructive feedback to all stakeholders in a number of ways, including discussion papers, newsletters, meetings and verbal reports. DFAT considers that such feedback adds to the sense of stakeholder participation in the process and ownership of the outcomes and will continue to provide it to the extent possible. DFAT notes however that it is not always possible to provide feedback on all issues raised by interested parties, given the need to identify a negotiating position that reflects Australia’s national interest and maximises its negotiating leverage, particularly at certain key points of the negotiations.
The Government would note that DFAT has held consultations with a variety of stakeholders. The Department is in regular contact and consultation with 14 Commonwealth departments and agencies. It has met with all state and territory governments, including representatives of 25 state/territory departments. It has met a number of times with the Australian Local Government Association and responds regularly to queries from local governments. It has met with 220 industry associations and businesses. It has met with 92 non-government organisations. It has accepted 81 submissions from civil society on the negotiations on the GATS and a further 23 in the lead-up to the Cancun ministerial. It has updated its web site 15 times since July 2002 to reflect ongoing negotiations, with substantive detail on progress in those negotiations. The Department also has 269 subscribers to its services negotiation email service.

Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consult again with stakeholders with expertise in the relevant areas once Australia’s draft offer(s) have been prepared in future GATS negotiations, and prior to such offer(s) being communicated to the WTO as Australia’s official offer.

Response

As indicated in the response to Recommendation 6, DFAT will continue to engage in extensive consultations with key stakeholders in the preparation of GATS requests and offers.

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that the Government does not make any offers in the GATS, either in this round or in future negotiations, in the area of postal services which would adversely affect Australia Post’s reserved (standard letter) service.

Response

Australia, like many other countries, has a regulatory framework for postal services which is based on the social objective of ensuring the provision of a universal standard letter. Australia will maintain its capacity to meet this objective in its negotiating approach.

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Government make no further commitments under the GATS in areas of provision of public health services, public education and the ownership of water.

Response

The Government, in Mr Vaile’s media release of 1 April 2003 on Australia’s initial offer, and again on 26 May 2005 in relation to the revised offer, stated that Australia would not be making any offers in the areas of public health, public education or the ownership of water.

Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that the Government continue to recognise the essential role of creative artists and cultural organisations in reflecting the intrinsic values and characteristics of Australian society and that it make no commitments in current or future GATS negotiations that might adversely impact on cultural industries. The Committee further recommends that the Government continue the Most Favoured Nation exemption for co-production arrangements beyond 2004.

Response

The Government will continue to recognise the essential role of creative artists and cultural organisations in reflecting the intrinsic values and characteristics of Australian society. The Government, in Mr Vaile’s media release of 1 April 2003 on Australia’s initial offer, said it will ensure that the outcomes of negotiations will not impair Australia’s ability to deliver fundamental policy objectives in relation to social and cultural goals.
Australia’s MFN exemption on audiovisual services forms an ongoing part of Australia’s GATS schedule of commitments. This MFN exemption enables Australia to maintain co-production agreements with certain countries. Although the GATS Annex on Article II Exemptions provides that, in principle, such exemptions should not exceed a period of 10 years from the entry into force of the GATS, there has been no decision by WTO Members on any systematic approach to MFN exemptions under the GATS.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that the Government—prior to embarking on the pursuit of any bilateral trading or investment agreement—request the Productivity Commission to examine and report upon the proposed agreement. Such a report should deliver a detailed econometric assessment of its impacts on Australia’s economic well-being, identifying any structural or institutional adjustments that might be required by such an agreement, as well as an assessment of the social, regulatory, cultural and environmental impacts of the agreement. A clear summary of potential costs and benefits should be included in the advice.

Response

The Government agrees with the need for appropriate assessments of the likely economic and other impacts of bilateral FTAs prior to their conclusion. It has followed that approach in relation to AUSFTA, SAFTA and the Australia-Thailand FTA. As well as commissioning independent assessments of the likely effects of these agreements prior to negotiations, DFAT commissioned a detailed assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of AUSFTA as finally agreed. That study, by the Centre for International Economics was released on 30 April 2004.
It may be appropriate in some circumstances to request the Productivity Commission to undertake assessment of aspects of trade agreements or to assist with advice and input in relation to other inquiries. It is unlikely that any study could definitively answer all the issues addressed in the recommendations prior to commencing negotiations, in the absence of the detail of outcomes of the agreement. The Government’s approach has been to use economic modelling and analysis prior to agreements as a guide to the potential benefits available from a particular negotiation. At the same time it is conscious that there will be additional benefits and other implications that cannot be captured by economic modelling. In relation to the AUSFTA and other agreements, the Government has consulted extensively to ensure that the fullest possible account is taken of potential impacts of a proposed agreement, in order that relevant concerns and implications are reflected in the government’s objectives and the instructions given to negotiators.

Recommendation 12

The Committee recommends that future bilateral trade agreements be pursued without recourse to a negative list approach.

Response

The Government does not agree with the Committee’s concerns about the possible impact of the negative list approach, which only applies to the services and investment chapters of FTAs.
As the Report notes, a negative list approach is inherently more liberalising and transparent. Australia led the way in introducing the negative list approach when it negotiated the Protocol on Trade in Services to the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with New Zealand, concluded in 1988. Concerns about specific implications for existing measures can be addressed through the reservations mechanism. By this means, Australia is able to continue applying measures which may not comply with relevant liberalisation provisions, but which it wishes to retain. Furthermore, the negative list does not prevent governments from regulating either current or new services. It only constrains governments from imposing limitations to national treatment, market access and other principles set out in the services and investment chapters of an agreement. This approach does not prevent governments from continuing to adopt non-discriminatory regulations needed to address important public policy objectives like protection of the environment or human health.

Recommendation 13

The Committee recommends that the Government declare that it will not entertain any further proposals from the United States that go to the structure or operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or that in any way undermine the effectiveness of the PBS as a price capping mechanism. Accordingly, the Government should exempt the PBS from the proposed Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.

Response

This recommendation has been overtaken in that the final text of the AUSFTA includes provisions relating to the PBS. The integrity of the PBS has been entirely preserved.

Recommendation 14

The Committee recommends that in view of the risks associated with the negative list approach, the Government exempt Australia’s quarantine laws from negotiations for the proposed Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.

Response

The negative list approach referred to in the recommendation, which applies to trade in services and investment in the Agreement, has no bearing on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which relate to trade in goods. The integrity of Australia’s quarantine regime, and our right to protect animal, plant and human health will not be affected by the AUSFTA.

Recommendation 15

The Committee recommends that in view of the risks associated with the negative list approach, the Government exempt Australia’s genetic engineering regulatory regime (including that dealing with labelling and GE free zones) from negotiations for the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.

Response

The AUSFTA does not contain any provisions relating to regulation of genetically modified (GM) foods, nor does it have any provisions that would require Australia to change its GM food labelling requirements or any aspect of its GE/GM regulatory regime, including those relating to GE/GM free zones.
As outlined in response to Recommendation 14, the “negative list approach” applies to trade in services and investment. It does not have any bearing on Australia’s regulatory regime for GM foods.

Recommendation 16

The Committee recommends that:
the narrow definition for e-commerce used in the Singapore-Australia FTA be the definition for e-commerce in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement; and
the Government ensure that Australia’s cultural objectives will not be compromised by avoiding any concessions or undertakings that would enable future technologies or content delivery platforms to undermine or circumvent existing or future cultural protection policies.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Government exempt Australia’s cultural industries from the proposed Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.

Response

The provisions of the draft Electronic Commerce chapter of AUSFTA do not constrain Australia’s capacity to regulate in relation to audio-visual services.
While there is no definition of electronic commerce as such in the chapter, it does cover non-discriminatory treatment of digital products, in Article 16.4. However, that Article also states that the obligations on non-discriminatory treatment do not apply to non-conforming measures adopted or maintained in accordance with the chapters on Cross-Border Trade in Services, Investment and Financial Services and the annexes of reservations. Article 16.4.3 further underscores “for greater certainty” that these obligations do not prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures in the audiovisual and broadcasting sectors, in accordance with its reservations.
AUSFTA is consistent with Australia’s cultural objectives, particularly the need to ensure the availability of Australian voices and stories on audiovisual broadcasting services now and in the future.
The outcome of the negotiations on audiovisual and broadcasting services preserves Australia’s existing local content requirements and other measures and ensures Australia’s right to intervene in response to new media developments, subject to a number of commitments on the degree or level of any new or additional local content requirements.
Australia’s reservations under the Chapters on Cross Border Trade in Services and Investment permit Australia to maintain the existing 55 per cent local content transmission quota on programming and the 80 per cent local content transmission quota on advertising on free-to-air commercial TV on both analogue and digital (other than multichannelling) platforms. Subquotas for particular program formats (eg drama, documentary) will continue to be able to be applied within the 55% quota.
In relation to digital multichannelling, Australia will be able to impose a 55% local content requirement on programming on either two channels or 20% of the total number of channels (whichever is greater) made available by an individual broadcaster. No local content transmission quota could be imposed on more than three channels of any individual commercial television service broadcaster.
With regard to subscription television broadcasting services, the FTA allows Australia to ensure its cultural objectives are protected through maintaining the current requirement for 10 per cent of expenditure on predominantly drama channels to be allocated to new Australian production. This may be increased up to a maximum level of 20 per cent. In addition the FTA allows scope for any future Australian government to introduce new expenditure requirements of up to 10 per cent on four additional program formats, ie the arts, children’s, documentary and educational.
The Agreement also protects local content on free-to-air radio broadcasting services, through transmission quotas which allow for up to 25 percent local content in programming (eg of musical items) transmitted annually between 6.00 am and midnight on individual stations of a service providers.
The Agreement preserves the right for Australia to introduce local content requirements on interactive audio and/or video services if it determines that Australian content is not readily available to Australian consumers.
Finally, nothing in the Agreement will affect in any way the Government’s right to support the cultural sector through the allocation of public funding of activities such as the public broadcasters (ABC and SBS), public libraries or archives, or in relation to Government funding for Australian artists, writers and performers.

Recommendation 17

The Committee recommends that:
the Australian Government retain its capacity to regulate foreign investment, including the retention of the Foreign Investment Review Board; and
no investor-state provisions be included in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.

Response

The Government has retained the right to examine, through the Foreign Investment Review Board, United States investment proposals that may raise significant issues to ensure they are in the national interest.
The arrangements under the Chapter on Investment of the AUSFTA raise the screening threshold for United States proposals for investment in Australian businesses (other than financial sector companies) and proposals for acquisition of developed non-commercial residential land from $A50 to $A800 million. These changes to the thresholds for screening will improve Australia’s attraction as an investment environment by removing from the screening process many smaller and medium sized investments which do not raise national interest concerns.
However, investment will still be screened in all sensitive sectors, as will all large investments which are more likely to raise national interest concerns. In particular,
United States investment in urban land (including residential properties) and in existing media businesses will continue to be screened regardless of value.
United States investment above $A50 million in existing businesses in the telecommunication, transport and defence-related sectors will be screened.
In addition, existing foreign investment limits relating to the media, Telstra, CSL, Qantas and other Australia international airlines, federal leased airports and shipping have all been preserved.
The Investment Chapter of the AUSFTA does not establish an Investor State Dispute Settlement mechanism. This is in recognition of the Parties’ open economic environments and shared legal traditions, and the confidence of investors in the fairness and integrity of their respective legal systems.

Recommendation 18

The Committee recommends that the government retain the ‘single desk’ arrangements for wheat exports and that these arrangements be exempt from the proposed Australia-US Free Trade Agreement.

Response

Australia’s single-desk arrangements for marketing Australian commodities will not be affected by the AUSFTA.

Recommendation 19

The Committee recommends that any rules of origin applied in the Textile, Clothing and Footwear sector provide for goods made-up in Australia to access the US market without tariffs, irrespective of the source of the original yarn or fabric.

Response

The Government argued in the negotiations for the adoption rules of origin (ROOs) for textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) products on the same basis used generally for ROOs in the agreement. However, the US could not be persuaded to move from its insistence on inclusion of a “yarn-forward” rule of origin for textiles and clothing (this does not apply to footwear). Generally speaking, this rule means that fabrics produced for export must be made up of yarns wholly formed in one or other of the Parties to the Agreement; and apparel for export be produced from fabrics entirely formed in one or other of the Parties using yarns wholly formed in one or other of the Parties. Given the inclusion of yarn-forward textile and clothing rules, Australia insisted on maintaining long phase-outs for textile and tariffs under AUSFTA.

Recommendation 20

The Committee recommends that the Senate refer the final text of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for examination and report.

Response

This appears to be a question directed to the Senate.

Response of the Australian Government to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade


‘Near Neighbours—Good Neighbours An Inquiry into Australia’s Relationship with Indonesia’


Recommendation 1 
DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs establish a program of exchange visits between the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committees of the Australian Parliament and the equivalent committees of the Indonesian Parliament. Incorporated in the program should be a formal, structured one day conference with agenda items prepared by both sides covering all aspects of the relationship that may be of concern. The program should be additional to the current bilateral visits program and be separately funded.

Response

The Government welcomes the development of a closer relationship between the Australian and Indonesian Parliaments. We note that the Australian Parliament already has a well developed parliamentary exchange program with Indonesia and that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade undertook a visit to Indonesia in December 2003. The Government believes that it would be for Parliament to decide how best to spend its exchange program budget.

Recommendation 2 DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Federal Government acknowledges the Northern Territory’s role as interested neighbour and as observer of BIMP-EAGA (a sub-regional grouping of ASEAN) and consider providing special assistance to the Northern Territory to enable it to enhance its role.

Response

The Government acknowledges the Northern Territory’s role as an interested neighbour and as an observer of BIMP-EAGA. The Northern Territory is commended for pursuing its observer status as ‘Development Partner’ at BIMP-EAGA officials meetings in the BIMP-EAGA Plus One arrangement. BIMP-EAGA is given a high priority in the Northern Territory’s current Asian Engagement Plan. The Government welcomes the Northern Territory’s growing international engagement and its most active and constructive participation in discussions with the Australian Government and the States on trade policy matters. The Government would be willing to consider any cost-neutral proposals from the Northern Territory Government relating to this issue.

Recommendation 3 DEST

The Committee recommends that the Federal Government jointly invite the States to examine ways in which the educational relationship with Indonesia can be more cohesively managed.

Response

The Government seeks to work collaboratively with all State and Territory Governments on a wide range of education and training matters. The relationships between the Australian Government and State Governments are positive.
The Department of Education, Science and Training works closely with State and Territory Governments to jointly host industry events, extends speaking invitations for seminars, and generally take into account the perspectives of the States and Territories when planning work programs.

Recommendation 4 AusAID

The Committee recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs arrange that the activities of the Government Sector Linkages Program be extended to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of better linkages between State governments and regional counterparts in Indonesia. The arrangements should be funded jointly by Federal and State and Territory Governments.

Response

A new Public Sector Linkages Program, which commenced in November 2004, allows for funding of activities identified by Federal, State and Territory governments and universities.
Under this mechanism there is normally scope to meet up to 75 per cent of salary and other costs of participating Australian partners, but particular consideration is given during the selection process to those partners making a contribution in cash or in kind.

Recommendation 5 DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs confer with the Local Government and Planning Ministers’ Council about strengthening the bilateral relationship through encouraging the establishment of links between local regions in Australia and Indonesia.

Response

The Government welcomes the development of closer links between Australia and Indonesia at all levels, including local government. I (Mr Downer) will write to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Mr Lloyd, to commend the proposal to the Local Government and Planning Minister’s Council (LGPMC).

Recommendation 6 AusAID

The Committee recommends that over the next five years Australia seeks to increase our aid to Indonesia to a level whereby Australia would become Indonesia’s third largest bilateral source of funding.

Response

Development cooperation funding for Indonesia has increased substantially. Prior to the tsunami, the 2004-05 estimate was for total Australian aid flows to Indonesia of $160.8 million, representing an increase of 32 per cent over the previous two financial years.
Following the Indian Ocean disaster, Australia provided significant immediate emergency assistance. On 5 January the Prime Minister announced Australia’s commitment of $1 billion over five years to the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development (AIPRD). The AIPRD represents the largest single aid package in Australia’s history.
According to figures from the Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI) Australia is now the third ranked bilateral donor to Indonesia, behind Japan and Germany.

Recommendation 7 Defence

The Committee notes that the pace for rebuilding the defence relationship will be determined by both countries. On the Australian side, it strongly endorses measures that can accelerate the process of re-establishing mutual confidence in the defence relationship.

Response

The Government agrees with the recommendation and is working actively with the Indonesian Government to build further on the renewed levels of confidence that have been established since the 1999 events in East Timor. Since the Department of Defence’s March 2003 written submission to the Committee’s inquiry, Indonesia has endured the tragedy of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami off Northern Sumatra and the following earthquake on 29 March 2005. The ADF has been heavily involved in providing assistance to Indonesia’s disaster relief effort.
The excellent cooperation between our two countries’ armed forces during the ADF deployments to Sumatra has highlighted further the growing strength of the defence relationship. Since December 2004, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, has visited Indonesia four times and has called on both Indonesian President Yudhoyono and his Indonesian counterpart, Dr Sudarsono. In February 2005 General Cosgrove met with ADF and Indonesian Armed Forces personnel in Aceh as well as the Indonesian Minister for Defence in Jakarta.
More broadly, the Government is engaging the Indonesian Armed Forces across a range of activities that seek to re-establish mutual confidence in the relationship. Strategic dialogue has been the foundation for progressing the relationship. Following the Chief of Army’s visit to Indonesia in July 2003, the Indonesian Chief of Army Staff, General Ryamizard, reciprocated with a counterpart visit to Australia in December 2003. Since General Ryamizard’s visit, the other two Service Chiefs have met with their Indonesian counterparts either in Australia or in Indonesia, including during Service Chief visits to Aceh following the tsunami. Army to Army service level talks were conducted in Bali in February 2004, Navy to Navy service level talks in Jakarta in March 2004, and Air Force to Air Force service level talks in Bali in July 2004. Air Force to Air Force Service talks for 2005 were held in Australia in March. Service level talks have not been conducted with Indonesia since 1999 and provide an important continuing framework to produce tangible outcomes in the defence relationship. In August 2004 Indonesia hosted the inaugural Defence Strategic Dialogue, which discussed policy for future engagement activities and endorsed progress made through single Service Staff Talks. The Indonesian Chief of Naval Staff visited Australia with President Yudhoyono in April 2005 and met with a number of senior officials from the Department of Defence.
Senior level visits to promote common understanding of each country’s defence systems have continued to feature in the re-establishment of a mutually beneficial defence relationship with Indonesia. Indonesian delegation visits to Australia since the beginning of 2004 have focused on senior defence officers with command responsibilities and discussions have covered topics such as Australian Army training practices, Australian Air Defence systems, and Australian experiences in developing forces for peacekeeping operations. Since April 2004, Commander Northern Command has met with his Indonesian Army, Air Force and Navy counterpart commanders and has continued to build very strong relationships with these officers who have command responsibility over the northern approaches to Australia. Such relationships have led to enhancements in our defence cooperation with Indonesia in areas of mutual security concern such as terrorism, piracy, people smuggling and transnational crime. In July 2004 the Department of Defence’s Deputy Secretary Strategy called on his Indonesian departmental counterparts and the Head of the Indonesian Armed Forces. The visit of the Secretary of Indonesia’s Department of Defence in October 2004 has enhanced Defence links at the strategic policy level.
The Government continues to examine options for defence cooperation with Indonesia in combating terrorism. Defence counter-terrorism cooperation with Indonesia aims to complement whole-of-government efforts under the Memorandum of Understanding on counter-terrorism between Australia and Indonesia, which was renewed for a further 12 months on 7 February 2004. Since December 2003 the Department of Defence has sent two training teams to Indonesia to provide Indonesian defence members with information analysis training. Two officers from the Indonesian Armed Forces attended the June 2004 Regional Special Forces Conference in Bowral. In December 2004 the Indonesian Armed Forces sent a delegation to Australia to observe ADF counter-terrorism exercises.
Our provision of defence training and exchanges is an important element of our cooperation with the Indonesian Armed Forces, and provides the Indonesian Armed Forces with skills and abilities that are of mutual benefit to both defence forces. For the financial year 2003-04 the Government spent over $5 million on cooperative activities with the Indonesian Armed Forces. Up to 170 Indonesian Armed Forces personnel were given training, both in Australia and in Indonesia. Training included English language training, peacekeeping and peace operations seminars, maritime and air power studies, Staff College exchanges, single service training and flight instruction training. Defence dialogue with Indonesia continues to emphasise training and engagement opportunities that meet our mutual needs.
Five Indonesian Navy vessels visited Australian ports (two ships visited Darwin, and three visited Perth) in October 2004—the first such ship visits since 1999, and a sign of the increasing importance placed by both our countries on maritime cooperation. In April 2005 our two Air Forces conducted Exercise Albatross and AUSINDO, a joint air maritime surveillance exercise in the Timor Sea. TNI Navy is planning to send two corvette class patrol boats to Australia in July-August 2005 to participate in Exercise Kakadu.
The Government will continue to capitalise on recent progress made in the defence relationship with Indonesia. The focus will remain on capacity and confidence building, with an emphasis on fostering senior level relationships, providing training opportunities that assist the Indonesian military develop its force professionalism, and pursuing initiatives in areas of mutual security concern such as maritime surveillance cooperation and counter terrorism engagement.

Recommendation 8 DFAT

The Committee recommends that as Australia participates more broadly in the activities associated with the war against terror, and as it pursues more generally its security interests, the Australian Government should sustain a regular and rigorous dialogue to ensure that in a country where Islamic sensitivities are high, there is a complete understanding of Australia’s intentions and that those intentions in no way incorporate a hostile view of the Islamic world or Indonesia’s part in it.

Response

As outlined in its recent White Paper, “Transnational Terrorism: The Threat to Australia”, the Government believes as a matter of principle that the war on terror in no way constitutes an attack on the Islamic faith. We will continue to make this point at every available opportunity. The Government has stated publicly its appreciation of the positive role mainstream Islam has played in Indonesia’s transition to democracy.
The Australian Government is deepening its engagement with mainstream Islamic organisations in the region. For example, in 2003 the Government hosted the leaders of Indonesia’s largest Islamic groups: Hasyim Muzadi from Nahdlatul Ulama and Syafi’ i Ma’arif from Muhammidiyah, as well as Nurcholish Madjid, an Islamic scholar and leader from the Paramadina Mulya University. Indonesian Foreign Minister Dr Hassan Wirajuda and I hosted a regional inter-faith dialogue in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in December 2004 that advanced understanding between key faith leaders in the region. The Government also funded a workshop in Australia in 2004 on Islamic perceptions on state, society and governance in South-East Asia. The Government will continue to emphasise the shared interests of Australia and Indonesia in the war against terrorism.

Recommendation 9 DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade proposes at the next Australian Indonesian Ministerial Forum meeting that a scoping study be undertaken on the implications of a free trade agreement on both economies.

Response

The Australian Government has made significant progress on its policy of competitive liberalisation, including through negotiating and implementing bilateral free trade agreements. The Government has recently completed negotiation of FTAs with Singapore, Thailand and the United States, commenced negotiations on a Australia-New Zealand- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and has agreed to commence negotiations with Malaysia and China.
The Australian Government continues to develop bilateral trade and investment linkages with Indonesia, including through the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum and the Annual Australia-Indonesia Trade Ministers Meeting. At the most recent Trade Ministers Meeting in Bali in April 2005, Mr Vaile and his Indonesian counterpart Dr Mari Elka Pangestu agreed to develop an overarching trade and investment framework to further expand commercial links between Australia and Indonesia.

Recommendation 10 DFAT

The Committee recommends that:
travel advisories should note that they are not a prohibition on travel unless otherwise the case;
travel advisories should incorporate information on current practices, for example, the number of people travelling;
where a travel advisory impacts upon a State Government relationship or business activity, that there be capacity for this to be discussed with DFAT in a way that ensures that if at all possible the advice can be given in a way that satisfies insurers of low risk activities; and
that Australian Government agencies and institutions affected by travel advisories respond creatively during such periods and find ways to ensure that the interactions with their counterparts in Indonesia take place.

Response

The Government notes the Committee’s acknowledgement that travel advisories are not prohibitions on travel but rather aim to provide practical information so travellers are as informed and prepared as possible. This point is also clearly explained in the Government’s public information on travel advisories, particularly through the smartraveller website. Independent market research shows that 85 per cent of general community respondents understand that travel advisories are not prohibitions on travel.
Travel advice already incorporates information on current practices from a range of sources including diplomatic missions, the travelling public, consular partners and intelligence agencies. It contains practical, up-to-date information on visa requirements, health and medical issues and cultural or religious differences. Market research confirms that information in travel advisories already reflects community demands about the most relevant information that should be included in travel advice.
DFAT takes account of feedback from a wide range of sources in managing the travel advice functions. DFAT State offices in all state capital cities liaise with State Governments. Feedback mechanisms also exist for direct contact with DFAT Consular Branch in Canberra and State Governments are regularly in contact with overseas missions, through which any such concerns could be raised. In consultations with the Government, insurers have advised that it is the events themselves occurring in a country and the steps taken by the traveller to minimise their loss, rather than the Government’s travel advice, that affects the level of insurance coverage and processing of claims.
Australian Government agencies continue to accord a high priority to maintaining close and productive relations with their counterparts in Indonesia.

Recommendation 11 DIMIA

The Committee recommends that the possible introduction of a telemedicine system be examined further, with the aim of improving the consideration time for Medical Treatment Visa applications.

Response

The Government agrees with this recommendation and notes that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) has been progressively implementing a new electronic health processing service.
DIMIA has successfully piloted an electronic health assessment process (known as EHealth II) in Singapore. EHealth II has been in place since November 2003.
EHealth II links with an eVisa application (ie. a visa application lodged over the Internet), so that the applicant is photographed and x-rayed at the radiologist’s premises. Digital images are produced and relayed to the medical practitioner (Panel Doctor) who examines the applicant, reviews the x-ray and radiologist’s report, and records the findings on-line.
This electronic information can link with a visa application to result in an immediate visa grant, or if necessary, to be viewed nearly instantaneously, with diagnostic quality x-ray images, in Australia by the Medical Officer of the Commonwealth. From that point, the speed at which a visa decision is finalised depends on the diagnosis and assessment made by the Medical Officer of the Commonwealth. Further specialist reports may be required in some cases, but as extra reports would be presented as hard copies progress will be reduced to manual speeds.
Expansion plans for EHealth II are underway. The system is now operating in Japan and will shortly be introduced in Hong Kong and South Korea. Roll-out to other countries is projected over the next 12 to 18 months and a targeted approach will aim at areas using eVisas (ie. those visas that can already be lodged over the Internet), as well as those offering medical, particularly radiological, practitioners with the equipment and other suitable attributes.
Application of EHealth II to the Medical Treatment Visa stream may also require some specialist IT programming. The department is also exploring other visa options that would support the development of a health tourism industry but which would have around it the appropriate sponsorship and safeguards mechanisms that would ensure integrity in the visa outcomes, ensure it is not open to abuse, protect the Australian community in relation to access to health services and minimise risks of unintended health and welfare costs to the Australian community. Discussions with the Department of Health and Ageing are proceeding on this option.

Recommendation 12 AusAID

The Committee recommends that:
education should continue to retain the central importance that it has in Australia’s aid to Indonesia;
that increases in education funding should not be at the expense of other aspects of AusAID’s program to Indonesia or at the expense of aid to other countries; and
that increases to one part of the education program should not be at the expense of other aspects of the education program.

Response

Funding for education and training assistance to Indonesia has increased from $57 million in 2002-03 to approximately $62.5 million in 2004‑2005, or over 38 per cent of the total budget allocation for Indonesia. Education and training assistance will continue to retain this central place in Australia’s aid to Indonesia.
Within this figure funding for basic education and technical and vocational education is estimated to total about $20 million. Approximately 20 per cent of this funding will be directed to basic Islamic education, which is roughly proportional to the enrolment rate in Islamic schools in Indonesia.
While funding for basic education has increased in recent years, this has not been at the expense of funding for postgraduate scholarships, which will continue with expenditure estimated at $32.7 million in 2004-05.
The increase in education and training expenditure in the Indonesia program has been accommodated through the 32 per cent overall increase in funding for the program from 2002-03 to 2004‑05. In 2004-05, the total Australian aid program is increased by 9.9 per cent in real terms. The increase under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development (AIPRD) program is additional.

Recommendation 13 AusAID

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government provide for an enhanced Australian Development Scholarships program to enable the provision of a substantial package of scholarships specifically for Indonesian students for studies in education.

Response

The Indonesia Australian Development Scholarships program currently allows awardees to undertake studies in the field of education. In 2004, 35 students were selected for studies in this field.
This outcome is partly the result of the introduction of a new targeted category of Australian Development Scholarships, under which awards can be directed to key Indonesian counterpart institutions that are engaged in the bilateral development cooperation program.
A large number of awards are also made each year to university teaching and research staff for study across a range of disciplines.
In addition, AusAID is currently funding the Australia Indonesia Institute to upgrade the qualifications of five selected teaching staff per year from Islamic educational institutions (IAINs) outside Java through supervised programs at selected Australian universities.
I (Mr Downer) have asked AusAID to take account of this recommendation as part of a review of the strategy for Australian Development Scholarships to Indonesia that is planned for later in 2005.

Recommendation 14 AusAID

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government should establish a program of scholarships to Indonesian teachers to undertake professional development training in Australia during vacations.

Response

Substantial professional development training for teachers is being provided through AusAID’s existing $20 million (2004-05) program of basic and technical/vocational education activities in Indonesia. This program includes, for example, a $27.2 million, six-year Primary Education Partnership project in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province that will improve the quality of teaching and learning in the first three years of primary school in three very poor districts.
The program will be enhanced by a new package of assistance for mainstream Islamic schools. This package is expected to have a particular focus on in-service training of teachers.
As part of this package, AusAID’s placement of up to 20 Australian volunteer English language teacher trainers in Islamic junior secondary schools in East Java province will have an immediate and sustained impact on the language acquisition skills and teaching methodologies of a large number of Indonesian teachers. Intensive professional development workshops and seminars on various aspects of language teaching methodology (such as collaborative syllabus development, lesson planning and team-teaching) will provide Indonesian teachers with contemporary theory and ideas on best-practice language teaching techniques.
This activity will also help build in Indonesia a better understanding of Australia.
While short-term training in Australia would have advantages for both countries, it is relatively expensive and would require English language proficiency beyond the reach of the vast majority of Indonesian teachers.

Recommendation 15 AusAID

The Committee considers that there is value in adding a work experience component to the Australian Development Scholarship Program and recommends that the Australian Government provide substantial ongoing funding to the Government Sector Linkages Program to enable it to be used in conjunction with the Australian Development Scholarship Program by providing for a work component to be added to the Scholarship Scheme.

Response

The Australian Development Scholarships Program does not preclude work placements as part of postgraduate programs. However, the initiative for such placements currently rests with the host Australian university.
I (Mr Downer) have asked AusAID to take account of this recommendation as part of a review of the strategy for Australian Development Scholarships to Indonesia planned for later in 2005.
I note that placements in Australian Government departments and agencies are constrained by national security considerations.
The Government Sector Linkages Program (now Public Sector Linkages Program) has significantly facilitated development of strong linkages and working relationships between counterpart agencies in the Australian and Indonesian government systems, for example, between the Federal Court of Australia and Indonesia’s Supreme Court. Amongst other things, the Program supports visits to Australia, and in-Australia work secondments and training, for Indonesian officials.

Recommendation 16 AusAID

That the Australian Government establish a Parliamentary Development Program to provide assistance to developing parliaments.

Response

Although this recommendation goes beyond Indonesia, assistance of this kind is consistent with one of the key objectives of the Australian Development Cooperation Program with Indonesia viz., to strengthen the institutions and practices of democracy.
Australia is funding a program to develop and support the operation of the new Regional Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah or DPD). This support is provided through the International Institution for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IIDEA) and includes skills training and a series of proposed visits to the Australian Senate.
I (Mr Downer) have asked AusAID to explore further options for parliamentary assistance with relevant Australian Government agencies and other organisations such as the Centre for Democratic Institutions and to report to me on the feasibility of implementing this recommendation.

Recommendation 17 DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government increase funding to the Australia Indonesia Institute to enable it to maintain both the breadth of the range of programs it supports, to provide for continuity of successful core programs and to enable it to significantly extend its reach.

Response

The Government is committed to providing the Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII) with an appropriate budget to undertake its important work in deepening the people-to-people links between Australia and Indonesia. The Government has encouraged the AII to expand its funding base through collaborative links with partner organisations. It has received $246,000 of additional funding from AusAID to implement a new Islamic teacher’s training program in cooperation with the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs. The Australia Council for the Arts has also agreed to provide the AII with $40,000 for a new cultural program to commence in 2004-05. The Government believes that the level of funding currently available to the AII is sufficient to allow it to play its important role of deepening Australian-Indonesian relations.

Recommendation 18 DEST

The Committee recommends that Indonesian Studies be designated a strategic national priority and that the Australian Research Council and the Department of Education, Science and Training be requested to recognise this in prioritising funding for both research and teaching.

Response

The National Research Priorities (NRP) were first announced in late 2002, and enhanced in late 2003 to take greater account of the contributions of social sciences and humanities research. The framework was developed following extensive consultation with the research community.
The goals that fall under the priorities framework represent important issues for our future and areas in which the contributions of research will play an important role. The Government recognises, however, that the framework does not provide a comprehensive list of all areas of research that are important to Australia. The Government would regard the proposal to add an additional goal on ‘Indonesian studies’ in this light.
It is envisaged that the NRP framework will be reviewed in around 2006-07 when the Government will consider whether the existing priorities and goals should be amended or enhanced. This will provide a degree of certainty to enable research agencies and funding bodies to implement the strategies that will make a real difference in delivering on the research priorities.
More information (including a full list of priorities and their associated goals, and agencies’ NRP-implementation reports) can be found on: http://www.dest.gov.au/priorities/

Recommendation 19 DEST

The Committee recommends that NALSAS (the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools program) be restored, or a program with similar aims and an equivalent level of funding be established.

Response

The Government contributed over $200 million through the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools (NALSAS) Strategy from 1994 to 2002. As well as redressing an imbalance between European and Asian languages in schools, the Strategy contributed to a significant increase in the study of the priority NALSAS languages, (including Indonesian) at primary and secondary school levels. It also contributed to deeper knowledge and understanding about Asia.
The decision to cease Government funding for NALSAS was long standing. In 1999, when the Government extended its NALSAS funding of $30 million a year for three years, it was on the understanding that the Strategy should have become self-sustaining in schools by the end of 2002. Education authorities were aware of this provision from 1999 and should have factored it into their planning for Asian languages and studies post 2002.
The Australian Government currently supports Indonesian language learning through its School Languages Programme. The Programme assists schools and communities to improve the learning of Asian, European and Indigenous languages. In the 2004-05 Budget the Australian Government committed $110 million for the School Languages Programme over the next four years.
In addition, the Australian Government is providing:
$1.3 million annual core grant to the Asia Education Foundation (AEF) to work with schools to support studies of Asia across all curriculum areas, with a further $500,000 for 2004 to provide additional professional support;
$3 million towards the development of online curriculum resources for the teaching of Chinese, Indonesian and Japanese, through The Le@rning Federation: Schools Online Curriculum Content Initiative (2001‑06), a joint initiative of the Australian, New Zealand and State and Territory Governments;
$1.2 million over three years (2003-05) to improve the quality of Asian language teaching through a national professional development programme for teachers; and
Seed funding of $4.6 million over two years to establish a National Language Centre which will help Australian exporters and other business professionals, teachers, and the tourist industry to acquire specialist language (including Bahasa Indonesia) and culture training, and to improve Australia’s relations with its major trading partners.
While the Government takes a leadership role in encouraging the learning of languages in schools, it is the responsibility of State and Territory governments to ensure languages and studies of Asia programmes in their schools are adequately funded.

Recommendation 20 DEST

The Committee recommends that additional funding be provided to the Department of Education, Science and Training to enable it to provide an annual grant to the Australian Consortium for ‘In-Country’ Indonesian Studies, for running and salary costs.

Response

In the 2003-04 Federal Budget, the Government announced several initiatives to encourage more Australian students to undertake study overseas. Indonesia is one of Australia’s most important bilateral partners in education, with a well established tradition of academic, teacher and student exchanges. Education links have been important in the political relationship as well as facilitating business and trade opportunities. The people to people links developed through education have served to sustain ties between the two countries and will continue to underpin so much of the relationship between the two countries in the future.
The Government has recently agreed to provide funding to the value of $75,000 per annum for 2 years to the Australian Consortium for ‘In-Country’ Indonesian Studies program (ACICIS). The Department will also work with ACICIS to develop a strategy for the ongoing viability of the program in the long term.

Recommendation 21 DEST

The Committee recommends that the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, develop a strategy for promoting understanding of Islam in Australian schools, and of creating ways of and encouraging Australian schools to establish sister school links with schools in Indonesia including Muslim schools.

Response

The Government is currently looking at ways to address the perceptions in some areas of the community that Australia is not racially or religiously tolerant. The Department of Education, Science and Training will work with other government bodies to address this issue.

Recommendation 22 DFAT

The Committee recommends that on October 12 in this and future years, Australians not only remember those lost and injured in the Bali bombings, but commit ourselves to making substantial and sustained efforts to deepen our understanding and appreciation of Indonesian society.

Response

The Government has a proud record on the commemoration of those killed and injured in the Bali bombings. For example, the Government arranged the first anniversary commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Canberra in October 2003 and ensured that those most affected by the bombings were able to attend. The Government organised a second anniversary memorial service in Bali in October 2004. The Government is working with Balinese authorities to ensure that any development of the bombing sites and memorials and their maintenance is undertaken in a manner that respects the memory of those Australians killed. Through its $10.5 million assistance package for Bali the Government established a living memorial to the Bali bombing. The Government is committed to deepening Australia’s understanding of Indonesia through a range of initiatives, including the Australia-Indonesia Institute and AusAID’s scholarship program for Indonesians to study in Australia.

Recommendation 23 DCITA

The Committee recommends that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts actively promotes in the agencies within its portfolio a commitment to building a relationship with Indonesia.

Response

The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA) supports the development of strong relationships with Indonesia in both the cultural and sporting areas. It has an overarching role of supporting cultural and sporting agencies within its portfolio to enable them to meet their diverse objectives and program outcomes. However, cultural and sporting agencies operate at “arms length” from the Government. Agencies set their own strategic direction and priorities in relation to cultural and sporting initiatives. The Department facilitates consultative fora to enable agencies to share information on important emerging issues. These fora provide an opportunity to discuss the agencies’ roles in international activities and to share information on target markets.
DCITA also facilitates information sharing on the many activities currently being undertaken within the portfolio. For example, the National Library of Australia (NLA) maintains a regional office in Jakarta from which the NLA’s Indonesian Acquisitions Program is managed. The staff of the library also undertake a variety of liaison and representational activities in Indonesia and the region.
There have also been many of the recent exhibitions organised by the National Collecting Institutions which feature Indonesian arts and culture. These exhibitions include:
Sari to Sarong: 500 years of Indian and Indonesian Textile Exchange at the National Gallery of Australia in 2003;
Gold and Civilisation at the National Museum of Australia in 2001;
Treasures from the World’s Great Libraries at the National Library of Australia in 2001-02; and
Lamalera—Whale Hunters of Indonesia at the Australian National Maritime Museum in 1998-99.
The Australia Council also maintains strong cultural links with Indonesia by funding cultural liaison activities. Highlights of these activities include:
Funding the Asialink residencies program—Over the past 15 years Australia Council funding has supported some two dozen residencies for Australian artists in Indonesia.
The Community Cultural Development Board has funded Asialink for a series of cross-cultural projects that bring together artists and communities from Australia and Indonesia. Since 2000, five projects have been supported and have involved artists and communities in locations as diverse as Fremantle, Torquay, Padang, Sydney, Yogyakarta, Lombok, Jakarta, Melville Island, Komodo Island, Makassar, Bali, Christmas Island and Bathurst Island.
The Literature Board has provided a $5,000 grant to the Ubud (Bali) Writers and Readers Festival in October 2004, for the fares, fees and expenses of participating Australian writers.
Recent cultural projects aimed at further developing the bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia include a project of the Arts Development Division of the Australia Council. The Council, in collaboration with the Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII), has developed a new program of assistance for arts and cultural programs between Australia and Indonesia. The “Saraswati Arts Program”, announced in August 2004, provides assistance to projects that build on currently existing cultural relationships between Australia and Indonesia. Under this program the AII makes five to ten grants per year to assist Australian and Indonesian arts organisations and individuals to develop existing links and experiences to produce new cultural programs and events. The program aims to encourage Indonesian organisations to include Australian product in their programs, and for Australians to seek Indonesian partners for longer-term projects. An example of a project funded is a theatre performance called, SAWUNG GALING kembalinya Legenda (BLACK ROOSTER, the legend returns). This collaboration between the Sydney-based Sidetrack Performance Group and Indonesian troupe with Wot Cross-cultural Synergy toured Nitiprayan, Solo, Surabaya, Bandung and Jakarta in late 2004 and reached an audience of over 7,600 people.
From time to time DCITA programs also support activities that benefit the Australia-Indonesia cultural exchange relationship. In 2004, Visions of Australia—a program that provides funding for the development and touring of cultural exhibitions within Australia––provided a grant of $18,500 to develop an exhibition called Green Turtle Dreaming. This exhibition documents the complex traditional relationships and mythology of the turtle in Indigenous communities of Australia and neighbouring islands in the Indonesian archipelago.
In 2005 Visions of Australia provided a further grant of $41,999 to tour this exhibition to eight Australian venues, including some of the most remote in the country.

Recommendation 24 DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Australia Indonesia Ministerial Forum establish a Working Group on Arts, Heritage and Culture.

Response

The Australia Indonesia Ministerial Forum was established to promote trade and investment cooperation. The Australian Government has no plans to propose the establishment of a Ministerial Forum Working Group on Arts, Heritage and Culture. Cooperation on arts, heritage and culture is best promoted through other bilateral mechanisms, including the Australia-Indonesia Institute.

Recommendation 25 DFAT

The Committee recommends that the Australia Indonesia Institute receive additional funding to expand its efforts in promoting culture and arts.

Response

The Australia-Indonesia Institute already devotes considerable resources towards promoting culture and the arts. It has expanded its efforts where possible by forging collaborative links with other funding organisations and by requiring grant applicants to seek funding from a range of sources. A new cultural program, the Saraswati Arts Program, was established in July 2004. The Institute has committed $100,000 to it for three years, and the Australia Council for the Arts has contributed $40,000 for the first year.

Recommendation 26 DFAT

That a portion of the increased funding recommended earlier for the Australia Indonesia Institute be dedicated to the furthering of the sports relationship between Australia and Indonesia.

Response

The Government does not believe that extra funding for the Australia-Indonesia Institute is required to cover sporting projects. The Institute remains open to applications for projects that seek to expand and improve sports links between Australia and Indonesia. Two sports projects received funding in the current year: to improve swimming coaching skills in Jakarta; and to develop school cricket sports programs and coaching skills in Bali and Lombok.

Recommendation 27 AusAID

The Committee recommends that AusAID examine and report on the value and budgetary implications of adding cultural heritage as a third crosscutting issue in its program.

Response

I (Mr Downer) have asked AusAID to consider this recommendation and report to me.
I note that support for arts and culture falls within the mandate of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, however, current guidelines for the new Public Sector Linkages Program funded through AusAID do not preclude applications relating to cultural heritage if they have a clear development dimension.

Recommendation 28 DCITA

The Committee recommends :
that the Federal Government continue providing additional funding for transmission for Radio Australia; and
that the Australian Broadcasting Authority examine and reports on the cost and feasibility and implications of Radio Australia taking advantage of spare short wave capacity directed at Indonesia and broadcasting on multiple frequencies.

Response

The Government renewed additional funding of $3 million per year to the ABC to strengthen Radio Australia’s broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific in the 2003-04 Budget for three years. Within this funding, the ABC has the flexibility to contract for the transmission services that it believes will best strengthen Radio Australia’s role in the region. Radio Australia uses transmission facilities in Australia, including facilities at Cox Peninsula, and offshore facilities in the Northern Marianas, Singapore and Taiwan for its shortwave services. Radio Australia also uses an extensive network of local relays across the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Accordingly, Radio Australia services are now obtainable throughout our region through a variety of media, including shortwave radio, direct-to-home satellite reception, local AM and FM relays, and the Internet.
In addition to this enhancement of Radio Australia services, since 2001 the Government has provided funding to the ABC to establish and operate a television service to the Asia-Pacific region. The Government is providing some $90 million over five years for the operation of ABC Asia-Pacific.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,COMMITTEES,25,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-09-08,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Trade Practices Amendment (National Access Regime) Bill 2005 together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (NATIONAL ACCESS REGIME) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation Committee</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-08,"—I wish to speak on the annual report of the National Oceans Office to emphasise the importance of this area of activity and the often inadequate attention that is paid to our ocean environment. As it is obviously not where most people live and the vast majority of it is out of sight, below the water, we are remarkably ignorant and far less caring than we should be about the impacts of human activity and the ecosystems that are there. The federal government has chosen to fold the National Oceans Office into the Department of the Environment and Heritage. The office was originally supposed to be an executive agency coordinating ocean policy across the department of environment, the department of fisheries and forestry, the Fisheries Management Authority and other agencies. There is an absolute necessity to make sure that there is cooperation between departments on oceans issues in order to ensure conflicting interests, including fishing, shipping, oil and gas exploration and environmental needs, are all adequately considered. Funding for this area of activity must be kept up.
The Democrats believe we need a national oceans act in order to provide the sorts of major reforms necessary to underpin regional marine planning. At present, regional marine planning, in my view, is not based, as was originally intended, on ecosystem based management. Rather, the Democrats fear that regional marine planning has deteriorated into a wish list for development and exploitation of ocean areas. As an example of this, the newly formed south-east regional marine park does not protect any areas from all human use. It does not appear to provide adequate green zones and fails to adequately limit the use of seismic testing equipment in important areas such as blue whale critical habitat.
We need to make sure that funding is provided to ensure adequate and coordinated research work such as mapping and biodiversity and resource assessment. There is a real risk that we are not sufficiently aware and informed about what is even in the oceans. From that basis of ignorance we are therefore unable to know how we are affecting it by a range of activities. This has become particularly problematic with the ever-growing power and capacity of commercial fishing vessels. I am aware of a new variety of fishing called bottom trawling that is taking place. This is basically dragging huge nets across the bottom of deep sea ocean floors in areas where we simply do not know what is there. We do not know what species are there, we do not know what the ecosystem is. The ocean floors are quite literally being destroyed—almost like being clear-felled—as a result of this type of activity.
We have to do more in the way of research to address our lack of knowledge. We have to be more cautious and precautionary in the approach we take in areas where we are unaware. Having a national oceans act would establish a national oceans authority to replace the executive agency that the National Oceans Office was originally intended to be. The Democrats believe that this should be much higher up the government’s agenda. We see a need to establish a comprehensive, adequate and representative network of marine national parks to assist in the protection of Australia’s flora and fauna in the context of resource use. We also see a need to protect those productive natural systems and processes which underpin our fisheries and tourism industries. There is an important role for the work that the National Oceans Office did in engaging the community on the need for conservation and ecologically sustainable marine use. It is crucial that under the change that has been made to the National Oceans Office these types of activities and responsibilities do not disappear.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to give consideration to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee report into the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. I was particularly concerned about the issues that were raised on page 19 of the report, which relate to the poor quality of telecommunications services in rural and regional areas. The committee reported that during the course of their inquiry they were frequently told about the inadequate level of services, especially in the state of Western Australia.
With the damning testimony received by this committee from across the country, I am not surprised that this government has no interest in allowing this Senate to have a proper inquiry into the Telstra fire sale. This government seems to have forgotten that not everyone voted for them at the last election. By refusing to allow a proper inquiry into the Telstra fire sale, it is denying those Australians who did not vote for it their inalienable right to have their representatives in this Senate act in their interests.
This government does not want any scrutiny. It knows that, the more people look into what the government is doing, the more they will get angry. And, of course, the government does not want Senator Joyce to wake up to the fact that he has been conned. I do not know whether Senator Joyce has read this report, but I suspect he has not. Any reasonable person who had read this report would realise that Telstra needs to be fixed, not flogged. But it seems that the government has only one response to the problems that ordinary Western Australians from across the state are experiencing with the telecommunications services they are receiving from Telstra: flog it off.
The Prime Minister and his lackeys in the National Party told the Australian people time and again before the last election that Telstra would not be sold until the services it provided were up to scratch. This report is clear evidence that Telstra’s telecommunication services are not up to scratch, yet this government is rushing to legislate to flog off Telstra as quick as it can. In my own experience, from crossing this country time and again as a truck driver, I know just how bad telecommunications services are in regional areas. I was talking to a school bus driver the other day, who shared with me his concerns about the lack of mobile phone coverage in the areas in which he works. He was telling me about the vast areas in Western Australia that are serviced by the school bus drivers who carry about 25,000 children to school and back every day that have no mobile coverage at all. Can the marketers of Telstra—those who sit opposite me now—put their hands on their hearts and say that everyone in their home state is getting the telecommunications services they deserve? I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, that they cannot. I also put it to you that, if there were a need for one of those bus drivers to seek urgent emergency services—and I hope that there never will be such a need—for the children of the mums and dads who own the service through this government, and if this service were not available because of inadequate telecommunications services, the marketers of Telstra would be culpable in whatever sad outcome might result.
This hypothetical might seem extreme to some senators. That is simply because they are so out of touch with their own states that they allow their blissful ignorance to mask the reality of a less than satisfactory telecommunications service in this country. Speaking of being out of touch, we all use a common term when we ask friends and colleagues to ‘keep in touch’. In Western Australia there are far too many places where you cannot keep in touch. I will bet Canberra to a canker outbreak that that is the case throughout every state and territory across Australia.
I draw the Senate’s attention to an article in yesterday’s West Australian. The lead story on page 3 was titled ‘Crashed mum injured and alone’. From the immediate vicinity of this crash site, on the cutting through Red Hill on the major Toodyay Road that services Perth city, you can see the CBD very clearly. But at this very site mobile coverage fails. You can see Perth’s major trauma hospital, but you cannot call it from your mobile phone. This ‘satisfactory’ level of telecommunications service is based on the out-of-touch benchmarks set by an out-of-touch government as it pursues its goal of selling Telstra. The government is not interested in fixing Telstra; all it wants is to sell it. Instead of pursuing its obsession with privatising Telstra, the government needs to improve the levels of access to quality telecommunication services in Australia. Telstra should not be sold. Australians know this to be true.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,30,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to speak on the same report. Of course, it is interesting that we see on the Notice Paper on this very day a report about the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. I want to touch on some of the matters that Senator Sterle touched upon, particularly in relation to my own state. Only a matter of a couple of weeks ago, Senator Minchin was talking to a group of schoolgirls in Canberra. One of the schoolgirls from my state asked him about the state of the telecommunications system in Tasmania and the problems within it. His answer was that he thought things were pretty well okay—which, frankly, is amazing, given the nature of the problems which exist there.
There is an article in today’s clips headed ‘Nunamara phones in $1 million upgrade’. It says, ‘Nunamara residents have complained about telephone services in the area for several years.’ It talks about one microcosm of the problems which exist in the state of Tasmania. Recently, we had some pretty heavy rains in northern Tasmania, and in other parts as well. In the central highlands, 240 millimetres was recorded in less than a 24-hour period in one area. Where I live, it was only 135 millimetres in that same 24-hour period. We experience, from time to time, very heavy rains. The problem with that is that the copper wire network experiences massive problems because of ageing and water damage during those events. Of course, Nunamara is one of those areas that is terribly badly affected. In fact, the article in the newspaper talks about the problems being due to flooding and, in addition to that, an excavation problem which damaged the lines.
All over the state, phones, including my own phone, experience repeated outages during bad weather and sometimes when there is no weather explanation for the problem. I have asked the head of Telstra Country Wide in my state if he can tell me why we experience repeated phone outages at my home. I asked him nearly three months ago. I have not had an answer yet. One would have thought that Telstra would be able to explain such a simple matter as why there were repeated line drop-outs.
It is not a life-and-death problem for me or my family. I think I can happily say that we can survive the usual practice, which is to discover that the phone lines do not work and to ring up and have someone tell you that the line will be transferred to a mobile phone. But there are a lot of people who are not in the same position as we are. There are a lot of people who do not have mobile phones or who cannot afford to experience the additional cost of operating on their mobile phone. If, of course, you are relying on the landline for internet or fax services then you are out of business. It is incredibly important that these sorts of reports are considered by the parliament. It is an incredible coincidence that, on a day like today, this report comes up for consideration.
Having experienced the problems myself and having spoken to many constituents in the seat of Bass, the seat won by the government—Mr Michael Ferguson won that seat in the elections last October—I was amazed that Senator Minchin said that he thought that the telecommunications services in Tasmania were pretty much up to scratch. What has Mr Ferguson been doing? Doesn’t he talk to the finance minister responsible for the sale? Presumably he has spoken to Senator Coonan about the problems that exist in his own electorate. He must have heard about them. Many people talk about them. They are very common. Indeed, today’s Examiner, in the city of Launceston, the main city in the electorate, is talking about one area—an area, I might say, to which Mr Ferguson made a specific promise about mobile phones which he has not yet kept. But he does know about the problem in Nunamara. Did he not talk to Senator Minchin about that? Or was he told to keep his mouth shut lest he hurt the Telstra share price, lest he be counselled in the way that the government is proposing to counsel Mr Trujillo and the three amigos for telling the truth?
The truth is that in regional Australia—in northern Tasmania and Tasmania generally—Telstra services are not up to scratch. Telstra has been spending some money. Clearly, what has been revealed to us is that not enough money has been spent. But the problem is very significant. I know former Senator Mackay, from my state, on many occasions raised in this chamber and in the estimates the issue of the copper network line system in Tasmania and the problems particularly experienced by that system, when heavy rain fell, because of water inundation and water problems. Telstra have been, frankly, tardy in addressing those problems. What amazes me is that the government is saying, with all this happening, that Telstra services are up to scratch.
What is even more amazing is the 11 August report which the government received, which told them unequivocally that the system is not up to scratch, that there are millions of line faults and call problems. I suppose it is ironic that yesterday we were dealing with Telstra legislation and the cut-off when many people in my state have been cut off in relation to their Telstra lines—and it is clear that that it is happening all over the country. I will tell you one thing, Mr Acting Deputy President: when someone coming into this place has been elected on a promise that they will not support the sale of Telstra and has run around between the day when they were elected and their swearing-in saying that they would stand up to the government, that they would be the hero who would protect regional Australia, that they would do the right thing and that they would live up to their obligations and commitments to their constituents, but then within a matter of weeks of coming in here indicates that they have changed their mind—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I am reminded that it was a matter of days. I am being generous, because I was thinking of 1 July, but you are right. From the time of swearing-in until the rollover, we saw a very quick conversion by Senator Barnaby Joyce. I understand that western Queensland has seen a new dance craze. It is called the ‘Barnaby backdown’. This senator’s performance has seen him go from hero to zero in the eyes of the Queensland electorate. I thought from the comments that Senator Barnaby Joyce was making before he was sworn in that he was going to be a very astute politician who would be very difficult to unseat and who would be a certainty for re-election when he stands before the people of Queensland on the next occasion. I can say that he is far from a certainty now because of what he has done. I can tell you that the information I have is that there is a lot of anger in Queensland, not just from rusted-on National Party supporters but from a lot of people who gave their support or their preferences on the basis of the promise that was given to electorate. It is a very dangerous thing to make a promise that you do not keep. It is even more dangerous when it is about an issue that the public feel very strongly about. One recent poll said that 88 per cent of the population do not support the sale of Telstra.
Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, I know that you will profess to know more about what might happen in the Senate in your state when the election comes around, but I do know that your comments about the single-digit support for the National Party are probably not going to change and are not going to be assisted. The elevation of that single-digit vote will be extremely unlikely with Senator Joyce on the ticket, because of his performance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-08,"—It is nice to see you smiling, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis.
 (Senator Brandis)—I am always smiling, Senator Bartlett.
—I am glad to hear it. This report is apposite at this point in time. It is a report into the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. It is a report by a committee that I chair, although I hasten to say that, even though I was the one to table the report, I do not take a huge responsibility for the production of this, because most of the work was done by my predecessor, Senator Cherry, in what was basically his final report. It is a pretty fair legacy to leave, I must say, because it does highlight many of the problems with the regulatory regime that currently exists.
I turn not to the comments of the majority but to the government members’ dissenting report. The government members expressed the view that the inquiry itself was unnecessary because there had been previous inquiries and that that was borne out by the fact that a number of the recommendations in the report are the same as recommendations put forward in previous reports. It is true that some of the recommendations are the same, although certainly not all of them. But I think that does not in any way suggest that the report or the inquiry was not necessary; it emphasises why it was so necessary—that is, because problems that have been identified time and time again are still not being acted on. That is why the failure or inability of the Senate to properly examine the Telstra legislation as a result of the decision of government members is so unacceptable and such a dereliction of duty. It will prevent the opportunity to scrutinise precisely the problems that this report identifies and to see whether or not what the government has put forward does address them. Some of these problems are openly acknowledged by the government members on the Senate committee in their dissenting comments at the back of the report.
One of the Telstra bills that was only tabled today and is being subject to a derisory one-day committee hearing tomorrow relates to competition and consumer issues. This report and its focus on the regulatory regime goes to the heart of some of those issues. Anybody who has looked at this area even fleetingly would know that, when you are dealing with competition and consumer issues in the telecommunications area, you are looking at quite a complex area of activity. The legislation that was tabled today makes a number of amendments to the Trade Practices Act in relation to penalties for breaches, enforcement of conditions, limitations of exemption determinations and orders, variations and revocations of exemption determinations, and procedural rules, as well as matters to do with the operational separation of Telstra. Most of those are issues that the report of this inquiry went to.
It is quite clear that operational separation is complex and difficult to do effectively. This inquiry and, indeed, other reports, including reports put out by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, have highlighted some of the significant shortcomings in the existing arrangements in the pricing reporting and in the accounting separation and determinations that are being used already. It highlighted inadequacies in the process, but perhaps equally importantly—in regard to a recent report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which I spoke to in this chamber in the previous sitting week—clear indications of a lack of cooperation from Telstra and there were quite strong statements from the ACCC implying that there was less than good faith from Telstra in regard to the approach it was taking on some of its obligations under the existing law. That, I would suggest, is a cause for very significant concern. That report, I might say, went to activities and operations under the previous Telstra management, not under the current people who are causing so much angst for the government.
It is therefore extremely disappointing that the serious issues highlighted in this report are not able to be examined by the Senate, because it is one thing to say, as coalition members of this committee said, that we did not need this inquiry because it had already been looked at. I did not agree with that but, however much I disagreed with it, I could see the reason to make that argument. We have already had other Senate committee inquiries into other aspects of telecommunications. But there is no way you could say, ‘That means we do not have to look at new legislation that goes right to the heart of this very issue.’
It means, firstly, that it is an area that the Senate has put a lot of time into examining to see how it can be improved, so when legislation finally appears it would try to address it. To then be railroading it through with late-night debates, guillotines and a truncated committee examination is, again, a dereliction of duty. It is particularly derelict of those members who are willing to support the sale, because they are the ones who are enabling these changes to happen and they are doing so without properly examining, even for themselves, what the real consequences would be. That is a real shame.
We have already spoken at length in other debates today and yesterday about that fact, but this report gives extra weight to how big a travesty that is. That is because it is a significant report in its own right about very complex issues. You can see that from many of the excerpts from the evidence contained in this report—particularly in relation to small business operators, people who are trying to enter the communication markets in different ways, ISPs and others, many of whom have significant problems with Telstra operating in what they allege to be an anticompetitive way.
We need to make sure that some of those very real and very significant problems are being addressed at this time, because it is going to be a lot harder to do it in future, and it is crucial, if we are going to take such a significant step, that we examine it properly beforehand. So it is very disappointing. It is, I believe, a real, significant failure—the largest to date in relation to this government’s inability to responsibly handle the extra power that it was given by the people, in particular by the people of my own state of Queensland. It is a difficult responsibility, to be in that position of deciding how to deal with issues and how to progress them and what process to use—let alone how to vote at the end of it all. It is of course a position that I have been in and Australian Democrats senators have been in for many years, so we know that it is a lot harder than it sounds, and it is hard to do responsibly.
But I think that any objective observer would have to say that, even at times when people have disagreed with the decisions of the Democrats and the outcomes that we got in certain areas, no-one ever accused us of pork-barrelling. I cannot recall—out of all the nasty words that have been said about us, all the different descriptions and insults that were thrown from all sides, depending on whether we supported something or opposed something—that anyone ever accused us of using that position of power to pork-barrel and extract slush funds for our own particular constituencies. I do not think I have ever heard that term used about us; I have heard it used about Senator Harradine, I have heard it used about others and obviously we have heard it used about some members of the National Party in relation to this issue and others—and, in some cases, with some justification.
I think that is another example of how the loss of the Democrats’ ability to do that job should be a matter of concern. Obviously people will have a couple of years to judge how the government handles this extra power and responsibility, but I would have to say that this week has shown a pretty bad example for people to use when weighing up whether this change is actually for the better in regard to the Australian community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to give consideration to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee report into the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. I was particularly concerned about the issues that were raised on page 19 of the report, which relate to the poor quality of telecommunications services in rural and regional areas. The committee reported that during the course of their inquiry they were frequently told about the inadequate level of services, especially in the state of Western Australia.
With the damning testimony received by this committee from across the country, I am not surprised that this government has no interest in allowing this Senate to have a proper inquiry into the Telstra fire sale. This government seems to have forgotten that not everyone voted for them at the last election. By refusing to allow a proper inquiry into the Telstra fire sale, it is denying those Australians who did not vote for it their inalienable right to have their representatives in this Senate act in their interests.
This government does not want any scrutiny. It knows that, the more people look into what the government is doing, the more they will get angry. And, of course, the government does not want Senator Joyce to wake up to the fact that he has been conned. I do not know whether Senator Joyce has read this report, but I suspect he has not. Any reasonable person who had read this report would realise that Telstra needs to be fixed, not flogged. But it seems that the government has only one response to the problems that ordinary Western Australians from across the state are experiencing with the telecommunications services they are receiving from Telstra: flog it off.
The Prime Minister and his lackeys in the National Party told the Australian people time and again before the last election that Telstra would not be sold until the services it provided were up to scratch. This report is clear evidence that Telstra’s telecommunication services are not up to scratch, yet this government is rushing to legislate to flog off Telstra as quick as it can. In my own experience, from crossing this country time and again as a truck driver, I know just how bad telecommunications services are in regional areas. I was talking to a school bus driver the other day, who shared with me his concerns about the lack of mobile phone coverage in the areas in which he works. He was telling me about the vast areas in Western Australia that are serviced by the school bus drivers who carry about 25,000 children to school and back every day that have no mobile coverage at all. Can the marketers of Telstra—those who sit opposite me now—put their hands on their hearts and say that everyone in their home state is getting the telecommunications services they deserve? I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, that they cannot. I also put it to you that, if there were a need for one of those bus drivers to seek urgent emergency services—and I hope that there never will be such a need—for the children of the mums and dads who own the service through this government, and if this service were not available because of inadequate telecommunications services, the marketers of Telstra would be culpable in whatever sad outcome might result.
This hypothetical might seem extreme to some senators. That is simply because they are so out of touch with their own states that they allow their blissful ignorance to mask the reality of a less than satisfactory telecommunications service in this country. Speaking of being out of touch, we all use a common term when we ask friends and colleagues to ‘keep in touch’. In Western Australia there are far too many places where you cannot keep in touch. I will bet Canberra to a canker outbreak that that is the case throughout every state and territory across Australia.
I draw the Senate’s attention to an article in yesterday’s West Australian. The lead story on page 3 was titled ‘Crashed mum injured and alone’. From the immediate vicinity of this crash site, on the cutting through Red Hill on the major Toodyay Road that services Perth city, you can see the CBD very clearly. But at this very site mobile coverage fails. You can see Perth’s major trauma hospital, but you cannot call it from your mobile phone. This ‘satisfactory’ level of telecommunications service is based on the out-of-touch benchmarks set by an out-of-touch government as it pursues its goal of selling Telstra. The government is not interested in fixing Telstra; all it wants is to sell it. Instead of pursuing its obsession with privatising Telstra, the government needs to improve the levels of access to quality telecommunication services in Australia. Telstra should not be sold.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to speak on the same report. Of course, it is interesting that we see on the Notice Paper on this very day a report about the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. I want to touch on some of the matters that Senator Sterle touched upon, particularly in relation to my own state.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2005-09-08,"—I rise to speak on this report of the Australian National Audit Office, Performance audit—Regulation of Commonwealth radiation and nuclear activities: Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, generally referred to as ARPANSA. This report was tabled in March of this year. I do at the outset want to compliment the Auditor-General’s office on this report because it is a very comprehensive report—the reports always are, but this was the first audit report to be undertaken of the role, administration, management and performance of ARPANSA since it was established a few years ago. It is certainly a report that I urge all senators to read.
It is a very critical report and the ANAO does not pull any punches when it comes to its assessment of the performance of ARPANSA. The audit examined five key areas, the first being key governance arrangements supporting the regulatory function, the second being recovery of regulatory costs, the third being licensing processes, the fourth being monitoring of compliance and, finally, management of noncompliance and unlicensed activity. I want to refer to some of the comments and findings in this report so that they are on the public record of the Senate. Reports of the Auditor-General come out regularly, but I am not sure how often senators and members get the chance to read them. Certainly, they are reports which should be highlighted, particularly one like this that is severely critical of the organisation being audited.
In the key findings of the audit report, under the heading ‘Managing the regulatory function’, it found:
… the size and scope of the regulatory function were underestimated during its planning and implementation—
that is, the planning for and implementation of the establishment of ARPANSA. It goes on:
The number of sources was four times more than planned, and the number of facilities nearly three times more.
Those are sources and facilities which produce radioactive material. So that is a major critical finding at the outset, that when ARPANSA was set up it was hamstrung from the start—and this theme runs right through the report. At item 12, again in that first section of the report, under ‘Managing the regulatory function’, it says:
ARPANSA’s Chief Executive Instructions (CEIs) address management of the potential for conflict of interest between the regulatory function and other functions.
But then it goes on, in item 13:
However, overall management of conflict of interest is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the ARPANS Act and Regulations. Key aspects of the instructions, such as maintenance of a register of advices, have not been implemented. As well, the instructions do not require matters of conflict of interest to be documented. Potential areas of conflict of interest are not explicitly addressed or transparently managed. This includes ARPANSA’s obligation under the ARPANS Act and Regulations to license itself to operate two facilities, and many sources, to conduct its non-regulatory functions.
14. ARPANSA has a customer service charter. However, it does not monitor or evaluate performance against the standards of the charter.
Finally, in this section, it says:
15. ARPANSA has a documented process for recording and actioning complaints. However, the Regulatory Branch does not maintain a complaints register, as required.
This is a failure of very basic but very important functions of the agency. It should be remembered that ARPANSA was set up—and we supported it, and I think the principle was correct—as a national regulatory body to oversee the licensing and activities of various facilities operated under the Commonwealth’s control with regard to nuclear radiation. Unfortunately, as I said, it has not met many of those fundamental requirements.
Under the section ‘Management of cost recovery for regulatory activities’, the report states:
16. ARPANSA is required to operate on a user-pays basis, to meet the government’s requirements that entities regulated should bear the costs of such regulation. These costs include licensing and monitoring of compliance with the Act and Regulations.
17. However, ARPANSA does not have a documented cost-recovery policy/methodology, or other guidance addressing cost recovery.
This is a fundamental failure. Further on it states:
Since ARPANSA’s establishment, licence fees have increased considerably.
But then it states:
There is substantial under-recovery of costs.
Further, it says:
In particular, the costs of regulation of the Replacement Research Reactor (RRR) have been under-recovered.
Indeed, I pursued these matters at estimates earlier in the year. As a result of some of these failures in cost recovery, the government has allocated one-off additional funding to ARPANSA particularly for dealing with the under-recovery of costs with regard to the new reactor. ANSTO has not been required to find the funding, but the government has come to the party.
The report also deals with licensing, which of course is a key regulatory activity. But it states:
27. The bulk of license assessments—some 75 per cent—were made without the support of robust, documented procedures. Assessments of applications were supported by draft procedures only, which staff were not required to follow.
28. Some 60 per cent of applications accepted for assessment have been processed without a fee. Accepting applications without a fee is a breach of ARPANS legislation.
Sixty per cent of the applications were assessed without a fee. That is a breach of the legislation. In a rather interesting finding, it also states:
31. ARPANSA has not rejected any applications for a licence.
It goes on:
33. ARPANSA advised that it does not consider that these applicants were deficient in demonstrating radiation protection and nuclear safety ... However ... ARPANSA does not have systematic arrangements in place to provide assurance ... that—
special conditions—
are not being used to overcome deficiencies within applications.
The process is clearly being circumvented in some way. In a rather significant comment, I think, it says:
ARPANSA does not have a centralised database for monitoring or reporting its processing performance.
There is much more in this report which time does not permit me to go to, but I will mention a couple more points. The report states that ARPANSA does not:
... have a strategy for identifying prohibited activity by non-licensed entities.
                  …         …           …
The ANAO found that there had been underreporting by licence holders.
                  …         …           …
ARPANSA has developed guidelines for entities to facilitate their reporting. However, the guidelines are out of date, do not reflect changed reporting requirements and do not specify a timeframe or format for reports.
I must compliment ARPANSA in one respect: they have taken on board every one of the 19 recommendations made by the Audit Office and have agreed to implement them, but it is going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to do so. I hope that they can get this right because it needs to be got right and very soon. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2005-09-08,"—I rise this evening to address the issue of Queensland’s uranium resources and the contribution they may make to meeting the world’s energy needs. Presently there are 441 nuclear reactors in 32 countries. They use 68,000 tonnes of uranium worldwide each year. Nuclear energy currently provides about 17 per cent of global electrical power. However, and I think this is the significant dynamic, this is expected to more than double by 2050. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, 35 nuclear plants are currently under construction, with another 25 planned for the future. The world’s second largest energy consumer, China, is planning an astonishing fourfold increase in nuclear power production as an alternative to coal. It is expected to invest something in the vicinity of $US40 billion in nuclear power by 2020, with about 30 new reactors in the pipeline. India is also planning new reactors, 24 over the next few years.
There is a substantial and, it seems, fast growing demand for nuclear power. All the estimates are that existing sources of fuel supply will be insufficient to meet this demand. Even now, uranium production only meets half of the existing demand for fuel, the other 50 per cent being produced from the conversion of highly enriched uranium from obsolete military warheads. The IAEA predicts that these stockpiles will decline and countries will have to look elsewhere for fuel over the next 10 years.
Opening up new reserves of uranium is an obvious solution, and Australia is an obvious place to look. Australia has the world’s largest reserves of low-cost recoverable uranium—somewhere in the vicinity of 40 per cent. But, regrettably, we are not the largest exporter. Canada currently supplies 30 per cent of global demand, despite having far smaller reserves than Australia. Australia has three producing mines: Olympic Dam and Beverley in South Australia and Ranger in the Northern Territory. They produce around 10,000 tonnes a year, making Australia the second largest exporter of uranium. But we are capable of producing much more.
At present we are burdened by the consequences of the rather bizarre logic of the Australian Labor Party’s three-mine policy, which was introduced in the 1980s. The deal to appease the ALP Left always lacked, to my mind, a compelling rationale and is now well past its use-by date. As Summit Resources noted in a submission to the federal government’s inquiry recently into developing Australia’s non-fossil fuel energy industry, the policy:
... dissuades investment in uranium exploration in Australia and further consolidates our competitor countries advantage in the industry.
Fortunately, the federal government has now seen the manifest stupidity of this policy and last month moved to take control of uranium mining processes in the Northern Territory. We can expect that this will open up more reserves for exploitation.
But there are actually tremendous opportunities for uranium mining in my state of Queensland. The Queensland Bureau of Mining and Petroleum has identified 32 uranium deposits across the state. Indeed, four mines in North Queensland could begin production immediately if they were given the go-ahead. Summit Resources, Laramide and Maple Minerals have all recently invested millions of dollars in future uranium mining prospects near Mount Isa, Georgetown and Townsville. If the Queensland mines were allowed to go ahead, it would have several important consequences. It would serve to meet the growing demand for uranium on the world market; it would bring millions of dollars in investment to local communities; and it would bring hundred, perhaps thousands, of jobs to regional Queensland and help to underpin its long-term future.
It is interesting to ask why this is not happening. The answer is fairly straightforward. It is because the Beattie state government refuses to issue any mining permits. On numerous occasions this year the Premier has said that he wants the local emphasis to remain on the state’s abundance of cheap coal and new, cleaner coal-burning technologies. In the state parliament last month the Premier said that expanding the uranium industry is ‘nonsense’ and ‘would undermine the coal industry, which is the subject of billions of dollars in investment and supports jobs, businesses and communities in regional Queensland’. Apparently, we Queenslanders lack the capacity to mine coal and uranium at the same time!
It is true that one of my state’s great industries is the export of coal, but the reality is that most of it is coking coal and is used for the production of steel. Only 33 per cent is thermal and used in the generation of electricity. In any event, the worldwide demand for coal is currently so great that it will be years before we see uranium eating into the demand. Indeed, the International Energy Agency expects a 43 per cent increase in demand for coal over the next 20 years. The Minerals Council of Australia—an organisation not generally known for its inclination to undermine mining activities or the investment therein—does not share the Premier’s view of Queensland’s position. It has said that there is room for both commodities. In a recent media statement it remarked that the opposition to uranium mining was ‘founded in ideology rather than sound science, risk assessment and good public policy’.
If this unwarranted obstruction to the growth of Queensland’s mining industries were not enough, we have the further, rather bizarre twist that the Beattie government is resisting change at precisely the time that the federal Labor opposition is at last reconsidering its commitment to its outdated and unsustainable three-mines policy. So confused is the ALP on this issue that Mr Martin Ferguson, the federal shadow minister for resources, is pressing for change while the shadow minister for the environment, Mr Albanese, opposes it, and Mr Beattie, on the right of the party, supports Mr Albanese on the left. Once again, we see a rather sad Labor Party in a state of policy confusion, to put it generously. Mr Ferguson is quoted as saying:
... it is hard to accept that in a resources state, coal stocks could be exploited to take advantage of the resources boom, but uranium deposits had to be left undeveloped.
I can only agree. What a remarkably sane statement. Here we are facing a global demand for uranium and Queensland could help meet it but the Queensland Labor government is adamant in its refusal to seize the opportunity. It is worth while asking who bears the cost of this rather perverse policy formula. To my mind, there is only one persuasive answer: the people of Queensland. The Queensland Treasury loses but, more importantly, several regional Queensland communities lose jobs, investment, opportunity and security.
I realise that some people have concerns about nuclear proliferation in relation to our supply of uranium, but let me say three things on that point: Australia has the toughest export safeguard requirements of any country—they go well beyond the IAEA safeguards in their integrity; we intend to maintain the integrity of that regime; and Australian uranium is for power generation. Our agreements proscribe the use for military purposes and there are no reported instances of diversion or misuse of material supplied by Australia. It is time the Beattie government acted in the interests of Queenslanders and granted those mining permits.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Nuclear Energy</title>,ADJOURNMENT,32,1
