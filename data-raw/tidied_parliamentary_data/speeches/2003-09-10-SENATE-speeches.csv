"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-09-10,"—The Quarantine Amendment (Health) Bill 2003 makes sensible amendments that modernise and improve the Quarantine Act 1908 and, in some cases, bring the law into line with current practice. Labor supports all the provisions in this bill, which include a new section, 32B, to enable aircraft to be automatically cleared for health purposes except in specified circumstances. This, I think, reflects the modern reality that it is impractical for a health assessment to be conducted of each plane entering Australia each day. Labor is also glad to see that under this amending bill a person will not need to be shown to have an infectious disease before they can be quarantined because now reasonable suspicion of infection or exposure will be sufficient. Obviously this is an improvement when considering conditions such as SARS or chickenpox where the symptoms of ill health do not necessarily occur until some days after infection.
I am aware that Qantas have had some concerns about this bill and were not consulted about it between 2000 and last week when Labor drew it to their attention. While I understand Qantas's concerns have been satisfied, I record Labor's view that it is important that Qantas are afforded full and cooperative consultation while the regulations are developing over the coming months. This is important to ensure that the practical implementation of this legislation is consistent with the intentions expressed; that is, to update legislation and support current practice. Labor supports the bill and will not been moving any amendments.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (HEALTH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-10,"—I would like to speak today about the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003. The immediate purpose of this bill is to introduce a new regime of registration charges for Australian providers of education and training of international students—that is, institutions, colleges, schools and universities that provide educational service onshore in Australia are required to be registered with the Department of Education, Science and Training. This bill would increase the registration charges substantially, especially as they apply to higher education institutions and other providers with large enrolments. I acknowledge that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has expressed concerns about the potential impact of these increased registration fees, but I wish to return to this matter in a little while.
The underlying purpose of the bill before us is to increase the financial resources that are available to the education department for the monitoring and the compliance activities that it should properly undertake as part of its overall administration of the ESOS regime. I am sure that senators would be only too well aware that, in the year 2000, there was a series of five bills passed through this chamber following amendments instigated by the opposition, which introduced a thoroughly revamped, strengthened regulatory framework for Australia's international educational industry.
A crucial aspect of that raft of legislation was the provision of additional powers, to be administered by the education department and the minister for education, as well as the department of immigration, which were designed to improve the compliance on the part of providers. The government has said in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that is currently before the chamber that the ESOS regime was designed to ensure that only courses and providers registered on the DEST register—that is, CRICOS—can offer courses to students from overseas, that overseas students get what they have paid for by way of education and training that meets appropriate quality requirements and that, where a provider collapses or closes, the financial liability for the provision of tuition fee refunds to the international student does not rest with the Australian taxpayer. Clearly these are principles that I strongly support.
The act came into effect in mid-2001. However, as the government noted, it provided for the enforcement of a new regime which many believed lacked vigour and effectiveness. The government admits this in its own explanatory memorandum, where it says:
Enforcement actions that have been undertaken to date have demonstrated that each case will be time consuming, require intensive investigation and usually be unique in the issues that must be addressed.  
The department is limited to acting reactively. The estimates committee has been told that additional revenue collected through this imposition of provider charges would enable DEST to employ an extra 40 staff to engage in compliance activities. I take the view that these staff are sorely needed. As the government itself admits, despite the introduction of the new, tougher ESOS regime, there remain serious risks to Australia's international educational industry posed `by mismanaged and/or disreputable providers and non-bona fide students'. The explanatory memorandum also says:
... too little action has been taken against rogue providers who, for example, offer courses at below cost to students whose primary purpose is to gain entry to Australia, which calls into question the integrity of the industry as a whole. 
This is an industry which is of profound importance to Australia. Its value is about $6 billion per annum. It is one of our most significant export earners. It creates many thousands of jobs for teachers, academics, support service providers and, of course, Australians in the general economy. There are a whole series of people in this country who are directly employed in providing services to overseas students. No matter where the students live and no matter where they travel, as their families are attracted to Australia and there are other benefits through tourism, this becomes a vital, national economic issue.
It is also important for us in terms of our diplomatic standing and our relationships with other countries. The students who come here—and this should be the focus of our attention—should be able to develop lifelong links with this country based upon good, successful experiences and interactions with Australians. Currently, I am sad to say, that is not always the case. This is an industry which has a small but nonetheless significant number of rogue operators who are able to cause immense damage to the overwhelming majority of people who behave properly. Despite the new powers under the ESOS Act, the government has not dedicated sufficient resources to enforcement and compliance activities or to our providers to encourage them to ensure that the centre of their operations is the welfare of the students, not the making of money. There is far too much direct evidence now that poor educational experiences in this country are having a detrimental effect on the industry as a whole.
It was Labor that drew attention to these rorts and other behaviours by rogue providers—`rogue providers' is the term the government now uses—and the exposure of these rogue providers through this parliament was forced on this government. I believe it is the government's lack of proactive action against these crooks that, as has been explained to us by so many of our peak educational institutions and industry organisations, has exposed the industry to serious risk. Effectively the education department has relied far too much on meagre resources and far too much on the opposition to do the basic detective work that it should have been undertaking within the corridors of the bureaucracy. It is a fundamental failure on the part of the government because it has taken so long for it to acknowledge its responsibilities in this regard.
The new actions we see here today are a step in the right direction. The processing of framing legislation was, of course, essentially bipartisan in nature. As far as the Labor Party are concerned, we acknowledge that the government is now moving in a bipartisan manner on this issue, but we believe any quality assurance regime should have genuine rigour and not just be another paper tiger. Unfortunately that has all too often been the case. I want to emphasise that the majority of the providers are honest, respectable and genuine in their determination to provide high-quality service, but it takes only a few rotten apples in this barrel to cause immense damage.
I repeat my concerns about the government's failure to establish an effective fit and proper persons regime with regard to the operations of the ESOS Act. Last year we saw, for instance, the Australian College of Technology in Sydney go bankrupt. It was an outfit run by two colourful identities within the field: Mr Michael Megas and Mr Nabil Nasr. They have, of course, been associated with a number of questionable providers in the past. There were some 140 students at the college who remained unaccounted for when it collapsed. There were serious sums of money missing and serious breaches of student visa requirements. After the college collapsed, it went into liquidation. The proprietors alleged that they did not have the money to pay out the staff. Taxpayers' money was required to be used, and $144,000 was paid to bail out the entitlements of former employees. I think this is an appalling situation. It should not have happened. It is an example yet again of where we are able to identify through the parliamentary processes the inadequacies of the government's actions. 
I was given a series of documents in this matter. At the bottom of that very large pile of documents I found a copy of a statutory declaration which attempted to describe the circumstances regarding the sale of this college. The declaration was signed by someone who is now familiar to us all in this parliament: Mr Karim Kisrwani. The document I refer to claimed that Mr Kisrwani was present with Mr Megas and Mr Nasr when they negotiated a possible buyer for the college. Mr Kisrwani has some very interesting business links, as we have seen in recent times. They go all the way to the minister for immigration. It is clear in this case that a couple of convicted embezzlers were able to establish businesses and enjoy the extraordinary licentiousness that is occurring within the international education industry.
I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with Mr Kisrwani appearing with these two gentlemen, but it does suggest to me that this industry is capable of attracting highly dubious characters. The government must do a great deal more to ensure that the fit and proper persons test is applied in this industry. The international reputation of this country is at risk. At meetings that were held in February this year between a Labor Party delegation and senior officials of the government of the People's Republic of China—at vice minister rank—those officials indicated to us their concerns. The failure of quality assurance remains one of the greatest stumbling blocks in the development of this industry and the relations between this country and China. The People's Republic of China has directly requested an intergovernmental working party to move these issues forward. The governments of India and Malaysia, as well as the People's Republic of China, have indicated to the Australian government their deep concern about the unsatisfactory nature of the quality assurance regime in this country.
A number of universities operating in the Shanghai region have undertaken MBA courses which have been the subject of considerable criticism in China for admitting students who do not meet the criteria for admission to Chinese universities in the same region and for providing courses on a fast-track basis, which means that students are able to exit those programs in a shorter time frame than they could domestically and are on the job market with qualifications that many believe are below standard. Perhaps as many as three out of four of the partnership arrangements are technically illegal because they do not have local registration in the People's Republic.
The education agents operating in this industry have been allowed to get away with far too much for far too long. There is no effective registration provision for education agents. Agents are providing services for students in a manner which leads me to the view that they are outside the current regime. They are unregulated, they are untrained and they are exposing this industry to great risk. I have evidence before me from the department of immigration regarding education agents operating offshore providing educational services to students. Australian education agents recruiting students overseas have had a visa rejection rate of 43 per cent—total rejections being some 16 per cent overall. Some 25 agents are in excess of that average and a further 15 have exceeded the average rate of rejections across the sector as a whole. There is a very high level of refusal rates and cancellations by what I regard as rogue providers in the education agents sector of this industry. There is a basic lack of regulation and quality assurance. There is a desperate need for enforcement action in this area when the legislative framework is put in place, because there is none at the moment. 
While a majority of institutions act in a bona fide way, there are problems with the employment of some education agents who have a demonstrable record of failure in regard to the number of student visas rejected. The evidence is available to this government from the department of immigration, yet we hear nothing on these issues from the department of education. Channel 9 has picked up these issues recently and drawn attention to the University of Newcastle, where student plagiarism has clearly gone unpunished—one might argue rewarded—in a desperate attempt to provide students with qualifications which they do not deserve. There is clear evidence of plagiarism. There is direct copying from essays. The whistleblower is the one who is punished, not those who appear to be organising these things.
In my judgment, the franchise arrangements that are occurring with some universities in the international education area need very close supervision. There are far too many providers who, it is widely believed, are not fit and proper persons. They are operating in a way that has put the reputation of this industry and this country at serious risk. This is all a direct result of the pressures being placed on universities by the Commonwealth government forcing universities to attract fee paying students. Our reputation is being put at risk by a government whose policies are predicated on the assumption that there are ever increasing numbers of people out there who are prepared to pay for the services provided by universities.
The Commonwealth has a direct responsibility here. It cannot maintain the claim that it is someone else's fault—be it the states or the universities—for not providing the services for which students rightly pay. It is not satisfactory for the complaints being received from international students about their treatment in this country continuing to go unattended. There is far too much evidence—evidence put before the Senate estimates committee—of students' unhappiness with the way universities have been treating them. Universities have been isolating them and not providing the full educational experience. They have not been meeting the reasonable and proper demand that international students get the opportunity to mix and work with domestic students, with Australians, so they get the full benefit of their time in this country. International students are all too often treated as cash cows. They are open to exploitation and abuse, which is no credit to this country.
This industry of such importance, which should provide an experience of lifelong value to the students and which ought to be of enormous value to this country, is not being successfully managed, so this industry's full potential is not being realised. This is a classic case where the failure of the market, compounded by the failure of regulation, has produced a situation whereby this country is the dramatic loser. So, with those words in mind, I suggest that this is legislation we ought to support because it is at least a step in the right direction. It is too little too late but it is better than no action being taken at all. I understand Senator Stott Despoja will be moving a second reading amendment. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS (REGISTRATION CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-09-10,"—Following on from Senator Carr in relation to the second reading amendment that I will move at the end of my comments, I foreshadow that I will amend that shortly. After those spirited words from Senator Carr I actually thought he was going to say that the Labor Party was opposing the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003, but in fact, as he said in the dying minutes of his comments, he thinks that this legislation is overdue and is a step in the right direction. The Australian Democrats think it is a wrong step and we are among a number of groups that feel that way, not the least of which is the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, arguably a key stakeholder in the higher education sector and a group that I would not define as the most radical in the higher education sector. Along with the AVCC, there has been some outcry from groups such as the National Union of Students and CAPA, the postgraduate association. 
Certainly international students, through postgraduate and undergraduate representative bodies, have made their views on this legislation felt. The government's proposals for visa increases would hit hard not only those overseas students who are here but those who are planning on coming to Australia. They see this legislation as having a deleterious effect on our reputation. It has been made very clear that international students and organisations that represent them are prepared to run international campaigns that will raise awareness of Australia's view of overseas students as cash cows.
The legislation that we have before us in relation to increasing charges for overseas students is clearly, blatantly a revenue-raising measure. That was the reason the Australian Democrats moved to disallow the initial visa increases. We fought valiantly in that debate but lost, for the same reason I expect we will not succeed in opposing this legislation today. The opposition, despite the rhetoric we have heard, joined with the government to allow those increases to go through in a regulatory form—that was the Migration Amendment Regulations 2003—and now they are supporting the passage of this legislation, albeit with a second reading amendment, I hope, by the Australian Democrats. But that is not good enough.
I think in this debate we need to get a perspective on how charges have increased for overseas students. We also have to be mindful of the fact that education is one of Australia's most successful areas of export. We make billions of dollars through overseas students, but, as we all know, education generally and higher education specifically have a public good. When it comes to overseas students we cannot underestimate the cultural exchange, the social, intellectual and other benefits, as well as that economic impact. Being mindful of that, we also have to get some perspective on visa charges and the increased costs and charges that we in Australia have slugged overseas students with over a number of years. I put on record during the disallowance debate some of those increases. For those students wondering why Australia is doing this and for those education groups concerned about these increases it is worth putting on the record again exactly how Australia has fared. In 1998 visa charges, including work rights, were $285. As a consequence of the latest fees hike being supported—and it is being supported—the charges will be $455, including work rights. That is an astonishing 60 per cent increase in only five years. It is an extraordinary impost and it is undeniably quite a large jump.
By way of comparison, in 2001 there was a study conducted of the costs of education for international students in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. IDP Education Australia did that study. They found that the costs in Australia were significantly higher than those of our main competitors in the international market. If you look at the comparison of the rates in that survey in 2001, you will see that Australia was the equivalent of $US156; New Zealand was between zero US dollars and $US70; Canada was the equivalent of $US82; the UK was the equivalent of $US48; and the US was $US45. So Australia was a standout at $US156. It should also of course be noted that the Australian dollar has increased in US dollar terms in recent years. I acknowledge that visas are only a minor part of the total outlay of overseas students who choose to come to Australia—and they are getting more and more picky about what export education services they will use. Clearly, I hope, Australia does not want to lose its pre-eminence in this area. We do not want to lose the fact that we are a good place for people from all around the world to come and study. 
So this bill is just the latest attempt by the government to increase the costs of education for overseas students. It reinforces the fact that the government views overseas students as cash cows, as revenue-raising sources. It is undeniable that this legislation will make money for the government. The Bills Digest acknowledges that, the government's own figures acknowledge that and, indeed, figures that have been provided by other groups such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee bear that out as well. We believe it is unacceptable and that is why we are opposing the legislation.
The bill essentially aims to change the annual registration charge structure for education service providers. This would result in a huge cost increase for registered providers with higher enrolments. The current annual registration charge, as people may know, is a tiered structure which relates to ranges of the number of student enrolments. In 2003 the registration charge ranged from $432 for providers with one to 10 enrolments to a maximum of $8,462 for providers with more than 400 enrolments.
The government expects to get $1.8 million in revenue for this charge in 2003. This bill proposes to change this fee structure to a $300 base charge and an additional $25 charge for each enrolled student. Although this would link the charge more directly to the number of students enrolled with each provider, it is clearly an attempt to slug those who provide education services to overseas students with higher costs—and, we can predict, to slug international students themselves because of those other outlays that they have to bear. For example, a provider with 9,000 enrolments would currently be charged $8,462. However, under the new charge you are looking at $225,300. This would place an unacceptable burden on international students, but it would also place a burden on those providers of education services for overseas students. It is inequitable that international students should be forced to foot the bill for measures that we believe the Commonwealth should be assisting with.
According to the explanatory memorandum, the government states that it will receive an additional $5.1 million over four years on an ongoing basis if this bill is passed. The government claims these increases are necessary to meet the costs of increased compliance and enforcement activity of those organisations that provide education services for overseas students. The government states—again in the explanatory memorandum—that the ESOS Charges Act returns insufficient funds for proactive enforcement action. How can the government argue this when the government's own forward revenue estimates show a total of $6.1 million in 2006-07? That is actually more than three times the amount that the government has estimated it will require to cover the costs of its own `stronger regulatory responsibilities'; it is arguing that it needs around $2 million a year.  
Despite the government's treatment of international students as primarily a revenue-raising mechanism, it is clear that the internationalisation of education provides considerable benefit to this country, to our government and to the entire community. I touched on those points earlier—the public good that comes with education generally, but specifically the cultural and other exchange that comes with overseas students being in Australia, and the economic benefit that is very clear not only from the fees that students pay but also from the money that students spend when they are living in this country. Does it not make sense for the government to be investing in this area of export—investing in education generally, but specifically this area—and not be attempting to profit from such provision of education to overseas students?
I mentioned that a number of key groups in the higher education sector were concerned about these issues and indeed were lobbying parties and groups in the chamber to oppose this legislation. I mentioned the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. My understanding also is that the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Students, CAPA and other bodies, and specifically their overseas student wings, have made very clear their concerns about this legislation. They are concerned not because they do not expect to pay something but because our costs are so radically out of step with other countries with whom we are competing and because of the fact that it will deter students from coming to study in Australia. 
The AVCC, as senators would know, have been particularly strong and vocal in their criticism. They have done quite a few studies to estimate the impact that this would have in financial terms. They are arguing that the imposition of an additional registration charge of $25 per student on education institutions which enrol overseas students will have a dramatic effect. Using the DEST estimates, they claim that this will result in additional revenue of more than $20 million over four years. For universities with the largest number of overseas students, this will result in an increase in charges from just over $8,000, as I mentioned, to around $200,000. They have asked us to put these figures on the record today and also to ask the government what is the rationale behind these revenue raising mechanisms, given that this is—if you use the most conservative figures—at least three times the amount that the government needs.
According to the AVCC, the government want to build up the number of providers—and they could be schools or private colleges—but why should universities which are already extremely underfunded pay more money for the government to be able to build up additional providers? That came from the new President of the AVCC, Professor Di Yerbury. She has condemned the proposals. In fact, using a specific example relating to 8,600 students, they have singled out Monash University as a case in point. Monash, which has more than 8,600 overseas students and now pays the existing maximum registration fee of $8,462, would instead pay $250,975. That is a thirtyfold increase. This is why the AVCC and other groups are so angry.
The University of Melbourne and RMIT are other examples. Currently they both pay $8,462. Under this proposal, the University of Melbourne would be paying $165,500 and RMIT would be paying $145,500. No wonder the AVCC is arguing that this `$3 billion industry' is being milked. Universities say they are being milked by the federal government for their success in attracting international students. The government cannot have it two ways. This cannot be an area that we are particularly proud of or that we boast when at the same time the government puts these barriers in the path of those universities that are attracting overseas students and most notably puts barriers in the path of those students who would come to Australia to study. 
However, given the current climate in relation to higher education policy and debate, is it that surprising? On the one hand we have universities that are desperately in need of funds, we have universities that are arguably in crisis, we have academics and general staff who deserve pay increases and some degree of security, we have students who are paying among the highest fees and charges in the industrialised world and who are soon to be slugged with additional fees and charges if the current government reforms are passed not only in the House but also in this place, and we have a recognition that universities deserve more support in the form of operating grants and finances. Yet, on the other hand, we have a proposal from government that does not look at the prospect of additional public investment in a sector that has been underresourced for many years, not just by this government but by the previous government as well. And what is the answer? Cost shifting to students.
Students have already borne the high cost of their own education because notions of public good went out the window in the late eighties with the Labor government. It is now proposed to increase HECS fees by up to 30 per cent for students studying at public universities around Australia. It is a move that the Democrats strongly oppose, as do the key groups in the sector. When the universities say they could help finance some of the activities they provide through internationalisation of education—and, admittedly, some universities acknowledge the revenue-raising aspects and appeal of overseas students—what does the government do? It imposes increased visa and registration charges for providers that mean universities will probably see a decrease in the number of students who come to Australia.
Australia has a proud record on international education. Many people know of the Colombo Plan that was established after the Second World War. It had a far-reaching effect in building cultural, strategic, political and other relations—notably in the South-East Asia region. I have put on record before in this place that in 1985 the Australian Labor Party commenced the shift to treating international students as a market by opening up those fee-paying arrangements. Since then, but particularly since this government got into power, international students have been an increasingly important source of revenue for universities. That is partly, as I have mentioned, because this government has reduced—and it has in real terms—its higher education spending on students.
International education has a fundamental value to this nation. It is extraordinary in its value in economic terms. In financial or dollar terms, it is worth around $5 billion per annum. It is the third largest services export and the eighth largest sector overall. Moreover, the sector has grown primarily through the initiatives of universities, with little Commonwealth assistance. The universities have provided a lot of the initiative and have done a lot of the work in promotion—and certainly in resource terms—to increase our share of export education. That is why we should be listening to what the vice-chancellors have said on this issue. We should be taking into account their views, the views of key stakeholders.
Even the Bills Digest acknowledges very clearly the criticisms in relation to this legislation, as have all those groups I have mentioned in this debate, the Labor Party and a number of us around the chamber. I include Senator Harris in that, and I should put on the record that Senator Harris did support the disallowance motion to the migration regulations moved by the Democrats a couple of months ago. Those groups have made a very clear criticism, and it is one that the government has yet to respond to, of the lack of consultation with the sector. That criticism of government is acknowledged in my second reading amendment. But I would prefer to get a response from the minister on behalf of the government as to why these ad hoc and quite radical changes to our policy and the funding of international education have been made not only without broader reflection on the impact of the changes but also without consultation with the sector. Surely some of these problems and criticisms could have been avoided if the government had consulted with those notable groups in the sector. 
I acknowledge that there are some positive reforms in the package proposed by Minister Nelson in relation to international students. There are some good programs and some good ideas in the reform package, such as increased funding for the Endeavour program scholarship, the four centres of excellence and an increased focus on compliance and quality. We have no problem with those measures. In fact, we commend them. But why should international students have to fund them through yet another hike in the cost of visa applications? Indeed, why should registration charges be increased?
When it comes to marketing, we acknowledge that the largest item of expenditure in the package is the promotion of international education. I think it is around $41.7 million. But the reality is that a lot of the promotion and a lot of the marketing—and successful marketing at that—has been done by the universities. This is not an area that the Commonwealth necessarily need to be putting funding into. They should not be slugging students—or, indeed, their providers—who come to this country in order to fund that kind of marketing. Universities are quite happy to be involved in the marketing. International students should not be responsible for DEST's funding of promotional activities.
I put on record again the Democrats' strong opposition to this legislation. We hope to find some supporters, including Senator Harris. Considering the strong words we heard from the representative of the opposition, Senator Carr, the Labor Party could at least match that rhetoric with a vote today. Government should go back to the consultation table, back to talking to students and their representatives, and find out how they could deal with this in a much better way—a way that does not have a deleterious effect on the sector, the stakeholders, the students and our country's reputation. Some of my concerns are addressed in the Australian Democrats second reading amendment standing in my name. I move:
	At the end of the motion, add:
	“but the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for treating international students primarily as a revenue-raising mechanism;
	(b)	acknowledges that the international-isation of education provides a considerable public benefit and, as such, it warrants direct Commonwealth investment; and
	(c)	condemns the Government for not adequately consulting the higher education sector on this bill”.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS (REGISTRATION CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-09-10,"—I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003. One Nation does not support the government's proposal to increase fees and charges on overseas students and Australian education institutions enrolling overseas students. The bill will cost the education export industry $90 million over the next four years. Firstly, the bill will result in an increase in the cost of student visa application charges from the present $315 to $400. The Department of Education, Science and Training budget papers estimate that this increase will net an additional $69.9 million over four years.  
Secondly, the bill will impose an additional registration charge of $25 per student on educational institutions which enrol overseas students. DEST estimates that this will result in additional revenue of $20 million over four years. For the universities with the largest numbers of overseas students, this will result in an increase in charges from over $8,000 to almost $250,000. This is encapsulated very well in an article from the Australian on Wednesday, 21 May headed `$3bn industry milked: AVCC'. It states:
However, Professor Yerbury, the vice-chancellor of Macquarie University, said the history of the Australian Education International counsellors had been mixed.
“At times the universities have walked away from the AEI and its predecessor, whose efforts have been pretty patchy,” she said.
In a separate initiative, the Budget allocated $35.5 million for the establishment of four new international centres of excellence, plus further support for the existing Centre for Sustainable Tourism.
The new centres are for: Asia-Pacific studies and diplomacy; maths education; water resources management; and sports science administration.
Again, these would be partly funded by revenue raised from international students and the universities, in a formula that the AVCC said would not benefit all universities.
“This will take money from international students and out of the universities to fund four new centres which may go to only four universities,” Professor Yerbury said. “The package is supposed to be about supporting universities, not taking money from them.”
That really sets out the basis of what is going to happen should this legislation be passed here today. 
The majority of international initiatives proposed in this bill were developed without consultation with the universities about the best use of any additional expenditure. It should also be noted that from 2005-06 the amount of revenue raised directly from universities will be significantly higher than the planned expenditure put forward by DEST. Put simply, this represents a levy on universities to cross-subsidise other functions within the education portfolio. As the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee notes:
We are concerned about the negative impact that these changes will have on the competitiveness of one of Australia's major export industries. This is occurring at the same time that our major competitors are introducing incentive programs to attract students to their universities and away from Australian universities.
It is no secret that the federal government wants to facilitate greater cross-border flows of students and education service providers. It is part of the negotiating proposals for Australia at the WTO. As we debate this bill here today, that process is actually occurring at Cancun in Mexico. One of the major criticisms of the process that the government is conducting at present is that it is largely carried out in secrecy. There are no public procedures—either prior to or after these meetings—to look at what has been agreed to. We have a situation where the Australian government, through the WTO and the GATS, is negotiating with other countries and making decisions that will impact, One Nation believes, very adversely on our education system. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's own web site states:
Australia also sees the liberalisation of trade in education services as the most effective way of encouraging the internationalisation of education and enhancing flows of students between countries.  
It goes on to discuss the purported benefits of education liberalisation, concluding with this statement:
These significant benefits underpin the desirability of facilitating greater cross-border flows of students as well as educational services providers.
I wonder what consultation the government engaged in when developing this negotiating position, particularly with the entities that this is going to impact on. What discussions has the government had with the Vice-Chancellors Committee and with the individual higher education groups around Australia? What input have they had in relation to the commitments to education that this government is going to make under GATS? I believe there has been none.
Let me be very clear about the future of education if we continue to pursue trade liberalisation via the General Agreement on Trade in Services through the WTO. Services are the fastest growing sector in international trade and, of all services, health, education and water are shaping up to be the most potentially lucrative—I repeat that the greatest trade that there is going to be in the future will be for the corporate sector. Let us get this straight: we need to understand very clearly that, yes, governments are participating in the GATS process, but the process is being driven by corporate entities who will benefit from the outcomes. Investment houses like Merrill Lynch predict that public education will be globally privatised over the next decade. There is an untold amount of profit to be made when this happens. The conquest of foreign markets has now become a common strategy among higher education institutions around the world. Already over 40 countries, including all of Europe, have listed education with the GATS, opening up their public education sectors to foreign based corporations.
The WTO now refers to the `education market'. It is symptomatically subjecting education, training and research to market laws. The federal government must allow Australia enough policy-making freedom to ensure that the education needs of our people can be met now and in the future. Education is of such critical importance to the social, cultural and economic development of our society that it should not be subjected to the binding rules of an international treaty that prioritised trade liberalisation over other goals. We cannot afford, in this country, to allow our education to become subjected to the bottom line, because that is where we are heading. With the corporatisation of education in Australia and worldwide, it will not be the benefit of the student that is the priority; it is going to be the bottom line—the return to the shareholders of these corporations, who ultimately will run these megauniversities.
The WTO negotiations under GATS are proceeding on the basis that individual WTO members will commit to opening up particular sectors to international trade with the aim of `achieving a progressively higher level of liberalisation'. The WTO negotiations are predicated on members making two major commitments in the education sector. The first one is market access. Go and have a read of article XVI of GATS. According to the article a market access commitment means that a WTO member agrees not to impose limits on the number of foreign education service providers, the number of foreign services personnel that may be employed in the education sector, the legal form of a foreign-owned/based education service provider, or the use of foreign capital. It is permissible for WTO members to enter partial commitments, with some reservations to aspects of the market access requirement.
We have it very clearly set out that, when Australia does commit to article XVI of GATS, we will not be able to control the number of foreign providers, we will not be able to control the number of people they bring into Australia to provide those services, because GATS carries with it a definition of a natural person. Why? It is very easy to work that one out. For foreign corporations to be able to bring their workers into Australia under GATS, they need a definition of what a natural person is. If we go further, the second issue is national treatment and for national treatment we look at article XVII of GATS, which says that a national treatment commitment means that a WTO member agrees not to modify the conditions of competition in favour of domestic education service providers. In other words, this commitment means that governments must facilitate an “equal playing field” for both domestic and foreign education service providers. 
Where have we heard that cliche `equal playing field'? Everywhere. It is a common denominator. What does it mean? It means that the people of Australia who commit funds to our universities—we are providing the funds for the Commonwealth government to fund our Australian based universities—will have to provide under GATS exactly that same funding for overseas corporations. It says that a WTO member agrees not to modify the conditions of competition in favour of domestic education service providers. It is there—it is clear. As I said earlier, the negotiations on these are happening now, while we are here in this chamber, in Cancun, Mexico. I believe the Australian people have a right to know what is actually being set out. 
WTO members may enter into additional commitments, and there are five subsectors of education. The first commitment is primary education—this includes both primary and preschool education. We need to look at the definition of services that are provided under GATS as government services, because we are being told that all of our education is excluded from GATS. I refute that, and refute it very clearly, based on the definition of what is government service provision. For any segment to have that exclusion, that service cannot be provided by a public entity. If we look at education, have we got private universities? Of course we have: Bond University, in my own state. Do we have private high schools? Of course we do. We even have private state schools. Under that definition in GATS, if that service is provided by a corporation, then that service is not protected from GATS. Read the first two pages of GATS—that is, if you can find a copy.
The second commitment is secondary education. This includes all general and higher education schooling and all technical and vocational training below the university level. So look out for the TAFE colleges. If you have any corporate private service providers, you will find that under GATS they will be eligible for exactly the same funding as government services. We note that under international human rights law the primary and secondary education sectors constitute compulsory education.
The third commitment is higher education. This includes all post-secondary education, particularly education leading on to a university degree or its equivalent and the subdegree technical and vocational training. The fourth commitment is adult education. This includes education for adults outside the regular school or university infrastructure—for example, day or evening language classes. The fifth and final commitment is other education services. This is a catch-all category that includes all other types of education. This subsector has not clearly been defined. 
Under GATS we have a commitment that ultimately will be honoured by this government. If it is not going to be honoured, then why has the government committed to continual five-year rounds of negotiations with the ultimate aim to remove all exclusions? WTO members make commitments in each of the subsectors separately. The number of commitments entered into across education subsectors 1 to 4 is relatively constant. It is surprising that as many liberalised commitments have been entered into for primary education as for higher education. Current international trade involving higher education is much greater than that for primary education, and other education is the least committed subsector.  
It is one thing to oppose a bill, but we need to put something in its place. One Nation believes that there should be a compulsory contribution by corporations to a trust fund from which the education system, universities, can draw on merit for the benefit of both the students and Australia as a society.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-09-10,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003. It takes me back a bit to my days as parliamentary secretary when one of my tasks was to reform the student visa program. We inherited a system that was less than thorough and less than appropriate and colleges and educational facilities were being run that did not really deserve the name of an educational institution. It took 2½ years to work through that and to work with the industry to find a much better way of ensuring that students coming here to study in Australia were coming to institutions that were worthy of being called an educational institution and that they would get an education and be assured that the fees that they were paying were going to an institution that would deliver a course. We found significant difficulty in ensuring that the registration of these institutions, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria—and I think Senator Carr will remember that it was one time I have been able to work cooperatively with Senator Carr on some of these issues—and two of the states were less than—
—She did drag the chains for years. We had to educate her!
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order, Senator Carr! You are being complimented.
—Senator Carr would not know when he is being complimented. I am glad you pointed it out to him. I was just saying that at least he cooperated in that effort.
—This is the first time you have paid him a compliment.
—No; he would not accept that. We realised that there were two states in particular which were less than forthcoming in supervising or carrying out the inspections of these colleges to ensure that they were meeting the criteria on which they had been registered.
—I knew you were going to attack the Labor government and that is why—
—I was one of each at that time. It was important that we had those significant changes to the ESOS Act, and also to the immigration act, to tighten the regulation of education and training services for overseas students studying in Australia on student visas. I think it made a significant difference. They were particularly pertinent when those changes came in just after September 11. If I recall correctly, some of those people who committed that appalling act of flying into the World Trade Centre two years ago this week were on student visas. In fact, some of them had not had their student visas finalised, so it was very prescient that we had been working for 2½ years to tighten our student immigration program and also to put tighter restrictions and surveillance on those institutions registered in the states and for which the states had basic responsibility. We had no power or authority to close them down if they were not performing appropriately.  
So there were significant changes, but the government was of the opinion that further changes were needed. In the last budget, $113 million was committed for a package for international education, which involved scholarships and various other supports for what is a very important international program but also an important export earner. It is also important for developing significant relationships with the countries from where students come to study. Many of them are from the Asia-Pacific region, but we have a lot of students coming from countries like Norway and Sweden. Norway has a particular program and we see quite a significant number of students from there studying here. That means that we have enormous bonds. There are also students from America. They are important bonds that Australian students develop with them in terms of trade, exchange and research, and nobody can ever estimate the value of those students.
It was evident that the fee structure was not as fair as it ought to have been. The new fee structure in this bill will mean that no provider will pay any more than any other provider for each international student. Many providers will pay less in the future than under the current tiered structure. Obviously, those providers with large numbers of international students and large revenue streams will have a larger total annual fee because they have more students. It is only fair that those providers that stand to gain most from Australia's reputation as a quality study destination contribute equally to maintain that reputation. We must remember that part of this is to maintain the reputation of the industry as a whole. If it is weak in one area, that affects the whole range of educational institutions. Families may come to study at a TAFE, a private institution or a university—they do not all come to study at a university—and, if we maintain the standards and the reputation of the industry as a whole, all will benefit.
It is important I make the comment that overseas students were consulted following the budget announcement. I have been advised that the overseas students said that as long as they could see there was value for money in this they did not have an objection to it. The value for money is in the fact that the standard will be maintained. That is not only important for Australian education but important for the standard of the qualification the overseas students take home and the standing in which that qualification is held. When that was explained, they were of the opinion that this fee was appropriate. When you look at overseas students studying in Australia, you also have to put the fee in the context of the Australian dollar. With the cost of education compared with some other countries, it is still value for money. The fact that students can work for 20 hours a week during term time and full time during holidays—I am seeing if I can remember this from the deep, dark recesses of my mind when I was parliamentary secretary for immigration—and that in many other countries they are not permitted to work means that there is still significant value in coming to Australia.
Some comments have been made about the impost of this cost and the effect it will have on education. I can remember when I was making the changes to immigration the world was going to fall in; the overseas student market was going to come to an end! It did not. We had a much better system where we could ensure the institutions that were registered in the states were actually providing an education and were not shonky or ripping the students off. That has added value to the industry. This will add value to the industry in making sure we maintain the reputation and standard of the educational institutions. As I said, that benefits both Australia and the students from overseas who will be studying in those institutions. I commend the bill to the Senate. I indicate that we will not be supporting the second reading amendment of the Democrats.

"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2003-09-10,"—Today I would like to make some observations regarding the principle of one vote, one value in Western Australia. This issue is currently topical because the WA state government—the Gallop, 1930s socialist-style government—has introduced legislation for one vote, one value in Western Australia, legislation which is currently the subject of a High Court challenge on constitutional grounds. In addition, Senator Andrew Murray has introduced the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002] in the Senate calling for universal adoption of one vote, one value.
It is undeniable that the principle of one vote, one value is the democratic ideal, and in a perfect world, in which the population was evenly distributed throughout Western Australia, it would be a fine system. But, as we all know, we do not have the luxury of living in a perfect world. We have to deal with reality, and the reality is that Western Australia is a vast, highly centralised state. 
—So was Queensland, but they gave them one vote, one value there.
—Western Australia is much bigger than Queensland, I assure you, Senator Campbell. You should visit sometime and have a look around. Western Australia covers one-third of the continent, an area of more than 2,500,000 square kilometres—more than three times the size of the entire state of New South Wales—with a total population of just 1,900,000-odd people. The vast majority of the population is concentrated in the south-west corner of the state, with the remainder of the state being relatively sparsely populated. The population of Perth alone is 1,413,700, with the rest of the south-west having a population of just under 200,000—with the result that something like 84 per cent of the population of Western Australia is concentrated in the south-west corner, with the rest in the east and the north-west of the state. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, WA has five of the 10 least populated regions in Australia, these being the Kimberley, south-eastern Western Australia, the Pilbara and the Central and Upper Great Southern statistical divisions.
It is precisely because of Western Australia's unique demographics that vote weighting is desirable and has been the tradition in Western Australia ever since responsible government was established. If you go to the members entrance of the Legislative Assembly in Perth, you will find a list of the original seats. It is apparent that the need for regional representation as a formula for providing the best government for Western Australia was recognised even at that time as there were a large number of seats located in the south-west and, interestingly, also a large number of seats located in the Pilbara and the Kimberley, where in the late 1800s the population must have been quite small. Nevertheless, these regional areas were given representation because then, as now, most of the wealth of Western Australia was generated in the regions. In consideration of this, and the large distances in Western Australia, it was thought appropriate to provide representation in the state parliament for people living in those different regions. That rationale is as valid in 2003 as it was in the 1890s. Today, the wealth of Western Australia is still generated in the regions and the circumstances of life, needs and priorities of the people living in, for example, the tropical far north of WA, as in other regions of this vast state, are different from those living in metropolitan Perth. 
Another equally valid practical matter is that excessively large electorates are virtually impossible to adequately service. Country people deserve to be adequately and reasonably represented in the state parliament. The only way to ensure that country people in WA are not disenfranchised is to have vote weighting in country electorates. Currently, as it is, metropolitan electorates take up an average of 158 square kilometres for each electorate. Conversely, country electorates cover a combined area of 2,521,827 square kilometres, or an average of 109,645 square kilometres for each electorate. On 4 August this year, the Western Australian Electoral Commission announced the results of an electoral redistribution that will take effect at the next state election, due in 2005. One of the new seats created, Murchison-Eyre, will cover almost half of the state. By way of contrast, the three smallest metropolitan electorates, Alfred Cove, Girrawheen and Perth, each cover an area of only 21 square kilometres. If the Western Australia Attorney-General, Mr McGinty, has his way, eight lower house seats will be appropriated from the country and given to the city. Based on the recent WA Electoral Commission redistribution, if Mr McGinty's High Court appeal succeeds, the seats of Murchison-Eyre, Greenough, Merredin, Wagin, Stirling, Murray, Collie-Wellington and Vasse are all likely to be abolished.
Ostensibly, the Gallop government is pursuing one vote, one value in the interests of fairness, but I ask: what is good or desirable about so drastically diminishing the voice of regional Western Australia in the state parliament? It amounts to nothing more than a cynical attempt to effectively disenfranchise regional Western Australia. The Gallop government is notoriously city-centric, with no demonstrated regard for the interests of country people. Indeed, it might be said that the government's only interest in country people is to disenfranchise them.
Regional Western Australians have been neglected by the Gallop government: they have lost services, endured funding cuts, had their local hospital boards abolished and witnessed the centralisation of their health services. Despite WA having the largest area of dryland salinity in the nation, the Gallop government has been conspicuous in its inaction on this problem.
—Shame! It is very important.
—I agree with you, Senator Ellison; it is very important. The government's blind pursuit of the green vote has seen it consistently undermine the regions. An example of this is the government's undermining of the Regional Forest Agreement for the South-West Forest Region—as is the decision on Mauds Landing and numerous other decisions which have seen regional Western Australia disadvantaged by the Gallop government. 
Imagine how much worse this neglect of the interests of country people would be if the Labor Party could in future be elected to government without winning a single country seat. That would be a possibility if the proposal of McGinty and Gallop goes ahead. In fact, this would be the effect of taking eight seats from the country and giving them to the metropolitan area. What will the consequences of this be for the good and effective government of Western Australia? The only answer can be that the consequences would be extremely adverse. The truth of the matter is that the political interests of metropolitan urban people in terms of law and order, health, and education services are already adequately covered by the existing composition of the state parliament. The proposed reduction in regional representation will mean that the state parliament will be less focused on the potential of the great regions of WA, which contribute so much to the Australian economy.
It is interesting to look at some of the comments on the Labor Party's legislation from the member for Pilbara, Mr Larry Graham, who is an Independent but who is able to speak from the unique perspective of having been a long-time member of the Labor Party, which he represented in the state parliament for 10 years. Mr Graham has said:
This legislation is the most treacherous act the Australian Labor Party has ever carried out on country people in this state. I get no pride or joy from saying that. This party has put its urban and suburban interests at the forefront of politics in Western Australia ... It is a centralist piece of legislation that will completely disenfranchise the people who are worst off in this State.
As I have said, excessively large country electorates have no regard for community interests and are difficult to adequately service. This was reflected in comments from Mr Barry Court, the President of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, when he said, `Some of the biggest electorates in the world are in Western Australia. It is hard to service them now—to reduce country representation by eight seats will make it impossible to service them.'
Who better to talk about the difficulty of representing a large country electorate than some of the members themselves? I want to go back to Mr Graham, whose electorate covers an area of some 858,700 square kilometres. He said:
It takes a lot of work to be a member in a big electorate. Every year on average I drive some 80,000 kilometres, I travel some 250,000 kilometres by aeroplane and I spend some $15,000 to $20,000 to charter vehicles and aircraft to get around my electorate.
The Hon. Bruce Donaldson, who is an upper house member in the Western Australia parliament, has said:
All members of this House would be aware that it is very difficult to get around a region, especially in the country. People want to see their members and not necessarily be talking to them at the end of a telephone line. Each and every one of us would have to knock back five or six invitations a day because there are only 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week. As country members must travel vast distances to get from A to B, it makes it even more difficult for them.
George Cash, another upper house member in Western Australia, referring to a committee inquiry into this matter that was held in recent months, said:
A number of submissions were made by members of the public ... They made the point that country people certainly should not be treated as second-class citizens. However, the big point that was made continually was that there was no call across the State for more members in the metropolitan area. Those people could not understand why there was a determined effort by the Government to transfer members from the country to the metropolitan area. From my experience, people in the metropolitan area have said to me that they think they have too many members of Parliament in the metropolitan area. 
If the Labor Party had the courage of its convictions, it would put the issue of one vote, one value to a referendum, but it has not because it knows that most Western Australians oppose it. So the Labor government has refused to hold a referendum on the issue. Two Westpoll's have demonstrated that the Labor Party's so-called reforms do not have a majority approval among West Australians and, significantly, that only 26 per cent of country voters support the proposals. Such is the depth of feeling against Labor's attack on regional representation that a country alliance of the Liberal and National parties, the WA Farmers Federation, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association and the Country Shire Councils Association of WA was formed to fight the Labor Party every step of the way. These people have been very generous in their support to oppose the High Court appeal by the Labor Party.
One vote, one value is a longstanding obsession of the Labor Party. New South Wales based former Prime Minister Mr Gough Whitlam has written of the Labor Party's efforts to impose one vote, one value on state parliaments since the 1960s. In May this year Mr Whitlam went so far as to attack Mr Kim Beazley, the current member for Brand and former federal leader of the Labor Party, questioning Mr Beazley's `ticker' and bemoaning:
Hansard reveals that Kim Beazley has never denounced or even mentioned the malapportionment.
—It would be a big problem in Brand.
—Yes, it would be a big problem. Mr Whitlam hails from Sydney, and, while he clearly suffers from the effete, know-all arrogance typical of Sydney people, to be charitable—
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order!
—I do not think that was unparliamentary.
—It is not unparliamentary, but you do have a Sydneysider in the chair!
—To be charitable, it is unreasonable for him to be expected to understand the unique demographics of Western Australia. However, that cannot be said of Senator Andrew Murray, who has proposed a one vote, one value bill in this parliament. Senator Murray is really from Zimbabwe. He had only been in Australia for seven years before he was endorsed by the Democrats. I think he needs to get around the state of Western Australia, have a look at the demographics, and think about the traditions and the reasons why we have a weighted voting system in Western Australia. Then perhaps he might do the right thing and withdraw his bill.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by Senators Faulkner, Ray and Evans today relating to the release of confidential documents.
I remind the Senate of the chronology of the leak of this ONA document classified `Top Secret AUSTEO'. On June 19 this year, former ONA analyst Andrew Wilkie gave evidence to the United Kingdom Foreign Affairs Select Committee on weapons of mass destruction. His appearance received a great deal of publicity in the Australian media. Around this time someone—I believe from within government—accessed from ONA on a `return and burn' basis that highly classified, top-secret AUSTEO codeword document and it was provided to Herald Sun journalist Andrew Bolt. I believe that the motivation was to discredit Wilkie. 
On Monday, 23 June Mr Bolt admitted in his Herald Sun article that he was going through `the only secret report that Wilkie ever wrote about Iraq'. On 9 July Wilkie wrote to the Prime Minister about his concern over this leak of classified information. The Prime Minister's office replied almost four weeks later on 31 July, stating that Wilkie's concerns had been flicked to the Office of National Assessments. On 6 August ONA wrote to Wilkie stating that they had referred the Bolt article to the police. It is now 10 September, nine weeks later, and the police still have not made up their mind whether they will launch a full investigation into this matter.
In parliament yesterday Mr Howard said, `Oh well, it is all okay because no intelligence material related to national security was published,' and that that was the heart of the issue. That is a very cynical spin from the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister knows it. At the heart of the issue, to use the Prime Minister's words, is a flagrant breach of national security, a failure to investigate, covering up, using our security agencies for purposes outside their charters and passing a document that contains highly classified material—perhaps material from overseas intelligence sources without their clearance—to a journalist. On the face of it, this is an extraordinarily serious breach of national security, covered by provisions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. It is a crime.
As always, the government has `us and them' standards. If the late Merv Jenkins is suspected of leaking, the goons and the heavies come down on him like a ton of bricks, but if Andrew Bolt admits to having a classified document he is not even interviewed nine weeks later. Any other Australian would find themselves in a small dark room with a very bright light focused on their faces, but not Mr Bolt or anybody associated with this serious leak. This government has a tradition of brazenly abusing security agencies for political purposes. We in the opposition say this: the full force of the law should come down on that person, or those persons, responsible for leaking that document and having that document or information contained within it supplied to Mr Bolt. The full force of the law should come down on any senior member of government who was in on this dirty little fix. That is in the interests of national security, that is the task in front of this government, that is the task in front of the Australian Federal Police; and this opposition will hold the government accountable on this important matter.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-09-10,"—This government will be accountable. This is the weakest, most pathetic beat-up that Senator Faulkner has been involved in since I have been in this chamber. He has sought to say that he `believes the document was provided' and he says `perhaps involving foreign governments'. This is an insult to our intelligence. He has not got a single, solitary, decent, respectable fact. He simply wants to protect his latest hero in this very dishonourable affair of a senior, allegedly ABC classified intelligence officer jumping ship and seeking to make a media career out of his former employment as a public servant. How dishonourable and reprehensible, and I am very surprised that you would deal with such a person as this man is evolving to be. Who is he and what was he? He has sought to make mileage from his very respected and cloistered position as a fourth-grade operative in the ONA. Briefing Channel 9 over the weekend, as he did, before he announced his resignation, he orchestrated the media. How low can you go? And Senator Faulkner wants to champion this man as some sort of saviour of the Labor Party. He is just reprehensible. Everything that has been said of him is what he has said in the Bulletin and what he has said in the Financial Review in his very flagrant, extravagant and outrageous performances, where he has sought to orchestrate the whole thing to grab himself some sort of peculiar notoriety. He did not even work in the Iraq section. He went to Channel 9 and told them before he even had the courtesy to announce to his employer that he was going to jump ship. He has orchestrated this whole thing to get some sort of grandiose self-enrichment from the process. And everything he said is contradictory. In the Financial Review of 12 March he is quoted as saying:
There is no doubt they—
being Iraq—
have chemical and biological weapons, but their program now is disjointed and limited.
So he is acknowledging that they have chemical and biological weapons. That is his story. He said in the Bulletin thatSaddam could create a humanitarian disaster and he could do it with weapons of mass destruction. Talking about coalition forces, he said in the BulletinthatIraq could overwhelm them with hundreds of thousands of refugees. This man is incongruous, inconsistent and unreliable and is the latest saviour for the opposition. It is a very sorry, sad situation. Let us talk about the Andrew Bolt article of 13 March 2003 when that journalist said:
More importantly, in saying why he opposes war, Wilkie not only badly contradicts himself but admits we should be scared of Iraq. He says that Iraq does not pose a security threat but then says Iraq, as a rogue state, should worry us as a potential source of weapons to terrorists.
Where is this man coming from? He is very unstable. At the very best, he is unreliable; at worst, he is flaky and irrational.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2003-09-10,"—It is almost beyond belief that the government have been so indolent on the leaking of an ONA document classified top secret. When it came to Merv Jenkins or Trent Smith, they could not have acted more quickly to send in the investigators. Countless interviews were held, phone records were searched and suspects were brow-beaten. Yet we now have the circumstance of a journalist acknowledging that he had possession of an ONA document marked top secret, and the AFP are still considering whether to have an investigation—just considering. It has been 48 days since the publication of extracts of an ONA document and still we do not have a full investigation. Why has the Prime Minister been asleep at the wheel? 
Yesterday, the Prime Minister ran the astounding argument that he had been assured that there was nothing of a national security nature in Bolt's article. This is just pathetic dissembling. The document is marked `Top secret AUSTEO'. Its unauthorised disclosure is a breach of the Crimes Act. The document is protected in its entirety. It is not okay to leak or have published parts of it that you decide have no national security implications. ONA has in place a whole range of document-handling procedures designed to protect its material. Identifiers are placed in every document so as to trace leaks. ONA follows a `return and burn' policy so that every document is properly tracked. What we want to know is this: was ONA asked to provide a copy of Mr Wilkie's December 2002 ONA report to any minister's office, government department or government agency just prior to the disclosures that appeared in the Herald Sun of 23 June this year?
Let us be clear about this. If a minister's office is found to have disclosed this material to an unauthorised recipient—that is, a journalist—then that minister must be sacked. It is that serious. In our Westminster system, we extend trust to ministers to properly handle security matters, but they have a duty to abide by the rules. Seeking `retaliation', which the Prime Minister has asserted as a right of government, can never extend to the use of a top-secret document to discredit a government critic.
I am not a fan of Wilkie—that is known—but I do not believe he has done anything illegal, nor have I heard anyone from the government accuse him of illegality. There is no doubt that Andrew Bolt, in quoting slabs from an ONA document classified top secret, has breached national security. Having received the document, it was his obligation to immediately return it and report the matter to the authorities. It is now Andrew Bolt's duty to put his loyalty to Australia ahead of his loyalty to the coalition government and tell us whether the ONA document was supplied to him by a minister's office, a government department or a government agency. If he wants to argue that he is bound not to disclose his source, he should be willing to go to jail for his beliefs.
We know that most of our analysis and intelligence on Iraq comes from our overseas intelligence partners. It is given to us on the basis that it will not be disclosed. If any of the material finds its way into the hands of an unauthorised recipient, we must immediately inform our intelligence partners. It is time for the government to front up honestly on this issue. If they know who leaked this, they should come clean, because if they try to cover it up, that would be far worse than the initial sin. If security agencies believe they are at risk, that their political masters will leak sensitive and secret material, then they will feel inhibited in future from passing on vital information. We will all be the losers if that is the case.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2003-09-10,"—I agree with all of the previous speakers on this motion to note that these are very serious matters for the Senate and I believe they are being treated as such. The Minister for Defence and Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, indicated in question time that a very serious response is being undertaken by the government, that the Australian Federal Police are in the course of pursuing an investigation. I will say—nobody else has made this observation, to my recollection; I stand to be corrected—that I believe the AFP will conduct their investigation with absolute priority, with absolute diligence and with no adversion in that process to any of the political to-ing and fro-ing that goes on in this place, and I am completely confident of that. 
In response to questions asked of him today, the minister also indicated that the approach taken by that investigation is a matter for the AFP. Most importantly, it is not a matter to which the hypotheses and extrapolations of the opposition can be applied with any seriousness whatsoever as they have been in this chamber today. I think it is a very unhelpful addition to the process to try to second-guess or double-guess—or perhaps just creatively assume—facts and options that might apply in this case and encourage ministers to respond to those in question time. It is not appropriate for ministers to comment on that investigation, particularly in reference to the operational matters occurring therein, and members of the Senate well know that. 
I think the hypothetical extensions that we have been subjected to this afternoon show that the opposition is, at this point, really grasping at straws in the wind. This concerns me for a number of reasons—not just because they are hypothetical but because they are examples of what is now habitual offending; that is, the extraordinary politicisation of these issues over and above the pursuit of genuine efforts to look at matters of proper procedure, to look at appropriate investigation and to look at how the process is being undertaken. This politicisation goes way beyond that. For example, in media reports earlier this week pertaining to another AFP investigation—the questioning of people like Abu Dahdah—I heard a politicisation that I had not heard before. Even the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Commissioner Keelty, commented that he was being asked questions in radio interviews that pertained to operational issues. These are questions which he is simply not able to answer—and nor should he be required to. In some ways, the opposition's pursuit, on this level, of these issues is very similar.
Senator Faulkner alleged this afternoon that there has been a failure to investigate, a covering up, and a use of agencies for inappropriate purposes—which he extrapolates as perhaps involving foreign governments, a statement which I think Senator Johnston responded to—including the passing of material to a journalist. But the bottom line here, as the minister made quite clear in his response, is that there is an AFP inquiry proceeding. Surely that is the matter of relevance for this chamber: that the AFP are undertaking their job and their role in this process responsibly, diligently and, as I said, with the utmost propriety. As Senator Johnston said in his remarks earlier, it seems to us that if one is so concerned about intelligence leaking, about integrity and about appropriate behaviour then one would be similarly outraged—and the opposition could employ extra mock outrage if there is any left—about the behaviour of an ONA officer in going to the media in advance of a planned resignation, briefing the media and contriving a situation around that. If you take it very seriously then I would assume that that would elicit similar outrage—but apparently not. 
I think we need to perhaps use a calm head in looking at these issues and use a calm head in examining them in this chamber, if that is at all possible. One would hope that in a serious parliamentary and political process—which looks at intelligence matters, which looks at security matters and which looks at matters concerning the Australian Federal Police, the ONA and all the other agencies involved—we would in fact be capable of doing that. I do not always expect the best from the opposition, and I expect to be disappointed again.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-09-10,"—I think the previous contribution by Senator Payne is somewhat startling given that she attempts to accuse the Labor Party of the politicisation of these matters when we have just had the minister responsible in this chamber, Minister Hill, admit that Minister Downer's office briefed at least one senator prior to Mr Wilkie's appearance before the committee inquiry in order to provide the senator with material to discredit Mr Wilkie's evidence. So if she wants to talk about the independence of the process and the important role of that intelligence committee—a committee which I think is very important and has been entrusted with a degree of independence and authority—then I think we ought to look at what is really going on in terms of the politicisation of this process. What we have heard is an admission that a senator was briefed with material yet to be tabled. At the moment it is unclear to us exactly what was contained in that material, but that material was used in an attempt to discredit Mr Wilkie's evidence before the parliamentary inquiry. 
We also have a prime facie case that somebody leaked material to Mr Bolt, a journalist, because his article claims to have knowledge of that top-secret documentation. That is where the concern is and that is why the Labor Party legitimately raises these concerns. What I find most galling are the double standards that apply here. I raise the investigation into Merv Jenkins in Washington as a stark contrast to the government's slowness and hesitancy in coming to grips with this matter. In terms of Mr Jenkins, within four days of agreeing to the inquiry concerning him they had an investigative team in Washington and the goons—as I think Senator Ray refers to them—were putting enormous pressure on Mr Jenkins, a loyal DIO officer and ex Army officer. He was threatened with jail and disgrace in the pursuit of their concerns about the potential leaking of confidential information. So we see this enormous and aggressive response from the government in that case. The Blunn report said that the interview of Merv Jenkins was oppressive. Contrast that with the government's behaviour in this case. We now have information that on 4 July ONA finally wrote to the AFP requesting that they investigate the possible disclosure of classified information. So on 23 June we had the Bolt article and then some 11 days later we had a letter—after some consultations—which sought to have that investigation launched.
But now, after nine more weeks, the minister, Senator Hill, is not quite clear whether there is really an investigation or whether they are still in a preliminary stage, having a bit of a look at whether or not an investigation may be launched. He was not at all clear about whether there is an investigation. What we know about Merv Jenkins is that, within four days, he was in extremely oppressive interviews with officers dispatched to Washington from Australia. That was the urgency involved; that was the seriousness with which that breach was taken. But, with the breach in relation to the Bolt article, we now have a leisurely nine weeks passing and no suggestion that anyone has been interviewed. The minister cannot really confirm whether there is going to be an investigation.
The contrast could not be more stark. There was an oppressive, urgent investigation in relation to the Merv Jenkins matter which ultimately put enough pressure on that poor man that he suicided. Yet, in the case of this very serious breach of security—this clear leaking of security information—we have this sort of leisurely, manana pace where we may be having an investigation or we may not be. Nine weeks on, what is the hurry? The minister cannot really provide any information; he is not really terribly sure. You wonder whether the government are actually serious, whether they have any interest in getting to the bottom of this investigation and whether they have any interest in having it pursued and finding out who the culprit was, because clearly the government was involved in a campaign to discredit Mr Wilkie and clearly they are one of the most likely suspects in relation to the leaking of information to Mr Bolt. It just seems that there is no hurry and no urgency. (Time expired)

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2003-09-10,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 9 September 2003 of the Hon. Donald Robert Willesee, a senator for Western Australia from 1950 to 1975 and at various times in that period Minister for Foreign Affairs and Special Minister of State.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Willesee, Hon.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-09-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate record its deep regret at the death on 9 September 2003 of the Honourable Donald Robert Willesee, former Federal Minister and Senator, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Don Willesee was born on 14 April 1916 at Derby, Western Australia. Educated at state and convent schools at Carnarvon, Don left school at 14, as both his father and brother were out of work during the Depression. His early working life was as a public servant: a postal clerk at Carnarvon and a telegraphist at Perth. Don married Gwendoline Clarke in 1940. At 14, Don joined the Australian Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists, eventually becoming secretary. He became a member of the Australian Labor Party at 21. Don was an experienced industrial advocate before becoming a senator. He had an early interest in politics, reading Hansard whilst still at school and assisting his father as he sought to become a state member of parliament.
Don entered federal politics after successfully standing as a Senate candidate for Western Australia in the 1949 general election, taking up his position in February 1950. He was the youngest senator at the time, at 33 years of age. He retired prior to the general elections in November 1975. In Don's inaugural speech to the parliament, he spoke of the importance of developing a distinctly Australian foreign policy. He went on to become the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Whitlam government, where he was involved in opening up relations with the Chinese government and took a strong interest in issues such as the law of the sea and the spread of nuclear technology. His other notable achievements were opening relations with African nations and developing better communications with Australia's Pacific neighbours. He retained a strong interest in foreign affairs throughout his life, and he recently spoke of the need to support East Timor as an independent country.
During his time in parliament, Don also served as Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Special Minister of State, Minister assisting the Prime Minister, Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council. During his time in parliament, Don was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. He also attended several overseas parliamentary delegations and conferences and travelled overseas on official visits to Africa, Europe and the United States as Special Minister of State. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Gwen, to his children and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-10,"—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to support the condolence motion moved by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the government on the death of former senator Don Willesee. Born in 1916 in Derby in Western Australia's Kimberley region, Donald Robert Willesee left school at 14, as many working-class boys did in the Depression years. He left school to become the family breadwinner after his father lost his job. Don went into the post office and soon joined both the Australian Postal Workers Union and the ALP.
By the late 1940s he had moved rapidly through the ranks of both the Labor Party and the trade union movement. In 1949 he was elected to the Senate, taking his place here in 1950 and enduring those 23 long years in the wilderness for the Labor Party. He was 33 years old when elected. He was a talented young man and he came from a talented family. His brother Bill became an MLC in Western Australia and for a time was the Leader of the Opposition in the upper house. 
And, of course, Don was father to six very talented children who, between them, amongst other things, revolutionised television current affairs in Australia. He was very proud of his children and their achievements, despite his politician's lingering suspicion of the press. His first speech, read today, seems remarkably prescient. His concerns were, first, Australia's place in the world—whether we should look to Britain, or to America, or find our own feet in the region as a member state of the United Nations. His second concern, and the one which occupied most of his speech, was the need for the government to grapple with the requirements of competition and social justice in a modernising economy. Although the Australia in which Don Willesee made that speech was very different to the Australia of today, I do not think he would have found much unfamiliar in the sorts of dilemmas we now face. His passionate wish for Australia to chart an independent and ethical course in foreign affairs is sharply relevant today. So, too, is his belief that economic policy ought to be judged by its benefit to ordinary Australians, not by its ideological purity. 
Don was briefly Labor Senate leader in opposition. In fact, he was Labor's shortest-serving Senate leader. He served as our leader from 17 August 1966 to 8 February 1967. On the other hand, he was a very long-serving Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. He served in that position from 12 November 1969 to 5 December 1975. As a key figure for the Labor Party in opposition, I think it is important to note one very significant contribution he made during that period in supporting the federal intervention into the New South Wales and Victorian branches of the ALP in 1970. Those interventions were very necessary to reform and modernise the Labor Party.  
Don served on the Machinery of Government Committee as Senate Deputy Leader after the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. This was the committee that worked to implement the Wilenski report and to reform the Public Service to give practical expression to the priorities set out in Labor's election platform. The Willesee family had one well-known run-in with Prime Minister John Gorton, but less well-known is Don Willesee's advice to Gorton as Gorton's disregard for the opinion of press, colleagues and public began to damage him politically. Gorton, Willesee bluntly advised, had to mend his ways or he was headed for a crash. Gorton's response that as Prime Minister he couldn't crash showed the gap, I think, between John Gorton's grasp on political realities and that of the union-trained Labor man from Western Australia. Some years later another Prime Minister—a great Prime Minister of Australia—could have benefited from Willesee's sage advice when Willesee objected to the appointment of Vince Gair as Ambassador to Ireland. 
Don Willesee's first ministerial appointment was as Special Minister of State, with additional responsibilities including assisting Gough Whitlam at foreign affairs. I doubt that it took Don Willesee long to discover that in foreign affairs Gough didn't consider he required much assistance. Nonetheless, Willesee's pragmatism and his lack of interest in personal publicity were a perfect complement for his Prime Minister, and Willesee became foreign affairs minister in November 1973. This brought him one of his most unpleasant parliamentary moments, when the Liberal opposition combined with DLP unions and far right activists in a mindless attack on Labor's foreign policy. They tried to make a cause celebre—a second Petrov affair, if you like—out of a Russian violinist, Georgi Ermolenko, in Australia on a cultural visit, who said at the airport that he liked Australia very much and didn't want to leave. After a night's sleep he realised, as he said later when he returned to Australia, that he did not want to abandon his family but, rather, to emigrate normally with them at a later date. Despite Ermolenko's repeated statements to immigration officials and independent witnesses that he wanted to return to Russia, the Liberal Party and their DLP allies of the time insisted that he was being forcibly repatriated. Willesee's respect for the wishes of this young man who was being used as a political pawn by reactionaries earned him a censure motion in the Senate. 
By March 1975 Georgi Ermolenko and his parents had successfully applied to migrate to Australia, and Ermolenko in fact went on to be a violinist in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. What former ALP Senator Cyril Primmer called Willesee's `down to earth, forthright' decision had been proved right. It was Don Willesee's down to earth and forthright qualities that served him best as Special Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs. As Special Minister of State he travelled to Africa in 1973, the first Australian minister to do so for 10 years, and was successful in repairing relations with African nations suspicious of Australia's previous reluctance—under the Liberals—to condemn Rhodesia and South Africa. He reiterated Australia's position in Australia's opening address to the 28th session of the UN General Assembly in 1973, as well as stating Australia's strong stand against nuclear testing and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
Throughout his time as Special Minister of State, and later Minister for Foreign Affairs, his diplomatic abilities contributed greatly to Australia finally charting an independent course. He decried `the blindly sycophantic philosophy' of the Liberal government and established relationships—with Britain, America, African nations and the countries of our region—in which an independent Australia had independent opinions, but where differences between friends need not make them enemies. 
Everyone who knew Don Willesee remembers his devotion to the Labor Party, unwavering despite the dispiriting decades in opposition, and also his devotion to social justice which he maintained throughout his life. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I express our sympathy at his passing and offer sincere condolences to his wife, Gwen, to his children—Colleen, Mike, Terry, Geraldine, Don Jr and Peter—and their families.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Willesee, Hon.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-10,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats I would like to associate us with and support this condolence motion and send our condolences to Don Willesee's family and friends. As has been mentioned, Don Willesee was a senator for Western Australia from February 1950 until the end of 1975. He was 33 years old when he first got into the Senate, which is the same age I was when I came into this place—I suspect there are not too many other similarities apart from that. Certainly serving nearly 25 years in the Senate is something that few of us here manage to replicate. There would perhaps only be two or three serving in this chamber at the moment who have served for that length of time. As has been mentioned, he served all but the last three of those years in what must have seemed like perpetual opposition—something you get used to when you are in the Democrats.
The main thing I would like to emphasise is the widespread reportage of the integrity and sincerity of Don Willesee. Given that he finished as a senator at the end of 1975—before the Democrats were first elected to the Senate in 1977—there are no personal connections between his service in this chamber and any of the Democrats, but, as with many others whom we have spoken about in this place in condolence motions, his legacy and contribution to this chamber are measured more by how he is remembered after he finished here rather than simply by the number of speeches he made whilst he was in here.
Don Willesee opposed the development of nuclear weapons and said that, while ever there was a Labor government, there would never be nuclear weapons made in Australia. He spoke out against the treatment of prisoners by the then Indonesian government, opposed the conflict in the then Portuguese Timor and was acknowledged to be a lead player in encouraging dialogue between North and South Korea—perhaps an indication of some of the intractability of many of these difficult foreign issues. But certainly, in that relatively brief period as foreign affairs minister—as with others in that particular government—some significant precedents were set and significant advances were made that allowed a lot to be built upon them. If one is going to have a legacy, to be widely acknowledged for sincerity and forthrightness, not just during your time in this chamber but beyond that, is a pretty good one to have. Certainly I am sure that the many achievements of Don Willesee are a source of great pride to his children and his wider family.
When Don Willesee retired from the Senate in the 1975 election the West Australian newspaper at the time reported that `the pity of his imminent departure from politics is that his party will lose a moderating influence at a time when it is sorely needed'. I would go so far as to suggest that part of the pity of his departure from life is his loss to a lot more people than just his party and his family—his loss to the country that he contributed so effectively towards for so many years. Again, I associate the Democrats with the condolence motion and send our condolences to his family and friends. ",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Willesee, Hon. Donald Robert</title>",Condolences,12,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-10,"—I very much wish to be associated with the condolence motion for our colleague former senator Don Willesee. As we know, he was elected in 1949. His early life was a very difficult, hard row to hoe—that is, economically. He was in a nurturing family and he knew the value of family. He had to leave school early, as has been said, to bring home the bacon. He worked as a clerk at Derby and as a telegraphist in Perth. He became Secretary of the Australian Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists. As the secretary of the union, he was dedicated to improving the conditions and lifting the wages of his members. He had quite a number of successes there. Western Australia was pretty far away from the arbitration commission, but he was certainly able to deal with the situation in Western Australia and in his contacts interstate.
He was schooled in social justice. He had a passionate commitment to social justice and to the protection of the most vulnerable. This was reflected in his passion for helping those in developing countries. As has been said, Don Willesee had a commitment to a national, independent foreign policy, which looked towards Asia. Before the Labor government became the government of the day, the outlook was towards England, Europe and, of course, America. Don worked very hard in a number of areas, including the law of the sea convention, which is designed to go some way towards spreading wealth amongst those who are least able to stick up for themselves. Don Willesee did a considerable amount of work on that.
As has been said, on an occasion in      October 1973, he stood up in the United Nations and made a very powerful speech against French and Chinese nuclear tests. Such was his strength and the wonderful nature of his expression of views that there was a line-up of hardened ambassadors and delegates to the UN to shake his hand. Don Willesee, as minister and assistant minister, looked towards Africa and during his visits to the area showed that Australia had a real commitment to Africa. Of course, he was concerned about Rhodesia and spoke very vigorously concerning Rhodesia and also South Africa.
I will give you two examples of his prescience. On the subject of the Korean peninsula, he said that if war broke out there, Vietnam would be like a picnic. Think about that in this day and age. Sure, Vietnam would be like a picnic if Korea were to enter a war. The second point that he made was when he had that big argument with Gough Whitlam over East Timor. Don Willesee was committed to giving the East Timorese a vote of self-determination. That indicates also that he was a far-sighted foreign affairs minister.
I want to say a few personal things; just at the present moment, I need to. I have always had very good vibes about Don. I was saddened to hear of his death. Memories come flooding back. Some of you will know that in 1968 the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party elected me as the federal executive delegate, in the first vote. I think I got the secretary through on my preferences. When I got to the federal executive, there was a decision made, after a day's argument, and a motion adopted against the wishes of Gough Whitlam, Lance Barnard and a number of others; it was a 10 to six vote not to allow me to take my place.
Over the next seven or eight years—from 1968 to 1975—there was constant undermining of my position. Tasmania would reaffirm my position on the federal executive and at the federal conference yet there was constant pressure from certain organisations—and I will not repeat what I said then. It was not easy, I can tell you. There were many, many dark, stressful days during that time. Don Willesee stood by me all that time. A number of my friends got a bit tired of it. In the end, in 1975, by 11 votes to one I was expelled. The one remaining was Don Willesee. Where were the others? There were six or seven people who would have voted for me but they were not there. I will be forever grateful for the courage that he showed on that occasion and on a number of previous occasions. 
I wish to express my deepest sympathy to Gwen—63 years married—and to Colleen, Michael, Terry, Geraldine, Don and Peter. Those names many of you know well. To all his extended family, I extend my deepest sympathy. Don was a thoroughly decent man and a great Australian.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Willesee, Hon.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-09-10,"—Today I, too, rise with considerable sadness to pay tribute to the Hon. Don Robert Willesee. As we know, and as many of those who have spoken today have recounted, Don Willesee passed away on Tuesday surrounded by his family, his wife, Gwen, and his six children, Colleen,        Michael, Terry, Geraldine, Don Jr and Peter. He was aged 87. Don Willesee was a good man and a distinguished Australian and this nation is poorer because of his passing. I wish to support the condolence motion that has been moved by Senator Vanstone and supported by other speakers in this chamber. I join this debate as the current longest serving Western Australian senator, and I know I speak for my state colleagues in putting forward the views that I do.
I did not have the privilege of knowing Don Willesee well personally, but I did know and admire him as a member of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. Peculiarly enough, I first encountered Don Willesee when he was Labor's Senate leader. I was then living in South Australia and I was a young delegate to the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia. This was before I moved to Western Australia. Don Willesee came to address the United Trades and Labour Council at its Pirie Street union meeting hall. I remember being impressed by his words and his presence. He had a calm, centred, yet authoritative demeanour. His address in a normally raucous meeting was heard in silence. He spoke quietly, without histrionics, which was something unusual at that time. He spoke about complex foreign affairs issues. In doing so he eschewed slogans and posturing. It was not so much what he said, although it was the first extended analysis of Australian-Indonesian relations I had heard and it opened new insights and perspectives for me, but how calmly, logically and in a stimulating manner he presented a sophisticated point of view. It was understated, yes, but absorbing, considered and engaged as well.
Many of the obituaries that have been printed about him over the last few days refer to a kind, quiet achiever. Some refer to him as the youngest senator of his time in the Senate. Some refer to him as the patriarch of the prominent journalistic family, and certainly his sons and daughters have etched their names into the records of Australian journalism. Some of the obituaries refer to him as Whitlam's right-hand man, and certainly he added stature and prestige to Gough by consolidating the Whitlam vision and the Whitlam reputation in foreign affairs. Some of the obituaries refer to his singular achievements as foreign minister in cementing for this nation a genuinely independent foreign policy, bringing us closer to Africa, putting in place enhanced relations with the Pacific island nations and, perhaps the biggest issue of all given the time, seeking to normalise our relations with the People's Republic of China. 
I have no doubt that he was all of these things and deserves a place in the pantheon of Australia's important figures accordingly. What impresses me most about his history is how he rose to these heights. Don Willesee was born in April 1916 in the small, isolated town of Derby on Australia's far north-west coast. From that humble beginning in the Australian outback in a town perched on the edge of a tidal mudflat he rose up through the ranks of the Australian post office to become a union advocate and industrial negotiator, leader of the Senate and Australia's foreign minister. It takes an accomplished and substantial figure to do that. It is almost the Australian equivalent of log cabin to White House. It is the history of a self-made, self-taught, intelligent, persistent and gracious figure. It is also an example of what capable Australians from modest backgrounds can achieve if they are given the opportunity or if they make the opportunity. His life is a substantial lesson in what ordinary people can become given the chance to develop their own abilities.
This morning I rang and talked to some of Don Willesee's counterparts and contemporaries. They emphasised to me how much of a Christian and a family man Don Willesee was. I was told that, despite the fact that as foreign minister his mandate was to cover the world, his universe was his family. They had with him a magic bond. Reading Don Willesee's maiden speech delivered in Old Parliament House, it is not surprising to see that it began with his concerns about Australia's relations in Asia and went on to discuss the evils of inflation at that time. Interestingly, though, before his debut speech he had an opportunity to ask a question. It was about whether Australia would recognise the People's Republic of China. This was a question, asked in the depths of the Cold War, that was not uncontroversial—not by a long shot; but it was a necessary question to ask at the time.
In the fifties Australia was beginning to come out of the shadow of Britain and the United States, but standing independently within the Western alliance was still then only a distant glimmer in the eyes of the most visionary people. Don Willesee was in that sense a trailblazer. Today China is one of our biggest and fastest-growing trading partners. Today the Liberal Party invites representatives of the Communist Party of China to its national convention and the Prime Minister looks forward to a free trade agreement with the People's Republic of China. Don Willesee must have had a quiet smile at these developments. Certainly on 1 March 1950 when he asked the then Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs the question he did, anyone who had forecast the developments I have just outlined would have been deemed certifiably insane.
It is necessary to say a few words about Don Willesee's achievements as a foreign minister. He is described as Gough Whitlam's right-hand man. It is not enough to say that Willesee did the hard work that enabled the Whitlam vision to be consolidated, established and realised. Ideas need action in order to be made real. Without diminishing in any respect the greatness of Gough, a lot of that action was carried out by Don Willesee and carried out unobtrusively, without seeking to push his presence forward. Don Willesee was one of those Labor stalwarts who could have achieved much more than they did. What handicapped Australia in taking full value from his talent was that he was one of those in the Labor Party at that time who had to shine from opposition during our long exile from government in the fifties and sixties.
If in 1961 the Liberal-Country Party coalition had not famously won the seat of Wide Bay on Communist Party preferences, the Don Willesee CV of achievement in the service of this nation would have been much longer and more replete. I regret on his behalf that the times were against his achieving more than he did. To shine in opposition is hard. Don Willesee's record on foreign affairs begins there—in opposition—and reveals a huge and substantial contribution. He did much to strengthen Labor's foreign policy position from opposition. 
In his own name he called for jobs and housing for Aborigines in Western Australia's north-west and for iron ore companies to employ more Aboriginal workers. That is something that is still necessary in the iron ore mines of the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Citing humanitarian grounds, he called for this country to take more refugees. At that time Asian Ugandans were being forced into exile from their country. He believed we could offer them a safe haven.
He forged links with African countries to the point, I believe, where it damaged what I think were his realistic chances of becoming, after Dr Evatt, the first Australian President of the United Nations General Assembly. He damaged his chances with the superpowers by calling for South Africa to be expelled from the United Nations because of its policies of apartheid and later also because of his stand on discriminatory policies being practised in Rhodesia.
Despite seeking to normalise relations with China, something he assiduously pursued, he nonetheless strongly protested—as was said in this chamber a moment ago—not only against French nuclear testing but also against Chinese nuclear testing and sought a mature relationship with China in which we were free to disagree. It was not a cap-in-hand relationship; it was an honest, mature relationship while seeing the value in encouraging that country to open to the world.
He sought to improve the corporate behaviour of Australian companies overseas by, as foreign minister, pushing them to adopt better employment standards for local workers and introduce into their working rights the rights and privileges they extended to workers in Australia—a quite revolutionary position at the time. He sought as well to push the rich countries of the world into providing better levels of aid, particularly food aid, to countries that were starving or where people were living in poverty. And of course—and I acknowledge that Senator Harradine said this better than I—he sought to find a practical accommodation for the liberation of the people of East Timor at a time when that was not an easy argument to make with the Prime Minister.
Don Willesee was a great servant of this chamber—and certainly of the Labor Party and definitely of Western Australia—and a devoted father to his family. He was a man of great integrity. His was a substantial life. I join others in mourning the passing of Don Willesee and I offer my condolences to his family.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Willesee, Hon.

I came into this place well and truly after he had left but Don Willesee was a Western Australian, and so am I, and I know how well respected and well liked he was by all those in the Labor Party. He gave great service to his country from 1950 to 1975, when he represented Western Australia in the Senate. He was one of those people who, when you mention his name now, resonate in your memory of the days when he was a very leading light in the Labor Party. His memory lives on, because you can recognise his name and his good deeds on behalf of the Labor Party and the government in his time. I salute what he has done for Australia and I wish his family all the best in their time of bereavement. ",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Willesee, Hon.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-09-10,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Australian Government to acknowledge that on 6 August 2003, in the case of Young vs Australia, the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that:
(i)	the Australian Government's refusal to grant Mr Young a pension on the ground that he does not come within the definition of “dependant”, for having been in a same-sex relationship, violates his rights under article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the basis of his sexual orientation;
(ii)	the Australian Government provided no argument on how the distinction between same-sex partners and unmarried heterosexual partners is reasonable and objective, and no evidence which would point to the existence of factors justifying such a distinction was advanced;
(iii)	as a victim of a violation of article 26, Mr Young is entitled to an effective remedy, including the reconsideration of his pension application without discrimination based on his sex or sexual orientation, if necessary through an amendment of the law;
(iv)	the Australian Government is under an obligation, as a signatory to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to ensure that similar violations of the Covenant do not occur in the future; and
the need for the Australian Government to legislate for partnership recognition of same-sex couples under Commonwealth law.
I guess in some ways the Senate had this debate in a reasonably comprehensive way approximately two years ago. It is not my intention to go over in any great way a discussion in which we have already been involved. The Senate has already expressed an intention in this regard in passing a similarly worded motion. However, the recent decision by the United Nations gives us an opportunity to refresh the debate and to look at where it is at now in the context of many states and territories having seriously reformed their laws in this regard since we last debated this issue in the Senate.
On 6 August the United Nations Human Rights Committee made its second major ruling in relation to gay and lesbian human rights breaches in Australia in less than a decade. For the second time the Australian government has been found to be in serious breach of its obligations under article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for failing to recognise rights on the basis of sexual orientation. In 1999 Sydney man Edward Young took a case against the Australian government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the UN Human Rights Committee, claiming he had been discriminated against over entitlements provided to partners of deceased war veterans. Mr Young took this action because all attempts to utilise local remedies had failed him. Following the death of Mr Young's partner of 38 years, who was an Australian World War II veteran, Mr Young applied to the Department of Veterans' Affairs to claim entitlements provided to partners of deceased war veterans. The Department of Veterans' Affairs informed Mr Young that he did not qualify for a pension because he and his partner had not been a heterosexual couple. Mr Young appealed this decision to the Veterans Review Board, which also refused the pension because only married or heterosexual de facto partners are entitled to it. He then took his case to the UN.
Throughout this legal, and lengthy, process Mr Young, to his credit, remained steadfast in his resolve and he consistently maintained that his case was fought as a matter of principle, justice and equality. By refusing a pension to Mr Young, the government has refused to honour his deceased partner's war service by refusing to treat him in the same way as it would a heterosexual veteran. In effect this means that the government seems to think it is okay for gay men and lesbians to fight, even die, for their country but it still wants to treat people like second-class citizens when it comes to recognising relationships. 
The findings of the United Nations Human Rights Committee were very clear: the federal government had discriminated against Mr Young. Its view was that the government should reconsider Mr Young's pension application without discrimination based on his sex or sexual orientation, if necessary by amending federal law. The committee also stated that Australia is under an obligation to ensure that such discrimination does not occur in the future. Undoubtedly there will be those who will seek to undermine the integrity of the United Nations, to distract attention or to claim that the United Nations has no place interfering in Australian domestic affairs. But the UN Human Rights Committee is one of the more important human rights bodies within the UN system. The members of the committee are not representatives of their own countries; they work as independent officers of the UN, usually bringing with them long careers in human rights law and global reputations stemming from their work in human rights. The findings therefore are substantial, groundbreaking and not ambiguous.
According to ANU legal academic Wayne Morgan, who was a consultant in the case, the ruling is the strongest statement ever made by the UN about the equality of rights for same-sex couples, and the ramifications for Australian law are extensive. Australian law often defines a couple as including only married or heterosexual de facto partners. Such definitions exist in superannuation law, tax law and social security law, as well as in laws governing the armed forces and, as we see in this case, specifically laws relating to veterans' pensions. The UN's decision clearly means that all such definitions breach the human rights of same-sex couples, and the government is now under an obligation to amend all such laws. If ever there previously had existed any doubt, there is now more than at any other time a clear requirement for the federal government to act to bring an end to this appalling discrimination.
I submit that the Australian government is now obliged, both morally and legally, to respond. Remarks made by High Court Justice Brennan in the Mabo case stated in part that `a common law doctrine founded on unjust discrimination in the enjoyment of civil and political rights demands reconsideration'. The government's time for ignoring this issue has passed and the opposition's time in not dealing with the issue in its term of government has passed too. I contend that if ever there was a time for the opposition to take the opportunity to show its true colours on where it stands on the broader question of equality for same-sex couples and gender minorities then surely this is it. 
Failure to act will leave Australia even further behind other comparable international jurisdictions that have moved to ensure equality under law. Such jurisdictions now include, to varying degrees, Britain, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand. Almost every other Western government has granted legal recognition and rights to same-sex partners. Almost every Australian state has done the same or a similar thing, yet the Commonwealth now drags far behind. South Australia and the Northern Territory remain the only localised jurisdictions that have not, in a comprehensive way, addressed this issue. Since the Senate last addressed this issue—and since I last spoke to it—we have seen sweeping reforms in Western Australia, the ACT and Tasmania. They, to varying degrees, recognise same-sex couples at a state level on issues like superannuation, property settlement, wills and estates, hospital visitations and so on. But we have not seen Commonwealth reform and, as a consequence, we find discrimination continues in a range of areas under Commonwealth law dealing with relationships. These include Defence Force entitlements, superannuation benefits, social security rights, Family Court access and so on.   
Failure of the government to act on this occasion, given the strong imprimatur to do so, risks Australia becoming quite backwards in this human rights area in the context of comparable Western jurisdictions. I believe that failure to act will bring unwelcome international attention and embarrassment upon our nation. We have a precedent in that in 1994, when the UN last made a ruling in relation to this issue—against Tasmania's discriminatory laws—we saw a Commonwealth response. That response from the then Keating government, with bipartisan support, resulted in legislation which effectively aimed to if not override then to invalidate the discriminatory laws which put Australia in breach of the UN covenant on civil and political rights at that time. It was a positive response from the parliament with bipartisan support and ultimately helped contribute to a better Australia in the long term.
We Australian Democrats believe we have a solution to the current issue before us, and that is the Sexuality and Gender Identity Discrimination Bill, which was first introduced by now retired Senator Sid Spindler and which has since been updated and reformed. It is soon to be reintroduced under my name after I have been through long consultations with human rights groups and gay and lesbian communities. Ultimately, this issue has been around for my party at least since 1995. We believe that the imprimatur from the UN gives the matter more urgency and puts greater strength behind it to bring it on for full and formal debate.
The bill effectively responds to the issues that have been raised by the United Nations committee and the bill will effectively provide the wholesale reform which the committee seems to be advocating and which the opposition has indicated it might support. This bill will soon be reintroduced and we will have the opportunity, I hope, for a further debate on it. I call on all senators to support full and frank debate of the issues in that bill, to allow for its passage and to finally put this issue to rest by resolving it through the parliament so that we are no longer breaching these international treaties and human rights obligations and, better still, so that we end discrimination against a significant minority of Australian citizens.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-09-10,"—I thank Senator Greig for his contribution because, as always on issues of human rights, Senator Greig is passionate and moving. I was here for his first speech in this parliament, which I found to be one of the most eloquent discussions of discrimination I have ever heard. As someone from my generation both in terms of election and in terms of age, Senator Greig has done this place a great service in his discussion of human rights.
—Easy!
—I believe that. I want, however, to discuss some assumptions underlying Senator Greig's proposition in the notice of motion before the Senate today. First of all, Senator Greig spoke about human rights and I want to talk for a while about the conversation on human rights. In my view it has never been enough in parliament to simply say that there is a right. That right has to be established. Simple rights talk, per se, is lazy; indeed it is worse. Professor Glendon of Harvard Law School says: 
Our stark simple rights dialect puts a damper on the processes of public justification, communication, and deliberation upon which the continuing vitality of the democratic regime depends.
In other words, talk of rights alone erodes public confidence in the legislative system. The public expects us to discuss rights, obligations and values. Let me get to moral equivalence and values. I have spoken often in this parliament about moral equivalence in different contexts. People know what I think about that. I think it has been a tragedy. The argument in the 1960s and 1970s—and the argument which still goes on today—that all moral, political, cultural and social choices are equal is simply false. It is not only false; it is degrading, corrupt, outrageous and decadent and it justified bloody murder. Surely then you would now agree that not all choices and systems are equal, for if all values are relative then so too is liberty itself. All values are not relative.
Tolerance and fairness—and I know Senator Greig and I both think those values are important—can hardly be defended by the claim that no values can be defended. We make, and should make, value judgments. That is what we do here. The point is, of course, that not all values are equal. Underlying Senator Greig's motion today is a great philosophical principle enunciated by John Stuart Mill: it is not the function of the law to intervene in the private lives of citizens or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour. While that was not particularly successful in Victorian England, it has been picked up in the post Second World War world and, of course, by the United Nations, and in a sense it underpins much of our discussion today on issues of sexual morality.
I have spoken in this chamber before about the United Nations focusing on democratic nations where it is easy to score points and fail to pick up far grosser human rights abuses. I just mention that in passing. I will not dwell on it today; it would be too easy to do so. It is a funny thing how the world has changed. In Victorian England, politicians spoke about free trade in the public sphere and in the private sphere they spoke about values. After the Second World War, social democratic countries spoke about regulation in the public sphere and in the private sphere they spoke about personal choice and private choice. The world has changed enormously.
I give this background to show that having a discussion about values in 2003, I find, is very difficult. I find it difficult coming into parliament to discuss values. In fact, it is a very unusual conversation. I believe, as the government believes, that it is not appropriate to discriminate against people on the basis of their race, gender or sexual preference. But the government believes that it is not inappropriate to legislate to enhance the benefits to certain groups where to do so would enhance values a society believes should be promoted. We do that when we give positive benefits to assist women or Indigenous Australians. We choose values and we support them. The government believes that marriage is a valuable institution. It is an institution that should be protected and should be encouraged. The government therefore provides benefits to sustain and enrich that institution.
To summarise, the government does not believe that it should be value neutral on every issue. Underpinning this claim is democratic theory. Australia is a sovereign nation. Australians elect their representatives in free and democratic elections. The premise of our political system is that the parliament has the right, and indeed the obligation, to enact such laws that it feels reflect the views and wishes of the Australian public. If the people disagree, they are free at a subsequent election to vote for a different party—one that more accurately reflects their views. The current law regulating this issue was enacted in a democratic way. Certainly if people disagree, they are free to express their disagreement at the ballot box. 
The government believes that it is the overwhelming view of the Australian community that marriage under Australian law means the union of male and female. Furthermore, the government believes that it has the right to make sure that such public views are reflected in the laws that govern us all. Again, we give positive benefits to promote values we believe are valuable. To conclude, the government believes that individuals have freedom of choice. Liberals must believe that. Liberals do believe that. But Liberals do not always believe that those choices need to be funded equally.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-09-10,"—I rise to speak to this urgency motion on behalf of the opposition. At the outset I can say that the opposition are pleased to support the urgency motion standing in Senator Greig's name. The Labor Party strongly oppose discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians, as we oppose discrimination against other groups in our community. On this matter the Labor Party's national platform is unambiguous. It states:
Labor supports legislative and administrative action by all Australian governments to eliminate discrimination, including systematic discrimination, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, religion, sexuality, disability, genetic make-up, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 
Our platform further states:
Specifically, Labor supports the enactment of legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of a person's sexuality.
Labor believes that all Australians should have the right to live and work in an environment free from unlawful discrimination, vilification and harassment. The Labor Party remains committed to taking comprehensive steps to address systematic discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians.
In recent years we have seen Labor governments at the state and territory level take steps to address discrimination against Australians in same-sex relationships under state and territory law. Senator Greig referred to a number of these initiatives. Just a fortnight ago the Tasmanian parliament became the most recent to redress discrimination against Australians in same-sex and other significant relationships. The Labor Tasmanian Attorney-General, Judy Jackson, is to be congratulated for her hard work on behalf of Tasmanians in developing this world-class legislation and securing the support of the Tasmanian parliament and the Tasmanian community. Tasmania now joins Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Western Australia in having enacted some form of legislation to address discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians. Labor governments in my home state of South Australia and in the Northern Territory are engaged in consultations with the community on these important issues.
As the states and territories have demonstrated, meaningful reform in this area must be undertaken in a comprehensive and consultative way. That remains the commitment of the federal Labor Party. Thankfully, we live in an era when a very large number of Australians at least know someone who is in a same-sex relationship and have some understanding of the difficulties they face in their everyday lives because the law provides no recognition of their relationship. This heightened community awareness and understanding provides the Commonwealth government with an opportunity to address these issues at a federal level. 
Regrettably, however, we see no attempt by the government to confront seriously the experiences of these Australians in same-sex relationships and to engage with their concerns about ongoing discrimination in a range of areas under federal law. We see no attempt by this government even to cooperate with the states and territories to deliver reforms in areas of overlapping responsibility. For example, the Attorney-General continues to refuse to accept a referral of powers from the states to enable property matters involving same-sex de facto couples to be dealt with in federal courts. As a consequence of this, same-sex couples must have their property matters dealt with in state courts. The Attorney-General has been completely unable, it seems, to give a coherent explanation for his insistence that Australians in same-sex relationships should be singled out and treated differently from other Australians in this area.
Because of the government's indifference to their experiences, Australian citizens in same-sex relationships are still forced to go all the way to the United Nations Human Rights Committee to have their concerns heard and acknowledged. That was the case in 1994 that Senator Greig referred to—the case of Mr Nicolas Toonen, who, I might add, in June of this year received an Order of Australia in recognition of his work in promoting understanding of gay and lesbian rights. Regrettably, in 2003, as we heard today, nearly 10 years later, Mr Edward Young is still facing the same discrimination on the basis of his sexuality. This of course is the subject of the motion before the Senate today.
The federal Labor government provided an effective response to the UN Human Rights Committee's decision in the Toonen case with the introduction of Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. It remains to be seen how the Howard government will respond to the Young case. From the comments of Senator Mason today I have to say that I do not have a lot of hope that there will be a positive response. The concerns raised by the committee raised broader issues regarding a whole range of federal laws, as Senator Greig acknowledged. It is important that these be addressed in a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal way. I should also note that the government issued a statement to the media last week which represented that the matters raised in Mr Young's communication had been considered and rejected by the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC. In fact, the UN committee's decision reveals the true position in relation to this. The committee stated:
On 23 December 1999, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission denied the author's complaint to that body, stating that as the author had been subjected to the automatic and non-discretionary operation of legislation, the Commission had no jurisdiction to intervene.
That is the point. The commission did not reject the claim; rather it found it had no jurisdiction to intervene. In other words, HREOC was not able to consider the merits of Mr Young's case. Indeed, even if the case had arisen in a different way, it is not clear that our national human rights body could have dealt with it because there is no prohibition against sexuality discrimination in federal law—and this is the crux of the matter. HREOC is generally forced to refer such matters to the states where such legislation does exist, as we heard today.
Regrettably, I do have to say that the government was not the only party to issue a misleading statement on that day. Senator Greig himself put out a media release, which stated:
The Democrats `Sexuality Discrimination and Gender Status Bill' has been on the Senate Notice Paper since 1995 but neither the Government nor the ALP would support it or even allow parliamentary time to debate it. 
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Senator Greig has made such a false claim. I was hoping that in his contributions this afternoon perhaps he would correct the record, and it seems that perhaps he will do so at the end of the debate today. He also claimed in the Age of 14 June this year that both Labor and the coalition had refused to debate this bill. I hope now that Senator Greig has had an opportunity to have a look at the Hansard, where he will see that Labor did agree to a second reading debate on this bill. That debate took place on 28 May 1998 following an extensive inquiry and report into the bill by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, chaired by Labor Senator Jim McKiernan, which recommended a range of improvements to the bill. In fact the very name of the bill, the Sexuality and Gender Status Discrimination Bill, was recommended by the committee. Labor senators on that committee indicated in the debate that the bill, as amended—whilst it was far from perfect or even a completely workable piece of legislation—could be supported by Labor. Once again, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Senate committee, and in particular its former chair, Senator McKiernan, on the issues raised by the bill. Senator Greig has indicated that he does intend to correct the record, and I hope he does so when the opportunity arises.
We expect that the government will treat the concerns of the UN Human Rights Committee seriously. We hope that the government will not resort once again, as it often does in this context, to shooting the messenger. Everyone is familiar with the government's tactic of using the shortcomings of the UN human rights treaty committees as an excuse not to sign the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. Everyone will remember the government's announcement in the year 2000 of a diplomatic initiative to improve the operation of these UN committees as a precondition to Australia assuming any new human rights obligations.
Like most of this government's excuses for inaction, this one too has worn very thin. I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General issued a statement on 3 July this year claiming:
A number of reforms proposed by Australia have already been taken up by treaty bodies themselves.
The Attorney-General's Department further explained this statement by pointing to the establishment by the treaty committees in 2002 of an intercommittee meeting to coordinate their timetables and working methods, to increase their efficiency and reduce the burden of reporting on state parties. For example, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has now introduced a page limit for country reports, and the UN Committee on Economics, Social and Cultural Rights is reviewing its reporting guidelines. Yet the government continues to deny Australian women the benefits of the CEDAW protocol, which would enable them to take their concerns about unlawful discrimination to the UN committee once all domestic avenues have been exhausted.
If the treaty committees have adopted Australia's suggestions, as the Attorney-General and foreign minister have claimed, it is time for the Howard government to explain what steps it now proposes to take to end its splendid isolation from the UN human rights treaty system. It could start by providing a proper response to the committee decision on the Young case.
To conclude, the opposition are pleased to support this motion moved by Senator Greig. We are pleased that the motion addresses the need for comprehensive Commonwealth laws against discrimination.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-10,"—In the just three minutes I have allocated for my role in this debate on the urgency motion, I want to commend Senator Greig for bringing this issue to the chamber for us to debate and I want to pay particular tribute to Mr Edward Young and, indeed, to his now deceased partner, Larry Cains. They lived together for 38 years and exemplified a loving relationship between human beings which contributes enormously to our society and the respect we all must have for such relationships as the staple of society. I commend the tremendous persistence that Mr Young has shown in, having been denied and failed by several institutions in this country, going to the United Nations and having the United Nations rule that being denied the veterans pension he and his partner would have been allocated under any other circumstances is discriminatory and a breach of the UN human rights convention.
The Howard government is in breach of the UN human rights convention here. I found Senator Mason's contribution, which was very clever, particularly nasty. Senator Mason said, first of all, that it was not appropriate to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, but then he went on to say that this is an issue of sexual morality. It is not. If it is, his discrimination is all the worse, and if that is the subtext—and I believe it is—then his own words have discovered it. This is very much an issue of discrimination against one long-term partnership as against another on the basis of the partnership being same sex.
Senator Mason said, `It is not enough to call for a human right. That right has to be established.' No, it does not. The right is there in the value of all relationships in our society. The community does that and this government ought to catch up. When you have a Prime Minister saying the derogatory things he did about same-sex relationships so recently, then you know that this government is way behind community sentiment—and, as this ruling from the United Nations shows, world sentiment—in the year 2003. Senator Mason said, `If you disagree, you can go to the ballot box.' I challenge this government to put this matter that Senator Greig has brought here to the ballot box. Let us have a plebiscite or a referendum, and this government will be comprehensively defeated, because it is so far behind the Australian people in the matter.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-09-10,"—The government has adopted a sensible position with respect to the reported finding of the United Nations Human Rights Committee that an Australian man has been discriminated against because the government refuses to pay him a war widows pension. Senator Greig, whose urgency motion we are debating, has, with respect to him, not adopted a sensible position. The government, while noting that the committee is not a court and that its views are not binding, is considering its views and will respond in due course, and I am sure the response will be a considered one.
Senator Greig has sought to make a special cause out of the committee's finding and a special cause out of the particular circumstances that led to the committee's decision. It is important to note here that it is a non-binding finding. One response is sensible and responsible; one, I would suggest to the Senate, is neither sensible nor responsible. 
The fact is that the Veterans' Entitlements Act was not written to cater for circumstances such as those in which Mr Edward Young and his long-term partner, Mr Larry Cains, lived for 38 years. That point I believe was admirably made by the new National President of the RSL, Major General Bill Crews, on the ABC radio current affairs program PM last week. Major General Crews got it right and, again, with respect, I believe that Senator Greig has got it wrong. Major General Crews told PM on 4 September:
As a general rule, the League is entitled to have a position which some might regard as discriminatory, but there are many in the community that I believe would support it.
Major General Crews went on to say:
I do stress we are not opposed to people who are themselves homosexual. That is not the issue.
The issue is one quite clearly of entitlements within same-sex marriages and I'd like to separate the two.
This is not opposing people because of their sexual position.
Asked to comment on the view that the effect is that people, because of their sexual preference, are not entitled to the same benefits as those in a heterosexual relationship, the RSL chief said this:
Yes, that's presently the case and that's because the entitlements are based on the family concept and people are now deciding they'll redefine the boundary of the family concept. Now the League has some difficulty with that.
I think that that is a fair position; I think that it is a reasonable position. The government of course condemns discrimination and believes that every person should have the opportunity to participate in our community and to experience the benefits and accept the responsibilities that flow from such participation without fear of discrimination. Nothing less than that would satisfy anyone in this place, I am sure.
The issue raised by the case of Mr Young, who lived with his now deceased partner, Mr Cains, for 38 years is not one that goes to questions of morality. He has advanced a plea for access to a war widows pension on the basis that his partner was an ex-serviceman. I am sure that he entered into the relationship he and Mr Cains formed without any thought of the benefits the state might provide him in the event that his partner predeceased him. There were then and there are now other welfare benefits the Australian taxpayer provides to assist people in need. This government takes its human rights obligations seriously, both internationally and domestically. The matters raised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee finding in relation to article 26 have been considered under Australian law. They have been rejected by the Australian Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.
Australian law proscribes discrimination. The Workplace Relations Act, as just one example, contains provisions to help prevent and eliminate discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual preference. Since 1999 government amendments to superannuation law have allowed trustees to accept binding death benefit nominations from members so that death benefits are payable to a person nominated on the beneficiary form regardless—I stress, regardless—of gender. State and territory laws also prohibit discrimination. In the specific case of Mr Young, it is also the fact that, because Mr Cains's death was not war caused, under the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act no partner of Mr Cains, heterosexual or homosexual, would have been entitled to a pension under subsection (1). That is a point that has not been stressed terribly heavily by other speakers. 
Senator Greig has an agenda, and I say to Senator Greig that that is fair enough. But it is, by any definition, a marginal agenda, particularly in the context of the issue he has brought before the Senate today. In a liberal Western democracy such as that in which we are fortunate to live, of course there are pluralistic views—and indeed we should encourage their existence. No society can prosper if it fossilises or immerses itself in aspic. Change is inevitable and it is to be welcomed when that change is for the better. At the same time, I unashamedly say that marriage and the family remain the fundamental basis of our society. Despite what Senator Brown said about bringing it on in a referendum or in a plebiscite across the nation, as a representative I do not detect any substantial mood for change on that front. At the same time, in a liberal Western democracy, how people choose to live and with whom they choose to live has nothing to do with anyone else.
Senator Greig seeks to draw from this case the lesson that the Australian government needs to legislate for partnership recognition of same-sex couples under Commonwealth law. That would be a contentious matter for debate at any time, but it is in fact peripheral at best to the case that concerns us here. That is a point I wish to stress here today. It is clear that there is no entitlement of the sort that Mr Young applied for, in the precise circumstances of that particular case. That is where I would respectfully suggest to Senator Greig, and to others who are supporting him in this motion, the issue should lie in terms of the detail on which the case has been fought.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-10,"—I oppose the motion. The substance of Senator Greig's urgency motion is in the last sentence, where he says there is:
... the need for the Australian Government to legislate for partnership recognition of same-sex couples under Commonwealth law.
Basically Senator Greig wants same-sex relationships to be recognised as marriage-like relationships. But such a recognition would undermine the special status of marriage in our society by establishing a legally recognised relationship alongside marriage. It is this special status—this recognition of the special status of marriage—which is acknowledged by the government in issues like access to pensions.
The Prime Minister's recent and welcome support for marriage status quo is some consolation in this matter. The confusion surrounding much of the debate is quite understandable; we rarely have the opportunity to question and re-examine some of our community's bedrock institutions. Marriage is often taken for granted. The system of marriage between a man and a woman is one that has been relied on over thousands of years across the world and across cultures. It has been tried and tested over that time and found to be the best arrangement available. It is an almost universal human institution. There is good reason for the prevalence of marriage. Stable families depend on a stable marriage and stable communities depend on stable families. The stability that marriage brings also makes it the best environment in which to raise children. That is not to say there are never problems in marriages, nor that children cannot be brought up well if a marriage disintegrates. Nor is it to say that every marriage involves children. But it is to say that marriage offers the best chance to children of a stable and happy life. It is a social ideal that we try to live up to.
Research on the children of homosexual couples has found that they are more likely to suffer socially and emotionally and in their educational achievements compared with other children. Marriage is a public commitment declared to families and to the wider community to fulfil responsibilities which go beyond personal selfish interests. These responsibilities are to each other and to any children the married couple might have. The commitment recognises that there is a genuine social good in limiting our sexual life to one that is within a monogamous relationship. 
It also recognises that male-female marriage or de facto marriage is the only way in which children can be naturally conceived—without the intervention of a third party. The government recognises the special nature of these relationships by recognising them in law and in the benefits it offers to support them. What some gay activists are asking for is a new right—the right to change the rules of marriage or de facto marriage to suit their own purposes. But marriage is not about demanding and getting what you want; it is about serving others.
Agreeing to same-sex marriage would confirm that the desire of adults to choose a family format to suit them is more important than the needs of children to have a mother and a father. It would endorse a deliberately motherless or fatherless family. It would mean that our community had no interest in whether children had a mother and a father. Arguments that same-sex couples, or presumably anyone else who wants to marry, should be able to change the definition of marriage to suit their own lifestyles have far-reaching consequences and are discriminatory.
Apart from gay relationships, it would also allow a number of other marriage variations. For example, it could allow legal recognition of polygamy, polyandry and polyamory. There are already at least two groups of polyamory—that is, group marriage of varying numbers—advocates in Australia. If we arbitrarily choose to allow the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, wouldn't we also have to accept these other marriages or relationship forms? Once these new forms of marriage have been accepted, the term `marriage' will have lost all meaning.
Allowing same-sex marriage would mean that marriage is defined only by the transitory demands of various groups. Governments should not be spending energy on changing marriage or de facto marriage to meet the demands of various lobby groups. They should instead be looking to strengthen marriage through better education, counselling at the time of breakdown, and taxation relief. We all lose by the erosion of the position of marriage, but the biggest losers are the people who most need our protection—our children.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-09-10,"—I rise to oppose the motion proposed by Senator Greig. At the outset I wish to say that I respect Senator Greig's right to put the motion and to hold his views genuinely and honestly. Indeed I respect the rights of Senator Brown and the members of the Labor Party who support the motion, but they must also respect my right to object most vigorously to the motion. And I do it for a number of reasons. Firstly, the government is aware of the views of the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the communication to it alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the provision of entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The government takes its human rights obligations seriously, both internationally and domestically, and the government is considering the committee's views and will be responding in due course. It needs to be made clear that the Human Rights Committee is not a court and its views are not binding. I will be saying a bit more about that shortly.
What is true and what is the government's view—and this was made clear by the Prime Minister not so long ago—is that marriage is a bedrock institution in our society. The government also believes it is the overwhelming view of the Australian people and the Australian community that marriage under Australian law means the union of a male and a female. As Senator Harradine has made clear, it has stood the test of time—thousands of years—and I do not believe that this is the time to be changing such a position. The government does not believe that homosexual partnerships can be given the same status for family law purposes as marriage or de facto relationships involving a man and a woman. There is a plethora of legislation in this country at both federal and state level which says that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. There comes a time in the nation's history, at times like this, when we need to draw a line in the sand and say that marriage is important, that it is a bedrock institution and that it is the key structure within which the family must operate. 
In that respect I wish to also make clear my outrage at views expressed yesterday by Senator Greig in the Senate chamber that there is no link between X-rated material and child sex abuse. I find this an outrageous invitation to children to call up pornographic sites on the Internet. As a senator, Senator Greig is in a position to influence young children by his comments and therefore I find his comments irresponsible in the extreme.
On 3 September 2002, the department received notice that the Human Rights Committee had adopted its views in the Young case. The committee found that Australia had violated article 26 of the ICCPR by denying Mr Young a pension on the basis of his sexual orientation. Those views have been made clear and the government is considering its position. What I would also like to say relates to my lack of confidence in relevant United Nations committees and in particular the Human Rights Committee. Many of the members of the UN Human Rights Committee are from countries with abysmal human rights records.
—Libya chairs it, doesn't it?
—Senator Abetz has made the comment that Libya chairs such a committee. Is this an appropriate committee from which our country should be taking a lead? Wherever possible, laws in this country should be made by Australians for Australians in Australia. Members of this committee are apparently independent experts appointed by their governments, but the facts speak for themselves—res ipsa loquitur. Are they qualified to make decisions on behalf of Australians? I simply make that point.
I also make the point that from 1990 to 1996, when the Howard government came to power, the federal Labor government seized on the external affairs power under the Constitution; signed, on average, 44 international treaties per year; and selectively and arbitrarily acted upon those that it saw to be to its political advantage. Let us see what the Chief Justice of the High Court said about those views at that time. The former High Court judge and former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, in an article for the Australian Lawyer in March 1995, was very direct in his views as to the consequences flowing from the federal government's use of the external affairs power. He said:
This—
the use of the external affairs power by the federal government—
has had the effect of changing quite dramatically the legislative balance of powers between the Commonwealth and states. It meant that the Commonwealth potential legislative power was as wide as the whole area of treaty making power, which was unlimited in theory and was in fact explosively expanding. 
That is exactly the point, and that is why there have been major reforms on the treaty making powers by the Howard government since its election in 1996. I congratulate both the Prime Minister and Alexander Downer for their leadership in that respect.
Finally, let me say that this is a matter of great importance to the Australian people. It is a matter of how, at the end of the day, we see marriage and family.
—Let's have a vote on it.
—I am quite happy to be voting on it, Senator Brown, and I am quite happy to say that there is a line in the sand here. I will not be crossing that line. I believe that marriage is the bedrock of our institutions and it needs to be protected in a hearty and vigorous way at every step.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-09-10,"—With just three minutes to sum up, it is very difficult—indeed, impossible—to reflect on all the contributions that were made, but I do sincerely thank senators for their contributions. It is important that we discuss this issue. Much of the discussion we have heard here today genuinely reflects where much of the Australian community is.
Having said that, let me say that this issue has absolutely nothing to do with marriage. Anybody who mentioned it is talking through their hat. The fact is that the war widows pension is paid to people whether they are married or not, whether they have kids or not. This is about relationships. In that regard, the community has moved on. In effect, we have had a national referendum on this issue because of what has been done at a state and territory level. State and territory governments, often with the support and initial encouragement of minor parties, have already brought about this reform. The people have spoken. There is no strong call from any quarter opposing this legislation.
I would also make the point that while Mr Young's claim was rejected, as Senator Santoro said, through his first applications in trying to address this, it was rejected with regret. It was rejected because of the lack of opportunity to address this issue at a domestic level. They were not trying to establish a precedent at law. They were expressing with regret the fact that he had no opportunity, no option, but to go to the United Nations. That is not acceptable.
Senator Mason said that ultimately this is a question of choice. I say this to Senator Mason: people in our community do not wake up one day and say to themselves: `I think I'll be homosexual. I think I will place myself in a position of being discriminated against in every possible way, disenfranchising myself from my friends and family, and being at greater risk of abuse, harassment and discrimination.' I echo the words of Justice Michael Kirby, who at one time said that discrimination against people on the grounds of sexual orientation is as morally reprehensible as discrimination on the grounds of race or religion.
Senator Harradine, you said in your argument that this is ultimately about what is best for our children. I agree with you. We are children. Gay and lesbian Australians are children. They are sons and daughters. They are, too, mums and dads—and brothers, uncles and aunties. They are judges, lawyers, doctors, garbologists and politicians, and they all deserve equal rights under the law. All we are asking for—all the community is asking for in a broader human rights context—is equality under the law in areas of relationship recognition. It has nothing to do with marriage and we are all children of the broader community.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-09-10,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, Senator Ferguson, I present the 8th report of 2003 relating to the proposed construction of a new Chancery Building for the Australian High Commission, Colombo, Sri Lanka. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The proposed works are intended to provide a new chancery building for Australia's permanent mission to Sri Lanka. A new two storey building, with a total floor space of 2,200 square metres, will accommodate the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and three other agencies. The building will incorporate appropriate security provisions for the high risk classification of Sri Lanka. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $11.19 million at September 2002 prices.
The existing Australian chancery complex in Colombo has been in use for over 40 years and is no longer adequate for its purpose. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade submission states that the building does not meet minimum standards in relation to security, occupational health and safety or building services and the existing floor area of 950 square metres is too small to meet current operational requirements. The present layout is dysfunctional due to ad hoc expansion and space constraints, and the building has deteriorated with age to the extent that refurbishment and repair are no longer practical or cost-effective. Finally, the building does not project an appropriate image of Australia in a country where Australia is held in high esteem.
Work elements to meet the Department's objectives consist of 
·	security arrangements to meet the requirements of Australia's overseas agencies;
·	space provisions to meet the needs of current tenants and to permit future expansion;
·	pedestrian and vehicular access including a controlled parking area; 
·	a services wing, staff recreational facilities and landscaped surrounds; 
·	installation of new engineering services; and
·	integrated building fit-out to tenants' specifications.
The proposed works are intended to address the deficiencies of the existing chancery premises in relation to space, functionality, amenity and security.
At the public hearing, the Committee questioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a number of issues. 
In response to the Committee's questions relating to security, the Department stated that the new building would incorporate the full range of physical security measures employed in all their overseas offices, and would also take cognisance of the local situation. 
In relation to acoustic requirements, the Department envisages that acoustic treatment to the mechanical plant and the diesel generator will be provided in compliance with Sri Lankan regulations. The Committee was interested to know whether Sri Lankan regulations in relation to acoustics were higher or more relevant than the Australian standards. The Department responded that Sri Lankan standards are based on British standards, which are compatible with Australian standards. 
The Committee questioned the Department on the flooding and drainage measures to address monsoon storms. The Department proposes that earthworks will be undertaken to raise the ground floor of the new Chancery by half a metre. Responding to the Committee's enquiry about the implications of the proposed elevation of the building for water run-off to surrounding areas, the Department said that it intended to grade the site and that run-off would be channelled from the site by an existing storm-water drain.  
The Committee was assured that the building design caters for the full suite of fire control measures. The Department added that the new Chancery will incorporate energy targets in line with the Australian Energy Performance Guidelines.
In response to questions on costs, the Department told the Committee that the project budget includes a considerable provision for expatriate supervision to ensure that technical requirements meet Australia design specifications. The Department explained that fees and allowances for this project include Sri Lankan Value Added Tax on escalation and contingency provisions, in addition to construction costs. 
When questioned about the potential requirements for future expansion, the Department replied that it did not anticipate any increase in current staff numbers at the Chancery, but that the building fit-out could accommodate a modest increase in number, if required. 
Having considered this evidence, the Committee recommends that the proposed construction of a new Chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Colombo, Sri Lanka proceed at the estimated cost of $11.19 million.
Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those involved in the public hearing and reporting process.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-10,"—I present the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation on draft Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations 2003 and draft Retirement Savings Accounts Amendment Regulations 2003, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report the committee handed down today is a unanimous report, although I note that Labor has made some additional comments. Importantly, the report expresses the committee's general support for the principle of portability, and the ability of superannuation fund members to consolidate their superannuation accounts. In particular, the committee supports giving individuals the ability to consolidate an inactive superannuation account into either an active account or another inactive account. Such a measure, accompanied by a targeted education campaign following the introduction of portability, would achieve a reduction in superannuation account numbers in Australia and that is indeed important. 
It is also important to note that many Australians also have access to portability of their funds. Under the governing rules of a majority of Australian superannuation funds, a member can already elect to roll over or transfer his or her crystallised benefit to another nominated superannuation fund. In that sense, the regulations would only be extending the availability of portability in Australia. However, the report also recommends that the government should revise the gazetted regulations prior to 1 July 2004, when they are due to commence, to prohibit rollovers or transfers of superannuation accounts out of active superannuation accounts—that is, accounts that are still receiving employer sponsored superannuation payments.
The committee makes this recommendation out of concern that providing portability out of an active account would be tantamount to providing choice of superannuation, which, as senators will know, has previously come before this chamber. The committee believes that extending portability to active accounts is a matter better dealt with through choice of fund legislation rather than regulations on the grounds of efficiency and consumer protection. In addition, there is concern that portability out of an active account, without a full, targeted education campaign and a strong disclosure environment, could lead to a further proliferation of superannuation accounts due to the need to maintain multiple accounts. As we understand, this is not the purpose of the measure.
I note that this issue of portability out of an active account was the principal concern raised with the committee by the industry during the conduct of our inquiry—an extensive inquiry, may I remind the Senate. The committee consulted with a broad range of individuals and organisations, including peak industry bodies, superannuation funds and fund trustees, professional financial organisations, financial service providers, peak employee and employer groups and the relevant government agencies.
The committee makes a number of other recommendations in its report for reforms which could promote the implementation of the portability regulations. In particular, the committee advocates in its report the following measures: the revision of the financial disclosure requirements under the regulations; the development of a rollover transfer protocol to help facilitate portability; the exclusion of defined benefit schemes from the provisions of the regulations where the member's current entitlement is in accumulation or partly vested form, which is important; the provision of legal protection to trustees under the regulations, which is an important point raised by the Law Council of Australia; and the commencement of an education campaign on portability and choice of superannuation when the regulations come into effect, using the $28.7 million over four years allocated by the government in the 2002-03 budget. The committee also recommends the further refinement of product disclosure statements by the regulator, ASIC, and limiting future exit fees to reasonable administrative costs and redemption costs of a rollover or transfer.
I note that the committee has made a recommendation that the gazetted regulations be amended but that the Labor and Democrat senators have threatened to disallow the regulations if their concerns are not met. Rather than take this course, I urge the opposition parties and the government to cooperate through the gazettal of further Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations 2003—I believe that would be No. 5 this year—to address the committee's concerns prior to the proposed implementation of portability on 1 July 2004. It can be done, it should be done and it needs to be done. 
There is broad agreement in this chamber that the implementation of portability regulations is a desirable reform. I believe that, through the introduction of amending regulations, the concerns of opposing parties and the desire of the government to pass portability legislation can be met. In advocating the implementation of the portability regulations, I note that during the inquiry concerns were expressed that portability and choice are intertwined and cannot be introduced separately. But, provided portability out of an active account is prohibited, I do not share this concern. The Liberal members of the committee believe that the portability regulations can stand on their own in their revised form from 1 July 2004.
This is the last report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I intend later this evening to make a statement to the Senate on the winding-up of the committee—a committee that has produced 58 reports. I will not pre-empt just now the comments I will make later about the history of the committee and the people involved over the years. However, I thank the very many participants in the committee's portability inquiry. The quality of the submissions made to the inquiry was very high and they were of considerable interest to the committee. I take this opportunity to thank the witnesses who appeared before the committee in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. I also extend my gratitude to the other members of the committee. During the conduct of the inquiry the government gazetted its final portability regulations, which differed in a number of significant areas from the draft regulations referred to the committee for inquiry and report. There is no doubt that this made the job of the committee much harder, and I thank my fellow committee members for their hard work and their commitment to achieving a unanimous report that all members could accept. I also take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat, Mr Stephen Frappell and Mrs Dianne Warhurst, for their continued support of the work of the committee and their hard work in achieving a great result.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Superannuation Select Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-10,"—The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation report which we are considering has unanimously—and I stress that—requested that the government rewrite its so-called portability regulations. The portability regulations claim to allow a fund member to transfer moneys out of both inactive and active superannuation accounts. Most fund members already have the right to transfer out of an inactive account, except where the barrier of exit fees applies. The regulations do nothing about prohibiting excessive exit fees—exit fees that are a charge over and above a reasonable administrative fee and that can act as a barrier to moving your moneys out of an inactive superannuation account. The report lists in some detail massive exit fees that can amount to thousands of dollars—effectively a barrier.
Where a transfer out of an active account occurs, under the regulations gazetted by the government members will be forced to establish an additional account because they must leave a minimum of $5,000 in their original account. The committee has unanimously concluded:
... portability out of active superannuation accounts could lead to an increase in superannuation account numbers in Australia due to the need to maintain multiple accounts.
This is a damning rejection of the inaccurate claims by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, that account numbers would be reduced. It is a damning—and, as I say, unanimous—rejection of the minister's claims and the foundation of the regulations. The critical recommendation, No. 1, is: 
... that the Government prior to 1 July 2004 revise the ... Regulations ... to prohibit roll overs/transfers out of an active superannuation account.
This is a very significant change to the regulations that have been gazetted by the government. Further:
... the Committee believes that the portability regulations, by extending portability to active accounts, raise an issue which is better dealt with through choice of funds legislation on the grounds of efficiency and consumer protection.
There are some 25 million inactive superannuation accounts in Australia—accounts of nine million fund members. As I have indicated, most Australians can transfer their superannuation out of inactive accounts, subject to exit fees. Most accounts do not have exit fees. The question remains: why don't Australians consolidate their inactive accounts? There is nothing in these regulations that would allow people with inactive accounts to consolidate them. The fact is that they can do it at present but they do not. Why don't they do it? They do not do it because generally they do not know that they can consolidate their accounts and there is extensive red tape, form filling et cetera to go through in order to do so. There is nothing in these regulations that solves the fundamental structural problem of inactive superannuation accounts in this country. It is misleading of Minister Coonan to claim that these regulations overcome this problem when they clearly do not.
The report also includes a further six detailed recommendations that require a rewrite of the regulations. They highlight the incompetence of the government in a range of technical areas. There are some additional comments from Labor senators. Those additional comments in the report call for the automatic consolidation or rollover of inactive accounts into a member's last active or inactive account. That would largely resolve the issue of the 25 million accounts we have in Australia. This would be a major simplification and would dramatically reduce the number of inactive accounts. Secondly, Labor has called for simple, standard, comparable and enforceable disclosure of all fees and charges. Labor continues to argue that, if you are to have safe portability and safe choice, you must have accurate disclosure of fees and charges. We do not have that in Australia at the present time.
But Labor would go further to ensure safe portability and choice. Labor argues that we should ban commissions on superannuation products purchased with nine per cent compulsory SG contributions. Labor senators argue that it is unconscionable to be charging commissions—often very expensive commissions—on compulsory superannuation guarantee contributions. Finally, an extensive public education campaign—and I stress it should be an education campaign, not a government propaganda campaign—would be needed to inform the public. Labor has consistently argued for safe choice and portability. If you are to have portability and choice, you need to ensure that you have the most rigorous and tough protections of consumers. We have seen quite damning evidence of excesses, exploitation and, frankly, rip-offs by some financial planners in this country—not by a majority, but certainly by a significant minority of financial planners. Labor simply does not accept that the financial services industry can be trusted with portability and choice without the sorts of safeguards that I have outlined. We are talking here about compulsory long-term savings for retirement which need the most rigorous safeguards. As a consequence of this unanimous report, which is quite damning of the minister, Senator Coonan, Labor will be moving to disallow these regulations. 
The final point I make about the regulations is that, for the first time in my experience on a Senate committee, we saw the government and the minister take a contemptuous approach to the processes of the Senate whilst the committee was conducting the first day of its hearing on the draft final regulations. They did not even inform the committee. Regrettably, I could not attend the first day of that hearing because I was in my sick bed with a bad dose of bronchitis. I received a justifiably outraged call from the chair, Senator Watson. We have never seen a minister gazette regulations while the committee is actually holding committee hearings. What made it even worse was that she did not even tell the committee. The minister did not inform the committee and did not inform the witnesses, who had turned up on the basis of the draft regulations. It is the most contemptuous performance that I have ever seen by any minister in respect of the committee processes of the Senate. Consequently, the Labor Party will be moving to disallow these regulations tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Superannuation Select Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-10,"—The Democrats are very pleased to join the debate on this unanimous report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on the portability regulations. What the regulations provide—and this has become quite clear from the evidence to this committee—is a premature de facto choice regime. These regulations should be held off until we have a choice of funds legislation agreed to by the Senate, at which stage we can proceed with an appropriate set of regulations. In the meantime, as Senator Watson has pointed out in his comments, we should ensure that we have maximum portability for inactive accounts and that we have some measures in place to encourage the consolidation of the 25.5 million superannuation accounts—that is, the 2.8 accounts for every worker in Australia.
The Democrats believe that the best way to do this—and it is also highlighted in the report of this committee—is to actually get some decent consumer education on the advantages of account consolidation, a decent industry-wide transfer protocol, and action on reducing exit and entry fees. These are all issues dealt with in the recommendations of this committee report, which I commend strongly to the government.
I share with Senator Sherry my outrage about the way this committee was treated by the minister in that the regulations were actually promulgated on the day of one of our hearings. I have no doubt that it was an attempt to influence the committee in its decision making, and it certainly did—it made us very angry. I cannot recall in my experience as a staffer and as a senator in this place another minister acting to promulgate regulations whilst the committee was inquiring into them. It makes it more difficult rather than easier for the minister because now the minister will need to issue revised regulations rather than simply revise a draft regulation. That is a process which I would now urge the minister to do. The committee has made some very sensible recommendations about what those revised regulations should entail to promote appropriate portability among inactive accounts and to encourage account consolidation without necessarily introducing a deregulated choice of funds regime.
From that point of view, the Democrats strongly recommend that the minister issue the revised regulations within a very short period of time, because that window for the minister to provide a positive response to this report is very short. Failing a positive response in literally the next few days, the Democrats will be supporting the Labor Party's disallowance regulation. It is not our preferred position, but it will certainly be the position that we will pursue if the government does not provide an appropriate response by way of revised regulations. 
I do want to note for the record that this is the last report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, after 12 years of incredibly strong work. This committee was formed as a result of a resolution moved by a Democrat, Senator Sid Spindler, back in 1991. It was moved as a result of concerns about the process of legislation by press release, which was what superannuation policy was under the Hawke and Keating governments. I think the committee has made an extraordinary contribution to superannuation policy and in opening up public scrutiny in a very important area of policy over the course of the last 12 years.
I want to pay tribute to the staff of the committee over that 12-year period, to the hundreds of people who provided incredible quality submissions to the committee over that period, to my Democrat predecessors on this committee and also to its chairs, Senator Watson and Senator Sherry, who have been fiercely independently minded and have given their governments a right royal razzle-dazzle whenever required over the course of the last 12 years. It is an example of the Senate working at its best over a long period of time. It is an example of what Senate committees can do when they do work together: look at the information, put politics aside and actually produce good policy. As a result, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has been one of the most effective committees this Senate has seen over the last 12 years. I commend this report to the Senate. I urge the government to pick it up. If they do not, they will see their regulations disallowed, and that is a matter for the minister to now consider.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Superannuation Select Committee</title>,Committees,26,1

Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Clearly Labor endorses the major conclusions of the Committee Report being tabled today.
The Report's recommendation that the draft regulations be amended to prohibit transfers of funds from active accounts is of course whole-heartedly supported by Labor.
But having said that there are some matters that need to be addressed before the regulations can be approved.
For instance the Committee took evidence from more than one witness that the portability regulations as worded in their current form amount to the introduction of a de-facto “choice” regime. On reading the regulations I have to agree with that evidence.
Portability and choice are two entirely different animals and we on this side are of the view that the portability regulations should be introduced jointly with a safe choice regime.
On the basis that portability from inactive accounts is available to the bulk of fund members it is hard to see how there is a need for the regulations without the establishment of a choice regime.
The Committee took substantive evidence, which supports Labor coming to that view and it is consistent with our stated position that we will support a safe choice regime that contains strong protections and safeguards which protect consumers.
The only other matters I wanted to comment on are education and disclosure.
If we look at the portability regulations, allowing fund members to transfer account balances at will, we find that many account holders will be left at the mercy of the financial advising industry.
If the information which has come to light from the most resent survey, the ANZ Financial Literacy Survey, that dealt with levels of consumer knowledge of financial matters, and in particular superannuation are right and at the same time the issues highlighted in the ASIC/ACA Shadow Shopping Survey which relate to the professional and ethical standards of financial planners are also correct, it is easy to understand why we are advocating protection and safeguards for consumers. 
This is why Labor is of the view that any portability regulations or choice legislation must be accompanied by a comprehensive and strong education campaign; I think Labor's Additional Comments to the Report refers to an aggressive financial literacy education campaign.
Such an education campaign should be carried out by the Government in consultation with the financial services industry. I think it is essential that care is taken with any education provided to the public that the education is balanced with the information it provides and not product marketing in the disguise of education.
There are some who argue that the advent of the new disclosure rules will put consumers in a position to make educated comparisons and decisions about financial investments particularly in relation to superannuation. I don't agree with that view. A comprehensive education program focused on financial literacy is the only way to protect consumers.
On the question of disclosure, the committee heard a lot of evidence and were given various views. At the end of the day I, with my Labor colleagues, have come to the conclusion that there is little doubt that improved disclosure, particularly of fees and charges is a major step forward, but like education, disclosure alone is not the answer. We are of the view that for disclosure to be effective it needs to be clear and in a form that makes a comparison between different products possible.
The introduction of portability and choice will open consumers up to the high-pressure selling environment of the financial services industry. The government has responsibility to protect consumers from this and the disclosure and education programs Labor is suggesting will go a long way towards providing this.
In closing could I thank my other colleagues on the Committee, Senator's Sherry, Chapman, Cherry, Lightfoot and Wong, in particular Senator Watson who chaired the Committee not only during this Inquiry but for the life of the Select Committee on Superannuation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Superannuation Select Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-10,"—The report before the Senate, as previous speakers have said, is in relation to two sets of regulations. I note that these draft regulations were referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, but unfortunately amended regulations were gazetted during or just prior to the committee's first hearing. I wish to note how unfortunate that was in terms of the committee's process and the government taking some account of the processes of the Senate. These regulations essentially deal with portability—that is, the ability of a member to roll over or transfer existing superannuation funds from one superannuation account to another. The regulations, as gazetted, had the effect of mandating rollovers even from active accounts—that is, accounts into which regular contributions were still being made. As many submissions to the committee pointed out, this could in fact lead to more rather than fewer superannuation accounts in Australia, which is certainly a situation we want to avoid.
The committee's primary concern with the regulations was that they seek to implement, effectively, a de facto choice regime in the absence of some of the protective mechanisms which we consider are required to ensure that choice does not lead to consumers being ripped off. The committee unanimously supported the proposition that portability from active accounts would be better dealt with by choice of funds legislation. The committee also commented on the need for parliamentary scrutiny of the choice legislation and other policy issues associated with that when considering the issue of active accounts. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the regulations in fact prohibit rollovers and transfers out of active accounts. I commend particularly Senator Watson and other government senators on the committee for placing good policy above politics in this committee report and for joining with Labor and Democrat senators in recommending that the regulations prohibit rollovers or transfers out of active accounts. 
The second concern that I want to focus on, which the committee raised but which has also been amplified by Labor members in our additional comments, is in the area of exit fees. Even the Treasury acknowledged that exit fees could constitute a barrier to portability. The government's line on this issue, however, is that competition and the market will sort it out. The committee did not accept this and has recommended that the regulations limit exit fees to the reasonable administrative costs and redemption costs of a rollover. This is a very important recommendation—and one that I again indicate has the unanimous support of government senators as well as Labor and minor party senators—because exit fees can constitute a barrier to portability. They can also constitute a significant detriment to consumers in Australia, particularly if they are not sufficiently financially literate to understand precisely the terms and conditions of the accounts into which they are making contributions. Labor senators do go further than the majority of the committee. Our recommendation is that exit fees ought be banned altogether and ought be replaced by an administration fee which is calculated on the basis of the reasonable costs associated with a rollover or transfer out.
But what is important is that the committee has unanimously rejected the view of the government that exit fees should simply be left to the market. The reality is that the `leave it to the market' mentality does not work where you do not have proper and comprehensive disclosure regimes which enable easy comparison between funds and when many Australian's financial literacy places them at a significant disadvantage when trying to assess the appropriateness of different superannuation products and comparisons between those products. Essentially, the Labor position, which is reflected to quite a large extent in the unanimous report, is that there should be a safe choice regime and that it should be scrutinised by the parliament. Our position is also that commission fees on SG contributions should be banned, and that is important if one is seriously trying to establish a choice regime which protects the consumer.
In closing, I note that I have only been on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for this and for one previous report. It has been a very interesting process, and I do echo Senator Cherry's comments that particularly Senator Watson and Senator Sherry, in their chairing of this committee, have certainly put good policy above politics. I think the committee has made an enormous contribution to what is a very complex and difficult area of government policy—that is, superannuation—an area which is extremely important now but which will be particularly so in the future as Australians continue to contribute to their superannuation schemes. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-10,"—I present the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation on draft Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations 2003 and draft Retirement Savings Accounts Amendment Regulations 2003, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report the committee handed down today is a unanimous report, although I note that Labor has made some additional comments. Importantly, the report expresses the committee's general support for the principle of portability, and the ability of superannuation fund members to consolidate their superannuation accounts. In particular, the committee supports giving individuals the ability to consolidate an inactive superannuation account into either an active account or another inactive account. Such a measure, accompanied by a targeted education campaign following the introduction of portability, would achieve a reduction in superannuation account numbers in Australia and that is indeed important. 
It is also important to note that many Australians also have access to portability of their funds. Under the governing rules of a majority of Australian superannuation funds, a member can already elect to roll over or transfer his or her crystallised benefit to another nominated superannuation fund. In that sense, the regulations would only be extending the availability of portability in Australia. However, the report also recommends that the government should revise the gazetted regulations prior to 1 July 2004, when they are due to commence, to prohibit rollovers or transfers of superannuation accounts out of active superannuation accounts—that is, accounts that are still receiving employer sponsored superannuation payments.
The committee makes this recommendation out of concern that providing portability out of an active account would be tantamount to providing choice of superannuation, which, as senators will know, has previously come before this chamber. The committee believes that extending portability to active accounts is a matter better dealt with through choice of fund legislation rather than regulations on the grounds of efficiency and consumer protection. In addition, there is concern that portability out of an active account, without a full, targeted education campaign and a strong disclosure environment, could lead to a further proliferation of superannuation accounts due to the need to maintain multiple accounts. As we understand, this is not the purpose of the measure.
I note that this issue of portability out of an active account was the principal concern raised with the committee by the industry during the conduct of our inquiry—an extensive inquiry, may I remind the Senate. The committee consulted with a broad range of individuals and organisations, including peak industry bodies, superannuation funds and fund trustees, professional financial organisations, financial service providers, peak employee and employer groups and the relevant government agencies.
The committee makes a number of other recommendations in its report for reforms which could promote the implementation of the portability regulations. In particular, the committee advocates in its report the following measures: the revision of the financial disclosure requirements under the regulations; the development of a rollover transfer protocol to help facilitate portability; the exclusion of defined benefit schemes from the provisions of the regulations where the member's current entitlement is in accumulation or partly vested form, which is important; the provision of legal protection to trustees under the regulations, which is an important point raised by the Law Council of Australia; and the commencement of an education campaign on portability and choice of superannuation when the regulations come into effect, using the $28.7 million over four years allocated by the government in the 2002-03 budget. The committee also recommends the further refinement of product disclosure statements by the regulator, ASIC, and limiting future exit fees to reasonable administrative costs and redemption costs of a rollover or transfer.
I note that the committee has made a recommendation that the gazetted regulations be amended but that the Labor and Democrat senators have threatened to disallow the regulations if their concerns are not met. Rather than take this course, I urge the opposition parties and the government to cooperate through the gazettal of further Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations 2003—I believe that would be No. 5 this year—to address the committee's concerns prior to the proposed implementation of portability on 1 July 2004. It can be done, it should be done and it needs to be done. 
There is broad agreement in this chamber that the implementation of portability regulations is a desirable reform. I believe that, through the introduction of amending regulations, the concerns of opposing parties and the desire of the government to pass portability legislation can be met. In advocating the implementation of the portability regulations, I note that during the inquiry concerns were expressed that portability and choice are intertwined and cannot be introduced separately. But, provided portability out of an active account is prohibited, I do not share this concern. The Liberal members of the committee believe that the portability regulations can stand on their own in their revised form from 1 July 2004.
This is the last report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I intend later this evening to make a statement to the Senate on the winding-up of the committee—a committee that has produced 58 reports. I will not pre-empt just now the comments I will make later about the history of the committee and the people involved over the years. However, I thank the very many participants in the committee's portability inquiry. The quality of the submissions made to the inquiry was very high and they were of considerable interest to the committee. I take this opportunity to thank the witnesses who appeared before the committee in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. I also extend my gratitude to the other members of the committee. During the conduct of the inquiry the government gazetted its final portability regulations, which differed in a number of significant areas from the draft regulations referred to the committee for inquiry and report. There is no doubt that this made the job of the committee much harder, and I thank my fellow committee members for their hard work and their commitment to achieving a unanimous report that all members could accept. I also take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat, Mr Stephen Frappell and Mrs Dianne Warhurst, for their continued support of the work of the committee and their hard work in achieving a great result.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2

The Committee took substantive evidence, which supports Labor coming to that view and it is consistent with our stated position that we will support a safe choice regime that contains strong protections and safeguards which protect consumers.
The only other matters I wanted to comment on are education and disclosure.
If we look at the portability regulations, allowing fund members to transfer account balances at will, we find that many account holders will be left at the mercy of the financial advising industry.
If the information which has come to light from the most resent survey, the ANZ Financial Literacy Survey, that dealt with levels of consumer knowledge of financial matters, and in particular superannuation are right and at the same time the issues highlighted in the ASIC/ACA Shadow Shopping Survey which relate to the professional and ethical standards of financial planners are also correct, it is easy to understand why we are advocating protection and safeguards for consumers. 
This is why Labor is of the view that any portability regulations or choice legislation must be accompanied by a comprehensive and strong education campaign; I think Labor's Additional Comments to the Report refers to an aggressive financial literacy education campaign.
Such an education campaign should be carried out by the Government in consultation with the financial services industry. I think it is essential that care is taken with any education provided to the public that the education is balanced with the information it provides and not product marketing in the disguise of education.
There are some who argue that the advent of the new disclosure rules will put consumers in a position to make educated comparisons and decisions about financial investments particularly in relation to superannuation. I don't agree with that view. A comprehensive education program focused on financial literacy is the only way to protect consumers.
On the question of disclosure, the committee heard a lot of evidence and were given various views. At the end of the day I, with my Labor colleagues, have come to the conclusion that there is little doubt that improved disclosure, particularly of fees and charges is a major step forward, but like education, disclosure alone is not the answer. We are of the view that for disclosure to be effective it needs to be clear and in a form that makes a comparison between different products possible.
The introduction of portability and choice will open consumers up to the high-pressure selling environment of the financial services industry. The government has responsibility to protect consumers from this and the disclosure and education programs Labor is suggesting will go a long way towards providing this.
In closing could I thank my other colleagues on the Committee, Senator's Sherry, Chapman, Cherry, Lightfoot and Wong, in particular Senator Watson who chaired the Committee not only during this Inquiry but for the life of the Select Committee on Superannuation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-10,"—The report before the Senate, as previous speakers have said, is in relation to two sets of regulations. I note that these draft regulations were referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, but unfortunately amended regulations were gazetted during or just prior to the committee's first hearing. I wish to note how unfortunate that was in terms of the committee's process and the government taking some account of the processes of the Senate. These regulations essentially deal with portability—that is, the ability of a member to roll over or transfer existing superannuation funds from one superannuation account to another. The regulations, as gazetted, had the effect of mandating rollovers even from active accounts—that is, accounts into which regular contributions were still being made. As many submissions to the committee pointed out, this could in fact lead to more rather than fewer superannuation accounts in Australia, which is certainly a situation we want to avoid.
The committee's primary concern with the regulations was that they seek to implement, effectively, a de facto choice regime in the absence of some of the protective mechanisms which we consider are required to ensure that choice does not lead to consumers being ripped off. The committee unanimously supported the proposition that portability from active accounts would be better dealt with by choice of funds legislation. The committee also commented on the need for parliamentary scrutiny of the choice legislation and other policy issues associated with that when considering the issue of active accounts. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the regulations in fact prohibit rollovers and transfers out of active accounts. I commend particularly Senator Watson and other government senators on the committee for placing good policy above politics in this committee report and for joining with Labor and Democrat senators in recommending that the regulations prohibit rollovers or transfers out of active accounts. 
The second concern that I want to focus on, which the committee raised but which has also been amplified by Labor members in our additional comments, is in the area of exit fees. Even the Treasury acknowledged that exit fees could constitute a barrier to portability. The government's line on this issue, however, is that competition and the market will sort it out. The committee did not accept this and has recommended that the regulations limit exit fees to the reasonable administrative costs and redemption costs of a rollover. This is a very important recommendation—and one that I again indicate has the unanimous support of government senators as well as Labor and minor party senators—because exit fees can constitute a barrier to portability. They can also constitute a significant detriment to consumers in Australia, particularly if they are not sufficiently financially literate to understand precisely the terms and conditions of the accounts into which they are making contributions. Labor senators do go further than the majority of the committee. Our recommendation is that exit fees ought be banned altogether and ought be replaced by an administration fee which is calculated on the basis of the reasonable costs associated with a rollover or transfer out.
But what is important is that the committee has unanimously rejected the view of the government that exit fees should simply be left to the market. The reality is that the `leave it to the market' mentality does not work where you do not have proper and comprehensive disclosure regimes which enable easy comparison between funds and when many Australian's financial literacy places them at a significant disadvantage when trying to assess the appropriateness of different superannuation products and comparisons between those products. Essentially, the Labor position, which is reflected to quite a large extent in the unanimous report, is that there should be a safe choice regime and that it should be scrutinised by the parliament. Our position is also that commission fees on SG contributions should be banned, and that is important if one is seriously trying to establish a choice regime which protects the consumer.
In closing, I note that I have only been on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for this and for one previous report. It has been a very interesting process, and I do echo Senator Cherry's comments that particularly Senator Watson and Senator Sherry, in their chairing of this committee, have certainly put good policy above politics. I think the committee has made an enormous contribution to what is a very complex and difficult area of government policy—that is, superannuation—an area which is extremely important now but which will be particularly so in the future as Australians continue to contribute to their superannuation schemes. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-09-10,"—On behalf of the chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee. 
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2003</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation        Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-09-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise to make some comments in relation to the report on the provision of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 presented today by the Economics Legislation Committee. As a cosignatory to the minority report, I rise to point out that there is a significant area of difference among members of the committee. That area of difference relates to schedule 3 of the bill. Schedule 3 refers to gifts and covenants. The minority report recommends that the Senate delete that part of schedule 3 that provides for the naming of deductible gift recipients, or DGRs, by regulation. 
The background to this recommendation goes to the government's decision to codify some 400 years of common law on the definition of a charity. As we all know, there have been numerous public debates and comments about the manner in which the government proposes to treat charities. Many charities have expressed a concern that this government, or any future government, could use legislative change to restrict or deny charities the right to participate in public debate. Put simply, there is a concern that this is a codification of common law to muzzle charities. One has to ask the question: why does the government need to codify 400 years of common law? Until 2003 there had been a collective understanding of what a charity was, and now we have to codify it—or at least that is the view of the government.
The reason that there is a minority report from the Economics Legislation Committee is that schedule 3 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) deals with a related matter. At the present time there are two processes by which an organisation receives DGR status. The first method is for the organisation to fall under one of the general categories set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The organisation applies to the Commissioner of Taxation, who assesses the application. If the application is successful then the organisation is endorsed as a deductible gift recipient. The committee was told during its hearings that there are currently some 18,000 organisations that have been endorsed by the commissioner. 
The other method by which an organisation can receive DGR status is for it to be included by name in the legislation. We were told that there are currently some 100 organisations specifically named in the legislation. This meant that the legislation was amended on each occasion that an organisation or organisations applied to government to be included. The government is now proposing to do this by regulation rather than by amendment of the legislation. The stated reason for this is that the government believes that this process will be more effective and efficient. As outlined at the committee's public hearings, the current process is that an organisation writes to the government requesting inclusion in the legislation. The government considers the application, generally seeks the views of the Commissioner of Taxation and then seeks to amend the legislation. From what we were led to believe, the new process would essentially be the same except that the government would now make a new regulation rather than seek to amend the legislation.
Of course in all this the government maintains that it will behave in an unchanged manner. Currently there can be conditions attached to an organisation being named in the act—typically those that relate to time durations. The concern about this change is that the government could, through the regulation process, place more stringent requirements on an organisation seeking status as a deductible gift recipient. The difference from the current situation would be that, in order to reject the conditions placed on the organisation, the Senate would have to disallow the entire regulation. Currently the government can attempt to put stringent conditions on an organisation seeking that status and the Senate can simply amend that condition. But if we go down the path proposed by the government in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) then the Senate would give up the ability to scrutinise, review and amend any new conditions. The only option left open to the Senate would be to reject the entire regulation, and therefore the organisation—or any other organisations listed in that regulation—would be denied access to deductible gift recipient status. 
Of course the government would have us believe that it would never, ever do this. We are told that this government welcomes open and frank discussion and disagreement with its policies and programs. Any and all organisations can say what they like about the government and this government would never, ever do anything about it. Never, ever would this government, or any future government, go down that path. Never, ever would this government seek to limit the rights of an organisation to speak out on any issue. No processes would seek to limit or restrict research or advocacy projects. In my view, if you believe that you will believe almost anything.
It is too easy to say that regulation amendment to legislation is just about effectiveness and efficiency. Has the government actually demonstrated that the current process is inefficient or ineffective? The Senate has demonstrated time and time again that non-controversial legislation is dealt with efficiently and effectively. The Senate has also demonstrated that when any government attempts to impose stringent and unreasonable regulation or legislation that attempt will be subject to rigorous review. We must think carefully when we decide on this legislation when it comes before the Senate.
The minority report is about ensuring that those parts of this bill that are about diluting the power of the Senate are not agreed to. Currently the safeguards are there. No government could pretend that it would be in a position to put unreasonable conditions on an organisation seeking DGR. The Senate could, and would, amend those conditions. Schedule 3 removes that safeguard. Let us not fall prey to the efficiency and effectiveness arguments. Let us collectively work to ensure that the legislative safeguards that currently exist are maintained. Let us not hand more power to the executive. I commend the minority report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2003</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation        Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-09-10,"—I rise this evening to provide some comments on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 before the Senate. This bill provides for a new three-year agreement commencing on 1 January 2004. It does that by simply amending the reference to the years of the agreement within the bill, replacing the year specified in the current agreement with one that is anticipated to be between 2004 and 2006. It also seeks to increase the number of members on the ANTA board from seven to nine. I listened this morning to contributions by senators in this place regarding this bill and I concur with Senator Webber's judgment that the number of members on the board can in no way be a signpost for the quality or breadth of decisions made. 
An additional two members on the ANTA board, especially judging by where those members come from—the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia—are really only going to be there to advance this government's agenda, which is to promote user choice and privatise the education market. I believe the ANTA board is well serviced by its current composition of membership. It has lasted under those arrangements for many years. I for one do not believe that there is a need to increase the membership in this way. Be that as it may, that is the proposal in this bill. As always, this government seeks to tie it to another aspect. The flipside seems okay, but the reverse side is perhaps something you should question. Of course, the flipside of this is the requirement to appropriate this agreement so that the funds can flow for vocational education and training in the coming years.
I want to also make some comments about the fact that there is a major change in this legislation: the ANTA agreement, once it is signed off by the Commonwealth, states and territories, will no longer be a schedule to this act. In fact, the agreement will only be tabled in the parliament. I am pleased to be able to speak this evening after I tabled the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report and the Alert Digest this afternoon, because in this very week the Scrutiny of Bills Committee received a letter from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Mr Brendan Nelson, regarding some concerns that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had in relation to this. We believed that removing the agreement from the act as a schedule and simply making it subject to being tabled in each house of the parliament—which is what is outlined in the explanatory memorandum—indicated insufficient parliamentary scrutiny. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, of course, is most concerned about that.
The past, and we believe the best, practice has been to incorporate each new agreement in the principal act by way of amending the bill, enabling consideration and debate by the chamber. I will read an extract from the response from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, which is contained in the report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that I tabled this afternoon. The minister says:
I am advised that this is the case—
that is, the fact that the ANTA agreement is not legislative in nature—
because the ANTA Agreement does not determine the content of the law. Instead, it represents an exercise of the power that the Australian Government is granted undersection 61 of the Constitution, amongst other things, to enter into agreements or arrangements with the States and Territories on matters of the kind dealt with in the Agreement.
He goes on to say:
The ANTA Agreement has not been included in Schedule 1 of the Principal Act because it involves an exercise of legislative power, but rather because it has been common to include copies of intergovernmental agreements in schedules to Acts.
I believe that it is unfortunate that the government has sought to move this way, and I note that the two second reading amendments that have been put up by Senator Allison and Senator Nettle go to this very fact—that the agreement should be brought before each house of parliament and that it should be made available on the web site as soon as possible. There are assurances in the minister's letter that this will be the case, but one would hope that these second reading amendments, should they be successful, will ensure that that will be the case. 
The agreement is not ready to be a schedule to the act, nor is it ready to be tabled in this parliament. This bill has been brought on early. That agreement is yet to be finalised and fully negotiated by the states and territories with the Commonwealth. So that agreement is still under negotiation, which is why it is not before this parliament now and why it is not going to be a schedule to the act.
Tomorrow in the Senate we will also be considering the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003. In some ways that complements this bill because the two are linked—the money is appropriated through the ANTA agreement and ANTA provides the national directions and the way in which funding for VET and TAFE is spent in this country. One bill provides the funding, even though it is limited and inadequate, and the other provides the mechanisms by which that funding is allocated. There are many ways that routine bills which update principal acts and provide urgently needed funding are dealt with in this parliament. However, the urgently needed funding proposed in this bill is grossly inadequate to meet the increased demands being put on this part of our sector which is a key aspect of our national education and training system.
I will just turn to the provisions of the Vocational Education and Training Bill, which we will be considering tomorrow, but which, I think, is crucially linked to this bill. It is integral to addressing the needs and skills of this country, as is the VET sector inside the education portfolio. A colleague of mine Lindsay Tanner in an article in the Herald Sun on 2 September said:
... to raise our national skills capacity to match our labour force with needs of a modern economy ... Australia must substantially raise its commitment to VET.
He is right, but this bill fails substantially and abysmally to do that.
The MCEETYA task force review of growth of VET reported that vocational education and training is now 95 per cent of secondary schools nationwide. In 2002 over 185,000 students were on courses that led to certificates I, II or III. It is becoming a major component of our schooling for many senior students. There is at last a meaningful alternative for students who are not looking at going on to ever more expensive university studies but who want a more affordable, accessible and practical base for training on which to base their future. Many of these students in senior secondary colleges seek to go on to undertake TAFE courses and continue their study and their training under a vocational education training pathway.
This government seems to have its eyes closed to facts such as these, with funding being grossly inadequate to cope with this expansion. In South Australia, for example, it is calculated that the VET funding per student hour has fallen from $6.57 in 1997 to a mere 70c in 2001. The minister, in handing down this package as part of the budget this year, claimed that the package of dollars allocated for vocational education and training would give an additional commitment of $218.7 million to the states and territories through the ANTA agreement. Here we have another exercise in deception from this government and a gross misuse of figures. 
We know that the budgets of 1996 and 1997 when this government came into power not only reneged on the commitment to growth but also imposed a cumulative reduction of $240 million in Commonwealth funding for VET. In this 2004-06 agreement that is being proposed, the government has not provided one extra cent for additional growth funding despite the fact that it might want us to believe otherwise. It has offered to maintain 2003 growth funds of $100 million over three years and to only index that figure. This merely covers increased costs and does not deliver an additional single cent for any new places. The other $119 million is part of the welfare reform that was already announced in past budgets. Therefore, you get your total figure of $218.7 million. 
These so-called additional or new or growth funds were already provided in last year's budget figures, and funds have simply been rolled over, rebadged, renamed—call it whatever you like. But do not be misled by this government again. There is no new funding of $218.7 million beyond a little for indexation. There is nothing for expansion, no money for growth, no money for new places, no money to address the thousands that currently are unable to get into the TAFE system.
The report from the Dusseldorp Skills Forum entitled How young people are faring shows a dismal picture of employment and training for young Australians. The report showed that in May 2003 some 23 per cent of young adults were not in any form of education, employment or training. The figure for Indigenous young Australians is far worse, with 70 per cent not in any form of education, employment or training.
We also see accounts of where changes to the higher education fee structure have pushed many more young people out of the university sector into the TAFE system. This is particularly so if you look at Indigenous students. An ABC news item of 10 July told us that the South Queensland Institute of TAFE Indigenous enrolments have tripled in the past two years and the Courier Mail on 21 May 2003 ran an article that showed that the Institute of TAFE in Cairns had an Indigenous enrolment rise of around 30 per cent between 2000 and 2003. We know that is at a time when Indigenous enrolments in higher education have been dropping. We also have accounts of serious skill shortages in some areas. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into skill shortages and we have heard of shortages of metal fitters, machinists, chefs and pastry cooks, and even shortages in industries such as hairdressing, for example. 
So clearly there are young people out there whom we have the potential to recruit into these areas where there is a considerable and demonstrated need to increase the number of skilled workers. Training will be and is a large, growing and vital part of our education system that needs to be acknowledged and funded as such. It should be seen as an investment in the nation's future and not, as this government sees it, yet another cost to be borne by states—or, heaven forbid, students, if HECS type fees are ever introduced for TAFE.
Let me speak for a while on vocational education and training and TAFE in the Northern Territory. We know that the Northern Territory is vast and that there are many students in remote areas—and the potential for many more, let me add. I spoke last October on this topic when last year's VET bill went through the Senate. The Dusseldorp Skills Forum had reported back then that the Northern Territory had double the national average of teenagers not in full-time education, training or employment. The Northern Territory figure was 32 per cent. The report said:
The situation in the Northern Territory, with close to a third of its teenage population in `at risk' activities, should be a cause for national concern. 
This is still true, of course, but the allocation to VET areas by this government in the budget figures show once again that there is nothing being done to address the needs of such young people. If this government were concerned about the number of young people at risk and the number of young people who are potential students for the VET sector—which, of course, can be linked to unemployment rates—then you would think that there would be extra dollars in the training bucket to address this crisis. You would think that there would be money to look at the needs of young people, particularly in rural and remote Australia and places like the Northern Territory, to ensure that there is adequate funding so that this teenage population that is at risk would no longer be so.
TAFE Directors Australia continues to emphasise how critical the TAFE sector could and should be in this country. Even the Reverend Tim Costello, speaking at the recent AUSTAFE conference, said:
TAFE had a fundamental role and responsibility in helping to reconstruct people's lives in useful ways.
The current Senate inquiry into current and future skills needs took evidence in Darwin. The Northern Territory government pointed out that the problems in the Northern Territory were such that they had to make a significant contribution to support language and literacy courses for disadvantaged clients. The submission from the Tiwi Islands Training and Employment Board emphasised a whole range of problems that they encounter in providing training and employment to Indigenous clients—not just in providing language and literacy courses but also in ensuring that their Indigenous clients have confidence and vocational skills. They also need to address social problems and health problems and ensure that training does more than provide for the actual skills of the job for which people, particularly Indigenous people, are being employed.
This is a system that is funded by inputs—that is, ASCH, annual student contact hours. It is not a system that is concerned about or regards outcomes as an indicator of success. Many RTOs, registered training organisations, turn up in a community at the start of a semester selling the same product—and, I might add, by and large in the Northern Territory, it is the cheap end of the market. They, of course, target those closest to the main centres and hence the least expensive to travel to. This is clearly not an efficient use of funds overall, and the more remote areas by and large are left out because it is too expensive to go there and train.
Nationally there is an unmet demand for vocational training places through TAFE of 40,000 per annum. Given all these factors, VET and ANTA have a major role to play. A key recommendation of TAFE Directors was to significantly increase the national investment in TAFE to fund the unmet demand of 40,000 places. Unfortunately, the best this government is going to manage is to fiddle at the edge of the main stage or to try to play the magician and make negligible funding appear magnified in some looking glass. It has done that year after year.
It has proven form in these skills, though. The past minister presided over the most notorious growth-through-efficiencies regime that this sector has ever had to encounter. The government still has this mentality, despite the only results being larger class sizes, increasing reliance on part-time and casual TAFE staff and worsening employment conditions. The Howard government has a proven track record in cutting expenditure—$5 billion from universities and now, of course, around $240 million from this sector. It then tries to use the old smoke-and-mirrors trick in the hope that people will be deceived into thinking education and training are going fine, that the government supports it and that it is well funded. But that is not the case; it is very far from the case. 
Labor, by contrast, has made a real commitment to vocational education and training. Recently we announced the creation of 20,000 additional fully funded places in TAFE. Furthermore, we believe in TAFE, not as second only to university but as an essential and integral part of not only an overall education and training system but also the economic development of the nation. The TAFE system is preferred by many young Australians. Labor will support TAFE to build on its tradition of being a high-quality vocational education system.
Thousands of young Australians will leave school early and remain unskilled. There will still be a bleak future for the thousands of young Australians who cannot get a place in TAFE under this government. This budget is another example of this government's neglect of the VET system and of TAFE and of education in general. This is a repeat performance. This government is a habitual offender and it has seriously neglected education since it came to office in 1996.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-10,"—In concluding this debate on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 I thank those who have contributed, although I have to say the last contributor trotted out the same old Labor Party line, not policies; she criticised the government—
—Do you want this bill tonight, or not?
—and did it in a way that is not terribly honest. But we are very proud of our record—
—What you know about education you could write on the back of a postage stamp.
—About as much as you do, Senator. Again, what passes for policy in this place seems to be someone like Senator Carr yelling out, `Do you want this bill tonight, or not?' It is okay for the Labor Party to attack the government apparently, but when they get a bit of their own back they never like it. That is typical of the approach of Senator Carr to most issues.
The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Australian National Training Authority Act to provide a new Australian National Training Authority agreement and to increase the number of members on the authority board to nine. The Commonwealth is working collaboratively with the states and territories on developing a very new and forward-looking agreement for the period 2004 to 2006. When the new agreement is signed by all state and territory training ministers and the Commonwealth, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, my colleague the Hon. Brendan Nelson, will be pleased to make the agreement public by tabling it in the House and copying it to all members and senators. The bill will ensure that continuity is maintained in the national vocational education and training system after the current agreement expires. The bill underpins ongoing funding and development of a world-class vocational education and training sector that supports the competitiveness of our industries and Australia's economic and social development.
It is interesting to note that around 1.7 million Australians participated in VET in 2002. That is more than one-ninth of Australia's working age population. More than one in four young people participate in vocational education and training. New Apprenticeships—this is an interesting figure for Senator Crossin—have grown to over 396,000 in training as at 30 June this year, which is a huge increase on the number of 140,000 in 1995, the last year of the discredited Labor regime. I heard Senator Crossin also criticising the government in relation to funding. That criticism is, again, fundamentally flawed. Over the next four years the government will spend over $8.4 billion on vocational education and training. 
—No new money there.
—The opposition has claimed that there is no new funding for the ANTA agreement. I want to point out to them again that some facts are always of assistance in these debates. The funds offered by the Howard government to the states and territories, and that includes funding of around $3.6 billion over the life of the new agreement and with indexation, compared with the 2003 funding, provide an additional $220 million. Growth funding will be indexed, as I mentioned. The total increase in funding over three years is 12.5 per cent compared with total funding in the 2001 to 2003 agreement.
The bill provides for an increase in the number of members of the board from seven to nine. This board provides advice to ANTA through the ANTA ministerial council, which is made up of all the state and territory training ministers. It provides that advice in all of its functions under the act. As the governing body for ANTA, the board oversees ANTA's operations and is ultimately responsible for ANTA's performance. The role and functions of the ANTA board are prescribed in the ANTA agreement for 2001 to 2003.
The bill also removes the ANTA agreement from schedule 1 of the Australian National Training Authority Act. This is consistent with similar intergovernmental agreements no longer being included as schedules to acts. The ANTA Act provides ANTA with the authority to provide funds to state and territory governments in accordance with the applicable ANTA agreement. Without an amendment to the ANTA Act to alter the current definition of `agreement' to refer to the next agreement, ANTA would have no authority to make payments to the states and territories under the new agreement unless that agreement was expressed as an amendment to the 2001 to 2003 ANTA agreement. The next agreement will be a wholly new agreement based on new priorities. It will not be an amendment to the current agreement which provides arrangements for 2001 to 2003 only. It is not possible to amend the definition of `agreement' in the ANTA Act to refer to the 2004 to 2006 agreement as that agreement has yet to be concluded.
Senator Crossin raised concerns that the removal of the agreement from the schedule will deny the opposition the opportunity to scrutinise the ANTA agreement. That is quite clearly false as Dr Nelson has undertaken to table the agreement when it is concluded. Nevertheless, I understand that the Australian Democrats have proposed an amendment requiring the minister to table the document within 15 sitting days of the agreement's conclusion. We will of course agree to that amendment. I understand that the Australian Greens have also proposed an amendment that the agreement, when concluded, be placed on the ANTA web site within the same period. Again, the government has no objection to that amendment.
The publicly funded vocational education and training sector consists of over 4,000 training providers offering nationally recognised training to over 1.7 million Australians each year. I should perhaps digress to congratulate all those training providers on the very good work they do for young people and, indeed, not so young people involved in vocational education and training. The sector provides a great service that leads to better outcomes for individual employers and communities across the states and territories. This bill will provide for the ongoing development and continuing successful operation of Australia's world-class vocational education and training system. I commend it to the Senate.

That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like to make some comments on the quarterly report of the chief executive officer of ARPANSA. As senators may be aware, ARPANSA not only plays a critical role in the regulation of nuclear facilities and radioactive materials in Australia; it is also expected to report on a quarterly basis to the minister and thus to the parliament. There are a number of features of this report that take into account ARPANSA's role. It deals with radiation facilities operated by the Department of Defence, Telstra, CSIRO, the Australian Federal Police, the ANU and the Australian Customs Service as well as the issue of radioactive waste storage and disposal by the Commonwealth.
The issue I want to touch on tonight—HIFAR reactor operations—is a key issue in relation to ANSTO and is contained on page 9 of this quarterly report. One of the responsibilities of ARPANSA is to regulate the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. As senators would be aware, the Australian Democrats have long campaigned against the establishment of a new reactor. I might add that it is the single highest piece of science expenditure in the history of this nation, and it has occurred in spite of a lack of accountability, transparency and consultation, both with the local community and more broadly. It has occurred in spite of public health concerns, security issues and environmental concerns that relate to the issue of radioactive materials, both the storage of them and their waste disposal.
In light of that, it is important to highlight some of the recent issues and episodes that relate to the HIFAR reactor, particularly the new one. On 4 April last year, ARPANSA issued a licence to ANSTO to construct the replacement reactor—the new reactor, as we call it. More recently, they found that there was a geological fault through the Lucas Heights site. ARPANSA subsequently found that the fault was, as they claimed, not capable of causing surface displacement or impact on the seismic design basis for the replacement reactor.
There is also an issue in relation to licence conditions. In January of this year, as senators may be aware, a whistleblower notified ARPANSA of several alleged breaches of the licence conditions concerning the construction of that reactor. The main issue associated with the breaches concerned the reactor pool tank. ANSTO, as principal contractor in that, instructed its subcontractor to carry out works in relation to the reactor pool tank that were actually prohibited under that licence. Later this year, ARPANSA found that INVAP had breached the conditions of the facility licence and, in doing so, had actually contravened the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Regulations 1999. ANSTO was not found to have breached the conditions of the facility licence, however, because it notified ARPANSA of the breach. 
Despite the seriousness of the issues involved in the breach, ARPANSA did not impose any sanctions on INVAP. This apparently was justified on the grounds that it was the first time that INVAP had contravened a condition of licence. On many occasions in this place I have raised on behalf of the Democrats concerns that we have had with the INVAP record in relation to the construction of nuclear facilities and, indeed, the sale of nuclear materials and equipment to regimes, including regimes that have links with terrorist organisations.
The Australian Democrats do not support engagement in the nuclear fuel cycle. We think that we as a nation should be doing everything to curtail the expansion of the nuclear fuel cycle. Certainly, building a new reactor is not helping that.
—What about the medical benefits, the lives saved?
—Concerns have also been raised about ARPANSA's capacity to oversee the construction of the replacement reactor. Some organisations allege that ARPANSA does not have the technical staff or the experience to regulate a project of this nature. I will acknowledge Senator Tierney's interjection, because I think most people involved in this debate acknowledge that, where radioactive materials are produced, they have to be disposed of, dealt with and stored in a safe manner. We have a problem not only with the construction of a new facility to create more waste but with the ineffective way the government has gone about looking at these contracts—and, indeed, the plans and the construction originally—to ensure that the waste was safely disposed of. Instead, we are going to truck it out to South Australia, to my home state, in the north when we all know that one of the most dangerous periods when it comes to the storage of radioactive materials is their transportation. If you produce it, you have to look after it.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Radiation Protection and    Nuclear Safety Agency</title>,Documents,30,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-09-10,"—I rise to speak on the report of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. I had the honour of opening an international conference on nuclear medicine a few months ago. Senator Stott Despoja should really update her knowledge of what is actually happening and the huge benefits that this new reactor will bring to Australia. She talks about some of the possible downsides. With proper regulatory safeguards, these things can be handled. What she totally missed in her contribution was the upside of nuclear medicine in Australia.
One of the things that I would like to inform the Senate of is the fact that the new reactor at Lucas Heights and the adjacent research facility will be able to do far more than the previous reactor. What we have there at the moment is a reactor built in 1958. It is for the production of radioisotopes which are used in nuclear medicine for healing. They have produced a great service to Australian medicine over more than 50 years. The new reactor, in terms of the scale of what it can produce and the new medical technology that it can produce, will enhance nuclear medicine in this country in an incredible way and produce products for medicine that are exportable and that will create a major export market for Australia.
It is said that all of us at some point in our life are likely to be beneficiaries from some procedure that involves nuclear medicine. As time goes on and as the technology improves, the benefits in health to Australian society are absolutely massive. 
I would just like to say this to the Senate and to the public. We have to keep this debate in perspective. It is claimed that there are downsides to this. We are not talking about a new thing; we have had this technology for over 50 years. What we are going to do is actually roll over to a new level of technology that is very safe, that has the capacity to produce massive improvements and enhance the health of the Australian public. I would like to bring that to the attention of the Senate to bring some balance into this debate.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-09-10,"—I bring to the attention of the Senate a number of vital issues in relation to the education and training sector. I recently addressed the annual Australian Council for Private Education and Training conference in Sydney. The ACPET conference discussed ways to grow better and more sustainable education. In my presentation, I outlined three important issues, two of which I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate. The first is the system of user choice within vocational education and training and the second is the maintenance and improvement of quality in the training system.
It was these two issues, when I entered the Senate chamber earlier tonight, that Senator Carr was raising in his contribution to the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003. I would like to take him to task on a number of the things that he was saying. These two issues that I want to deal with tonight—user choice and quality—are at the very heart of an effectively reformed vocational education system. Since the Howard government was elected, we have made enormous progress in this area. There is much more user choice in the system and there is much higher quality.
Over the last six years Senator Carr has constantly been bringing up little anecdotes about where this massive system might be having a problem and then trying to extrapolate that across the whole system in order to claim that the whole system has a problem. When our Senate committee inquired into this, and particularly into user choice and the registered training organisations, we found in a number of states that there were problems but it came down to about one or two per cent of the providers. For any organisation, that is a terrific outcome. So it was very disappointing tonight to hear, six years later, Senator Carr still on this hobbyhorse, still trying to trash the system.  
Senator Carr does that because he is an old reconstructed socialist and he would really like to see a system that was totally public. He does not like private providers and he does not like user choice, so he rails against this because it does not fit his ideological model of what should happen in vocational education and training. But we have an opportunity now—now that we have freed up the system, now that we have a much more flexible system and a system that is far more responsive to the market and to what people want—to build a really first-class system. Great progress is being made and this is happening also in the international sphere. Australia has a high reputation and has the opportunity for great educational exports in this area of vocational education, as we have indeed done in the university sector. It does not help if a senior senator in the opposition keeps trashing the system that is doing so well.
Tonight I would like to discuss where the system is doing so well and to update the Senate on where the changes in vocational education and training are up to at this time. We are currently renegotiating a new Australian National Training Authority agreement. Under our Constitution, vocational education is primarily the responsibility of the states, but over the last 10 years the federal government has injected new growth money, usually at the rate of $1 billion a year. In this new agreement, the money goes up again. The Australian government is, over the next three years, putting another $3.6 million into the system. We are asking the states to match the increase. When this money is in place, there will be an additional $890 million of funding injected into the national training system. We are putting more money in and we are encouraging the states to put more money in.
It is therefore disappointing that we see the states in a number of ways pulling money out and making it more difficult. In a number of the state budgets there have been cuts to vocational education and training funding, and at the state level vocational education is now more expensive for employers and students. There has been a significant hike in fees in a number of jurisdictions. As usual, the main guilty party in the states in all of this is Bob Carr, Premier of New South Wales, who has jacked up some of his fees in his TAFE colleges by 100 per cent. This is the man who would be the new leader of the opposition down here. By the way, there was a poll today and people were asked which state premier they would like to come down to become the new leader of the opposition to replace Simon Crean. There is a race on between the state premiers. These state premiers will have to perform a little better than they are doing at the moment, particularly in the area of vocational education and training.
We will be requiring the states to do a number of things under this new priority agreement. They will have to support our national priorities, they will have to support regional development and they will have to support programs for successful transitions to work for young people and practical reconciliation for Indigenous Australians. These will be conditions of the new agreement when the additional funding is going in. We have placed the highest importance on national consistency and on improving the quality of training. Under the next agreement, the states and territories will be required to strengthen their commitment to user choice. The introduction of user choice whereby employers and apprentices are able to identify and engage with training providers of their choice and receive public funding for that training has been led by the Australian government and has been a significant success, despite what Senator Carr has said tonight, since it began in January 1998. 
Over recent years there have been growing difficulties in the implementation of user choice. In some jurisdictions, restrictions have been imposed on user choice, such as restricting which training organisations may provide user choice training or which kinds of students may attract user choice funds. This is having the effect of limiting choice within the system and taking away from some of the terrific progress we have made in recent years in this area.
It is very unfortunate that at the last ministerial council meeting of all state and territory training ministers held in Darwin in June, state and territory ministers did not agree to the set of recommendations that would have improved user choice for employers and providers. The recommendations would have required greater transparency about state funding arrangements. The recommendations would also have required the states to target user choice funding, to agree to national priorities to improve e-business processes and to establish a new funding basis for setting prices for qualifications under user choice.
Dr Nelson will be pushing for these recommendations to be accepted at the MINCO meeting in November this year. The Australian government will be pursuing reforms to user choice through these current Australian National Training Authority agreement negotiations. The government believes it is important that every effort be made to fully implement user choice policies in a way that meets not only the needs of industry but also the increasing expectations of flexibility in VET by students.
Turning briefly to my second issue, the other key priority area in relation to these negotiations is quality. We have the Australian Quality Training Framework for vocational education and training. This is to improve national quality assurance and ensure that students and the community at large can have confidence in the training system. The Australian government recognises that the key to improving quality is not necessarily more regulation; there are other mechanisms which will enhance the quality of training. One of those initiatives we are bringing in is Reframing the Future, under which the Australian government, through ANTA, will provide funding for over 200 projects every year. In this way we will improve the quality of training in industry.
If these issues surrounding user choice and quality control are to be handled properly, they must benefit Australian training. The reforms that have come in under the Howard government are certainly developing these two aspects: quality and user choice. These are the two things that the Labor opposition is railing against, purely on ideological grounds. For positive, practical outcomes and an improved vocational education system, our quality and user choice programs are certainly the way to go.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Education and Training</title>,Adjournment,31,1
