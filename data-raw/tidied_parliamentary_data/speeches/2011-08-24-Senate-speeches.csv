Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:31):  I table the explanatory memorandum and move:


   That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



24 March 2011 marked an important day for Australia’s vocational education and training (VET) sector.  This was the day the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 was passed by this Parliament and one of the most significant reforms to the VET sector in years became a reality. 


That Act clearly demonstrated this Govern­ment’s commitment to improving the quality and consistency of training in the VET sector, both at home and internationally. The Act established the national VET regulator and the Australian Skills Quality Authority, or ASQA, commenced opera­tions on 1 July 2011.  I acknowledge that this key reform could not have been achieved without the considerable support and cooperation over a long period between the Commonwealth and most states and territories, as well as stakeholders across the sector.


But I have to say, ASQA does not have an easy job ahead of it and there are many significant challenges in the sector that ASQA needs to work through.  Since 1 July, ASQA has had responsibility for all registered training organi­sations (RTOs) in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Terri­tory.  It also assumed responsibility for RTOs in Victoria and Western Australia that also operate in referring states and territories, or offer services to international students.  This accounts for around 2000 RTOs and this figure is expected to double over the coming year as Queensland, South Australian and Tasmanian Governments enact their legislation referring powers to the Commonwealth.


On commencement, ASQA took over a high volume of work with some 642 outstanding applications being transferred from state and territory regulators.  ASQA has begun its opera­tions with a robust, but risk-based, approach to regulation.  With its new suite of regulatory tools to address non-compliance issues, it is steadily working through its significant workload to ensure that training providers either improve, or exit the system.


When the national VET regulator legislation was last before the Senate on 23 March 2011, I acknowledged that while the Government received very strong support from all the major stakeholders, they raised some legitimate concerns.  There were also some issues raised in the reports of the Senate Standing Committees on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Inquiry into the Bill and for the Scrutiny of Bills.  Some of these concerns I was able to address at the time through amendment of the Explanatory Memorandum.  Others I could not address due to the legislative process of states referring their powers.  I did, however, ask my Department to hold a consultation process with stakeholders to consider these concerns and to allow me to introduce amending legislation as early as I could to address them, without disrupting the referral process.


My Department has undertaken an extended consultation process with stakeholders, including state and territory government officials.  This consultation included two face-to-face meetings; one in Canberra on 20 and 21 April and a second one in Sydney on 9 and 10 August.  At the April consultations those sections of the Act which had been identified as needing reworking were discussed in some detail. The second consul­tations in August involved consideration of an exposure draft of the amending Bill, on a confidential basis, to explain in detail the changes that are being proposed in response to concerns and suggestions of the stakeholders.  


These consultation processes also provided an opportunity to reflect on the advice provided by the two Senate Standing Committees: the Scrutiny of Bills and the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. I thank my colleagues on these committees for their work and considera­tions on this important government reform.  I’m happy to say that through this extensive consul­tative process, stakeholders have generally expressed their agreement to the measure in the amending Bill that I’m introducing today.  This is an excellent outcome for all concerned – but most importantly, it is further confirmation of the widespread support for the reforms we are making to the VET sector and the commitment of all to ensuring that Australia has a strong VET sector known for its high quality.


Before moving on to the explain the detail of the measures in the Bill I am introducing today, I would like to again encourage the Victorian and Western Australian governments to join the national regulatory system for the VET sector.  Although I know they have some concerns about states’ rights issues, I am also confident that they are keen to see improvements in the quality of the VET sector. The National VET Regulator Act provides ASQA with a more robust set of powers that is currently available to state regulators. Feedback from stakeholders is that they welcome the concept of a truly national and consistently applied regulatory system.  I trust that we can continue to work cooperatively toward that end.


I will now address the specific measures in the Bill. With the




Objects



Throughout the consultations, and in submissions to the Senate Standing Committee inquiry, stakeholders expressed the view that an Objects clause would contextualise the Act and give the sector an indication of its purpose.  I am pleased to say that following constructive discussions with stakeholders and states and territories, the Government has built a consensus around negotiated objects, and these will be reflected in a new section 2A Objects clause in the National VET Regulator Act . The objects would be as follows:


to provide for national consistency in the regulation of VET


to regulate VET using a  standards based quality framework and, when appropriate in the circumstances, risk assessments 


to protect and enhance VET quality, flexibility and innovation and Australia’s reputation for VET both within Australia and internationally


to provide a regulatory framework to encourage and promote a VET system that is appropriate to meet Australia’s social and economic needs for a highly educated and skilled population


to protect students undertaking, or proposing to undertake, Australian VET by ensuring the provision of quality VET


to facilitate people being able to have access to accurate information relating to the quality of VET.


The objects clause will also include two notes defining the standards-based quality framework and also that the objects are subject to the constitutional basis of the Act.


The Government, and stakeholders, consider these objects focus appropriately on the goals for a national regulatory and quality framework that is essential for retaining Australia’s reputation, that is essential for the protection of students and that is essential for businesses operating across state boarders.




State/Territory Laws



This Bill also amends section 9 of the Act which deals with the registered training organisations being immune from certain state and territory laws.  The amendment clarifies that the intent of the main Act is that it applies in the same way in referring and non-referring states in relation to the Act’s interaction with their state laws.   


The Bill also introduces a new subsection at 9(3) which provides a new mechanism to allow for laws in non-referring states to be specifically excluded with the agreement of the Ministerial Council. Commonwealth representatives have negotiated tirelessly and constructively with our state counterparts to draft a provision which all governments are comfortable with.




Amending Accredited Courses



The amending Bill clarifies the circumstances when the national VET regulator can amend a VET accredited course without an application being made by the course owner.  This amendment to subsection 51(2)(a) narrows the power currently provided in the National VET Regulator Act.  Concern that the existing power was too broad was raised by both the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and stakeholders.   The proposed amendment restricts the circumstances when the regulator can amend accredited courses to situations where the amendment:


updates the course


corrects false or misleading information in the course 


is requested by a licensing or other industry body that has an interest in the course.  


This power is important to ensure that the robustness of the VET quality framework can be maintained and that courses can be updated in response to changing circumstances or requests from industry.




Cancelled Qualification



The National VET Regulator Act provides for a civil penalty where a person purports to hold a VET qualification or statement of attainment that has been cancelled.  The Act also requires a person to be notified of a cancellation and given a reasonable opportunity to return the cancelled qualification.   


Both Senate Standing Committees raised concern about this process and were concerned to ensure that a person is aware of, or could reasonably be expected to be aware of, the cancellation of the qualification or statement of attainment before being liable for a civil penalty.   The amending Bill therefore includes provisions to ensure this is clarified.  


Minor changes are also proposed to sections 58, 59 and 60 to clarify details around the period within which a cancelled qualification must be returned, taking into account the method of notification and whether the person affected seeks a review of the decision to cancel the qualification.


The power to cancel a qualification is an important regulatory tool to allow the regulator to ensure the quality of VET in Australia.  It helps to ensure that there are not uncertified people purporting to be properly trained and thereby bringing discredit to their industry.  The amendments in the Bill ensure that the process in respect of informing a person of a cancelled qualification is as fair and transparent as possible.




Use of force



The Scrutiny of Bills committee, and some stakeholders, raised some concerns about the use of force provisions in the National VET Regulator Act.  The Act specifies that an authorised officer may use force against a ‘thing’ - for example, to move or open a filing cabinet – when executing a warrant.  The Government is proposing to amend section 70 of the Act to include limits on the use of force.  Under the proposed amendments, the person in charge of the ‘thing’ in question must be given a reasonable opportunity to move or open it themselves, prior to any force being used.  The Amending Bill also clarifies that the section does not authorise use of force against people. 


These amendments are consistent with the recommendation of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in that they reflect the approach taken in other Commonwealth Acts such as subsection 3U(d) of the Crimes Act 1914.  In my speech to the Senate on 23 March, I indicated that the relevant provisions in the Act would also be amended to include the recording by video of situations where force is used in executing a warrant.  This option was also raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.  However, on further investigation by my Department, it was found that the use of video recording in such circumstances is not mandated by any other piece of Commonwealth legislation. Given this, I did not feel it appropriate to place this requirement on the national VET regulator at this time.  This, of course, does not prohibit authorised officers under the Act from using video recording equipment if the regulator believes it is appropriate in certain cases.   




Authorised Officers



The Scrutiny of Bills Committee also raised concern around the wide discretion that the regulator had to appoint authorised officers and that authorised officers be appropriately qualified and trained.  The proposed amendment seeks to amend the Act to enable the Minister to make a determination about required experience, training and qualifications (if any) for authorised officers appointed by the regulator under section 89 of the Act. 




Sharing information with the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency



In order to ensure a consistent approach to tertiary education regulation, particularly as greater numbers of providers operate in both the higher education and VET sectors, an amendment is proposed to facilitate information sharing with the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency, the higher education regulator.  Not only will this facilitate information sharing, it will also help to reduce the regulatory burden on dual-sector providers.




Headings



Stakeholders also suggested that for ease of reading, some headings should be changed to better reflect what particular sections dealt with.  The Government is always happy to work with the sector to ensure the Act is user friendly and clear for RTOs, trainers and students. We are therefore seeking minor amendments to the headings of sections 107, 108, 109 and 110.


This Amending Bill reflects the Government’s continued commitment to working with governments and stakeholders to continually improve the quality and consistency of training across the VET sector. A strong, nationally consistent regulatory framework is a key step in achieving this.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  In accordance with standing order 111, further consideration of this bill is now adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, which commences in 2012.

Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I wish to speak on this matters of public interest discussion to bring to the attention of the Senate and the wider community a matter of significant concern raised by a constituent who came to my office some time ago. The matter goes to the limits of migration legislation, the Migration Review Tribunal and ministerial inter­vention. A young man by the name of Daniel attended my office on 23 May this year, seeking assistance and advice on a serious migration problem. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship, DIAC, on 18 May had informed him that he was illegally present in Australia. He was told he had 28 days to depart and to contact the department of his own volition or they would come and talk to him. As he had initiated regular contact with his migration agent, he was understandably distraught at this advice.


By way of background: realising a longstanding dream, this young man arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom in September 2008 on a working holiday visa. His trade for the past 16 years was that of a solid plasterer, and in Australia he obtained employment in that field immediately. Being impressed with his skills and aptitude, in 2009 his employer encouraged him to obtain an Australian trades certificate. This was with a view to sponsoring him on a business sponsorship 457 visa. Daniel gained his certificate, and his employer lodged a 457 application in February 2009. The employer failed to meet the financial requirements of sponsorship and the application failed. On leaving DIAC's Perth offices, having just received the bad news, Daniel approached a registered migration agency. This agency, EasyMigrate Perth, was in the same complex as DIAC—I would suggest a prime location to attract clientele.


Now, you might say, that was the smart thing to do and I, in times past, might have agreed. Daniel engaged EasyMigrate and paid in excess of $5,000 for their services. His agent advised that they would apply for a skilled regional sponsored 487 visa. This would allow him to stay onshore whilst they applied for a state sponsored 176 visa. At this time, Daniel provided all relevant documentation necessary for his claim. His agent advised that the process could take up to four years and they would contact him when, and if, necessary.


An extremely organised person, Daniel kept copies of all documentation relating to his quest to remain in Australia. In hindsight, this was a very smart move—the smartest move he made, apart from seeking advice from my office. Over the next two years, he received no contact from his agent. Being keen for updates on the progress of his application process, Daniel called them regularly. The answer was always: 'All is in hand and going well.' In January 2011, with a reputation as a tradesman of quality, Daniel sought advice on establishing his own business in Australia. He approached his agent inquiring as to his ability to do so under the criteria of his visa status. He was advised there was no impediment and to go ahead. So he started up his own business in February 2011. In March 2011, with his business booming, he talked to Silver Trowel Trade Training Centre about taking on an apprentice. He also renewed the 12-month lease on his rental property. Daniel was content with his life—all was well, or so he thought.


However, this young man's life was about to be turned upside down. On Wednesday, 18 May, Immigration informed him of his illegal status and his removal order effective within 28 days. Daniel immediately contacted his agent, who denied any knowledge of the order. An appointment was made for the following day. At the meeting with his agent, the advice was: 'Don't panic. This can be fixed. We'll lodge a state Sponsored 176 visa. You'll be granted a Bridging Visa E. We'll lodge an appeal to MRT and buy you some time.' On Friday 20th May, Daniel insisted his agent accompany him to Immigration to find out what went wrong and what could be done. A bridging visa E was granted and he was instructed to produce an airline ticket by the following Friday. What advice did his agent give him? 'Don't worry. Don't buy a ticket. We'll lodge an appeal with MRT.' By Monday, 23 May, Daniel's agent had provided him with a copy of his visa application rejection letter dated 24 March, 2011. An appeal was lodged with MRT in the knowledge that it would fail, but it would buy time. This is the point at which Daniel, in a state of panic, first contacted my office.


My office was about to discover his migration agent had demonstrated complete disregard for their client's best interests. In effect, the agent had failed to advise when the application was rejected due to the lack of supporting documentation, which they held on file; failed to advise of the opportunity to lodge an appeal to MRT within the 21 days of the decision being received; failed to advise that his trades recognition had failed due to lack of supporting evidence, also held on file; failed to lodge the original 176 application; failed to lodge the Federal Police clearance application; failed to advise their client of any of the above; and failed over the previous two years to acknowledge numerous contacts from DIAC seeking additional information. This was despite holding all relevant information on file. Later, they failed to provide their client with the complete visa rejection letter, as it contained damning evidence of their negligence. At this point, my office goes into overdrive in an effort to right the wrongs against this young man. Over the following days advice was sought from the parliamentary liaison unit officer in Perth, Ms Shelley Jenkins; Ms Renelle Forster, Assistant Secretary, Ministerial and Executive Services, DIAC; Minister Bowen's CLO, Nathan Fenech; Mark Bailey, Assistant Director, Stakeholder Engagement Migration Agents Section, Migration and Visa Policy Division, DIAC; Ms Jan Feeby, Branch Manager, Trades Recognition Australia;


and Ms Claire English, Senior Migration Officer, Skilled Migration WA, Department of Training and Workforce Development WA. Daniel also sought the advice of an independent lawyer.


Although I cannot praise highly enough the efforts of all those above, everyone's hands were tied. Why was that? It was that, through no fault of Daniel's, an appeal had not been lodged with the MRT. That must be done within 21 calendar days of the applicant being taken to have received the letter of rejection. If the client has a registered migration agent, they receive the notification and their client is deemed at law to have also received it. Of course, in this case, it never happened—why would it? Why inform their client of this contact when all other contact from the department had been withheld?


The assistance and advice provided by Minister Bowen's CLO was exemplary. Understanding Daniel's predicament, he contacted their legal department for substantive advice. That advice was: 


Legislatively there is no basis for the Minister to intervene due to an appeal to MRT not being lodged in time.


You may well think this was the end of it, but there is more. On Friday, 3 June, whilst in my office Daniel contacted the owner of EasyMigrate, who had now become involved in the case. What my staff heard on speaker phone was unbelievable. During the conversation the agent claimed he had an insider within the department and that his insider could fix the problem and fast-track Daniel's state sponsorship. This of course was untrue on both counts; the problem could not be fixed and there was no insider.


But back to the crux of this matter. There is an anomaly in migration law. It allows blameless clients of unscrupulous and negligent migration agents to fall through a legislative crack. Of course they can lodge a complaint to the Migration Agents Registration Authority, but this does not assist their migration status. MRT has no discretion, and a merits based review may not be accepted after the final cut-off date. Legislatively there is no basis for the minister to intervene when an appeal to MRT has not been lodged and considered.


So where did the wronged party go from there? In this case he went back to the UK, where he immediately lodged a new applica­tion. There was some urgency to this, as the 176 application criteria changed on 31 June, complicating an already complex situation. Ms Jane Sancom, principal migration officer, and her staff in the minister's London office ensured Daniel's new application was lodged prior to the cut-off date of 31 June. Fortunately for Daniel this has a happy ending and his visa was granted on 5 August, 2011. This was made possible by the exceptional assistance provided to my office by the aforementioned officers and agencies.


Madam Acting Deputy President, it would be a useful development to have this anomaly in migration law examined. In such extreme and extenuating circumstances, where there is no fault at all on the part of the individual, there should be an alternative pathway to a common-sense resolution, one that does not impact so greatly on the lives and incomes of those exploited by unprincipled migration agents.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (14:00):   My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Evans. I refer the minister to today's revelation that, in March this year, the member for Dobell lobbied Central Coast Group Training to give his ex-wife a job at the same time as supporting that organisa­tion's bids for federal funding for a jobs incubator. I also refer to Mr Thomson's text message to Councillor Best, the general manager of Central Coast Group Training, saying, 'Bye-bye job incubator', following a radio interview in which Councillor Best expressed his concerns about delays with the GP superclinic at Warnervale. Does the minister condone Mr Thomson seeking this favour for his ex-wife as a quid pro quo for supporting government funding for this jobs incubator and threatening such funding when he did not like public comments made by the general manager of Central Coast Group Training?

Senator Fierravanti-Wells has, and she repeats claims made in the paper and then seeks to ask me, as if it is something to do with me, about it at question time. Obviously that is a way of getting the issue up. As I understand it, the question of the jobs incubator is a commitment that has been implemented through Mr Garrett's portfolio. I understand that is in the process of occurring. I am sure he has had some contact with the local member about that incubator, and I can certainly take it on notice as to whether that occurred. As to the rest of the matters raised by the senator, they are clearly not within my portfolio responsibilities.

Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  I am not going to make urgent inquiries into every representation by Mr Thomson to every minister. That would take a very long time and I am not sure on what basis I could justify that. Do Mr Thomson and every other member and senator in the parliament make representations on behalf of their electorates? Yes. The good ones do, more so than the poor ones.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked today by Senator Mason in relation to carbon pricing.


I also note that question time has been shut down in the other place. There must be a little bit of pressure over there. It is very interesting. The sort of thing that brings about that pressure, on one of the first times that we can recollect that they have actually shut down question time—and that has not happened for a long, long, long time—is that they probably do not have full confidence in what is going on. They are probably generally doing a fine job over there, and these are words that are going to resonate in our heads: 'a fine job'. That is what the member for Dobell was doing: a fine job. He was going to be there for a long, long, long time. Now it looks like it could be a couple of days. And there is 'full confidence' in the member for Dobell.


One of the things that bring about this lack of confidence is that the Queensland Treasury has presented a range of figures pertaining to the assessment of a carbon tax. And remember that the Queensland Treasury, administered by the Queensland Treasurer and member of the Labor Party, has presented a set of figures that are entirely different to what this Treasury has presented on the carbon tax. They are two completely different sets of figures. How could this be, pray tell? We do not seem to have full confidence in what is going on these days. It has not been a long, long, long time, but it seems to be coming really, really, really unstuck.


We can look at the tabled presentations by the Queensland Treasury. We cannot get the tabled presentations from the federal Treasury. They are hiding them; they do not want us to see them. It is secret squirrel stuff. And that is another thing we could talk about: things they keep secret. When they actually present the figures we find that regional towns in Queensland are going to be smashed by a carbon tax. This broad based consumption tax, delivered to you via every power point in your house, will do absolutely nothing about the temperature of the globe. It is merely a gesture. We see people who should be standing up for manufacturing jobs, sitting opposite me today, who should be standing up for working families, but all they want to stand up for is the Greens. That is who they support now: the Greens, the party that has been destroying the Labor Party. It is tearing the Labor Party asunder. The Labor Party is a slave to the Greens, and they are tearing it apart. It has lost its soul. They are doing it here today and they are doing it in the other place. Why are you doing it to yourself?


This carbon tax is the absolute essence of insanity. It has brought you unstuck. Why did you go back there? Why on earth did you go back to that turf? Everything else you could have walked through, but that is the tipping point; it is the destruction of what is happening. Everything that is happening around here is associated with this insane tax. When we look at the global environment and what is going on—the rise of China, the rise of India, the problems in Europe, the problems in the United States—why on earth would this nation go down the path of a carbon tax? It is just beyond belief. But it is not beyond contempt that you would do that to our country. It is not beyond contempt that you would put at risk the future of this nation by reason of this insane tax and a policy that is guided by the Australian Greens.


We have seen so much that is there for Queensland. The towns of Rockhampton, Gladstone and Mackay will suffer up to three times the effect of the carbon tax. These were the heartlands of the Australian Labor Party. Rockhampton was one of the heartlands of the Australian Labor Party. Why are you doing this to their jobs? Why are you doing this to prices? Why don't you care for these people anymore? Why can't you be fair dinkum and stand up for the real issues? Why do you go on this mad frolic with the Greens? Why have you let them do this to your party? Why do you sit back and watch while this happens? Every figure tells a story. The polling that is happening to you at the moment is for a reason. It is basically a self-inflicted wound, because of your mad taxes, mad associations and warrants for people—'full confidence' and all that other stuff. How did you get yourselves into this position?


If you do not back away from this carbon tax, it will go beyond being an issue for the Labor Party; it will be bad for Queensland and bad for our nation. It is absolutely beyond contempt that you would go to the areas that are actually putting money on the table for our nation. If it were not for regional Australia, the money would not go on the table for us to spend to keep the service industry afloat. It is the money that we get from our raw exports—coal, iron ore, wheat—that keeps this nation going. What a carbon tax does for that, gosh only knows. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-08-24,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (15:09):  It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to respond to Senator Joyce's diatribe. The fact of the matter is that a market mechanism like the carbon price is the most economically efficient way of reducing carbon pollution. It creates incentives for large polluters to reduce their emissions and to invest in the clean energy sources of the future, like gas, wind and solar power. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator LUNDY:
  The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Combet—as the senators opposite know very well—has flagged that, when the carbon price is in place, there may be scope to work with state governments to examine other programs that cut pollution at a higher cost.


Far from the fear campaign that we have just heard from the other side of the chamber, we take a responsible position with respect to the future of both Australia and the Australian economy. We know, through Treasury modelling, that the outlook for Queensland and other states as far as jobs go is healthy, but the key conclusion—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator LUNDY:
  Take the time to listen to the facts. The key conclusion of a Queensland Treasury report released yesterday is that, over the period to 2020, Queensland's economy will grow strongly, at an average annual rate of 3.5 per cent, with or without a carbon price, and there will be an extra 474,000 jobs created over that period. This is consistent with Treasury modelling, which shows the economy continuing to prosper and jobs growth strongly nationwide with a carbon price in place.


There is no basis to what we are hearing from the senators opposite. We know, through a whole series of endless debates, year after year, that there was a commitment—with bipartisan support, up to when Mr Abbott took over the leadership of the Liberal Party—to a market based mechanism. Why? Because it is the most efficient and most likely way to help transition our economy to a low-carbon economy. You may stand over there and berate us for not being visionary and all the rest of it, but I am proud of being part of a government that will take this country forwards, not backwards in the irresponsible way that senators opposite are promoting.


Treasury's modelling also shows that the carbon price will see household electricity prices rise by some $3.30 per week, with the total impact on costs for households estimated to be around $9.90 on average. To assist with this—an important fact in this debate that is often neglected by those opposite—the federal government will be providing assistance to households worth $10.10 a week on average, in the form of tax cuts, increases in family payments and higher pensions and benefits. Nine out of 10 households will get this assistance. Almost six million households will get assistance that meets or exceeds their expected average impact on prices, and over four million households, almost half of all households, we will get assistance that provides a 20 per cent buffer over and above the expected average impact on prices. 


This is not only good policy but it is mitigating the impact on households, which those senators opposite claim they are concerned about. I think there should be some acknowledgment of the fact and the substance of the policy in this debate, rather than empty critique being thrown at us, as we just experienced from Senator Joyce. It is not helping the public debate to approach this in such a base way. The level of political dialogue around the debate on climate change has descended to the bottom of the pit on the opposite side of the chamber. I call on senators opposite to take seriously the substance of the policy of tackling climate change, to take seriously the substance of lowering our carbon footprint as a country and to take seriously a policy that they once believed in. They were prepared to support a market mechanism in debate on the floor of this place. Why? Because the market is the best, cheapest and most efficient way to put downward pressure on the release of carbon into our atmosphere, therefore allowing us to make a contribution as a nation to the responsibilities we bear to the next generation of not only Australians but young people around the world. If we do not act now, we know, through all of the economic modelling, that it just becomes more expensive and the burden is transferred to the next generation of taxpayers, who will wear the irresponsible actions of the opposition.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-08-24,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:14):  When I was but a wee boy, the leader of the British Labour Party was the Rt Hon. Michael Foot. He had a shock of white hair. He was a great journalist; he was an appalling politician. He believed in unilateral nuclear disarmament. He believed that it was a good idea for Britain to take the lead and unilaterally get rid of its nuclear weapons. He believed that superpower conflict would somehow stop if Britain unilaterally got rid of its nuclear weapons. He believed also that other countries would follow. He was sincere, he was well meaning, he was idealistic and he was wrong. He was very dangerously wrong. The Cold War did not end because of unilateral nuclear disarmament; it ended because of strength by the West.


By the same token, this is a global problem. Temperatures will not fall unless there is global action, and this carbon tax will not make one iota of difference. Australia should never ever apologise for acting in its national interest. The government are undertaking what some commentators have called 'unilateral economic disarmament'. They are actually taking away economic prosperity from our country unilaterally before the rest of the world, hoping others will follow.


I accept that belief in the carbon tax is sincerely held, often with even religious zeal. But it is wrong. It will not make any difference. Why would a country like Australia—which has a marvellous comparative advantage in that it is energy rich and export oriented but is also trade exposed—do this? Why would it introduce a carbon tax? It is not in our national interest. Why would a government do this at a time of international economic crisis, particularly at a time when our trading position is already exposed and weakened? Why would a government do this? How can they argue that this is in our national interest? Why are they doing this? Why would a government impose this punitive tax on its own people when no other government around the world is prepared to introduce a tax of similar impact, reach and severity? Why would a government do this? And, yet, this is what they are proposing to do.


The Labor government will tell us that we have to lead by example, just like the Rt Hon. Michael Foot thought in the 1970s. I would say it is more like being the first lemming to jump off a cliff—and, believe me, there will be no-one behind us. As if any of our competitors are going to shoot themselves in the foot to assist us. As if developing countries like Brazil, Russia, India or China will follow Australia's example and bind their own hands and compromise their own economies. They will not do that. They will not prejudice their national interest and neither should we.


As if the developed world is going to reduce its growth and employment at a time when it is under enormous international stress. What about the United States of America? When is the last time you even heard President Obama talk about a carbon tax or a carbon pollution reduction scheme? Have we even heard that in months? No. What about the European Union? The European Union is spending more time investigating the fraud in its emissions spot market than actually trading on it. The Treasury modelling on which the govern­ment relies to sell this tax to the public is based on an assumption that countries around the world embrace an international trading scheme. That is an assumption of something that Michael Foot found out in the 1970s just does not occur. Countries do not unilaterally act against their own self-interest and neither should we.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2011-08-24,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:19):  I am very pleased to enter this debate. I must say that I hope I do not present just a wall of noise like we have heard from both Senator Joyce and Senator Mason. We really need to get back to some facts on this. Why are we doing this? Why are governments around the world saying that we need to deal with carbon pollution? We are dealing with carbon pollution because it is causing massive problems in the environment. The world is heating up. The tides are rising. We know this from all of the eminent scientists who have actually studied this problem. Every scientist who has expertise in this area is warning governments around the world that this is a problem.


It is not just individual scientists who are warning about the problem of global warming; it is also NASA. NASA have more expertise than anyone in the world. If you go on their website you will see that the globe is warming, that the tides are rising and that it has nothing to do with solar flares. It is carbon dioxide pollution in the atmosphere that is causing the problem. NASA says it, the Australian Academy of Science says it, the CSIRO says it and the Bureau of Meteorology says it.


I can understand this from Senator Joyce. Senator Joyce is a consistent carbon price opponent and global warming denier. But for somebody like Senator Mason to stand up and run this line when he actually supported a price on carbon under his previous leader, John Howard, is just hypocrisy of the highest kind. Yet we have got conservative leaders around the world actually accepting that this has to be done. John Howard accepted there had to be a price on carbon. Margaret Thatcher accepted there had to be a price on carbon. David Cameron—no relative of mine, I must say—accepts there has to be a price on carbon. Probably the former Leader of the Liberal Party, Malcolm Turnbull, says there has to be a price on carbon. So when Malcolm Turnbull says there has to be a price on carbon and that the best way to put a price on carbon is through a market system, what happens? The extremists take over the Liberal Party. The extremists take over the Liberal Party and they destroy Malcolm Turnbull's leadership because he is prepared to accept the scientific reality of the need to put a price on carbon. They assassinate their own leader on the basis of his beliefs on carbon pricing. 


Then what did they do? They said, 'We have got to do something because we need to deal with this issue on a political basis. We do not want to deal with it on a scientific basis but we need to deal with it on a political basis,' and they come up with a nonsense called Direct Action. Direct Action, according to the Treasury, will cost every family in this country $720 a year. Our approach on this is to make sure that families are looked after. We accept there will be a cost on families and we have factored that into our approach. The Treasury says the cost will be $9.90 a week. So what do we do? We are saying that most families will get $10.10 in return, that they will actually get better than the cost of the carbon tax. So we have got an economically viable and economically responsible position to take. 


Yet what do we get from Senator Joyce? Senator Mason started talking about wrecking the economy, then at least he thought, 'I had better not go down this way,' so he stopped saying 'wrecking' and he said 'compromising'. He knows it will not wreck the economy. He knows it will not compromise the economy. This is the hypo­crisy of people like Senator Birmingham—'Backflip Birmingham'—and Senator Mason going around and changing their whole position on this. They know it will not wreck the economy, because people know that this is the best way to deal with a carbon price. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:24):  Senator Cameron seems confident about his government's carbon tax proposal, which will put increased costs of living upon every Australian. If he is so confident, let us have an election about it. If you want to go the whole hog, let us have a double dissolution. Let's go for it, Senator Cameron. If you believe what you say, get out there and ask the people of Australia what they think about the lies of your leader, Julia Gillard, who promised us just a year ago, hand on heart, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Here we are a year later debating the carbon tax, which is going to destroy the Australian economy for no benefit whatsoever. Senator Cameron might tell me I am wrong. After all these taxes on every Australian, by how much are you going to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2020? Even your government's own modelling shows that carbon emissions will go up, not down. Senator Cameron walks out of the chamber because he cannot answer that, because he knows that what I am saying is a truthful reproduction of the Commonwealth government's own modelling. 


My own state of Queensland today—as Senator Mason asked about in question time—have done their own modelling. Even they are saying what an impact it is going to have on the Queensland economy. The Queensland state Labor government has done modelling that shows it is bad, the New South Wales state government has done modelling that shows it is bad, the Western Australian state government has done modelling that shows it is bad and the Commonwealth government has done modelling that also shows it is bad. 


Senator Cameron talks about the world heating up. Senator Cameron, you have not been following the debate. They do not talk about global warming anymore. It is climate change, remember, not global warming. Statistics over the last two decades show that the climate has either cooled or has certainly not warmed up. He says tides are rising and quotes the CSIRO. I still ask Senator Cameron or the CSIRO to explain to me why 140,000 years ago—a long time—tidal levels were about where they are now, as shown in the CSIRO's graph. The graph shows that, over the next 120,000 years, tidal levels went right down. Then suddenly, 20,000 years ago—this is the CSIRO's graph, not mine—the graph shows that tidal levels scooted back up to where they had been 140,000 years ago to approximately where they are now. 


Senator Cameron is part of the group trying to scare people into not buying near the water because the tide is rising, so we all sell our properties next to the seaside and on the river. Professor Flannery, appointed by the Labor government to head the Climate Commission, is part of the group saying, 'Oh, all is lost, the tide is increasing and we are all going to be washed away!' Professor Flannery, I might add as an aside, gets $180,000 a year for two days a week of work.




Senator Fifield:
  How much? 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  He gets $180,000 a year for two days work a week. But, hang on, Professor Flannery then goes out and buys a flash property on the banks of the Hawkesbury River. I guess he got it at a good price because people who might have had property there probably sold it to get rid of it because he and Senator Cameron are warning these people that they are going to be inundated. How can you take any notice of what Senator Cameron says? How can you take any notice of what Senator Wong said in the nonanswer, I might say, to all the questions that were asked of her today? 


Indeed, how can we take any notice of anything that the Labor Party or the Labor leader, Julia Gillard, says when we have direct evidence there before us of Julia Gillard promising the Australian people, the day before the last federal election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Here we are, a year later, debating it. How can you believe anything Julia Gillard or her ministers would ever say?

 (Queensland) (15:38):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and to have the second reading speech incorporated in the Hansard.


Leave granted.



The speech read as follows—


Landholders' Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011


The Landholders’ Right to Refuse (Coal Seam Gas) Bill 2011 will provide Australian landholders with the right to refuse the undertaking of coal seam gas mining activities on food producing land without prior written authorisation.


The intent of this bill is to allow farmers to say no to coal seam gas mining on their land. When Australia has so little good quality agricultural land, only about 1-2%, we must protect it from all other inconsistent land uses.


While ever we have uncertainties about the long term impacts of this new industry on our underground water resources, there will be concern within the community about impacts on food security. Queensland farmers in the Darling Downs, for example, rely on the aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin for their water source. Without detailed understanding of the connections between underground aquifers in the Great Artesian Basin, coal seam gas activities risk a drop in the groundwater table from dewatering of coal seams to allow gas extraction, or contamination of aquifers with hydraulic fracturing fluid. Farmers should have the legal right to decide that they would prefer to be able to keep farming on their land, and for their children to have that option, rather than take the risk of possible long term groundwater depletion or contamination.


The Greens believe that we need a moratorium on new coal seam gas approvals until there is full scientific understanding of the impacts on groundwater, food security, rural communities, threatened species, the climate and the Great Barrier Reef. However, even if that information is gained and the evidence finds that coal seam gas is safe, farmers should still have the right to say no. The surface and amenity impacts may be too great an interference with their farming operations. This bill facilitates their right to make that decision, by requiring coal seam gas corporations to gain their written authorisation to enter their land to conduct coal seam gas activities. That written authorisation must contain an independent assessment of the current and future risks associated with the proposed coal seam gas mining activity on, or affecting, the land and any associated ground water systems. The farmer must also be informed that they should seek independent advice and that they may refuse to give written authorisation.


If the corporation unlawfully enters the land, they commit an offence for which a significant penalty accrues daily, and the commonwealth may prosecute them. The farmer may also seek an injunction from the Federal Court to restrain the entry, and the corporation must pay the costs of that application irrespective of the outcome.


This bill applies to all land that has produced food at any time in the 10 years prior to the first proposed coal seam gas activity on the land, from commercial primary production through to urban vegetable gardens. The bill applies to all persons with an ownership interest in the land, which is broadly defined to include all persons with a legal or equitable interest in or right to occupy the land. This would include native title holders or those with native title rights and interests. A corpora­tion must obtain prior written authorisation from all persons with an ownership interest in the land before they may commence coal seam gas activities.


Importantly, this bill does not alter the ownership of the minerals and gas, which remain vested in the States. If the federal or state government decide that those resources are so needed, they may seek to compulsorily acquire the land, paying compensation on just terms or in accordance with state acquisition of land statutes. Those existing laws are a sufficient safeguard against a landholder ‘unreasonably’ refusing access authorisation, so this bill does not seek to address that issue.


The bill would only apply to coal seam gas activities which begin after the bill’s commence­ment.


I commend this bill to the Senate.




Senator WATERS:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:19):  This bill we are debating is part of the government's NBN fiasco. Consistent with its modus operandi it seeks to minimise or remove competition and to put the government in control—government knows best irrespective of the additional cost, irrespective of the inefficiency or the waste. This government has a scary disregard for the value of taxpayers' money. Of course we know that. We well remember that, in relation to the NBN, the government did not conduct even as much as a cost-benefit analysis. We well remember that the minister, Senator Conroy, and the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, designed the NBN policy on the back of an envelope in an aircraft. They came up with 'sort of an appropriate figure that we should put to it'. To make it sound scientific they did not want to come up with a round figure so they came up with a figure of $43 billion. There was no science to it. It was back-of-an-envelope type stuff. Of course, ever since, they have been playing catch-up, trying to come up with some sort of justification for that very inappropriate way to deal with taxpayers' dollars.


In this bill the government equally has made no attempt whatsoever to maximise value for money with the arrangements that it is proposing to put in place to bring fibre to greenfield sites. The coalition supports the principle of encouraging fibre to greenfield sites, of course. I am referring here to the dissenting report that was put forward in June by the member for Wentworth, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, as part of the advisory report on the Telecommunications Legisla­tion Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, where he noted:


While it costs more to install fibre than copper in a new development, the incremental cost is much less than the cost of installing fibre in brownfields sites. The Government’s stated policy is that in developments of 100 homes or less Telstra will install copper. The Coalition members believe this approach risks wasteful duplication with copper presumably being overbuilt within a few years if it is within the fibre footprint. On any view connecting greenfields developments to fibre must be a key priority given the cost advantage over brownbuild fibre overbuilds referred to above.


We agree with the principle of encouraging fibre onto greenfield sites. However, it is important to do it right, and that is where this government has significant difficulties—it does not think things through. It takes a very ideological approach to government and has a complete disregard for the value of taxpayers' dollars. It does not come to this with a view to making sure that we stretch the value of the dollar as far as possible and that we maximise the efficiency, the impact and, ultimately, the affordability for con­sumers. That is not the approach of this government. This is a government which is focused on putting government at the centre of all things, irrespective of whether that is the appropriate way to go. We are really concerned that this bill would further destroy broadband competition, because it would make it preferential to use the NBN. It would make it artificially cheaper for developers to use the NBN, rather than existing fibre installers, to lay fibre on greenfield estates. It would give NBN a competitive advantage in the marketplace, yet again, when there is no proper justification for doing so.


Labor is actually doing the opposite of what it promised. Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, said in December last year that he would preserve the role of private fibre installers and operators. Instead he has structured this bill in a way which would further entrench his monopoly, NBN Co., which is very clearly not in the national interest. For the benefit of the Senate and for senators who might be considering their position on this bill, I will quote what Senator Conroy said in December 2010:


It has been a consistent feature of the government’s policy in new developments that there should be room for competing providers. This continues to be the case.


…   …   …


Providers can compete to provide infrastructure in new developments—for example, by offering more tailored solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery.


That is exactly the opposite of what the government is now doing with this legislation. Why is the government so intent, through the power of legislation, to give its monopoly provider every single additional advantage in the marketplace that it possibly can? It is not appropriate, but that is the modus operandi of this government.


This bill and the way the arrangements have been put together demonstrate that the government has not learnt from the mistakes it has made on NBN policy more generally. The NBN is of course a government owned company which was created to build the network. It is going to cost taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It will have monopoly powers. The government thinks that this company should do everything. It should be in control of the whole shooting match—the whole shebang. Of course, that makes it way too expensive. It is bad for competition and it is largely unnecessary, as the private sector can do the job faster, more efficiently and cheaper, as long as the parliament and the government have set the appropriate ground rules for all of that to happen. But, no, this government thinks government has to be in charge of everything. This government does not believe in the benefits of competition. This government does not believe in the benefits, efficiency and value for money that can come from having the private sector compete appropriately with each other—and with NBN Co., for example.


I will go to the dissenting report by the member for Wentworth on behalf of coalition members of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, because it raises a series of very important issues. It makes the point that the arrangements in this legislation are:


… unnecessarily slow and bureaucratic for property developers.


In evidence to the inquiry, the Housing Industry Association made the observation that:


… the legislation needs to make it very clear who is responsible for the delivery and that there are certain obligations on the provider to do that in a very timely way, otherwise it will delay development. I appreciate that there are negotia­tions in the feasibility and planning arrangements, but there needs to be that level of certainty for developers so they know who is going to do it, who is going to pay for it and when it can be done. It should not take more than a couple of phone calls and a meeting to sort out it being put into the critical path of the development, otherwise those projects will be delayed whilst certain things are waiting for a provider to provide that infrastructure.


This bill will put in place significant additional burdens that are completely unnecessary.


The other observation made in this report is that this bill is a 'missed opportunity to impose competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co.' As presently drafted, the bill does not allow us to take advantage of the existence of competitive greenfield opera­tors, which would impose effective compet­itive and cost discipline on NBN Co. I recommend the report to Senator Farrell, the minister at the table, if he is still thinking about how he is going to vote on this legislation. He should have a very close look at the report by the member for Wentworth. It is very good reading; I think he would learn a bit.


It would be way better if we had a regime where developers had a viable option to use competitive greenfield operators to build out fibre networks in their developments, because that would mean they could build the network more cheaply, quickly and conveniently. That would:


… produce a more efficient outcome if it meant that infrastructure in new developments were built at lower cost than if it were done by NBN Co under a monopoly.


It is very simple. If NBN Co. can provide the service at the lowest cost then clearly it should be providing the service. But the market should be free to test whether there is a cheaper, quicker, more efficient way to do it. Why does the government not want us to have the cheapest, most efficient way of bringing fibre to greenfield developments? Why does it want to inflate the cost? Why does it want that additional cost to be passed through the whole economy? This, of course, is on top of the carbon tax and all the other taxes. This is a government that does not mind imposing additional cost-of-living pressures on people across Australia. The approach of this government, whether with NBN Co. or with anything else they touch and stuff up, is to spend too much, to borrow—




Senator Williams:
  It is waste.




Senator CORMANN:
  And it is waste, as Senator Williams just pointed out—spending too much, waste, borrowing money. And then of course there is taxing: introducing one new multibillion ad hoc new tax after another. That is because we have this waste, because we have inflated costs, because this government wants to put government in charge of everything and because the government does not believe in the benefits of competition and because the government does not want these sorts of services to be provided at the most affordable cost.


It would be very simple to fix. All the government needs to do is go back to the policy statement the minister made back in December 2010: that he is happy to have competition. Competition is good. Compet­ition keeps providers honest. If they know they are going to face competition they know they have to be as good as they can be. NBN Co. would know that it has to perform, because if it does not perform there is going to be a private provider that might be able to do it quicker, faster and with better service. If there is that threat, it might keep NBN Co. on its toes. This government is obviously worried that NBN Co. will not be competitive. This government is worried that NBN Co. will not be able to provide value for money. So what does this government do? It puts a fence around NBN Co. It says, 'No, we don't want pesky private providers to be out there showing us up.' 


If we allowed competition, people might actually realise that this white elephant we have set up is not delivering value for taxpayers' dollars. People would realise that it is just another example of waste of taxpayers' dollars and they would be even more upset about all these new taxes they face as a result of this government's persistent incompetence.


As the member for Wentworth, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, very astutely observed, this bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure, and on this point I quote him:


The regime established by the Bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. Today, as is clear from evidence provided by GFOA there is a nascent but increasingly active market in which CGOs compete to secure contracts from developers to build out fibre networks in their developments. In some cases, the CGO builds the network and then also operates as a retail service provider, providing services over the network to residents in the development.


That is a very good thing. He goes on:


The regime established by the Bill damages competition for several reasons. First, by exposing CGOs to competition from a government funded operator which is prepared to install fibre at zero cost to a developer (once the developer has incurred the expense of building trenches and other ‘fibre ready facilities’), the regime will effectively make it impossible for such CGOs to compete.


CGOs will be at a fundamental cost disadvantage because NBN Co is prepared to install fibre at zero cost, incurring a loss on the installation which it presumably hopes to recoup over time from service revenues.


This is typical monopoly-type behaviour. So you have a company, like NBN Co., which is getting not only the advantage of a 100 per cent taxpayer investment but also the advantage of the government muscle and the legislative muscle protecting its market position. Then, once everybody is sucked in, once everybody is locked in to this arrangement, nobody is going to be in a position to keep the company on its toes to provide the most affordable price and the most competitive service.


That is what this is all about. This is about locking in NBN Co. as the only viable provider, courtesy of significant taxpayer subsidies—multibillion-dollar taxpayer subsidies—and courtesy of protecting its position in the marketplace through legisla­tion like this. Why is that in the national interest? It is a question Senator Mason asked earlier in relation to the carbon tax. Why is that in the national interest? And, I might say, that was a very eloquent contribution in the context of this debate.


With so much of what this government does, there is a real question mark as to why they are doing it, as to why it would be in the national interest to force people to pay more for the services that are going to be provided through initiatives like NBN Co. They would have to pay if the private sector and the competitive market out there were allowed to do its job. Through competition, within the context of an appropriate framework, you do get better value for money—better value for taxpayers' money and better value for the private money people have to pay for services they might choose to access, or might not choose to access. If there is no provider out there that can provide a service at a price people are prepared to pay, maybe there is not sufficient demand to justify the expense in the first place.


The coalition, as constructive as we are, is proposing some amendments to make sure that the current flaws in this bill are addressed. Hopefully the government will see fit to support those amendments. Senator Birmingham, on behalf of the coalition, will be moving amendments to remove the disincentives for developers to use CGOs to install fibre infrastructure. The reason we want to do this is that we want to give developers an incentive to use competitive greenfields operators in the knowledge that, if they pay a CGO on a per connection basis, they will be able to recoup that cost by selling the connection to NBN Co. We want to ensure that developers have additional choices beyond the government's default option so that when they build a new development they will install fibre-ready facilities but there will be no live network installed. We do not want people to be locked into just one option. We want there to be a series of options. 


This will impose a cost discipline on NBN Co. because it will require them to purchase connections at a reasonable price, which will be set at a price no greater than NBN Co.'s own average cost of installing a connection. This will mean that, if there are competitors that can build connections at a lower charge than NBN Co., there will be a cost saving to NBN Co. and ultimately to the taxpayer. Surely that would be a good thing. I am hopeful that Senator Farrell will make it his business to recommend to the government that they seriously consider this amendment.


There will be a second coalition amendment to this bill which will seek to address the damaging effects on competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. 


The overall point is that the government has not learned from its failure around the NBN. It is wasting a lot of money. Because it wastes so much money, it has to borrow more and tax more. It is not good for Australia. It is high time that this government started to learn the value of taxpayers' money and stopped wasting so much of it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,17,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-08-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:39):  I rise to indicate my support for the second reading of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, but I reserve my position in relation to the third reading. I am open minded when it comes to the amendments that will be moved by the coalition in relation to this bill. Clearly this bill is necessary, but it is the way that it is implemented that is the key question. I think it is important that we reflect very briefly on the history of this legislation.


I voted for the structural separation of Telstra last year. I did so because I supported what many independent commentators said in relation to telecommunications in this nation—that it was held back because of the vertical integration, the virtual monopoly, that Telstra had. It was necessary to structurally separate Telstra. It was a case of trying to unscramble the egg, in a metaphorical sense—very difficult. It was a difficult reform exercise, but it was an exercise that many in the OECD thought was a good thing to do because, in OECD terms, Australia really lagged behind in telecommunications reform. So I supported that structural separation. 


I also supported the government's NBN bill, with significant amendments that the government agreed to that would level the playing field to enable smaller operators to compete fairly in the marketplace for business at the retail level, so there would not be price discrimination. I am grateful for the advice of Associate Professor Frank Zumbo in relation to those amendments about non-price discrimination. I thought there were some elegant ways around the concerns that were expressed by some, to make the NBN legislation fairer, to make it more effective and, above all, to allow more competition in the marketplace, which ultimately is unambiguously good for consumers.


Here we have this legislation about fibre deployment. The issue is:


It is estimated that 150 000 new dwellings and approximately 60 000 other types of premises (commercial, industrial and government) are constructed annually. NBN Co has calculated that 94 per cent of these new premises (or around 197 000) will be within the fibre footprint.


I am quoting directly from the recent report of the Joint Committee on the NBN, a committee that was established as a result of the negotiations I had with the Prime Minister last year in relation to my support for the NBN legislation. The Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network is an important transparency and accountability mechanism for the rollout of Australia's biggest infrastructure project. The committee report indicates:


The cost of installing fibre-ready infrastructure has been estimated at about $800 per lot or building unit. The cost of retrofit of fibre where no passive infrastructure has been supplied is estimated to be approximately $1300 a lot or unit.


The legislation will be reviewed in five years to assess if it is still required. This legislation essentially is saying that NBN Co. will be responsible for fibre installation for all premises in the fibre footprint which are at the development stage. In other words, NBN Co. will be given a virtual monopoly for those greenfield sites. That applies to all broadacre developments, all infill developments where it has fibre that is ready for service and capable of connection and new approved infill developments of 100 or more premises.


Those are the basic criteria, but there have been concerns expressed. In the course of the inquiry, while the majority of contributors agreed with the general premise of the bill, there were a number of commercial fibre providers and industry groups that raised concerns about the bill's potential to do a number of things. Again quoting from the committee report, which I think gives a very fair summary of the evidence, the concerns were that it could:


stifle competition in the Greenfield fibre provider market in the medium to long term;


potentially exclude commercial fibre providers from the market place if developers preferred to wait for NBN Co to lay fibre at no charge; and


limit the telecommunications services available to developments with less than 100 premises within the fibre footprint that are awaiting the NBN rollout.


There was a concern that those smaller providers would be disadvantaged. That itself should not be the only criterion. But, if the consequence of those providers being disadvantaged is that you have less competition and a blowing-out of costs and it puts those smaller providers at an unnecessary competitive disadvantage, then these are matters that we ought to be concerned about. The legislation outlines NBN Co. as a fibre provider of last resort. But the concern is that the way that this is structured means that effectively it will be a provider of first resort. That, to me, may pose a number of issues. A number of concerns have been expressed by the GFOA, Greenfield Fibre Operators in Australia, and I think those concerns have merit. Those concerns included, as I indicated, that NBN Co. is in fact promoting itself as a provider of first choice and not of last resort as is intended in the legislation. In other words, the structure of it, despite what the legislation says, is quite the opposite of what it is meant to be.


Another concern is that the Australian government is ignoring its own competitive neutrality policy for government owned businesses. This policy, it is important to note, dictates that no competitive advantages should be given to government owned businesses over private sector competitors by virtue of their public sector ownership, nor by using their fiscal or legislative powers. All those elements are blended into this.


I have never had an issue with NBN Co. being a government owned enterprise. For such a major piece of infrastructure that has the potential to be a nation-building piece of infrastructure that will improve telecom­munications and include a whole range of benefits that go with that, whether in health, commerce or technological advances, I think it is important that we have it set up as a statutory entity, as a government business enterprise, for when there is market failure. But it is important that it operates fairly.


A concern with this bill that the greenfield operators have indicated is that, if the bill is not amended to provide for protections and to encourage competition in deployment and the operation of fibre networks in green­fields, the competitive neutrality policy of the Commonwealth government will effectively be abandoned. There is a real concern about that. The government has responded to those concerns and it has discussed them comprehensively in the report, but the concerns of greenfield operators have not been addressed in the bill in its current form. I propose to detail and discuss this further. I think it is appropriate that the government be robustly questioned in the committee stage about the whole issue of competitive neutrality.


The greenfield operators association has indicated that two of its members have lodged complaints with the Australian Government Competitive Neutrality Com­plaints Office—it has the acronym AGCNCO; I have no idea how you would pronounce that!—situated within the Productivity Commission. This office is yet to report on the matters raised. That concerns me too because it clearly is a complex issue.


Another issue is: what do you do with services for new developments of fewer than 100 premises? TransACT here in the Australian Capital Territory has expressed some concerns in relation to this. It is concerned that there will be an anti-competitive and unlevel playing field for other infrastructure and service providers. This is what it stated in its submission:


This process has the potential to create a ‘digital divide’ between developments with less than 100 premises and those with more than 100 premises, both during and after the roll out of the NBN. It also creates an anti-competitive and unlevel playing field for other infrastructure and service providers. It seems that Telstra could determine unilaterally that it will service a development with a fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) or fibre-to-the-building (FTTB) solution, or even a mobile voice and broadband solution, which would prevent other service providers from accessing those networks given they are not regulated. This would further entrench Telstra as the monopoly provider in these markets, while also giving it first mover advantage to acquire the end-users as Telstra Retail customers, pending migration to NBN Co’s fibre network.


The concern raised by TransACT goes beyond complaints; it goes to some broader principles. It goes to the whole reason why we went through the very painful and costly process of structurally separating Telstra with the multibillion dollar deal to induce them to go down this path. It goes to the issue of whether we are replacing one monopoly with another, in the process giving Telstra some in-built advantages. I thought the reason we went down the structural separation path, which I supported, was to free up the telecommunications market to make it more dynamic, competitive, effective and consumer friendly in the sense that with more competition consumers get a better deal, price and product. TransACT is expressing very serious concerns about that. The broader implications of that worry me.


TransACT has suggested that the bill should be amended to:


… include provisions that ensure these developments are serviced by copper from the local telephone exchange wherever reasonably possible. This would ensure the ULLS26—


which I am sure means a lot to the six people listening to this on the parliamentary news network—




Senator Mason:
  That's not true.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It's not true?




Senator Mason:
  Thousands.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Thousands or dozens? If I may continue after that very unhelpful interjection by Senator Mason, the quote continues:


… is available to other service providers during the transitional period, prior to the NBN Co fibre deployment.


I think we should listen to TransACT—the ACT government, in effect—in relation to the fact that we might be entrenching further advantage to Telstra. We might be entrenching a further loss of competition and competitive neutrality with this. That concerns me.


I think it is important that where there is a greenfield site it be fibre ready. But it ought to be fibre ready so that you do not have a situation where existing operators—the small end of town, if you like—are being squeezed out by both Telstra, for some of those developments of 100 premises or fewer, and NBN Co.


I think it is worth indicating that the Housing Industry Association has advised that developers reported a cost of installing fibre to the premises in the range of $2,500 to $3,500 per premise. With additional installation costs, taxes, charges and developer margins, the cost will be up in the order of $5,000. The HIA stated:


Based on the numbers provided to HIA, the average cost to the developer per block for FTTP is in the range of $2500 ‐ $3500. 


The submission goes on to say that, when combined with additional costs, it is about $5,000. I think there are concerns about the robustness of the costings that have been put out by NBN Co. That needs to be tested. I do support the concept of a national broadband network, but it must be implemented in a way that gives the best value to taxpayers of the use of our funds, of all Australian taxpayers' funds. It must be set up in a way that genuinely enhances competition. It must be established in a way that gives better service than what we have had in the past. It must be set up in a way that ensures that we do not replace one monopoly, Telstra—which constrained telecommunications in this country—with another, NBN Co. 


Therefore, whilst I support the principle of this bill and I support the second reading of this bill, I will very closely look at the amendments being proposed, particularly by the coalition, to see if they will improve it. If the coalition's amendments will stymie the effective and efficient rollout of the NBN then of course I am not likely to support those amendments. But if those amendments will genuinely enhance competition, give a level playing field for the small business sector and ensure the principles of competitive neutrality, then those amendments will have my support. 


I hope that the minister, Senator Conroy, who has a real passion for the NBN, who has driven the reform on this, will note that my questions in the committee stage come from a genuine basis of wanting this to work in the most effective, efficient way possible to ensure that we do not end up with a son of Telstra with the NBN, which I hope will not be the case. That is why we should not dismiss out of hand a number of the amendments proposed by the coalition or at least deal with some of the serious concerns expressed in a sense by those amendments. I support the second reading of the bill. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,17,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-08-24,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:54):  I will leave the technical details of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 to my colleagues that have greater expertise in the area of telecommunications and broad­band. What I want to do is make some brief remarks about the NBN and reflect on the relevance of that project to the government's recent record in adminis­tration—or should I say maladministration. 


The Australian people now know there is one thing worse than the Labor government breaking its election promise. And what is that? It is when the Labor government actually sticks to its election promises, when it keeps its commitments. You see, the achilles heel of this government, of the Australian Labor Party, of the Rudd-Gillard governments, has always been the implementation of their programs. That is their great weakness. It has been from 2007, for nearly four years now, under this government. The list of failures and disappointments has been as long as it has been shameful. Some of it might have even been mildly amusing if not for the fact that billions of taxpayers' dollars have been wasted and, in some cases, lives lost. 


There has been the farce of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, two websites supposedly designed to ease the pressures on the cost of living. The idea was that, if the government kept watching, the price of cabbages and the price of unleaded petrol would come down. Instead they went up. Perhaps they should stop watching. After the fiasco of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, many have said, 'If we can't trust the government to keep the price of onions down, how can we trust them to control the world climate?' or, indeed, as is being debated today, 'How can we trust them with spending tens of billions of taxpayers' dollars on internet infra­structure with the NBN?' And how right they were. After GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch we have had the fiasco of the pink batts, the installation scheme that was compromised by widespread rorting, that put hundreds of thousands of homes at risk, that caused 200 house fires and four deaths and that cost the taxpayer billions of dollars to roll out and then tens of millions of dollars more to clean up—an absolute and utter fiasco. 


Perhaps the most spectacular example of the Rudd-Gillard government's imple­mentation failure has been in my shadow portfolio area of education. First, we had the computers in schools fiasco arising from Kevin 07's election promise to give every one of Australia's one million secondary students their own laptop. How I remember those election ads with the then Leader of the Opposition holding a laptop computer and saying, 'One of these will go to every student. This is the toolbox of the 21st century.' How could we forget it? So what has happened? Nearly four years on we know that the scheme has been under­budgeted by up to 500 per cent, with the Commonwealth forced to kick in extra money and an unwelcome financial burden falling on state governments and also of course on the parents of those children. We also know that the rollout is way behind. At budget estimates we found that only 55 per cent of the just under 800,000 required had been delivered and installed, with a deadline looming on 31 December this year. Lastly, not a single one of those 800,000 computers promised has been connected by the Commonwealth to the fast, up to 100 megabits per second fibre broadband as Kevin 07 promised. 


But if we thought the laptop fiasco was bad, the $16.2 billion Building the Education Revolution program, colloquially known as the Julia Gillard memorial school halls program, has truly won infamy in the annals of government incompetence, waste and mismanagement in this country. The BER has been a fiasco. In the end, the government hand-picked BER Chairman, Brad Orgill, who has been forced to admit something that everyone in the community and the coalition have been saying right from the start—that is, that government school projects, particularly in the three biggest states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have been overcharged, when compared to their Catholic and independent equivalents. Do not believe me; read the Orgill report. That is a disgrace. Those kids who go to government schools—like I did—missed out when compared to kids at Catholic and private schools. That is disgraceful from a party that, allegedly, stands up for the parents of those children.


But, by then, billions of dollars had already been wasted by Labor state governments, confirming the Common­wealth Auditor-General's finding that the Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations did not put in place sufficient oversight mechanisms so they could even assure themselves that they were getting good value for money. I did not find that; the Auditor-General found that. He found that the Labor Party spent $16 billion and that the Commonwealth department of education did not have the oversight mechanisms to ensure that those schools were providing value for money. Is that a disgrace or not? The sum of $16 billion, spent by this lot, and not even appropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure that it was money well spent. They sit there, trumpeting the BER as money well spent. The Auditor-General has said that the money was badly spent.


I am not recalling any of these instances for my own pleasure—on the contrary—although I am getting pleasure. It pains, at least, the opposition—not that lot over there—to see billions of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars flushed down the fiscal toilet. Some of the ideas were not too bad, but they were a shambles in the implementation. The ideas were battered to death by the appalling implementation of the Labor Party.


All these fiascos share commonalities that tell us a lot about the government's approach to policy implementation—a pattern, I fear, that we will see repeated on a much more monumental scale. On what? The rollout of the NBN. If you think the BER has been bad, just wait for the NBN—this shame of incompetence, this total inability to efficiently implement programs, even though some of them may have been worth while. But that is the grand failure of the government, over four years, with respect to not all their ideas but their incapacity to implement. That is their failure.


I think it was Talleyrand who said of the French Bourbon dynasty: 'They forget nothing and they learn nothing.'


The same could be said of this loser government.


Let me just outline to the Senate how it works down there in the PMO. Some barely pubescent senior adviser down there gets a brain snap, the grander the better, because the main point is that it has to make a great, 10-second media grab and be an election slogan. That is the key: it has to make a great, 10-second media grab. It might be 'A computer for every student'—a great grab, a good idea. It might be 'A hall for every school'—a great slogan. Or it could be 'Broadband for every Australian'—another brain snap that sounds great. No thought whatsoever is given to implementation. No-one thinks through all the issues, no-one costs it and no-one does feasibility studies or business cases. Figures are just plucked out of thin air, as they have been for the last four years.


But by then, of course, it is too late. The announcement has been made, the government has been committed and the political effect has already been achieved. Then the hard work starts—or at least it should—but in, many instances, it does not or it cannot. The case in point: the National Broadband Network. Once the poor bureaucrats are sent out, with the unenviable task of giving flesh to government brain snaps, they soon discover that the govern­ment's so-called policymakers have not thought through all the implications. That is the problem. The sums initially budgeted for are grossly underestimated, time lines bear no relation to reality, there is insufficient expertise to take on the task and so its implementation has to be sub­contracted to other parties who take the money and run, unhampered of course by any form of accountability.


What the government lacks in brains—their own—they do not lack in money; the taxpayers. After all, you can always borrow more of that! 'Who cares,' says the Labor Party. Sure, you might saddle future generations with $80 billion of debt, in a little over three years. But, hey, you do not have to worry about repaying it, do you? And, in the meantime, you can grab any brief flash of glory on the off-chance that something actually goes right. Yes, you get a good headline. Call it 'The stupidity premium'—billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to pay for the fact that this government speaks and then commits taxpayers' money before it actually thinks. That is the problem. This has happened time and time again, and each time more and more money is at stake—GroceryWatch, petrol watch, pink batts, computers in schools, the BER and others. And so the list goes on. Now we face a project which dwarfs any previous infrastructure in Australia's history. This is the grand-daddy of them all, and it is in the charge of this lot.




Senator Cameron:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This is a health and safety issue. I think we are going to end up deaf in here! If the senator could just lower it a little bit, we may be able to survive this tirade.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Adams
):  There is no point of order. Senator Mason.




Senator MASON:
  With over $40 billion of taxpayers' money at risk, I will just speak up. What we now face in this country dwarfs any previous infrastructure scheme in Australia's history by far, with tens of billions of dollars to be spent on a technology that is already becoming obsolete, doing something that for most part the private sector is ready to do at no cost to the taxpayer. Again, a brain snap: no planning, no cost-benefit analysis and no business case ever made. If the past is anything to go by, and with this government it sadly is, we can expect a few things. We can expect further budget blowouts. After all, the cost of this promise has already increased tenfold since first announced in 2007. We can also expect further delays. After all, the timeline for the rollout has already stretched from five to 10 years. And we can also expect a substandard product. We can expect the worst.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:19):  This bill we are debating is part of the government's NBN fiasco. Consistent with its modus operandi it seeks to minimise or remove competition and to put the government in control—government knows best irrespective of the additional cost, irrespective of the inefficiency or the waste. This government has a scary disregard for the value of taxpayers' money. Of course we know that. We well remember that, in relation to the NBN, the government did not conduct even as much as a cost-benefit analysis. We well remember that the minister, Senator Conroy, and the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, designed the NBN policy on the back of an envelope in an aircraft. They came up with 'sort of an appropriate figure that we should put to it'. To make it sound scientific they did not want to come up with a round figure so they came up with a figure of $43 billion. There was no science to it. It was back-of-an-envelope type stuff. Of course, ever since, they have been playing catch-up, trying to come up with some sort of justification for that very inappropriate way to deal with taxpayers' dollars.


In this bill the government equally has made no attempt whatsoever to maximise value for money with the arrangements that it is proposing to put in place to bring fibre to greenfield sites. The coalition supports the principle of encouraging fibre to greenfield sites, of course. I am referring here to the dissenting report that was put forward in June by the member for Wentworth, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, as part of the advisory report on the Telecommunications Legisla­tion Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, where he noted:


While it costs more to install fibre than copper in a new development, the incremental cost is much less than the cost of installing fibre in brownfields sites. The Government’s stated policy is that in developments of 100 homes or less Telstra will install copper. The Coalition members believe this approach risks wasteful duplication with copper presumably being overbuilt within a few years if it is within the fibre footprint. On any view connecting greenfields developments to fibre must be a key priority given the cost advantage over brownbuild fibre overbuilds referred to above.


We agree with the principle of encouraging fibre onto greenfield sites. However, it is important to do it right, and that is where this government has significant difficulties—it does not think things through. It takes a very ideological approach to government and has a complete disregard for the value of taxpayers' dollars. It does not come to this with a view to making sure that we stretch the value of the dollar as far as possible and that we maximise the efficiency, the impact and, ultimately, the affordability for con­sumers. That is not the approach of this government. This is a government which is focused on putting government at the centre of all things, irrespective of whether that is the appropriate way to go. We are really concerned that this bill would further destroy broadband competition, because it would make it preferential to use the NBN. It would make it artificially cheaper for developers to use the NBN, rather than existing fibre installers, to lay fibre on greenfield estates. It would give NBN a competitive advantage in the marketplace, yet again, when there is no proper justification for doing so.


Labor is actually doing the opposite of what it promised. Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, said in December last year that he would preserve the role of private fibre installers and operators. Instead he has structured this bill in a way which would further entrench his monopoly, NBN Co., which is very clearly not in the national interest. For the benefit of the Senate and for senators who might be considering their position on this bill, I will quote what Senator Conroy said in December 2010:


It has been a consistent feature of the government’s policy in new developments that there should be room for competing providers. This continues to be the case.


…   …   …


Providers can compete to provide infrastructure in new developments—for example, by offering more tailored solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery.


That is exactly the opposite of what the government is now doing with this legislation. Why is the government so intent, through the power of legislation, to give its monopoly provider every single additional advantage in the marketplace that it possibly can? It is not appropriate, but that is the modus operandi of this government.


This bill and the way the arrangements have been put together demonstrate that the government has not learnt from the mistakes it has made on NBN policy more generally. The NBN is of course a government owned company which was created to build the network. It is going to cost taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It will have monopoly powers. The government thinks that this company should do everything. It should be in control of the whole shooting match—the whole shebang. Of course, that makes it way too expensive. It is bad for competition and it is largely unnecessary, as the private sector can do the job faster, more efficiently and cheaper, as long as the parliament and the government have set the appropriate ground rules for all of that to happen. But, no, this government thinks government has to be in charge of everything. This government does not believe in the benefits of competition. This government does not believe in the benefits, efficiency and value for money that can come from having the private sector compete appropriately with each other—and with NBN Co., for example.


I will go to the dissenting report by the member for Wentworth on behalf of coalition members of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, because it raises a series of very important issues. It makes the point that the arrangements in this legislation are:


… unnecessarily slow and bureaucratic for property developers.


In evidence to the inquiry, the Housing Industry Association made the observation that:


… the legislation needs to make it very clear who is responsible for the delivery and that there are certain obligations on the provider to do that in a very timely way, otherwise it will delay development. I appreciate that there are negotia­tions in the feasibility and planning arrangements, but there needs to be that level of certainty for developers so they know who is going to do it, who is going to pay for it and when it can be done. It should not take more than a couple of phone calls and a meeting to sort out it being put into the critical path of the development, otherwise those projects will be delayed whilst certain things are waiting for a provider to provide that infrastructure.


This bill will put in place significant additional burdens that are completely unnecessary.


The other observation made in this report is that this bill is a 'missed opportunity to impose competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co.' As presently drafted, the bill does not allow us to take advantage of the existence of competitive greenfield opera­tors, which would impose effective compet­itive and cost discipline on NBN Co. I recommend the report to Senator Farrell, the minister at the table, if he is still thinking about how he is going to vote on this legislation. He should have a very close look at the report by the member for Wentworth. It is very good reading; I think he would learn a bit.


It would be way better if we had a regime where developers had a viable option to use competitive greenfield operators to build out fibre networks in their developments, because that would mean they could build the network more cheaply, quickly and conveniently. That would:


… produce a more efficient outcome if it meant that infrastructure in new developments were built at lower cost than if it were done by NBN Co under a monopoly.


It is very simple. If NBN Co. can provide the service at the lowest cost then clearly it should be providing the service. But the market should be free to test whether there is a cheaper, quicker, more efficient way to do it. Why does the government not want us to have the cheapest, most efficient way of bringing fibre to greenfield developments? Why does it want to inflate the cost? Why does it want that additional cost to be passed through the whole economy? This, of course, is on top of the carbon tax and all the other taxes. This is a government that does not mind imposing additional cost-of-living pressures on people across Australia. The approach of this government, whether with NBN Co. or with anything else they touch and stuff up, is to spend too much, to borrow—




Senator Williams:
  It is waste.




Senator CORMANN:
  And it is waste, as Senator Williams just pointed out—spending too much, waste, borrowing money. And then of course there is taxing: introducing one new multibillion ad hoc new tax after another. That is because we have this waste, because we have inflated costs, because this government wants to put government in charge of everything and because the government does not believe in the benefits of competition and because the government does not want these sorts of services to be provided at the most affordable cost.


It would be very simple to fix. All the government needs to do is go back to the policy statement the minister made back in December 2010: that he is happy to have competition. Competition is good. Compet­ition keeps providers honest. If they know they are going to face competition they know they have to be as good as they can be. NBN Co. would know that it has to perform, because if it does not perform there is going to be a private provider that might be able to do it quicker, faster and with better service. If there is that threat, it might keep NBN Co. on its toes. This government is obviously worried that NBN Co. will not be competitive. This government is worried that NBN Co. will not be able to provide value for money. So what does this government do? It puts a fence around NBN Co. It says, 'No, we don't want pesky private providers to be out there showing us up.' 


If we allowed competition, people might actually realise that this white elephant we have set up is not delivering value for taxpayers' dollars. People would realise that it is just another example of waste of taxpayers' dollars and they would be even more upset about all these new taxes they face as a result of this government's persistent incompetence.


As the member for Wentworth, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, very astutely observed, this bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure, and on this point I quote him:


The regime established by the Bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. Today, as is clear from evidence provided by GFOA there is a nascent but increasingly active market in which CGOs compete to secure contracts from developers to build out fibre networks in their developments. In some cases, the CGO builds the network and then also operates as a retail service provider, providing services over the network to residents in the development.


That is a very good thing. He goes on:


The regime established by the Bill damages competition for several reasons. First, by exposing CGOs to competition from a government funded operator which is prepared to install fibre at zero cost to a developer (once the developer has incurred the expense of building trenches and other ‘fibre ready facilities’), the regime will effectively make it impossible for such CGOs to compete.


CGOs will be at a fundamental cost disadvantage because NBN Co is prepared to install fibre at zero cost, incurring a loss on the installation which it presumably hopes to recoup over time from service revenues.


This is typical monopoly-type behaviour. So you have a company, like NBN Co., which is getting not only the advantage of a 100 per cent taxpayer investment but also the advantage of the government muscle and the legislative muscle protecting its market position. Then, once everybody is sucked in, once everybody is locked in to this arrangement, nobody is going to be in a position to keep the company on its toes to provide the most affordable price and the most competitive service.


That is what this is all about. This is about locking in NBN Co. as the only viable provider, courtesy of significant taxpayer subsidies—multibillion-dollar taxpayer subsidies—and courtesy of protecting its position in the marketplace through legisla­tion like this. Why is that in the national interest? It is a question Senator Mason asked earlier in relation to the carbon tax. Why is that in the national interest? And, I might say, that was a very eloquent contribution in the context of this debate.


With so much of what this government does, there is a real question mark as to why they are doing it, as to why it would be in the national interest to force people to pay more for the services that are going to be provided through initiatives like NBN Co. They would have to pay if the private sector and the competitive market out there were allowed to do its job. Through competition, within the context of an appropriate framework, you do get better value for money—better value for taxpayers' money and better value for the private money people have to pay for services they might choose to access, or might not choose to access. If there is no provider out there that can provide a service at a price people are prepared to pay, maybe there is not sufficient demand to justify the expense in the first place.


The coalition, as constructive as we are, is proposing some amendments to make sure that the current flaws in this bill are addressed. Hopefully the government will see fit to support those amendments. Senator Birmingham, on behalf of the coalition, will be moving amendments to remove the disincentives for developers to use CGOs to install fibre infrastructure. The reason we want to do this is that we want to give developers an incentive to use competitive greenfields operators in the knowledge that, if they pay a CGO on a per connection basis, they will be able to recoup that cost by selling the connection to NBN Co. We want to ensure that developers have additional choices beyond the government's default option so that when they build a new development they will install fibre-ready facilities but there will be no live network installed. We do not want people to be locked into just one option. We want there to be a series of options. 


This will impose a cost discipline on NBN Co. because it will require them to purchase connections at a reasonable price, which will be set at a price no greater than NBN Co.'s own average cost of installing a connection. This will mean that, if there are competitors that can build connections at a lower charge than NBN Co., there will be a cost saving to NBN Co. and ultimately to the taxpayer. Surely that would be a good thing. I am hopeful that Senator Farrell will make it his business to recommend to the government that they seriously consider this amendment.


There will be a second coalition amendment to this bill which will seek to address the damaging effects on competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. 


The overall point is that the government has not learned from its failure around the NBN. It is wasting a lot of money. Because it wastes so much money, it has to borrow more and tax more. It is not good for Australia. It is high time that this government started to learn the value of taxpayers' money and stopped wasting so much of it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-08-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:39):  I rise to indicate my support for the second reading of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, but I reserve my position in relation to the third reading. I am open minded when it comes to the amendments that will be moved by the coalition in relation to this bill. Clearly this bill is necessary, but it is the way that it is implemented that is the key question. I think it is important that we reflect very briefly on the history of this legislation.


I voted for the structural separation of Telstra last year. I did so because I supported what many independent commentators said in relation to telecommunications in this nation—that it was held back because of the vertical integration, the virtual monopoly, that Telstra had. It was necessary to structurally separate Telstra. It was a case of trying to unscramble the egg, in a metaphorical sense—very difficult. It was a difficult reform exercise, but it was an exercise that many in the OECD thought was a good thing to do because, in OECD terms, Australia really lagged behind in telecommunications reform. So I supported that structural separation. 


I also supported the government's NBN bill, with significant amendments that the government agreed to that would level the playing field to enable smaller operators to compete fairly in the marketplace for business at the retail level, so there would not be price discrimination. I am grateful for the advice of Associate Professor Frank Zumbo in relation to those amendments about non-price discrimination. I thought there were some elegant ways around the concerns that were expressed by some, to make the NBN legislation fairer, to make it more effective and, above all, to allow more competition in the marketplace, which ultimately is unambiguously good for consumers.


Here we have this legislation about fibre deployment. The issue is:


It is estimated that 150 000 new dwellings and approximately 60 000 other types of premises (commercial, industrial and government) are constructed annually. NBN Co has calculated that 94 per cent of these new premises (or around 197 000) will be within the fibre footprint.


I am quoting directly from the recent report of the Joint Committee on the NBN, a committee that was established as a result of the negotiations I had with the Prime Minister last year in relation to my support for the NBN legislation. The Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network is an important transparency and accountability mechanism for the rollout of Australia's biggest infrastructure project. The committee report indicates:


The cost of installing fibre-ready infrastructure has been estimated at about $800 per lot or building unit. The cost of retrofit of fibre where no passive infrastructure has been supplied is estimated to be approximately $1300 a lot or unit.


The legislation will be reviewed in five years to assess if it is still required. This legislation essentially is saying that NBN Co. will be responsible for fibre installation for all premises in the fibre footprint which are at the development stage. In other words, NBN Co. will be given a virtual monopoly for those greenfield sites. That applies to all broadacre developments, all infill developments where it has fibre that is ready for service and capable of connection and new approved infill developments of 100 or more premises.


Those are the basic criteria, but there have been concerns expressed. In the course of the inquiry, while the majority of contributors agreed with the general premise of the bill, there were a number of commercial fibre providers and industry groups that raised concerns about the bill's potential to do a number of things. Again quoting from the committee report, which I think gives a very fair summary of the evidence, the concerns were that it could:


stifle competition in the Greenfield fibre provider market in the medium to long term;


potentially exclude commercial fibre providers from the market place if developers preferred to wait for NBN Co to lay fibre at no charge; and


limit the telecommunications services available to developments with less than 100 premises within the fibre footprint that are awaiting the NBN rollout.


There was a concern that those smaller providers would be disadvantaged. That itself should not be the only criterion. But, if the consequence of those providers being disadvantaged is that you have less competition and a blowing-out of costs and it puts those smaller providers at an unnecessary competitive disadvantage, then these are matters that we ought to be concerned about. The legislation outlines NBN Co. as a fibre provider of last resort. But the concern is that the way that this is structured means that effectively it will be a provider of first resort. That, to me, may pose a number of issues. A number of concerns have been expressed by the GFOA, Greenfield Fibre Operators in Australia, and I think those concerns have merit. Those concerns included, as I indicated, that NBN Co. is in fact promoting itself as a provider of first choice and not of last resort as is intended in the legislation. In other words, the structure of it, despite what the legislation says, is quite the opposite of what it is meant to be.


Another concern is that the Australian government is ignoring its own competitive neutrality policy for government owned businesses. This policy, it is important to note, dictates that no competitive advantages should be given to government owned businesses over private sector competitors by virtue of their public sector ownership, nor by using their fiscal or legislative powers. All those elements are blended into this.


I have never had an issue with NBN Co. being a government owned enterprise. For such a major piece of infrastructure that has the potential to be a nation-building piece of infrastructure that will improve telecom­munications and include a whole range of benefits that go with that, whether in health, commerce or technological advances, I think it is important that we have it set up as a statutory entity, as a government business enterprise, for when there is market failure. But it is important that it operates fairly.


A concern with this bill that the greenfield operators have indicated is that, if the bill is not amended to provide for protections and to encourage competition in deployment and the operation of fibre networks in green­fields, the competitive neutrality policy of the Commonwealth government will effectively be abandoned. There is a real concern about that. The government has responded to those concerns and it has discussed them comprehensively in the report, but the concerns of greenfield operators have not been addressed in the bill in its current form. I propose to detail and discuss this further. I think it is appropriate that the government be robustly questioned in the committee stage about the whole issue of competitive neutrality.


The greenfield operators association has indicated that two of its members have lodged complaints with the Australian Government Competitive Neutrality Com­plaints Office—it has the acronym AGCNCO; I have no idea how you would pronounce that!—situated within the Productivity Commission. This office is yet to report on the matters raised. That concerns me too because it clearly is a complex issue.


Another issue is: what do you do with services for new developments of fewer than 100 premises? TransACT here in the Australian Capital Territory has expressed some concerns in relation to this. It is concerned that there will be an anti-competitive and unlevel playing field for other infrastructure and service providers. This is what it stated in its submission:


This process has the potential to create a ‘digital divide’ between developments with less than 100 premises and those with more than 100 premises, both during and after the roll out of the NBN. It also creates an anti-competitive and unlevel playing field for other infrastructure and service providers. It seems that Telstra could determine unilaterally that it will service a development with a fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) or fibre-to-the-building (FTTB) solution, or even a mobile voice and broadband solution, which would prevent other service providers from accessing those networks given they are not regulated. This would further entrench Telstra as the monopoly provider in these markets, while also giving it first mover advantage to acquire the end-users as Telstra Retail customers, pending migration to NBN Co’s fibre network.


The concern raised by TransACT goes beyond complaints; it goes to some broader principles. It goes to the whole reason why we went through the very painful and costly process of structurally separating Telstra with the multibillion dollar deal to induce them to go down this path. It goes to the issue of whether we are replacing one monopoly with another, in the process giving Telstra some in-built advantages. I thought the reason we went down the structural separation path, which I supported, was to free up the telecommunications market to make it more dynamic, competitive, effective and consumer friendly in the sense that with more competition consumers get a better deal, price and product. TransACT is expressing very serious concerns about that. The broader implications of that worry me.


TransACT has suggested that the bill should be amended to:


… include provisions that ensure these developments are serviced by copper from the local telephone exchange wherever reasonably possible. This would ensure the ULLS26—


which I am sure means a lot to the six people listening to this on the parliamentary news network—




Senator Mason:
  That's not true.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It's not true?




Senator Mason:
  Thousands.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Thousands or dozens? If I may continue after that very unhelpful interjection by Senator Mason, the quote continues:


… is available to other service providers during the transitional period, prior to the NBN Co fibre deployment.


I think we should listen to TransACT—the ACT government, in effect—in relation to the fact that we might be entrenching further advantage to Telstra. We might be entrenching a further loss of competition and competitive neutrality with this. That concerns me.


I think it is important that where there is a greenfield site it be fibre ready. But it ought to be fibre ready so that you do not have a situation where existing operators—the small end of town, if you like—are being squeezed out by both Telstra, for some of those developments of 100 premises or fewer, and NBN Co.


I think it is worth indicating that the Housing Industry Association has advised that developers reported a cost of installing fibre to the premises in the range of $2,500 to $3,500 per premise. With additional installation costs, taxes, charges and developer margins, the cost will be up in the order of $5,000. The HIA stated:


Based on the numbers provided to HIA, the average cost to the developer per block for FTTP is in the range of $2500 ‐ $3500. 


The submission goes on to say that, when combined with additional costs, it is about $5,000. I think there are concerns about the robustness of the costings that have been put out by NBN Co. That needs to be tested. I do support the concept of a national broadband network, but it must be implemented in a way that gives the best value to taxpayers of the use of our funds, of all Australian taxpayers' funds. It must be set up in a way that genuinely enhances competition. It must be established in a way that gives better service than what we have had in the past. It must be set up in a way that ensures that we do not replace one monopoly, Telstra—which constrained telecommunications in this country—with another, NBN Co. 


Therefore, whilst I support the principle of this bill and I support the second reading of this bill, I will very closely look at the amendments being proposed, particularly by the coalition, to see if they will improve it. If the coalition's amendments will stymie the effective and efficient rollout of the NBN then of course I am not likely to support those amendments. But if those amendments will genuinely enhance competition, give a level playing field for the small business sector and ensure the principles of competitive neutrality, then those amendments will have my support. 


I hope that the minister, Senator Conroy, who has a real passion for the NBN, who has driven the reform on this, will note that my questions in the committee stage come from a genuine basis of wanting this to work in the most effective, efficient way possible to ensure that we do not end up with a son of Telstra with the NBN, which I hope will not be the case. That is why we should not dismiss out of hand a number of the amendments proposed by the coalition or at least deal with some of the serious concerns expressed in a sense by those amendments. I support the second reading of the bill.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-08-24,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:54):  I will leave the technical details of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 to my colleagues that have greater expertise in the area of telecommunications and broad­band. What I want to do is make some brief remarks about the NBN and reflect on the relevance of that project to the government's recent record in adminis­tration—or should I say maladministration. 


The Australian people now know there is one thing worse than the Labor government breaking its election promise. And what is that? It is when the Labor government actually sticks to its election promises, when it keeps its commitments. You see, the achilles heel of this government, of the Australian Labor Party, of the Rudd-Gillard governments, has always been the implementation of their programs. That is their great weakness. It has been from 2007, for nearly four years now, under this government. The list of failures and disappointments has been as long as it has been shameful. Some of it might have even been mildly amusing if not for the fact that billions of taxpayers' dollars have been wasted and, in some cases, lives lost. 


There has been the farce of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, two websites supposedly designed to ease the pressures on the cost of living. The idea was that, if the government kept watching, the price of cabbages and the price of unleaded petrol would come down. Instead they went up. Perhaps they should stop watching. After the fiasco of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, many have said, 'If we can't trust the government to keep the price of onions down, how can we trust them to control the world climate?' or, indeed, as is being debated today, 'How can we trust them with spending tens of billions of taxpayers' dollars on internet infra­structure with the NBN?' And how right they were. After GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch we have had the fiasco of the pink batts, the installation scheme that was compromised by widespread rorting, that put hundreds of thousands of homes at risk, that caused 200 house fires and four deaths and that cost the taxpayer billions of dollars to roll out and then tens of millions of dollars more to clean up—an absolute and utter fiasco. 


Perhaps the most spectacular example of the Rudd-Gillard government's imple­mentation failure has been in my shadow portfolio area of education. First, we had the computers in schools fiasco arising from Kevin 07's election promise to give every one of Australia's one million secondary students their own laptop. How I remember those election ads with the then Leader of the Opposition holding a laptop computer and saying, 'One of these will go to every student. This is the toolbox of the 21st century.' How could we forget it? So what has happened? Nearly four years on we know that the scheme has been under­budgeted by up to 500 per cent, with the Commonwealth forced to kick in extra money and an unwelcome financial burden falling on state governments and also of course on the parents of those children. We also know that the rollout is way behind. At budget estimates we found that only 55 per cent of the just under 800,000 required had been delivered and installed, with a deadline looming on 31 December this year. Lastly, not a single one of those 800,000 computers promised has been connected by the Commonwealth to the fast, up to 100 megabits per second fibre broadband as Kevin 07 promised. 


But if we thought the laptop fiasco was bad, the $16.2 billion Building the Education Revolution program, colloquially known as the Julia Gillard memorial school halls program, has truly won infamy in the annals of government incompetence, waste and mismanagement in this country. The BER has been a fiasco. In the end, the government hand-picked BER Chairman, Brad Orgill, who has been forced to admit something that everyone in the community and the coalition have been saying right from the start—that is, that government school projects, particularly in the three biggest states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have been overcharged, when compared to their Catholic and independent equivalents. Do not believe me; read the Orgill report. That is a disgrace. Those kids who go to government schools—like I did—missed out when compared to kids at Catholic and private schools. That is disgraceful from a party that, allegedly, stands up for the parents of those children.


But, by then, billions of dollars had already been wasted by Labor state governments, confirming the Common­wealth Auditor-General's finding that the Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations did not put in place sufficient oversight mechanisms so they could even assure themselves that they were getting good value for money. I did not find that; the Auditor-General found that. He found that the Labor Party spent $16 billion and that the Commonwealth department of education did not have the oversight mechanisms to ensure that those schools were providing value for money. Is that a disgrace or not? The sum of $16 billion, spent by this lot, and not even appropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure that it was money well spent. They sit there, trumpeting the BER as money well spent. The Auditor-General has said that the money was badly spent.


I am not recalling any of these instances for my own pleasure—on the contrary—although I am getting pleasure. It pains, at least, the opposition—not that lot over there—to see billions of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars flushed down the fiscal toilet. Some of the ideas were not too bad, but they were a shambles in the implementation. The ideas were battered to death by the appalling implementation of the Labor Party.


All these fiascos share commonalities that tell us a lot about the government's approach to policy implementation—a pattern, I fear, that we will see repeated on a much more monumental scale. On what? The rollout of the NBN. If you think the BER has been bad, just wait for the NBN—this shame of incompetence, this total inability to efficiently implement programs, even though some of them may have been worth while. But that is the grand failure of the government, over four years, with respect to not all their ideas but their incapacity to implement. That is their failure.


I think it was Talleyrand who said of the French Bourbon dynasty: 'They forget nothing and they learn nothing.'


The same could be said of this loser government.


Let me just outline to the Senate how it works down there in the PMO. Some barely pubescent senior adviser down there gets a brain snap, the grander the better, because the main point is that it has to make a great, 10-second media grab and be an election slogan. That is the key: it has to make a great, 10-second media grab. It might be 'A computer for every student'—a great grab, a good idea. It might be 'A hall for every school'—a great slogan. Or it could be 'Broadband for every Australian'—another brain snap that sounds great. No thought whatsoever is given to implementation. No-one thinks through all the issues, no-one costs it and no-one does feasibility studies or business cases. Figures are just plucked out of thin air, as they have been for the last four years.


But by then, of course, it is too late. The announcement has been made, the government has been committed and the political effect has already been achieved. Then the hard work starts—or at least it should—but in, many instances, it does not or it cannot. The case in point: the National Broadband Network. Once the poor bureaucrats are sent out, with the unenviable task of giving flesh to government brain snaps, they soon discover that the govern­ment's so-called policymakers have not thought through all the implications. That is the problem. The sums initially budgeted for are grossly underestimated, time lines bear no relation to reality, there is insufficient expertise to take on the task and so its implementation has to be sub­contracted to other parties who take the money and run, unhampered of course by any form of accountability.


What the government lacks in brains—their own—they do not lack in money; the taxpayers. After all, you can always borrow more of that! 'Who cares,' says the Labor Party. Sure, you might saddle future generations with $80 billion of debt, in a little over three years. But, hey, you do not have to worry about repaying it, do you? And, in the meantime, you can grab any brief flash of glory on the off-chance that something actually goes right. Yes, you get a good headline. Call it 'The stupidity premium'—billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to pay for the fact that this government speaks and then commits taxpayers' money before it actually thinks. That is the problem. This has happened time and time again, and each time more and more money is at stake—GroceryWatch, petrol watch, pink batts, computers in schools, the BER and others. And so the list goes on. Now we face a project which dwarfs any previous infrastructure in Australia's history. This is the grand-daddy of them all, and it is in the charge of this lot.




Senator Cameron:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This is a health and safety issue. I think we are going to end up deaf in here! If the senator could just lower it a little bit, we may be able to survive this tirade.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Adams
):  There is no point of order. Senator Mason.




Senator MASON:
  With over $40 billion of taxpayers' money at risk, I will just speak up. What we now face in this country dwarfs any previous infrastructure scheme in Australia's history by far, with tens of billions of dollars to be spent on a technology that is already becoming obsolete, doing something that for most part the private sector is ready to do at no cost to the taxpayer. Again, a brain snap: no planning, no cost-benefit analysis and no business case ever made. If the past is anything to go by, and with this government it sadly is, we can expect a few things. We can expect further budget blowouts. After all, the cost of this promise has already increased tenfold since first announced in 2007. We can also expect further delays. After all, the timeline for the rollout has already stretched from five to 10 years. And we can also expect a substandard product. We can expect the worst. That way at least you will never be disappointed by this Labor government.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2011-08-24,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (17:33):  I would like to thank all senators who have spoken today on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. Regrettably, many of the opposition's comments—those of Senator Birmingham, Senator Joyce, Senator Macdonald and Senator Bernardi, which at times was like listening to people baying at the moon—have focused on its opposition to the NBN.




Senator Birmingham:
  Howl!




Senator CONROY:
  Exactly. I am not sure Hansard could pick up the baying from the other side just then, but they should have. Their comments have focused on their opposition to the NBN as a matter of policy, not the bill before us. In the interests of time I will not dwell on this but will focus on the bill. I think Senator Birmingham was the only one who even got close to speaking on the bill, so he does deserve some credit for at least attempting to pretend he is opposed to the bill. 


The government does not agree that, in the absence of public sector investment, Australia will have the broadband infra­structure available to improve our productivity, global competitiveness and social wellbeing. This is demonstrated by the private sector's failure to provide this infrastructure even with the offer of govern­ment funding under the original NBN request for tender process. Many of the problems people have with broadband access relate to a copper network that is inadequate and failing, wireless that is inadequate to the demands being placed on it and fibre provision that is extremely limited and patchy at best.


Contrary to the calls of opposition senators, a cost-benefit analysis is not required. The project has already been subject to extensive examination, including the implementation study by McKinsey-KPMG and Greenhill Caliburn's review of NBN Co.'s corporate plan. The project is subject to extensive ongoing scrutiny including by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, as Senator Ludlam noted. The government is committed to getting on with the project.


Senator Birmingham, what do you think the Productivity Commission could add that you could not? Personally, I think you are more than adequate to ask questions regularly of the NBN. You argue that your attempts are inferior to those of the Productivity Commission, but I am going to disagree with you and stand up for you on this point. It is in this context that I welcome Senator Ludlam's words of support for the NBN generally. He recognises the real potential of the NBN to advance Australia and prepare it for the digital economy of the future. Services on the NBN will be affordable. This is already being demon­strated by proposed pricing packages being launched by retail service providers. NBN Co.'s discussion paper on its proposed special access undertaking does not contradict this. NBN Co.'s SAU will set out NBN Co.'s regulatory undertakings for the supply of services to provide certainty and transparency, but it is not a forecast for actual prices. NBN Co. has also said it will be adhering to the pricing set out in its corporate plan. 


Senator Joyce again raised the idea of 'unit pricing', as he calls it, and through it the government's commitment to uniform pricing. While this is not very relevant to the bill at hand, I thank him for giving me the opportunity to yet again reiterate the government's rock-solid commitment on uniform national wholesale pricing—something he will not get under his own plan, something he will not get under the plan of Malcolm Turnbull, something that Senator Joyce will not be able to deliver for regional and rural Australians if he votes for the plan of Mr Turnbull. This is required under the statement of expectations the government issued to NBN Co. last December. It is embedded in NBN Co.'s network design and operation.


NBN Co. will be able to use revenue from lower cost, higher value markets, such as metropolitan areas, to deliver equitable pricing outcomes for users in regional, rural and remote communities. As Senator Joyce knows, this is just what the Queensland Nationals demanded at their state conference in 2005 when they passed a resolution calling for uniform national wholesale pricing in:


… all new telecommunications and satellite Internet connections to ensure all Australians are charged the same basic price for maintenance and new connections.


Senator Humphries asked about aerial cabling. NBN Co.'s corporate plan assumes that the majority of cabling will be underground—some 75 per cent. This will be supported by definitive agreements between NBN Co. and Telstra. Where existing cabling is underground, and in new developments, cabling should remain underground. Any aerial cabling would be kept to a minimum and would be in areas where there is existing overhead infra­structure, such as powerlines. It is not, however, a cost-cutting measure. It is simply the most efficient and feasible solution in some limited situations. These principles would apply in the ACT as they would apply anywhere else. As Senator Humphries himself mentioned, there is already overhead cabling in parts of the ACT, often in backyards rather than in the street.


Coalition senators have queried the government's commitment to competition in the provision of new infrastructure in new developments. The government is open to competition and innovation in the provision of such infrastructure. Senator Macdonald read several quotes to this effect. However, the government has also consistently said that, if alternative providers want to compete with NBN Co., they are welcome to do so. But it is on the understanding that they have the resources and ability to do so.


Mention has been made of competing fibre providers. There are a small number of alternative providers—around 10 of them. They have some technical expertise and experience. Senator Humphries mentioned TransACT, which is one of the larger ones. But, as the opposition pointed out in its dissenting report on the bill, it is a nascent sector—that is, it is in its earliest stages. These are relatively small-scale operations. Generally they have targeted developments which have been the most commercially attractive. They have been able to pick and choose the developments which they service. Their own evidence to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network indicates that they are not well placed to service Australia as a whole. Around 200,000 new premises are constructed each year. These providers do not have the scale to deal with this. It needs a national operation. Even if they could deal with this scale, to do so they would require extensive subsidies both for fibre and for backhaul. The reality is that they want to pick the lucrative markets while leaving the NBN Co. the hard ones and national coverage—or they want to be paid handsomely to do otherwise.


The government has established NBN Co. to provide high-speed broadband all across Australia for all Australians, charging uniform national wholesale prices, and the government is providing equity funding to deliver this outcome. This includes allowing NBN Co., in new developments where required, to spread its costs nationally and recover them over time. If other providers wish to compete with NBN Co., they are free to do so, but they are to do so on their own terms.


I turn now to the matter in hand. This bill will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to provide a legislative framework for the installation of fibre-ready telecom­munications infrastructure in new develop­ments. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that new developments are ready for fibre based technology. It is part of the govern­ment's strategy to build a superfast broadband network which will underpin our future productivity and competitiveness and meet our citizens' needs.


There is a new senator in the chamber tonight, Senator Madigan, and I welcome his participation and his listening in on this debate. It has been an extensive debate. I am sure you have seen much canvassed in it. But what I would really want to ensure you consider before you decide how to vote on this is that the NBN is being rolled out today. It is being rolled out very shortly in Bacchus Marsh, an area not far from where you originally came from in the good state of Victoria. Those are the fibre-to-the-home developments. We are also going to be rolling out, as you might have seen in a recent announcement from the government, the fixed wireless network. That will also go to regional areas around Ballarat. Among all the excitement of coming here, I am sure you have not had a chance to follow everything I have said—and congratulations and good sense there—but we have also started delivering the interim satellite, which covers all of Victoria, including areas in and around Ballarat. So the NBN Co. is delivering fibre, wireless and satellite to everybody across Australia. In its early stages, it is going to be in all three forms in and around Ballarat very soon. 


The key thing to understand is that the uniform national price is enabled by charging more in metropolitan areas to cross-subsidise the bush. We are unashamed about this. We have said that we believe it is what should be done and that it will deliver equal opportunity for everybody, no matter whether they live in Ballarat or any of the areas around country and regional Victoria. Our opposition have said that they support vouchers. People in and around Ballarat, in and around regional Victoria—Mr Turnbull's plan is to give them a voucher. He has recently stated publicly that he does not believe in cross-subsidies. He does not believe that metropolitan areas should pay more to subsidise people in regional and rural Australia. Here is your opportunity today, on behalf of regional and rural Victorians, to let Malcolm Turnbull know exactly what you think. Should regional and rural Victorians be, as Mr Turnbull wants, receiving a voucher for telecommunication services or should they get a cross-subsidised price equal to what people in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane pay? Those are the very simple economics of the NBN.


Very shortly, you will see some amendments being moved which are all about destroying the economics of the NBN—cherry-pick, pick the rich areas, go to the wealthy areas, destroy the economics of the NBN and the NBN will fall over. That is what is being proposed—




Senator Xenophon:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: the minister—




Senator Conroy:
  Are you feeling unloved because I have not mentioned you yet, Senator Xenophon?




Senator Xenophon:
  I can do without Senator Conroy's love any day. If I do this, I am picked up on it. The minister is referring to Senator Madigan personally. Any references should be through the chair. That is my understanding and that is my point of order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Stephens
):  Minister, please be guided by the standing orders.




Senator CONROY:
  I apologise to Senator Xenophon that I have not spoken directly to him yet, but I will get around to it. So, there is a very clear choice before the chamber—do you support the principle that everyone gets an equal chance, everyone gets an equal price, everyone gets an equal service, based on the three technologies? That is what the NBN delivers. Or do you want to try to sabotage it? Those on the other side will be moving amendments that are all about destroying the economics of providing that cross-subsidy. This is essentially about the cherry-picking debate. Public ownership and the capacity to provide equal services across the state of Victoria are at the heart of today's votes and today's amendments.


The purpose of the bill, as I have said, is to ensure that new developments are ready for fibre-based technology. If fibre-ready infrastructure is not installed in new developments, it will have to be fitted later at greater cost. It will cost more for every house and business than doing it up-front. Retrofitting would also be much more destructive. It is simply more sensible to install fibre-ready ducting in a trench that is already open. Fibre can then be installed and the houses occupied, or if that is not possible it can be pulled through later.


Having said that, I stress that this bill is a safety net. Most developers are already installing fibre-ready infrastructure, and we expect that most will continue to do the sensible thing. This is a sensible preparation for fibre and it appears to be generally accepted. It was accepted by the joint committee on the NBN, which recommended that the bill be passed. It also appears to be sensible to those opposite, although they also demand that the bill be amended to tackle issues far beyond the bill's intended purpose. I could say much more but in the interests of bringing the debate to a conclusion I rest there.


Question agreed to.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-24,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (17:47):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (2) to (11) on sheet 7133:

(10)   Schedule 1, item 10, page 8 (line 20), after ""paragraph (1)(b)"", insert ""or subsection (4)"".


(11)   Schedule 1, item 10, page 9 (after line 4), after section 372C, insert:




372CA  Purchase by NBN Co of installed optical networks



      Scope


(1)   This section applies in relation to the project area, or any of the project areas, for a real estate development project:


   (a)   that is compliant with Division 3; and 


   (b)   in which a compliant optical network is installed by a person other than NBN Co.


NBN Co to purchase network if requested


(2)   The person or persons responsible for the real estate development project may apply to NBN Co for NBN Co to purchase the network in accordance with this section.


(3)   An application for the purchase of a network must be made within 3 months after the completion of the network. 


(4)   The person or persons responsible for the real estate development project must provide NBN Co with such information and access as NBN CO requires to satisfy itself that the network is a compliant optical network.


(5)   NBN Co must purchase the network within 30 days after receiving the application. 


Amount of payment


(6)   The amount of the purchase payment must be in accordance with a scale of payments determined by the Minister for this subsection and published in the Gazette.


(7)   The Minister must determine a scale of payments for the purposes of subsection (6) as soon as practicable.


(8)   In determining a scale of payments, the Minister must take into account:


   (a)   the typical costs of providing such networks or elements of such networks, including significant regional variations in costs; and


   (b)   the costs that NBN Co would have incurred had it undertaken to provide such networks itself.


Interpretation


(9)   For this section, a project area of a real estate development project is compliant with Division 3 if:


   (a)   section 372E or 372F applied to installation of a fixed-line facility in the project area; and


   (b)   any fixed-line facilities installed in the project area that were subject to subsection 372E(2) or 372F(2) complied with those subsections.


Note:   These subsections require that the facilities be fibre-ready and that the installation comply with an instrument under subsection 372E(4) or 372F(4), subject to exemptions under section 372K.


(10)   For this section, a compliant optical network of a project area of a real estate development project is a collection of optical fibre lines in the project area, each of which:


   (a)   is wholly or primarily used, or wholly or primarily for use, to supply one or more carriage services to either or both of the following:


      (i)   one or more end-users (whether or not identifiable) in one or more building units;


      (ii)   one or more prospective end-users (whether or not identifiable) in one or more building units; and 


   (b)   is not on the customer side of the boundary of a telecommunications network; and


   (c)   is used, or for use, to supply a carriage service to the public; and


   (d)   for a line being deployed to a building lot—was installed in compliance with the conditions for such lines in an instrument under subsection 372B(4); and


   (e)   for a line being deployed to a building unit—was installed in compliance with the conditions for such lines in an instrument under subsection 372C(4).


As we proceeded to these amendments the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy asked why not move all the amendments together. That would have suited the minister because he wants to bundle all of the arguments against the opposition's amendments together. That was obvious in the pitch that he made to Senator Madigan in particular as he argued vehemently that all of the opposition amendments were about undoing the NBN's business case, that all of the opposition amendments were somehow about ensuring that the best parts of Australia could be cherry-picked, that all of this was purely about destroying the NBN. That is not true, and it is not true for either set of amendments.


It is particularly noteworthy that this first set of coalition amendments, amendments numbered (2) to (11) inclusive, tries to look at the best possible way to actually get the NBN built, or fibre laid, in greenfield sites. These first amendments do not touch on cherry-picking in terms of retail delivery; they do not touch in that sense on the actual retail side of operations. The first set of amendments proposes, along with a number of consequential changes, a new section 372CA that will provide for the purchase of installed optical networks by NBN Co., and would insert that in division 2. This proposed section is intended to enable developers, whose development project has an installed fibre network that is compliant, to have the option of requiring NBN Co. to purchase that network at a reasonable price. The govern­ment's system has been set up to provide for this default arrangement whereby NBN Co. operates as the provider of last resort for fibre in new greenfield developments, but it is a default version that is very encouraging, it is a default provision that is very attractive, because if developers do not go with NBN Co. as the provider of last resort they will have to pay more for the facilities to be provided to the properties they are developing. So NBN Co. will come along and, as it is doing across the country at taxpayers' expense, lay the fibre up and down the ducts and pits that have been installed in new developments, or they can, at their own expense—or of course at the expense passed onto those purchasing properties in the development—pay someone else to lay the fibre up and down the ducts and pits. This first set of opposition amendments seeks to provide a capacity for developers to use existing or new, if they wanted to start up, private competitive greenfields operators—people who install fibre in those greenfields developments—and do so in the knowledge that if they have them lay out the fibre in their communities then they can recoup the cost of that by selling on a per connection basis the service that has been laid out to NBN Co., not an unlimited sale or price but simply selling at an agreed price.


Importantly, in this construction space, it is not the retail space, it seeks to preserve some modicum of competition. The opposition heard consistently during the inquiry into this legislation concerns from many people in the business of laying fibre that the government ran the risk of putting in place a system in which developers had the choice either to pay somebody to lay fibre or wait until NBN Co. does it for free. Guess what most of us do when we are given that choice? We will take the option of getting it for free.


The result is the monopoly that NBN Co. already has over laying fibre on brownfield sites—up and down all of our streets and homes in existing developments—is extended to this greenfields space where there is an already existing market. As the minister acknowledged, people are already laying fibre up and down the streets of new housing developments at the instigation of those developers. There is a market there. This bill, if passed unamended, will change and distort that market in a way where it will become far, far more attractive for developers to simply leave it to the last resort provider, to NBN Co., to come along and do it itself.


So what have we done if we allow that to occur? There are several consequences. We have enhanced the NBN monopoly into these greenfield sites. In doing so, we have put a number of existing businesses out of the business of laying fibre because their business opportunities will have dried up. We will also create the perverse effect whereby the provision of fibre to these new developments will take longer than may otherwise occur. The developers will wait and trigger the last-resort provisions rather than take the opportunity to get the fibre installed into the ducts and pits of these new developments at the first available opportunity.


The coalition's amendments seek to ensure that developers have additional choices beyond the default option that the government has established, which over time would become the only option in many instances. When developers want to build a new development with fibre-ready facilities, they have a choice to go to the market and find complying businesses which will lay a compliant network that can be sold on to the NBN Co., hopefully at costs cheaper than the NBN Co. would be able to deliver it itself. Certainly, it would be at agreed regulated prices to ensure that there is not price gouging in this space, but hopefully to also apply some level of cost discipline upon NBN Co. by requiring it to purchase connections at reasonable prices which will be set at a price no greater than the NBN Co.'s own average cost of installing a connection. What it costs NBN Co. to install a connection is the maximum price that these private operators would be able to operate under. This would mean that if NBN Co.'s competitors can build connections at a lower charge than NBN Co. then there is a cost saving that can hopefully flow through to all.


As I indicated, there is a benefit to end users as well. The likelihood of incoming residents of new developments having active fibre services connected to their premises is increased by pursuing this approach. This approach was canvassed during the inquiry into this legislation. It was canvassed widely with a number of the witnesses who appeared. I highlighted during my contri­bution on the second reading of the bill that the Urban Development Institute of Australia, when asked about the proposed amendments that I have just moved on behalf of the opposition, said that it was a pragmatic suggestion. It said:


... that is a pragmatic suggestion. In relation to the certainty question you asked me before, that is what is confronted by developers—how and when are things actually going to be done? Whatever brings around greater certainty for purchasers of those properties that all the utilities are actually there and are available and can be handed over to them and the greater that certainty is, the better it will be.


This amendment increases the certainty that all of those utilities, all of those services, will be there. In particular, the fibre service will be there for them rather than waiting until a last-resort provision is triggered and NBN Co. eventually gets around to rolling it out up and down their street.


One of the businesses in this sector, OptiComm, when asked about the proposed amendment, told the Senate inquiry that it would provide advantages. OptiComm said:


... there would be some advantages in what you are saying to what is currently proposed. That allows diversity in the greenfield. As I have said, we have been successful. Not only do we offer broadband and voice but we offer a number of other services that some developers find attractive. It would still allow them to do that and allow them to keep that network operating through companies like ourselves or allows them the offer to transfer that ownership to NBN Co. I think that is what you are suggesting. We would never love to build a network and see it go to someone else, but I think the concept is better than where we stand today.


This is one of the existing developers going to greenfields sites, to new developments, laying out networks there and, as part of their business model, selling on a retail product, as well as having to comply with provisions which make that available elsewhere.


The amendments we are considering now do not impact on the retail side of things. They would see Opticom sell that service, that network, to NBN Co. but utilise their expertise, their skills and their capacity for competitive delivery of this fibre and utilise it in a way that will actually allow NBN Co. to hopefully access fibre laid in greenfields developments in the fastest possible way at the lowest possible cost. In relation to these greenfields developments that should surely be exactly what we all want to see.


TransACT, a large provider in the ACT of fibre to greenfields developments, equally indicated their support for this amendment and the approach it takes. They commented that a situation where different parties are responsible for installing a fibre network does not necessarily provide the best outcome. Essentially, TransACT said, 'We believe that where the developer puts pit and pipe into the development creates a situation where we have a tripartite type arrangement. You have the developer putting in pit and pipe. You have a fibre operator coming in subsequent to that. What we typically provide to the developments is a turnkey solution. We deploy the fibre and the pit and the pipe all together to the developer. We believe that having a situation where it is pip and pipe only is not necessarily the best outcome overall.'


So TransACT believe that the best outcome overall is to have the pits and the pipes built by the same person who lays the fibre and to provide a complete solution to developers in greenfields sites. It sounds like a logical approach. They indicated their support for this amendment as a good way of ensuring that you have that complete package provided. You get maximum efficiency from doing so and in this scenario the taxpayer gets maximum efficiency from doing so.


I will shortly move subsequent amendments that do go to the potential for retail service provision by these companies. The amendments look at the opportunities for these companies to maintain existing business models that see them not just build the networks but provide a retail service as well. However, those are separate amend­ments. This amendment is really to do with and focused very much on the actual building of the network. We believe that it provides good strong advantages to the operation of this bill. We believe that, rather than allowing this bill to end up having the effect of destroying many companies that currently roll out fibre in greenfields spaces, this would in fact enhance the opportunity for them to do so and, hopefully, potentially improve the outcomes for the NBN as a result of it.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (18:03):  I want to talk about the matters that Senator Birmingham has raised today in relation to the building of the network. I want to compliment him on this particular policy initiative of his and his desire not to see destroyed the many companies that are having some input into that.


I want to read the following quote:


I trust that the union executive will have the resolve to stare down those associated within the Labor Party who say, 'No, keep it in house. Give it to our mate, Tim Lee, who is the general manager of Fair Work Australia and a known associate of Julia Gillard, who deals with investigations into Fair Work Australia.'


That was a matter that was given today by Michael Smith on 2UE. It was an editorial—




Senator Conroy:
  I rise on a point of order concerning relevance. What does Fair Work Australia have to do with the fibre bill? I ask you to bring the senator to the topic at hand.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore
) (18:04):  We have a tradition of letting the debate run fairly widely in this area. We will continue and I will watch the process.




Senator RONALDSON:
  I am just reading from an editorial on Craig Thomson on Radio 2UE today. In relation to that matter—




Senator Conroy:
  Point of order. Reading out an editorial about Craig Thomson is not relevant even in the broadest of senses to a bill about fibre to the home deployments on greenfields sites. It could not possibly be within a stretch.




Senator Birmingham:
  On the point of order, Senator Conroy has not even heard the quote from the editorial. In fact, Senator Conroy did not even let a word of whatever it is Senator Ronaldson is going to quote from be uttered before he determined in his mind that it was not relevant to the debate. There is absolutely no point of order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Ronaldson, I will let you continue and you can bring it back to make it relevant to the debate.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Thank you, and I will. But I will just repeat the comment: 'Give it to our mate, Tim Lee, who is the general manager of Fair Work Australia and a known associate of Julia Gillard, who deals with investigations in Fair Work Australia.' That was a matter raised by Michael Smith today. He said: 'I trust that the union executive will have the resolve to stare down those associated within the Labor Party who say, 'No, keep it in house.'




Senator Conroy:
  Point of order concerning relevance. Can Michael Smith on 2UE talking about Fair Work Australia have anything to do with this bill. I ask you to bring the senator back to debating the bill. It will be a rarity for him to make a policy contribution in this place. Now that he is the high-powered shadow minister for tourism there was a hope that he could break his duck.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, we are not debating the issue. Senator Ronaldson I draw your attention to the point. I have told you I will be watching what you are doing and you have repeated the same point. Can we get back to the issues around Telstra.




Senator RONALDSON:
  The minister talked about policy contributions. I would remind him that some two months ago a very substantial policy contribution was put forward by me in this house in relation to indexation of the DFRDB. The party which voted down the DFRDB Fair Indexation Bill was the Australian Labor Party. Lots of policy contributions have been made by me and this side. But if the minister does not believe that is relevant, I will leave the matter there.

 (South Australia) (18:14):  I am hoping that the minister will deign to respond to these amendments and will outline to the Senate his view on this matter. If I boil it all down very briefly, our concern and the concern of many businesses operating in this space is that, passed in its current form, the government's legislation will simply see a number of businesses go to the wall, unable to provide their type of service to developers because you are setting up NBN Co. as the default provider of fibre services in greenfield sites. The difference, you will know, Minister, is that today Telstra's default requirement is to lay copper. There is at least a value add for developers to think about by having fibre providers come in. There is a value add for the fibre providers as well because they are able to try to sell services through those developments.


Your proposal is that NBN Co. will be the fibre provider. What is the value add for a developer to get anybody else in to do it aside from it happening a little quicker? There is no value add. The value for the developer is to leave it for NBN Co. to deliver the fibre because they get it cheaper. If the minister can demonstrate that somehow they will not get it cheaper under his default provision then that would be a great illumination for the chamber. I doubt very much that he will be able to demonstrate to us that they will get it cheaper through an existing competitive greenfield operator. The government have already sent many other businesses to the wall when they have interfered in market spaces—and it is not your fault, Minister; they were not in your policy area—particularly home insulation, on which I spent a lot of time making inquiries. So many home insulation businesses happily operated effective and successful businesses in the Australian economy. They provided jobs, opportunities, good services and good workmanship to their clients but they have gone to the wall because this government's judgment is flawed on matters of policy and on how they should involve themselves in the operations of business. There is a price to pay for their errors of judgment—people lose money, people lose businesses, people lose jobs and Australia is worse off as a result.


Passed unfettered this bill will see those who lay fibre in greenfield sites lose parts of their market—potentially lose all of their market. In the process we will see a contraction of competition in that space and an enhancement of the NBN, which is already one giant monopoly. We will see a loss of private investment, of private jobs and private businesses. For years businesses have done the innovation and the hard yards, developing their own businesses model which allows them to lay fibre in a competitive way in greenfield sites. They have provided a good service to developers and purchasers alike. 


The government are going to pull the rug out from under them and provide a default-free service that will ensure there is no business for the private operators and it will all fall back to you new government monopoly, your 100 per cent government own, 100 per cent debt funded and 100 per cent monopolistic enterprise, the NBN Co. 


You did not subject the NBN Co. to a cost-benefit analysis. Minister, I noted in your second reading speech that you wondered why on earth I would want to see it go to the Productivity Commission. I would think they could ask better questions or to a better analysis of the NBN Co.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am flattered by your questions, Minister, but the difference between the minister sitting over there, the government he represents and this opposition is that we do not think all wisdom resides among us. We do not believe that we simply know best. You do. It is the minister sitting at the table who, when his $4.7 billion fibre to the node proposal fell over, when he could not manage to get tenderers to meet the requirements for each and could not manage to get that much vaunted proposal, his key policy for the 2007 election of the ground—




Senator Conroy:
  A very popular one!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  A very popular one that you couldn't even deliver! So a very popular policy that is another demonstration of the flawed judgement of your government and of the flawed policymaking of your government! You spent millions of dollars in attempting to deliver that policy, on the processes of going out to tender, and in the end it fell over. So what did you do? Well the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, said, 'I've got a plane trip. Come and talk to me about this disaster of the fibre to the node policy. Come and talk to me about it.' So you hopped on a plane with Mr Rudd and you pulled out an envelope like this, which somebody has helpfully left here sitting on the desk next to me, and you said, 'Well, double or nothing doesn't quite work on this. Double or nothing of $4.7 billion doesn't work. But why don't we just shift the decimal point across one? Why don't we just blow it all and put it all on fibre to the premise instead?' There was no decent study of it, there was no decent analysis of it and no clear argument as to why this was the best, most cost-effective, most efficient proposal to provide fibre broadband in the most cost-effective way to all Australians. There was no rigour and no analysis and no real scrutiny of it, and you have ducked and dodged and avoided any effective scrutiny of it ever since.


If you had such confidence in this proposal that you are putting forward, Minister, you would have accepted the opposition's call for a cost-benefit analysis a long time ago. For all of the millions of dollars that you have spent on reports, studies and getting this thing off the ground, it would have been a pittance along the way to say, 'Do you know what? I take up that challenge and I will subject it to a cost-benefit analysis. I take it up because I have confidence that the cost-benefit analysis will come down on my side of the ledger.' But you do not have that confidence, Minister, and that is why you have not taken up the challenge that the opposition has reiterated again and again to you in this regard.


Most of the significant legislation to allow you to create your $50 billion debt funded monopoly has passed through this place, but this is an important piece of legislation that deals with the niche part of the proposal. It is an important niche part, the part that relates to greenfield sites, to new developments. And, of course, because it is a niche part it has niche impacts. But to the businesses who are concerned and will be affected they are not niche impacts; they are real impacts. To the people who have invested money in building up those businesses, they are not niche impacts; they are real impacts. And you are not proposing that you are going to come along to those businesses and pay them billions of dollars, like you are to Telstra or to Optus to migrate customers across and to compensate them for the loss of their cable networks. No, you are not proposing any compensation for these businesses. You are just changing the ground rules for them; that is what you are doing. So you are changing the ground rules for these businesses and if the new business model of the NBN does not work for them it is too bad, too sad—as is the attitude of you and your government. What we will see instead is a situation where their businesses are threatened and the jobs of those businesses are threatened. Ultimately, it will be a combination of Australians, customers, consumers, people purchasing the properties in question, developers and those involved in the development industry and taxpayers who will cop the impact. The taxpayers will cop it because your stripping of competitiveness out of this sector will see prices go up and we will see the NBN Co. as a giant monopoly simply become a giant, fat, sluggish monopoly, as all monopolies ultimately do. We will see developers lose out because they will not have choice, because eventually the choice will just not be there. The developers just will not have the choice of who to go to.




Senator Conroy:
  What's it like having amnesia?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, you want to talk about amnesia? Honestly! Look at the disasters that you and your entire government run away from. Day after day after day you run away from these disasters. I talked about home insulation and we can go to many other places or we can just rehash the fact that you were the one who developed a policy that you could never get off the ground and took to the 2007 election and, to get yourself out of trouble on that, you simply had to spend not just a little bit more but around $45 billion or $46 billion more, when it is all tallied up, to manage to get your new policy off the ground. That is a remarkable feat, Minister, something that I am sure future taxpayers will look back on and shake their head in wonderment at how a minister got away with such a tactical manoeuvre. I congratulate you for the tactics there, the tactics of getting a policy so wrong but being able to convince the Prime Minister of the day to go along with you on something even bigger, even grander and even less proven. It is a remarkable accomplishment in a political sense but a terrible accomplishment in a policy sense and in a budgetary sense for Australia.


As I was saying, there will be losers under this bill if it is allowed to pass. Among the losers will be the taxpayers, who will be paying more, and the developers, who will lose choice. Householders and others will also be among the losers, who will find that they are waiting around because there is not the competitive tension, the competitive dynamism, within the industry.




Senator Conroy:
  Would you like to come with me to the opening of the first brand-new fibre-to-the-home areas? Would you like to come?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Order! Minister, you will have your chance.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am not suggesting at all, Minister, that NBN Co. will not manage to build it to some people. It is a question of whether that is the best way to do it. You have this blinkered approach that NBN Co. seems to be the only way. We believe that there is a better way especially with these greenfield sites and that for these greenfield sites you can maintain a level of competitive tension in the construction approach. That is all this amendment seeks to do, but it is important because it will preserve those businesses who have gone out there and done the things that you used to highlight and praise. Minister, you used to point to some of these businesses as shining of people who were delivering the type of technology that you are encouraging everyone to embrace. Yet, with this bill you will go down as the minister who pushed those businesses out of business as a result of the freebie that you are offering everyone, ultimately, with the NBN Co.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2011-08-24,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (18:22):  The government does not agree with the opposition's dissenting report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and voted against the opposition's amendments in the House. The opposition is again proposing similar amendments, and the government will be voting against them again for the same reasons we outlined in the other place. 


The amendments basically propose that NBN Co. participate in a scheme by which it buys back fibre infrastructure randomly installed by developers and relieves other greenfield providers of operational requirements applying to NBN Co. knowing that they offer a layer 2 bit stream service on a wholesale-only basis. That is where it goes to the undermining of the economics of NBN Co. But let me deal with a couple of points that Senator Birmingham made. He suggests that we are forcing people to use NBN Co. This is not the case. We are simply the provider of last resort—exactly the same as Telstra are today. Telstra are the provider of last resort. Obviously, telecommunications being a utility, you want to ensure that everybody gets access. So NBN Co. is replacing Telstra as the provider of last resort. The amnesia of those opposite is simply that they have forgotten that they privatised a vertically integrated monopoly. They created this monstrosity, they created this situation where Australians have been getting slower broadband and more expensive broadband than other countries around the world because they privatised their vertically integrated monopoly. Then they keep trying to pretend that a wholesale-only monopoly is a bigger, more evil monopoly than a vertically integrated retail-wholesale company that, together, discrimin­ates against every other telecommunications company in the country on the basis of favouritism for its own retail company. 


You want to talk about infrastructure competition, suddenly clutching to your bosom infrastructure competition, when you privatised a vertically integrated monopoly that eradicated virtually all other infrastructure competition. Let's ask one person who might know something about infrastructure competition in this country. Let's goes to Paul O'Sullivan the chief executive of Optus, who said recently in a press conference: 'I can tell you about infrastructure competition. My company lost $5 billion at the hands of Telstra.' And what did the chief executive of Telstra say in a book he wrote a few years later about infrastructure competition when he left the country. He was an American executive—not Mr Trujillo, you may have guessed. A previous American executive wrote in his book of his time at Telstra, 'We were prepared to lose $4 billion'—this is back in the 1990s, so think back, $4 billion in the 1990s—'just to protect future revenue streams of over $20 billion that we think Telstra might make.' Telstra's chief executive fessed up. They were prepared to lose $4 billion at the time to put Optus out of business; $5 billion of losses for Optus Vision sold to SingTel for a dollar. That is what infrastructure competition, now clutched to their bosom, delivered to this country: a collapse in infrastructure competition.


Do you know how many out of the 5,000 exchanges around Australia, many of them in regional Victoria, have got a competitive deslam in them—that is the competitive mechanism you need? Five hundred out of 5,000 have got another company's infra­structure inside their exchanges after 10 years. It opened up recently, you might be surprised to know, with the threat of entry of NBN and the change in the level playing field, or the unlevel playing field. So there are a few more that have opened up recently. Five hundred out of 5,000 infrastructure competition, courtesy of those opposite. They privatise the ugly 800-pound gorilla into the marketplace with no real powers for the ACCC. Then, to fatten up the cow for the sell-off, they would not put in place any serious regulation of it at all. So those opposite who want to pretend they are interested in competition, who want to pretend they are interested in the battler, have got a track record that they would to just completely wipe from their mind. 


I would urge senators not to be fooled by the silken words of Senator Birmingham, who talks down his own capacity at the expense of the Productivity Commission. As to the withering exchanges at Senate Estimates, I hope you do come along to a few of those Senator Xenophon. Occas­ionally he pops in there—I mentioned you there Senator Xenophon—and make a positive contribution. Senator Birmingham's silken tongue is always at Senator Estimates. You should come along, it's good fun.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:27):  The minister does not need to mention me. I do not need to feel his love.




Senator Conroy:
  I still love you, even though no one else would be interested in talking to you. I still love you.




Senator XENOPHON:
 Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. I agree with the minister, in what he said, that Telstra was an 800-pound gorilla. The way that Telstra was privatised did not lend itself to competition. In fact, we have a vertically integrated monopoly that internationally was acknow­ledged as being bad for competition and bad for consumers. That is why I genuinely commend the minister for the work that he did to structurally separate Telstra. The principle of it was a good one. But we do not want to replace the 800-pound gorilla with another gorilla—maybe not 800 pounds, but maybe 400 or 500 pounds in the form of NBN. That is my concern. 


My question to the minister in respect of the amendment moved by Senator Birmingham is this: is it the case that under the current bill the NBN will effectively become the provider of first resort because the installation of fibre at greenfield sites will be done by NBN at no cost to the developer but there will be a cost to the taxpayer? The opposition's amendment, as I understand it, and I invite Senator Birmingham to disabuse me this if I am wrong, is that it will provide for some competitive tension in relation to the deployment of fibre at those greenfield sites. The minister knows where I stand on this. He did the right thing to structurally separate Telstra. It was a mess. It was not privatised in a way that lent itself to proper com­petition, to a lower price for consumers or to technological development that ensured we had the telecommunications system that Australians deserve. My concern is that this particular amendment might go some way to deal with what, on the face of it, appears to be a problem: that NBN will, in effect, be a provider of first resort at these greenfield sites. That is a legitimate question. The minister knows that I am not asking this from a hostile point of view but am genuinely concerned about the small businesses that could be affected by this.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (18:30):  Senator Xenophon, I absolutely accept you are asking in a genuine sense. You have shown courage in backing the legislation and in rigorously pursuing the competitive angles. I am a little disappointed that you have so little faith in your own amendments, many of which were accepted and supported. You talked about being worried about the 400-pound gorilla. The 400-pound gorilla is regulated by your amendments which were robust, very pro competitive and hotly debated in this chamber. The 400-pound gorilla is regulated properly.


We have never made any apology for the prospect that we are building a wholesale-only monopoly—a fibre-to-the-home network. We are not giving it away for free. NBN Co. have to earn a return. They are not the provider of first resort; they are the provider of last resort. We need to have a provider of last resort or we will end up with hundreds of thousands of homes not connected with a phone system. So we have to have a provider of last resort. That is all we are.


NBN Co. must get a return on its investment. It is not providing anything for free. It has to get a return on its investment. That is its mandate. You have looked through many documents on this. You have discussed this at length, both here and in many other places. We are the provider of last resort which we must mandate; otherwise we will end up with hundreds of thousands of new homes without any communications infrastructure.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:32):  I am grateful to the minister for his answer. If there were an alternative which says, 'Of course, if there is a greenfield site, it needs to be ready to be connected to the NBN and needs to be fibre-deployment ready,' we need that. I do not think there is any question about that. I do not think the opposition is saying anything to the contrary. In terms of that connection to the home at greenfield sites, what is wrong with allowing there to be some competitive tension and some ability for small and medium businesses to compete for that connection? Then, in the absence of that competition, NBN Co. would provide that. So long as there are objective and rigorous standards in relation to this, why can't there be an opportunity to allow some competitive tension in that process?

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (18:33):  The legislation does not require developers to approach NBN Co. It sets out the standards by which it has to be built. I am sure you would agree, and I think even Senator Birmingham would agree with this aspect, although one of his amendments goes deliberately against this. We have to have a system that is able to be interlinked, so we have to set the technical standard. It would be like saying to everybody, 'Just build your own railway network to all the different places.' We would have little islands with their own rail network, with different rail gauges, different rules and all those sorts of things. It would be completely different. Actually someone did that; it was called Australia. We have now connected rail to South Australia from Victoria and we now do not have to, I think, change the trains onto new tracks anymore. That is the modern day equivalent of what those opposite are seeking to do. They are seeking to change the standards by which people are building by allowing them to offer layer 3 services. That is what this amendment seeks to do.


Most importantly it comes down to cherry-picking. If you allow developers to pick and choose which ones they want, they will go where they can make the most money and they will make NBN Co. pick up the tab for all of the areas in regional and rural Australia that they do not want to build to. They will just cherry-pick the big housing estates around metropolitan areas and they will leave the rest to the taxpayer to pick up the tab. The revenue will go to them for the cheaper installations and NBN Co. will be left to pick up the tab for the more expensive installations with the poorer customers. That is where it really goes down to destroying the economics of the NBN.


Senator Birmingham can pretend that is not what he is doing, but that is exactly what he is doing. He will allow them to cherry-pick the most expensive, best, biggest areas where they can make the most money. They will ignore regional and rural Australia. We all know that no-one is interested in providing fibre to the home in regional and rural Australia. They are just interested in cherry-picking big housing estates in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide et cetera. That is what this amendment would allow to happen. It would fundamentally undermine the economics of NBN Co.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-24,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (18:35):  Minister, there is a remarkable inconsistency in what you say and in what you argue. Do you stand by the statements you have made previously? On 9 December last year you said:


It has been a consistent feature of the Government’s policy in new developments that there should be room for competing providers. This continues to be the case.


Developers will be able to source fibre from competing fibre providers if they wish. Providers can compete to provide infrastructure in new developments, for example, by offering more tailored solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery.


Do you stand by that and, if you do, isn't that somehow allowing the type of cherry-picking you are suggesting, in that it will be only the easier and cheaper ones delivered? The ones where there are better returns available will see developers and providers go in and provide the fibre services in those greenfield sites. Isn't that just what you were railing against? Yet that is what you said would be the case and is what in other places you and the department have indicated is what this legislation provides for.


In addition to responding on whether you still think there should be room for competing providers, which is all the opposition is attempting to facilitate through these amendments, can you make it equally clear—and I will put this as simply as possible—whether it will be cheaper for developers to use the provider of last resort that is NBN Co. to get fibre laid than it will be for them to use anybody else? Will it be cheaper for them to do that than to go to anybody else? It is a simple question and would demonstrate whether your belief that there will still be some competing market and some room for other providers is the case, or whether, as we and many others contend, you are setting up a system where the provider of last resort becomes the default provider because it is going to be significantly cheaper for developers to use it and it alone.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (18:38):  Senator Birmingham likes to quote selectively. The capacity for someone to compete with NBN Co. in fibre is there now. NBN Co. itself conducted a tender. For people who have not followed this debate it actually had a tender. It had reached the view that it needed to go with one national supplier because of capacity issues. So NBN held a tender because NBN itself does not have the capacity to do these installations. It tendered, and Fujitsu got the contract.


On your specific question, I have no idea what the business models and pricing of all the other companies are. I am not in a position to answer your question, because I do not know what the business models and offers from those other companies are.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (18:39):  I think the final agreement is pretty much the same as that which Telstra used to charge for installation. Telstra did not charge developers anything to install—it is what still happens today. Telstra does not charge anything to provide the copper into the home. It makes its money from the usage of the product. It may not be exactly the same—I have not seen all the final documents on this because there is still lengthy discussion and negotiation—but Telstra itself used to provide all of the connections. The developers would open up their pits and Telstra would run the copper in and connect the phones. I am happy to provide to you any further information that may be available.


Developers can source fibre from competing fibre providers if they want. Other providers can compete to provide infra­structure in new developments—for example, by offering bespoke solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery. NBN Co.'s role in new developments reflects its role in rolling out the NBN nationally. Where NBN Co. provides fibre it will recover the cost on a national basis and over a longer time horizon, just as Telstra has done historically with its copper network. It is up to other providers as to how they charge and recover their costs. If alternative providers want to compete with NBN Co. they are welcome to do so, but it is on the understanding that they have the resources and capacity to do so.


I am not sure there is much I am going to be able to add to that, no matter how many times or ways you rephrase the question, Senator Birmingham.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-24,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (18:41):  Grudgingly, the minister found a way to at least sort of answer the question. He said that NBN Co. would provide and lay the fibre, but would recover the costs on a national basis over a longer time horizon. Private providers providing the services would not be able to do that; they would have to recover their costs by charging the developer, which of course would be put into the costs of the land that is sold.




Senator Conroy:
  What's the cost? Come on!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, you said the very nice words that you could not talk about the business models of—




Senator Conroy:
  I'm not talking about business model, I'm saying: what is the actual cost of opening up pits and pipes? Come on, you've got to know that—you're an expert on this.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, you are not going to catch me on that, because, while you have tried to proclaim me as an expert on things, I made the point very clearly before that I do not propose or pretend that we are experts on everything. I can, if you want. I can quote some of the evidence received by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network about the costs of developing these things, of installing the fibre and so on, if you want. We can go through the submission of Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia, which stated that:


NBN Co Agreements with Developers, who have already applied for 133,000 new lot connections in Greenfield developments since 1 January 2011, evidences that the cost of each connection is currently averaging over $3000 per lot (excluding any back haul construction costs).


Current prices for GFOA networks that equal or exceed the current functional performance of NBN Co networks are up to $1500 per lot (excluding any back haul construction costs). FTA TV and Pay TV may add $300 per lot.


That was from the submission made by GFOA to the committee's inquiry into this legislation. If you want to talk about costs, TransACT said, according to the committee's dissenting report, that:


… the approximate cost depending on choice of provider and specification used, of installation of a fibre network per premise is up to $3500. TransACT stated:


The ballpark type numbers indicate that pit and pipe is somewhere in the order of $500 to $1,000 a premise and a turnkey solution is anywhere up to $3,500 a premise depending on who deploys it and what the specification is.


They are fairly valid points, but none of them get away from the reality of what you have just said and made quite clear to the chamber in this debate—that is, that the first of two models that will be available to developers is that they can use a private provider to have fibre laid. Of course, that private provider, as a private business provider, is going to have to recoup its costs somehow. The only place it can recoup them under your model is to charge the developer, which costs the developer more. Or, the provider can let NBN Co. do it and  recoup the costs 'on a national basis', to use your words, over a longer time horizon, charging the developer nothing.




Senator Conroy:
  What did Telstra charge the developer?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, I cannot believe that you, of all people, who love to come in here and give these lectures to everybody else, want to try to draw this comparison between Telstra laying a copper wire and developers getting a private business provider to lay fibre. I cannot believe you want to draw that comparison. This is a changed dynamic. This is a different approach that you are pushing through, and that is your right. But you are now talking about a situation whereby it is not Telstra laying copper against a private provider laying fibre. It is not Telstra offering copper for free against a private provider offering fibre at a cost. It is NBN Co. offering fibre for free against a private provider offering fibre at a cost. It is the same product, but one person—your govern­ment owned monopoly—is offering it for free. This is a fairly emphatic difference. You cannot keep drawing this comparison, making this argument that it is the same as with Telstra, because we are looking at a different situation here.


We are looking at businesses that have evolved over a period of time, businesses that have filled a space in the market that was not being filled. By changing the ground rules, as you are doing, you are going to transparently disadvantage those businesses. Your notion of provider of last resort is very clearly a flawed notion. You are very clearly setting up a situation whereby NBN Co. becomes the default provider. It will become the default provider because it will be hundreds if not thousands of dollars cheaper to use it. Per premise, developers will save hundreds or thousands of dollars to go with NBN Co. instead.


For most developers operating in a market where margins are tight, particularly right now, there is not a lot out there at present—not a lot of money to be made on residential or other property developments. Every dollar they can get counts. Every dollar on the margin is important. They are going to take the cheapest option. I cannot believe that you will not recognise and accept that. You see this concern of the opposition's as illegitimate and reject out of hand this sensible amendment of the opposition's that seeks to simply preserve the right, the role and the capacity of these private providers to keep doing the business they are currently doing: laying fibre in greenfields develop­ments and ensuring that in those greenfields developments there is competitive tension, as Senator Xenophon acknowledged, between the potential providers of fibre to those developments. It baffles me that you reject that.


But I am pleased that at least you have acknowledged, even if you will not put it in these words, that there will be a very distinct cost differential. People can go with the private provider and pay, or they can go with NBN Co. and not have to pay. That is the situation that will confront developers. In the overwhelming majority of cases one would expect that anybody who is given what is a fairly rational economic choice—do you pay for something or do you get it for free?—will go with 'get it for free' on almost any day of the week.


That is what will happen. You cannot continue to mount this argument that what is happening with these fibre providers is somehow comparable to where we are at with Telstra and copper. I am not aware that anybody is out there providing competition in the marketplace over who is laying copper in the ground. I am aware that there are plenty of businesses providing competition over who is laying fibre in the ground, and I am aware that those businesses fear this legislation and fear what it will do to their future.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-08-24,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:50):  I rise to add some brief comments to those I made during the second reading debate on this bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. I do not think these amend­ments—opposition amendments (2) to (11)—are illegitimate. Unlike with many of the amendments and proposals the coalition have served up during the course of this debate, I do not think this is an attempt at wanton sabotage. At least that is a relief; maybe we have moved on from that stage. I think the coalition, and all of us, are grappling with the fact that it is actually very difficult to compete in an open market with a utility provider that will be leveraging gigantic economies of scale.


The issue I touched on in the second reading debate—and I will address some of these questions to Senator Birmingham—is the issue of exactly how these amendments will work. I am speaking in particular about clause 11, which I have had a bit of time to think about as I have been listening to the debate. My main questions are how it will work in terms of pricing if NBN Co. is being forced to purchase an asset that has been put into the ground by a third party as well as the question of standards. I do think this is a valiant attempt to grapple with the very difficult issue of what happens when private fibre providers, who have been quite happily going about their business in cities like Canberra and in other places around the country and putting in the infrastructure, suddenly find that a national monopoly utility rolls over the horizon, with enormous economies of scale. It is going to be very difficult to compete. That is why I have some sympathy for these amendments. However, the problem I have is that it appears to me that the amendments would simply make things worse—although I note that some of the providers have offered conditional support to what the member for Wentworth and Senator Birmingham are attempting to do. My first question to Senator Birmingham goes to the heart of the promotion of competition. Perhaps the outcome would be cheaper, more efficient and of a higher technical standard if we just let the larger providers do their work. Competition may not in fact be appropriate. My question is about amendment (11) and subclauses 372CA(8)(a) and (b). The way that this amendment will operate in practice is that a third-party provider will put a network into the ground and then NBN Co. is going to be forced to buy it. How are the parties going to come to an agreement over price? Perhaps Senator Birmingham would care to address that issue and maybe flesh out a little bit how these changes, particularly proposed sub­clauses (6) through (8), would function in practice. I do not understand how you could negotiate a contract and fair terms of a transaction under the kinds of clauses that the coalition have drafted here.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-08-24,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:53): I rise—




Senator Conroy:
  My favourite fibre-to-the-home-supporting National!




Senator NASH:
  I thought that might wake you up, Minister! I rise to ask a question of the minister. I have not been closely involved in the debate over this for a while now, but I could not help but come and join my colleague Senator Birmingham down here this evening. Telecommunications certainly has been an interest of mine for a very, very long time—since long before I came into this place, as the minister would well know. What I find extraordinary is that we are still here, after years and years of this inept government, talking about NBN in various forms—first we had to fibre to the node and then we had fibre to the home. This whole process is extraordinarily inept. 


The minister started with a certain principle that he had in mind that he wanted to deliver, and some aspects of that I have a small amount of sympathy with. But unfortunately what has happened is that it has morphed into this unwieldy beast that the minister may well have lost control of. When you look at the intent, years ago, of how this was supposed to work and how it was supposed to look, it really seems to have gone off the rails in a lot of ways. I do have a question, Minister. I will get to that in a moment and it relates to these amendments, but I want to take the opportunity to make a contribution about regional communities. 




Senator Conroy:
  I recommend you visit Armidale!




Senator NASH:
  What actually got me interested to come down here was having recently been up in the seat of Lyne—and the whole issue of greenfields was raised with me very recently. Isn't it extraordinary that we see from this minister a complete mess and, not only that, attached to it a gigantic bucket of money? We will get, at another time in this place, to the discussion about the gigantic bucket of money, because, quite extraordinarily, it is just that—it is just a bucket of money. As far as we can see, there is absolutely no indication at all of any thought, rhyme or reason that has gone into the funding allocation for this—it is just a bucket of money. I am not sure that that is an entirely appropriate way to run the government's coffers. That is probably the greatest understatement I could use in this place. 


I know that colleagues will understand completely when I say that the government's ability to manage the economy and to manage money is absolutely deplorable. We only have to look at the $198 billion of debt that the government has managed to rack up to ask: does the government even have the ability to deliver the NBN in any way, shape, form or capacity so that it looks like some kind of functional network? I am not sure that it does. While we seem to be inching ever closer to something—and I use 'inching' in the loosest sense, because it is probably a lot less than inching—we seem to be getting to an end point of this giant bucket of money being spent on something that may well be superseded by something else very, very quickly. I am not sure that that makes sense either—that we are going down the road of spending tens of billions of dollars from a gigantically big bucket of money for something that may well be superseded in the very near future.




Senator Conroy:
  Oh, please, don't you do that! You know better than that!




Senator NASH:
  Call me a cynic. Call me a sceptic. I actually think that maybe that is not the best way forward. I will take that interjection from Senator Conroy saying that I know better than that. The minister is well aware of my involvement in this before I came to the Senate. Certainly at that time there were some views that were held by those of us who were looking into telco in the bush—




Senator Conroy:
  You wrote 'fibre to the home'. I stole your plan!




Senator NASH:
  Absolutely. Oh, you did steal my plan, did you? Thank you, Minister. Interestingly, I have the capacity to actually move with the times and embrace new things and new technologies—not be a dinosaur stuck in the past but be prepared to move forward with the times. I have come to the point where I am not entirely assured that picking one technology is the way to go.




Senator Conroy:
  Oh, that's sad. You're about to become a luddite!




Senator NASH:
  You may not like to hear this, Minister. You may not like to hear this at all, but I genuinely believe that. While we are on that subject, the thing that is so sad about this whole NBN process—and it is really sad—is that regional Australia has missed out. We still have no improvement, apart from in a couple of tiny pockets. Minister, you might be able to enlighten me in your answer about how many people in Armidale have now switched onto the NBN. I could be wrong—I could be underestimating things and doing you a great disservice—but I think it might be 15 people in Armidale who are now connected to the NBN. I shall look forward to your updating that and letting me know if I am indeed incorrect. I may well be. It may be more than 15 people out of a population of—I am not sure about Armidale; maybe it is 20,000 or 30,000. Minister, I am sure that you, having done the work up in the area, will be able to inform the chamber of exactly how many tens of thousands of people there are in Armidale, a place where I think 15 people have connected to the NBN. I am sure you will be able to enlighten me on that. Just to reiterate my earlier remarks, what I find really sad is that regional Australia has been left behind again. All we are getting from this government is talk, rhetoric and a whole lot of never-never. As I said, I give the minister credit for the little tiny pockets where the NBN has been connected. But, by and large, we are absolutely missing out. I say this in the context of the fact that if we had been in government the improvements to regional Australia would have been delivered.




Senator Conroy:
  Don't say OPEL.




Senator NASH:
  Minister, I am quite sure you would not like to direct me on what to say. It is funny but, under that, regional Australia would have had an improvement. Under the Labor government, regional Australia has not had an improvement. I am not a rocket scientist and perhaps I am a bit of a sceptic but, when I look at the whole scenario, I think, 'Under a coalition government regional Australia would be getting better telecommunications and currently under the Labor government regional Australia is not getting better telecommunications.' It seems like a bit of a no-brainer to me. Despite all this talk and all of this rhetoric about regional Australia getting better services and better telecommunications from this NBN, there is virtually nothing there yet—and it has been years and years.


I am sure the minister will stand up and say, 'Oh, yes, but we are progressing and it is all going to this end point.' I can guarantee the chamber that the minister will take the opportunity to have a very eloquent spray at me personally, given my history with telecommunications.




Senator Conroy:
  I used to have too much respect for you to do that.




Senator NASH:
  Oh, Minister, that is too kind! I am sure it will arrive and I am quite happy to sit here and listen to it if it does because what I do as a senator for New South Wales on the coalition side of this chamber is try to embark on and be involved in things that are actually going to improve things in regional communities. That is what I do. That is what I stand for. That is why I am here. That is why many of my regional colleagues are here, from the National Party to my Liberal regional colleagues. We try to improve things in regional Australian communities. What we have from this NBN is no improvement for regional communities. Maybe one day in 30 years I will stand here and eat my words and there will be this brand new nirvana of telecommunications having been delivered to the regions that at that point has not been superseded by another technology. Maybe I will, but I very much doubt it. I very much doubt it because it simply does not make sense.


While we are talking about regional Australia, something that is very interesting is the Australian Broadband Guarantee, which finished on 30 June. Whilst it is not necessarily related to this amendment, I will place on notice that I will have a discussion at some stage with the minister about the arrangements now that the ABG is finished and how that is all working, because it is as clear as mud. I will be having a discussion with the minister about how that works now and what a family moving out into a remote area that wants to hook up to satellite now has to cough up. It is not entirely clear. That is a discussion we will be having.




Senator Conroy:
  I suggest you seek a briefing before you do that.




Senator NASH:
  Thank you, Minister. I will take up the offer of a briefing. I appreciate that very much because I do not have your obvious expertise in this area and I would very much like to know exactly how that is rolling out.


It is interesting, too, when you look at the delivery under the NBN that is going to happen out in those regions. Is there a structural separation now? I would suspect there is not out in those remote areas. Perhaps, Minister, if you would be so kind, we could include that in the briefing. Maybe I could ask of officials at a briefing exactly how that works, because it looks very much to me like a structural separation has not happened out in the more remote areas. As I said, I have not been very involved in this lately and I could be completely wrong, but wouldn't it be an absolute shame if, through all of this reinvention and this wonderful NBN, remote areas ended up exactly where they were to start with? I do not know if that is the case, so I do appreciate the minister's offer of a briefing, but it occurs to me that that would be a very bad place to end up if, indeed, that is the case. It may well not be.


The reason we have this amendment is to try to create some sensibility in this whole process. I appreciate the answers the minister gave Senator Birmingham before. The area I am interested in is the NBN as a provider of last resort. When we are looking at this construction, as I understand it, where it is not going to be taken up by private companies the NBN is the provider of last resort. That actually looks a little bit similar to the old AWB provider of last resort before we deregulated the wheat industry, which was an extremely good measure that we no longer have, much to my sadness and that of my Nationals colleagues and many, many wheat growers out there across the country. My question is on the issue of the NBN as the provider of last resort. I am genuinely interested in: what triggers that, and what is the time frame from the trigger to when the NBN provides that?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (19:06):  I might just draw the attention of the chamber back to one or two of the questions that I put to Senator Birmingham. I have missed Senator Nash's contributions in these debates. Her contributions on tech matters were generally much more sensible and well researched than those of some of her colleagues, with the honourable exception of Senator Birmingham. I think there is a very important reason why NBN Co. has such a small customer base, and that is primarily that the network does not yet exist. That, I think, is what is suppressing its customer base at the moment. We are about to go into a volume rollout phase, and I do not think you will have to wait 30 years to come back in here—not necessarily to retract—but I do not think anything is coming down the pipeline any time soon that will match the kinds of speeds that will be provided when we can send this sort of bandwidth directly to people's premises. I think there is a very important role for this chamber and its various committees in accountability, in watchdogging this project and making sure that it does not go off the rails. But I also think that the main argument in essence has been won and we now need to just get on with the build. 


The question that I put to Senator Birmingham before goes specifically to some of the amendments that he has proposed, particularly amendment (11), about exactly how commercial negotiations are supposed to take place when NBN Co. is effectively being compelled to acquire an asset from a third party.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (19:08):  One of the things I really like about Senator Ludlam is that, compared to some of his colleagues in the Greens, he is an optimist. When I hear contributions from some of his colleagues in the Greens, especially in some of the climate change and environment debates that I also have carriage of in this place, I find myself leaving rather depressed, concerned that the world is going to come to an end, possibly as early as tomorrow morning. 




Senator Ludlam:
  My glass is half full!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Ludlam has a glass-half-full approach to things and his optimism about the take-up rate and about how wonderful the NBN is going to be is an admirable thing. We have an argument that it might be misplaced optimism, but I respect the fact that Senator Ludlam brings that optimism into this place. I want to turn to his questions, but before I do—otherwise I will forget—I do find it remarkable that the minister could offer no answer to Senator Nash's questions at the end of her contribution—




Senator Conroy:
  Just a timing question.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Yes, in particular her question of timing about when the provider of last resort trigger is triggered. When actually is it the case that a determination occurs that on this greenfields site fibre has not been laid and rolled out and so it is now up to NBN Co. to assume responsibility? There is a separate question which Senator Nash also asked which went to how long it will take NBN Co. to fulfil that responsibility. That may require separate advice, Minister, but I would have thought and hoped that you would be able to answer both of those questions during the conduct of this debate, because I think that is perfectly sensible and reasonable. 


Senator Ludlam asked questions earlier and then repeated some of them about pricing and standards in relation to the amendments that the opposition are proposing. If I can tackle those—and he is right—this amendment sets up a situation where NBN Co. can be compelled to purchase the network off the developer. It is not a case of NBN Co. negotiating each individual purchase with each individual developer on those individual terms. It is in fact that, as proposed section 372CA(6) states: 


The amount of the purchase payment must be in accordance with a scale of payments determined by the Minister for this subsection and published in the Gazette.


It then goes on in parts (7) and (8) in particular to outline how the minister determines the scale of payments. Part (8)(a) indicates that the minister must consider 'the typical costs of providing such networks or elements of such networks, including significant regional variations in costs'. That is an important point given the minister's allegations that this would enable cherry-picking of the cheapest places in which to do business. In fact, the minister would have in his power and at his discretion the capacity to indicate that, yes, it is more expensive to lay the fibre in some locations than in other locations.  Part 8(b) states that the minister would take into account 'the costs that NBN Co. would have incurred had it undertaken to provide such networks itself', which again of course would provide for regional variations and the like, but they are of course explicitly provided for in part (a). 


The really obvious area of competitive tension or opportunity here is that you would hope that the more this work occurs the more it is keeping NBN Co. and providers honest in terms of laying out the fibre in these developments. But of course the best argument here is that it ensures you get the best result for the developer. The developer and the people who purchase premises within the development get their fibre; they get it as fast as the developer can find somebody who can lay it and who can do so on terms that they find profitable enough to operate on according to the scale of payments that the minister has scheduled. 


With this whole NBN construct we are in a world of regulated payments. I know that Senator Ludlam appreciates that. In terms of access to the network, payments are regulated. This is providing for an element of regulated payments at the construction point and the construction end. With regard to the standards that would be set—and I think this is an important point to make—we are attempting through these amendments to provide a greater level of independence from NBN Co. of what those standards are. We are attempting to ensure that there is some level of independence, and our amendments (5) and (9) identify the ACMA as having a role in setting the standards and doing so in consultation with relevant industry bodies and—yes, absolutely—at a standard that is compliant with what NBN Co. needs. But, by having the ACMA play a role, what we hope to get away from is where NBN Co. demand a gold-plated system, where NBN Co. set any unreasonable level of standards for how it is done. Obviously, what we want are speeds that are required for the network. What we would expect are the standards to be correct. However, the minister seems to be quite happy to have a situation where NBN Co. can require such standards in these developments that would just render it utterly unprofitable for anybody else to provide the services, with not the slightest independent check on what it is that they demand or what it is that they want. We do not think that is reasonable. We think that, if you are going to have standards, obviously they need to meet the requirements and specifications of what NBN Co. need, but there needs to be—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, either you can snipe away in the corner there or, occasionally, you could actually provide a constructive contribution.  I have heard you speak in the committee stage to date and, more often than not, it has been to rehash the history of Telstra as a vertically integrated monopoly, to rehash the coalition's policy position—to rehash everything. It has never been to argue the case for the bill that you have presented before this chamber. If you want to get into some detail and start arguing the case for your bill, then feel free to do so. But all you want to do is snipe from the bench over there, without providing any arguments or details of your own or anything substantive to refute the concerns. These are not just concerns the opposition has made up. Mr Turnbull and I did not just sit down in a corner, and say, 'Geez, I wonder how we can invent some concern here.' Senator Ludlam and Senator Xenophon, as well as the other members of the committee, heard evidence from concerned businesses. That evidence is reflected in the Senate committee inquiry and it is evidence that we have tried to act upon by developing these amendments.


So to return to Senator Ludlam's question, we believe the approach we have laid out ensures there will be standards that meet the specifications that NBN Co. needs. They will be standards, however, with a level and a modicum of independent oversight that the ACMA will provide and they will be standards that are developed with industry consultation. 


We believe the pricing can be set in a way that avoids the type of cherry-picking fears that the minister has been trying to create and that provides some level of certainty for businesses going in and that, most import­antly, provides developers and households with the opportunity to ensure they can get the fibre laid in a timely manner. 


I will finish by, again, reminding the minister of Senator Nash's question about timeliness. Minister, perhaps it would really help this debate if you could actually tell us how long we would have to have no fibre laid in the pits and ducts before NBN Co. considered it was their responsibility to do so and, once they acknowledged that respon­sibility, how long it will take them to do so. Why don't you try answering those two questions?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (19:18):  While the minister collects his thoughts, I thank Senator Birmingham for his careful answer to my question. I do not propose to dwell here, but I want Senator Birmingham and the coalition to understand that I have not dismissed this amendment lightly. I genuinely do not think it will work and I do not understand how commercial negotiations can take place, if you can call them negotiations under the terms set out here. 


In your proposed section 372CA(8)(b), you propose that, in drawing up this scale of payments, the minister should 'take into account the costs the NBN Co. would have incurred had it undertaken to provide such networks itself'. You have also been at pains to point out that, by definition, NBN Co. would have incurred much lower costs if it was providing such networks itself. It will be leveraging gigantic economies of scale, which is why this competition argument is such a vexed one. How is the minister meant to take that into account? And what happens in the event of a dispute, where the NBN Co. and a third party provider disagree on the price that the minister has set? I think this is a recipe for enormous disputation and I do not understand how it would work in practice.


Progress reported.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (17:33):  I would like to thank all senators who have spoken today on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. Regrettably, many of the opposition's comments—those of Senator Birmingham, Senator Joyce, Senator Macdonald and Senator Bernardi, which at times was like listening to people baying at the moon—have focused on its opposition to the NBN.




Senator Birmingham:
  Howl!




Senator CONROY:
  Exactly. I am not sure Hansard could pick up the baying from the other side just then, but they should have. Their comments have focused on their opposition to the NBN as a matter of policy, not the bill before us. In the interests of time I will not dwell on this but will focus on the bill. I think Senator Birmingham was the only one who even got close to speaking on the bill, so he does deserve some credit for at least attempting to pretend he is opposed to the bill. 


The government does not agree that, in the absence of public sector investment, Australia will have the broadband infra­structure available to improve our productivity, global competitiveness and social wellbeing. This is demonstrated by the private sector's failure to provide this infrastructure even with the offer of govern­ment funding under the original NBN request for tender process. Many of the problems people have with broadband access relate to a copper network that is inadequate and failing, wireless that is inadequate to the demands being placed on it and fibre provision that is extremely limited and patchy at best.


Contrary to the calls of opposition senators, a cost-benefit analysis is not required. The project has already been subject to extensive examination, including the implementation study by McKinsey-KPMG and Greenhill Caliburn's review of NBN Co.'s corporate plan. The project is subject to extensive ongoing scrutiny including by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, as Senator Ludlam noted. The government is committed to getting on with the project.


Senator Birmingham, what do you think the Productivity Commission could add that you could not? Personally, I think you are more than adequate to ask questions regularly of the NBN. You argue that your attempts are inferior to those of the Productivity Commission, but I am going to disagree with you and stand up for you on this point. It is in this context that I welcome Senator Ludlam's words of support for the NBN generally. He recognises the real potential of the NBN to advance Australia and prepare it for the digital economy of the future. Services on the NBN will be affordable. This is already being demon­strated by proposed pricing packages being launched by retail service providers. NBN Co.'s discussion paper on its proposed special access undertaking does not contradict this. NBN Co.'s SAU will set out NBN Co.'s regulatory undertakings for the supply of services to provide certainty and transparency, but it is not a forecast for actual prices. NBN Co. has also said it will be adhering to the pricing set out in its corporate plan. 


Senator Joyce again raised the idea of 'unit pricing', as he calls it, and through it the government's commitment to uniform pricing. While this is not very relevant to the bill at hand, I thank him for giving me the opportunity to yet again reiterate the government's rock-solid commitment on uniform national wholesale pricing—something he will not get under his own plan, something he will not get under the plan of Malcolm Turnbull, something that Senator Joyce will not be able to deliver for regional and rural Australians if he votes for the plan of Mr Turnbull. This is required under the statement of expectations the government issued to NBN Co. last December. It is embedded in NBN Co.'s network design and operation.


NBN Co. will be able to use revenue from lower cost, higher value markets, such as metropolitan areas, to deliver equitable pricing outcomes for users in regional, rural and remote communities. As Senator Joyce knows, this is just what the Queensland Nationals demanded at their state conference in 2005 when they passed a resolution calling for uniform national wholesale pricing in:


… all new telecommunications and satellite Internet connections to ensure all Australians are charged the same basic price for maintenance and new connections.


Senator Humphries asked about aerial cabling. NBN Co.'s corporate plan assumes that the majority of cabling will be underground—some 75 per cent. This will be supported by definitive agreements between NBN Co. and Telstra. Where existing cabling is underground, and in new developments, cabling should remain underground. Any aerial cabling would be kept to a minimum and would be in areas where there is existing overhead infra­structure, such as powerlines. It is not, however, a cost-cutting measure. It is simply the most efficient and feasible solution in some limited situations. These principles would apply in the ACT as they would apply anywhere else. As Senator Humphries himself mentioned, there is already overhead cabling in parts of the ACT, often in backyards rather than in the street.


Coalition senators have queried the government's commitment to competition in the provision of new infrastructure in new developments. The government is open to competition and innovation in the provision of such infrastructure. Senator Macdonald read several quotes to this effect. However, the government has also consistently said that, if alternative providers want to compete with NBN Co., they are welcome to do so. But it is on the understanding that they have the resources and ability to do so.


Mention has been made of competing fibre providers. There are a small number of alternative providers—around 10 of them. They have some technical expertise and experience. Senator Humphries mentioned TransACT, which is one of the larger ones. But, as the opposition pointed out in its dissenting report on the bill, it is a nascent sector—that is, it is in its earliest stages. These are relatively small-scale operations. Generally they have targeted developments which have been the most commercially attractive. They have been able to pick and choose the developments which they service. Their own evidence to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network indicates that they are not well placed to service Australia as a whole. Around 200,000 new premises are constructed each year. These providers do not have the scale to deal with this. It needs a national operation. Even if they could deal with this scale, to do so they would require extensive subsidies both for fibre and for backhaul. The reality is that they want to pick the lucrative markets while leaving the NBN Co. the hard ones and national coverage—or they want to be paid handsomely to do otherwise.


The government has established NBN Co. to provide high-speed broadband all across Australia for all Australians, charging uniform national wholesale prices, and the government is providing equity funding to deliver this outcome. This includes allowing NBN Co., in new developments where required, to spread its costs nationally and recover them over time. If other providers wish to compete with NBN Co., they are free to do so, but they are to do so on their own terms.


I turn now to the matter in hand. This bill will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to provide a legislative framework for the installation of fibre-ready telecom­munications infrastructure in new develop­ments. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that new developments are ready for fibre based technology. It is part of the govern­ment's strategy to build a superfast broadband network which will underpin our future productivity and competitiveness and meet our citizens' needs.


There is a new senator in the chamber tonight, Senator Madigan, and I welcome his participation and his listening in on this debate. It has been an extensive debate. I am sure you have seen much canvassed in it. But what I would really want to ensure you consider before you decide how to vote on this is that the NBN is being rolled out today. It is being rolled out very shortly in Bacchus Marsh, an area not far from where you originally came from in the good state of Victoria. Those are the fibre-to-the-home developments. We are also going to be rolling out, as you might have seen in a recent announcement from the government, the fixed wireless network. That will also go to regional areas around Ballarat. Among all the excitement of coming here, I am sure you have not had a chance to follow everything I have said—and congratulations and good sense there—but we have also started delivering the interim satellite, which covers all of Victoria, including areas in and around Ballarat. So the NBN Co. is delivering fibre, wireless and satellite to everybody across Australia. In its early stages, it is going to be in all three forms in and around Ballarat very soon. 


The key thing to understand is that the uniform national price is enabled by charging more in metropolitan areas to cross-subsidise the bush. We are unashamed about this. We have said that we believe it is what should be done and that it will deliver equal opportunity for everybody, no matter whether they live in Ballarat or any of the areas around country and regional Victoria. Our opposition have said that they support vouchers. People in and around Ballarat, in and around regional Victoria—Mr Turnbull's plan is to give them a voucher. He has recently stated publicly that he does not believe in cross-subsidies. He does not believe that metropolitan areas should pay more to subsidise people in regional and rural Australia. Here is your opportunity today, on behalf of regional and rural Victorians, to let Malcolm Turnbull know exactly what you think. Should regional and rural Victorians be, as Mr Turnbull wants, receiving a voucher for telecommunication services or should they get a cross-subsidised price equal to what people in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane pay? Those are the very simple economics of the NBN.


Very shortly, you will see some amendments being moved which are all about destroying the economics of the NBN—cherry-pick, pick the rich areas, go to the wealthy areas, destroy the economics of the NBN and the NBN will fall over. That is what is being proposed—




Senator Xenophon:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: the minister—




Senator Conroy:
  Are you feeling unloved because I have not mentioned you yet, Senator Xenophon?




Senator Xenophon:
  I can do without Senator Conroy's love any day. If I do this, I am picked up on it. The minister is referring to Senator Madigan personally. Any references should be through the chair. That is my understanding and that is my point of order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Stephens
):  Minister, please be guided by the standing orders.




Senator CONROY:
  I apologise to Senator Xenophon that I have not spoken directly to him yet, but I will get around to it. So, there is a very clear choice before the chamber—do you support the principle that everyone gets an equal chance, everyone gets an equal price, everyone gets an equal service, based on the three technologies? That is what the NBN delivers. Or do you want to try to sabotage it? Those on the other side will be moving amendments that are all about destroying the economics of providing that cross-subsidy. This is essentially about the cherry-picking debate. Public ownership and the capacity to provide equal services across the state of Victoria are at the heart of today's votes and today's amendments.


The purpose of the bill, as I have said, is to ensure that new developments are ready for fibre-based technology. If fibre-ready infrastructure is not installed in new developments, it will have to be fitted later at greater cost. It will cost more for every house and business than doing it up-front. Retrofitting would also be much more destructive. It is simply more sensible to install fibre-ready ducting in a trench that is already open. Fibre can then be installed and the houses occupied, or if that is not possible it can be pulled through later.


Having said that, I stress that this bill is a safety net. Most developers are already installing fibre-ready infrastructure, and we expect that most will continue to do the sensible thing. This is a sensible preparation for fibre and it appears to be generally accepted. It was accepted by the joint committee on the NBN, which recommended that the bill be passed. It also appears to be sensible to those opposite, although they also demand that the bill be amended to tackle issues far beyond the bill's intended purpose. I could say much more but in the interests of bringing the debate to a conclusion I rest there.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  Tonight I rise as part of the adjournment debate to pay my respects to a man who could only be described as a true believer and a carrier of the light on the hill. Walter Rex Neil, known as Rex, dedicated his life to the labour movement. He was a man of unwavering commitment to repre­senting working people. 


I would also like to acknowledge that in the chamber tonight we have fellow senators from Tasmania: Senators Urquhart, Bilyk and Polley. I welcome their support tonight. 


Rex was taken from us suddenly and unexpectedly so tonight, as part of my contribution, I wish to reflect on Rex's achievements and commitments to the Labor Party and to the union movement. Only a matter of weeks ago hundreds of people, including family, friends, politicians, state and national union leaders and members of the Labor Party joined to pay their respects at the service for Rex, including the current RTBU Tasmanian State Secretary, Samantha Simonetis, who Rex had worked closely with over the past few years, and former National RTBU Secretary, Roger Jowett, who reflected on Rex's life in his contribution at the service. It is a testament to the mark Rex had made and clearly showing the esteem in which Rex was held in right across the party and the union movement that so many people joined together to pay their respects to Rex Neil. I had the pleasure of meeting Rex nearly 30 years ago when I joined the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party. 


Rex began his career on the railway in 1959 as a porter at Railton. Immediately upon commencing his position on the railway lines Rex become a member of the Australian Railways Union, the ARU. At that time Tasmania's railway system was a strong and thriving government department with 3,000 employees, an urban railway system in Hobart, a premier intercity passenger service, and the Tasman Ltd and rail workshops at Invermay Road which could produce both locomotive and rolling stock. Whilst working on the railways Rex was promoted through the grades of shunter, station master and finally to train controller, working the train control boards in Launceston. 


Rex's involvement in the railway union saw him represent railway workers in Tasmania for over 50 years, filling a huge number of positions with the ARU and the amalgamated Rail, Tram and Bus Union, the RTBU, at a state and national level. Rex was a passionate advocate for ARU members and rose to the position of Tasmanian branch secretary in 1974. He held this position until 1993 when he became assistant branch secretary of the newly amalgamated Rail, Tram and Bus Union. 


The creation of the RTBU came about as the part of the larger restructuring of the labour movement. The RTBU came into existence after an amalgamation of the Australian Railways Union, the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, the Australasian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association and the National Union of Railway Workers. Whilst this was a difficult and challenging time, Rex immediately saw the benefits of the amalgamation. 


Whilst Rex was renowned as someone who was always straight to the point and made it clear where he stood, he possessed the finest qualities any union organiser could hope for: he was a terrific listener. Every worker Rex represented had a story to tell about their job and their workplace, and Rex made sure he was there to hear every story. The story of the modern railway worker is of someone that is called upon to work unsocial hours undertaking shift work as a single driver operating freight or as working as part of a small gang, but either way it is unusual to see many other workers. But Rex made it his business to ensure that he was accessible and that every member was able to talk with their union representative face to face. This often meant Rex worked unsociable hours as well to ensure that his union members were kept informed and had the opportunity to speak to their union representative. This commitment and care for his members highlighted the type of man Rex was; in fact, you could not have met a more genuine, caring and outstanding advocate for his members than Walter 'Rex' Neil. 


During his time in the RTBU the rail industry faced many challenges, none bigger than in 1999 with the incoming American owners of the privatised TasRail. During the 20 years previous there had been rationalisation of the workforce which had seen the Tasmanian rail system privatised. Add to this the anti-union and anti-collective bargaining legislation and policies of the Howard government and the RTBU, like many unions, were facing a particularly difficult period. When the new American owners of TasRail took over in 1999 they had a well-established record of anti-unionism. These were dark and difficult days indeed. Some union activists were not rehired, rail workers were given the ultimatum of a job and an individual workplace agreement or nothing, which threw wages and conditions out the window, and meant the prospect of looking for a new job. 


Rex continued his passion and commitment to the union movement through these dark years until what can be described as Rex Neil's proudest moment in his time contributing to railway unionism and railways in Tasmania, with the renationali­sation of the Tasmanian rail system by the state government, followed by historical high levels of investment delivered by both the state and federal Labor governments which has seen the upgrading of infrastructure and rolling stock. A new single, enterprise wide collective agreement was implemented and ratified by members, with the union density in the industry now back to a healthy 70 per cent and still growing. These achievements are in no small part thanks to the role Rex played. 


In speaking at Rex's service, former RTBU national secretary and colleague Roger Jowett summed up Rex fittingly when he said:


All of us in the RTBU and the wider labour movement have been enriched by his lifelong contribution. His life work is both testament to the foundations of collectivity and solidarity upon which unions are built and it why we can proclaim: we are proud to be union. 


And this rang true for Rex, who was a proud life member of the Australian Labor Party and held various positions in the party such as national and state conference delegate, administrative committee member, vice-president, president of the North Launceston branch and platform chair of the Community, Health and Transport Services Committee. Despite this, despite playing a enormous role in the Labor Party, it was always Rex's union members who came first. But Rex's commitment to the Labor Party could never be questioned and ran a very close second. Rex really was a genuine Labor man. One of his grandchildren recounted at the service that Rex said he didn't mind what his grandchildren did as long as they promised him two things: firstly, to support the Carlton Football Club—which I personally cannot agree with—and, secondly, to always vote Labor. 


Whilst Rex was involved in numerous Labor campaigns, there are a couple that really stick in my mind which I will share tonight. Rex was heavily involved in the campaigns of former Tasmanian Labor state government minister and member for Bass, Jim Cox. Rex and Jim first met at a function where Jim was describing to Rex the difficulty of completing the dreaded job of getting all of his posters erected before the election. It was this first chat which started a long association between the two. Every election Jim and Rex would have this quiet chat and magically a few weeks out from the election hundreds of Jim Cox posters would suddenly appear. Party members also recall Rex's vital involvement in many campaigns through the use of his trusty van, and it was this trusty van which again demonstrated his tireless commitment to the labour movement. What other person would attach several posters on their van by attaching them with screws through the bodywork? Rex also used this trusty van in the 1996 Bass federal election campaign where Michelle O'Byrne defeated Warwick Smith. Rex took up the bus driving duties, ferrying campaign volunteers all over the electorate to go doorknocking. And in a free moment of the campaign, Rex would drive the van around the block over and over, waiting for a park to open up in front of Warwick Smith's office so that he could park the van right out front, with Michelle O'Byrne's name all over the van whilst obscuring the view of Warwick's office and his name.


Rex also used his van to great effect in the 2007 'Your Rights At Work' campaign delivering posters all over Launceston. It was examples like these, and many others too numerous to mention, that made Rex a true believer of unwavering commitment to the labour movement. Whilst Rex was a quiet achiever there was no doubting his passion, commitment and dedication to his beloved ARU, RTBU and the Labor Party. He was truly a man who cared deeply about other people and he worked to improve the lives of those less fortunate. He was a true Labor warrior and someone who will be terribly missed, but will be remembered by the beautiful memories he has given us. Farewell Rex.

Senator Johnston
  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, upon notice, on 28 September 2011:


Does a bank require confirmation from every customer signing a guarantee that they have had the guarantee and its implications explained to them.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-08-24,"



Senator Sherry:
  The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:


The Australian Bankers Association has released the Code of Banking Practice.  The Code sets out in detail what the member banks of the ABA will do before they take a guarantee.  The Code of Banking Practice requires that before a guarantee is taken, the bank must provide a prominent notice indicating: that the person should seek independent legal and financial advice on the effect of the guarantee; that the person can refuse to enter into the guarantee; and that there are financial risks involved.  


Banks have a duty to disclose relevant issues to a third party guarantor.  In addition, guarantees may be overturned because of unconscionable conduct; instances of duress; undue influence; and inequality of bargaining power due to a specific disadvantage or disability.
