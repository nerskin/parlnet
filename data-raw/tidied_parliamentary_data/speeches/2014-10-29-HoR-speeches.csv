Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 amends the Customs Act 1901to implement Australia's obligations under chapter 3 of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. 


Chapter 3 sets out the rules of origin criteria and related documentary requirements for determining the eligibility of goods to obtain preferential tariff entry into Australia under the agreement. 


The complementary Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, will amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to set out Australia's tariff commitments under the agreement. 


The agreement was signed by Prime Minister the Hon. Tony Abbott MP and his Japanese counterpart, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on 8 July 2014 in Canberra, Australia.  The governments of Australia and Japan have agreed to aim for the agreement to enter into force early in 2015. 


The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is a comprehensive agreement that substantially liberalises trade with Japan and creates significant new commercial opportunities for Australian businesses.  Japan is Australia's second largest trading partner and the implementation of this agreement will significantly boost Australia's position in this major market, as this agreement is the most liberalising trade agreement Japan has ever concluded.


More than 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty-free on full implementation of the agreement. There will also be significant new market openings in services and investment.


The agreement contains simplified and trade facilitative rules of origin and related documentary requirements.  Goods imported into Australia that meet the rules of origin, implemented through this bill, will be entitled to claim preferential tariff treatment in accordance with the agreement. 


The amendments include relevant obligations on Australian exporters and producers who wish to export Australian goods to Japan under the agreement and obtain preferential treatment for those goods in Japan.  The amendments also confer certain powers on authorised officers to examine records and ask questions of exporters or producers of goods exported to Japan in order to verify the origin of such goods.


The agreement reflects Australia's close bilateral economic relationship with Japan.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (09:08):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B New Air Combat Capability Facilities.


As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the Department of Defence proposes to carry out public works to support the introduction into service and operations of the new F35A, or Joint Strike Fighter, aircraft. The works will provide new and refurbished facilities at Royal Australian Air Force Bases Williamtown, Tyndal, Townsville, Darwin, Curtin, Scherger, Learmonth, Pearce and Edinburgh as well as additional explosive ordnance and flare storage facilities at Defence Establishment Myambat. The works will provide new and upgraded facilities and infrastructure essential to the operation of the new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The project includes new accommodation, maintenance hangars, storage, workshop and training facilities, aircraft runway and pavement works, and explosive ordnance storage facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $1.477 billion, excluding GST. This investment will bring economic benefits for the local industry, predominantly in the regions of  Newcastle, in New South Wales, and Katherine, in the Northern Territory, over the next seven years.


The committee made three recommendations to Defence in relation to the works proposed at RAAF Base Williamtown, and I am advised that Defence has accepted these recommendations. Specifically, Defence will: continue to consult with local communities and, where possible, implement measures for the mitigation of noise impacts; work with the Hunter Water Corporation to ensure water quality is not compromised; and undertake appropriate traffic studies to ensure that construction traffic is suitably managed.


Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence in early 2015 and be completed by 2022. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee, under the leadership of the member for McPherson, for once again undertaking a rigorous and timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.

The SPEAKER
 (09:59):  Pursuant to the resolution agreed to earlier, the question is that these bills be now read a second time.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,"<title>Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014, Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014</title>",BILLS,4,1,speech
"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:00):  What we just saw was extraordinary. We had government members en masse voting to take themselves off the speaking list. That is what they all just did. We had about eight people from the opposition on the speaking list so it was all going to happen within the time allotted anyway and we would have voted earlier. The only thing that happened with the gag motion was that government members made sure that they did not have to speak. Government members made sure that they were not forced into the humiliating position of having to defend all the hype that the member for Kooyong has attached to today, because today will be as big a fizzer as the last repeal day was.


We have today, for a full day of parliamentary sittings, a grand total of $1.8 million of savings. That is what they are here boasting about in the same week they have added $5.1 million worth of compliance costs onto motorists throughout Australia. More than double additional compliance costs have been put in place in the same week of their big repeal day that delivers only $1.8 million. And you really have to ask some questions about the $1.8 million.


The role of one of the bills we have in front of us is to change punctuation. Its role is to remove hyphens, semicolons and commas and to return commas to other places. It will correct a spelling error that was made in 1995 that the Howard government had not picked up on and we did not pick up on. The member for Kooyong has found it so we need to set aside a day to be able to deal with the additional costs associated with this!


We are dealing with a number of bills today. The first one is the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. This one amends or repeals legislation in the Agriculture, Communications, Environment, Immigration and Border Protection, Industry, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Social Services, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs portfolios. The majority of the measures in this bill are not contentious and in fact the majority of them have zero deregulatory savings attached to them. There is nothing in the majority of the measures to suggest that there is some great burden of regulation that is going to be lifted from small business as a result of their implementation.


Let me give you some examples of what we are getting rid of with the omnibus repeal day bill. We are getting rid of the Fishing Industry Policy Council, which was established by law in 1991 and has never met.




Mr Frydenberg:
  So why keep it?




Mr BURKE:
  We had from the member for Kooyong, 'So why keep it?' We are relaxed about getting rid of it but it is not worthy of the fanfare. It is not worthy of setting aside a day in parliament to say: 'There is something no-one has noticed since 1991. Let us all look at it now and make the member for Kooyong seem incredibly important, because the entire fishing industry will no longer be weighed down by a body that they did not know existed and had not met.'


This bill is amending acts in the Agriculture portfolio to reflect the fact that programs and payments described in those acts are no longer operating or being paid. So no-one is getting the money and the program is not operating any more. By all means get rid of it, but this is like asking for congratulations for being able to queue to get a cup of coffee. It is like being asked to be praised for doing the ordinary work of government. What we have today on these issues is nothing more than the ordinary work of government.


The Australian Communications and Media Authority will now be able to publish certain notices in a variety of methods, including on its website, instead of just the Commonwealth Gazette. Fine. That is an ordinary part of the ordinary business of government.


There is the repeal of an act in the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio that relates to particular tariff decisions made between 1996 and 1999 that are no longer relevant and the repeal of the Patents Amendment (Patent Cooperation Treaty) Act 1979 that amended the Patents Act 1952. The amending act was spent once the amendments passed into law. So in 1979 it had its impact and the amendments took place so you do not need it any more. But that is not worthy of fanfare or an entire day in the parliament to say, 'Great, we are now doing this.' 


I just do not know why on earth we are not debating this in the Federation Chamber, but I do know that every time the government comes forward now saying something is not controversial and asking, 'Will you please send it to the Federation Chamber,' we will have today to compare it with when we make the decision as to what is controversial and what is not. The government has set a very strange standard here in deciding what the view of the House is on what is controversial and should be sent to the Federation Chamber. Issues only go to the Federation Chamber by mutual agreement. The government have set a very unusual standard of what the threshold is for what is considered controversial.


It is repealing the Skilling Australia's Workforce Act 2005, which has already been superseded, repealing the Home and Community Care Act 1985, which was made redundant when the review agreements were deemed national partnership agreements in 2009, and removing social security payments by amending several acts to reflect the fact that no-one has been able to qualify for them since 2000. It is repealing two acts in the Treasury portfolio relating to the termination payments tax. The last termination payment subject to the tax occurred before 1 July 2005. Here is something that is going to be a big relief to small business—repealing the Papua New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1970, which had approved a Commonwealth guarantee on a loan made to Papua New Guinea which has been fully repaid anyway.


With all of these measures there are no deregulatory savings attached. The government want to talk about how much burden we are taking off small business and they give you the total number of acts they are repealing. Overwhelming all the measures I have just referred to are just tiding up, as government does from time to time and as we did. In fact, there are only five measures in this bill that have any deregulatory savings attached to them, worth a total of $1.3 million. These measures are: abolishing the Product Stewardship Advisory Group; amendments to the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, which, among other things, removes the requirement of importers, producers and suppliers of fuel to provide an annual report to environment, saving $30,000; amendments to the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, saving $130,000; simplifying key personnel notification requirements for approved aged care providers, saving $1,160,000; and assisting research and analysis using protected information, saving $5,000.


They are all savings worth having but, make no mistake, the decision of the government that they would dedicate a full day of the House of Representatives debating it means we will spend more money by the parliament sitting than we will be saving. It means the net cost to the budget is a negative because they were not willing to deal with this in the way that we would normally deal with noncontroversial run-of-the-mill legislation.


We do not take issue with the majority of measures contained in the bill. There are some advisory groups within the environment portfolio in particular where there will be a Senate legislation committee inquiry. We just want to confirm that those advisory groups are no longer playing a relevant role, so we will check that. But, other than that, we are completely relaxed about what is in front of us. We will vote for it when the vote comes up later today and we will reserve our right on a couple of those committees while the Senate inquiry determines whether or not a couple of those advisory bodies were in fact playing a relevant role. These include the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council and measures in the hazardous waste act. Understandably, we are taking a cautious approach to ensure that the government's claim that these groups are no longer relevant is in fact valid.


We are committed to an organised and ongoing effort to minimise, simplify and create cost-effective regulation. We are not interested in doing it in a way where the Commonwealth comes out with a net negative on savings that were only being ascribed to the Commonwealth anyway. So for some of these groups, the only savings are not to small business but to the Commonwealth and the cost to the Commonwealth, by insisting we have to have the debate in this chamber, is more than what will be saved. This is reminiscent of a government that as soon as they came to office, having spoken about debt and deficit, decided they would double the deficit and make debt unlimited. In the same way, they came in saying that they wanted to get rid of red tape because red tape costs money and in one day they spend more than they will save. In the same week, they more than doubled the total savings that are allegedly going to come to small business by adding a new compliance burden to every petrol station in the country—$800 per petrol station in Australia on the government's own figures.


The second of the bills is the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014. It repeals 656 acts from the period 1970 to 1979 that are of no consequence at all. They have decided to do this in a staged way. So on repeal day No. 1, we dealt with everything up to 1969 and now we appear to be going a decade at a time so we can work through each decade as we get closer to the next election. In doing so, we will continue to waste entire days of parliamentary sitting time when there are real issues to debate, when there are issues that are genuinely contentious because the government decided they needed to waste a day in here when a noncontroversial debate can very easily happen in the Federation Chamber and none of this is time critical. If it went through a few weeks later, it would make no difference to anything other than their media strategy.


The bill for the amending acts is filled with the repeal of amending legislation. When you have got a principal bill, an amendment bill comes in to change the bill. The moment the bill is proclaimed and the original bill itself has been amended, the amending bill ceases to be relevant. So all they are doing here is just getting rid all at once of bills that technically remain on the statute books that have done their job. You could do a global search on every piece of legislation containing the word 'amending' and get rid of them all at once. But they have decided to make it look like they are going through this methodically. Every amending bill, once proclaimed, has had its impact. There is no reason to do these a decade at a time. This is so the member for Kooyong can claim to have a three-year program.


I must say, I very rarely read political memoirs from anyone on either side of politics. But if the member for Kooyong brings out a book on his time as parliamentary secretary, I am not going near it. There is no way in the world I am going to read a chapter on redundant legislation followed by a chapter on commerce and finish off with the grand chapter on hyphens for his crowning achievements on deregulation.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  He is referring now to a global figure that he wants to point to, none of which is ever relevant to any of the repeal days that we are allegedly meant to focus on. The Navigation Act 1970 amended the Navigation Act 1968. The amending act became redundant once the amendments passed into law. So, okay, we are going to repeal it. It will make no difference to anyone—other than it may form an additional page in a chapter of the memoirs of the member for Kooyong. The Book Bounty Act 1970 amended the Book Bounty Act 1969. Book bounties themselves were repealed in 1990. So with the principal legislation being amended, gone, the amending act technically remains on the statute books. Now we are going to dedicate a day to getting rid of something like that as well. The Home Savings Grant Act 1975 which, amended the Home Savings Grant Act 1964, itself was repealed in 2006.


So with the substantial acts being repealed, obviously the amending acts are no longer relevant. If you want to clean them up, by all means clean them up. But why on earth is this meant to be an important day in the history of the Federation for a bonfire of regulation for amending acts that have not been relevant for years and, in fact, ceased to be relevant within moments of them being proclaimed decades ago?


The Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Act 1979 amended the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965. Having been a minister for agriculture, I looked at this and thought, 'Well, why was I never briefed on this when I was minister for agriculture?' The answer, of course, is the 1965 legislation, which provided for the grant of financial assistance to the states for assistance to the poultry industry, was itself repealed in 1996. It has been gone since 1996, and we are meant to be excited here that we are cleaning up the records, getting rid of red tape for an amending bill when the principal legislation has already gone. The explanatory memorandum on the amending acts says it all:




None of the corrections makes any change to the substance of the law
.



Notwithstanding that, the bill has been calculated to generate $100,000 in deregulatory savings. Exactly how you reconcile those concepts and exactly how you have none of these changes making any difference to the substance of the law, but it saves $100,000, is impressive accounting. I look forward to the member for Kooyong addressing this in his later remarks. Thanks to the vote gagging his own members, they will not get to speak, but he will still get a chance to come back into the House later today to let us know how, when none of the changes make any difference to the substance of the law, you can save $100,000 by doing it. Maybe he can factor that against the cost of parliament sitting today, given that this is the only issue we are dedicating ourselves to.


The Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014, otherwise known as the punctuation-led recovery bill, fixes up incorrect cross-references, punctuation errors and spelling errors and places words in their correct alphabetical order—all reasonable things to do at some point in time but hardly worthy of saying, 'We're going to dedicate a day in parliament to this.' What other issue do we dedicate a day in parliament to? We do not dedicate a full day in parliament to talking about what the government wants to do to the pension. We do not have a day in parliament dedicated to which side of politics is committed to the future of Medicare. But we do have a day for getting rid of legislation which makes no difference to the substance of the law and which corrects alphabetical order and punctuation! In terms of the priorities of this government, today can only be described as madness.


There are deregulatory issues to be dealt with, but they are not in front of us today. The only thing that is in front of us today that is significant in terms of deregulation is rhetoric and a media release. For example, the Statute Law Revision Bill changes the expression 'servant' to 'employee'. I am glad that change is being made. It may or may not be changed back during later industrial relations ideas that might come from those opposite, but it happens over 49 pieces of legislation and is, obviously, not an unreasonable change—but, once again, it is part of the ordinary housekeeping of government.


The bill changes gender-specific language to gender-neutral language in seven locations in the Acts Interpretation Act and 87 locations in the Defence Act. This is something that should happen, and I am glad it is happening, but it is certainly not making a difference to small business compliance. I do not know where they get that rhetoric from. It also inserts a new dictionary into the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Again, the explanatory memorandum in this bill says it all:


None of the corrections make any change to the substance of the law.


Notwithstanding that you have that statement, 'None of the corrections make any change to the substance of the law,' the bill has been calculated to generate—wait for it!—$420,000 worth of savings. So none of the corrections makes any difference to the substance of the law but—bingo!—you save $420,000 on the way through. It is true! Getting better cross-referencing in legislation is the right thing to do, but how changing semicolons to full stops, capitalising 82 words, bolding and italicising six phrases or removing erroneous commas contribute to $420,000 in deregulatory savings is a mystery to me—an absolute mystery to me! And I gather, from the text messages currently being furiously sent by the member for Kooyong, that it was a mystery to him until this moment as well.


Our record has been about deregulation without the fanfare. We repealed 16,794 acts and legislative instruments when in government. It is part of the ordinary routine functions of government. Examples of the types of repeal of redundant acts that we undertook were: the repeal of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Act 1919—the one for implementing the Treaty of Versailles—which was still around when we came to office. It was not a disaster that the Howard government or the Fraser government or anyone had not got rid of it, and we never tried to have a grandstanding day. It was silly that it was still on the books, so, as it came to our attention, we got rid of it.


Similarly, in 2012 we repealed the Administrative Arrangements Act 1987, as part of modifications and amendments it had made had already taken effect and there were no instruments or regulations in force under the provisions of that act. So we got rid of it. There was the repeal of the States Grants (Beef Industry) Act 1975. That act had provided for financial assistance to be payable to a state in relation to beef producers. It was redundant. No financial assistance had been paid since 1977. It was redundant and it was repealed in 2011. We also did a routine clean-up of the statute books, in the statute law revision acts of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the statute stocktake appropriation acts of 2012 and 2013 and the Statute Stocktake Act 2011—without the fuss or fanfare.


But then there was the greater deregulation agenda—the deregulation agenda that mattered—which was the Seamless National Economy. That was an agenda aimed at reducing costs for business in complying with unnecessary and inconsistent regulation. That was about dealing with red tape that affects people, not red tape that you have to search dusty old books in the library to try to find, because it is not actually affecting anybody.


Completion of only 17 of the Seamless National Economy reforms was estimated by the Productivity Commission to reduce business costs by $4 billion a year—$4 billion a year! That is roughly double what the government are claiming they are going to be able to achieve. And I have to say that, in terms of their numbers, if they are claiming dollar values for punctuation, I think the numbers they are pointing to need to be viewed with a high degree of suspicion.


The Productivity Commission also estimated that full implementation of the Seamless National Economy reforms would increase productivity through increased gross domestic product by $6 billion a year. Those figures are in stark contrast to the $1.8 million that we are debating today. What we are dealing with today is the ordinary work of government.


I said after the prime ministerial statement last week that I hoped the next repeal day would be better than the last. The last was pretty bad, but it takes a very special parliamentary secretary to say, 'That level of humiliation wasn't enough,' and that he can go one step further! And today the member for Kooyong has delivered. Today the member for Kooyong has made the last repeal day look constructive!


I got stuck into the last one at the time, but it at least did better than $1.8 million—it at least did better than that. Make no mistake; some of what they called 'deregulatory reform' last time round was removing essential protections and having changes that actually hurt people. Nothing was clearer than when they referred to getting rid of red tape, but what it meant was to in future cut the wages of Commonwealth cleaners. That was part of what happened last time.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  While the dollar figures where higher, the reality was that they dressed up as deregulation what actually amounted to cutting the wages of some of the lowest-paid workers, including the very workers who clean the offices for the people who did it to them. 


I want to remind the House of what happened, because when these bills got to the Senate we made it clear that if our amendment was carried we would insist on it. The government ultimately accepted the amendment and we let the bills through in good faith, only to find that within 24 hours they had found another method to still cut the wages of Commonwealth cleaners. If this government want to talk about the total savings, they need to be honest about the irrelevance of most of the measures that we talk about and the real harm that they have done against some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. There is nothing this parliament should be proud of when the last repeal day meant future wage cuts for the people who serve all of us, and every department, in some of the lowest-paid jobs. 


To hear the interjections that have happened during this part of my speech from the parliamentary secretary, saying, 'Oh, it is all deals with unions', I say that the members of those unions are paid a lot less than us. The members of those unions are serving all of our offices and all of the public service and are doing a hard-day's work or hard middle-of-the-night's work. For their pay cut to be part of the fanfare of so-called 'getting rid of red tape' shows a contempt for those individuals in a way that I had hoped this parliament would never show, no matter who was in office. It is one thing for those opposite to say that they do not agree with those rules and that they want a tender process that allows the lowest bidder, whether or not they are keeping to the guidelines, but the audacity of claiming that cleaners getting better wages was an example of red tape—no, it was not red tape; it was their livelihood. It was not red tape in some small business burden. It was how much money the people who clean our offices had to take home. 


The policy that the government adopted was bad enough, but to dress it up with the rhetoric of red tape—and I use the term carefully in this place—was offensive. It was just out and out offensive to claim that better wages for low-paid cleaners was an issue of red tape. If the government wants to pursue lower wages for people, they should have the courage and the guts to do it head-on. But do not have a situation where you dress it up as part of a red tape repeal, reach an agreement with the opposition and then find a side way of doing it anyway within 24 hours. The government treated people with contempt, they then did a deal that gave people hope and then, within 24 hours, they trashed that hope again—and in the rhetoric after said, 'Oh, but everyone will still be paid the same amount at the moment'. Well, they will not be after the next tender, and their wages will be cut because of a deliberate act by this government that was dressed up within the rhetoric of the red tape repeal because the government did not have the courage to deal with it head-on. Decent wages for cleaners should not be viewed as red tape. It should never have happened. The behaviour of the government on the last repeal day was appalling. It is something that will not only affect the view of people in the cleaning industry towards this government; it is also something that will be attached to the character of this government for a very long time to come.


I have gone fairly broadly across the issues relating to red tape repeal. I have done so largely because the rhetoric surrounding this bill goes a long way beyond the actual contents of this bill. Obviously we will be voting for the second reading, but I move a second reading amendment:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House notes that:


(1) repealing spent and redundant acts and regulations is part of the ordinary, routine function of any government and the former Labor Government repealed 16,794 acts and regulations during its time in office;


(2) the former Labor Government had a strong record of deregulation reform which significantly improved the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian economy and, in particular, the former Labor Government through its Seamless National Economy reforms was delivering significant cost savings to businesses—just 17 of these reforms were estimated to lower business costs by $4 billion per year with the full reforms to increase Australia's productivity and deliver a $6 billion boost to GDP per year;


(3) the three bills being debated together provide claimed deregulatory savings of $1,855,000, or just 0.1 per cent of the figure claimed by the Government, with a vast majority of the changes in this bill having no impact in terms of costs or regulatory burden on businesses, individuals and the community sector in Australia; and


(4) the commitment to deregulation should not be used as a cover for threatening fairness, workplace safety, or the protections of our environment.""


The principle of deregulation and getting rid of red tape is one that we should be able to have a mature debate about. Unfortunately, the significant issues in red tape are not before the parliament today. And just watch for the people who have tuned into the radio or today or are watching the telecast because they know that this is the member for Kooyong's big day and the parliamentary ratings will quadruple. The people who are paying attention should listen to the arguments that are put up by the remaining speakers from the government. There are not many of them because most of them voted to get them themselves off the list before the debate commenced. But listen to the arguments and you can bet one thing: their speeches will not be about the bill before the House. Their speeches will be about other issues, because what is in front of the House today is almost entirely inconsequential. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Watson has moved an amendment to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (10:29):  Is it any wonder people are cynical? Is it any wonder—




Mr Giles:
  No.




Mr LAUNDY:
  Thank you to the honourable member opposite. We have just spent an hour and a half talking about where this debate should happen. It is just mind blowing. 


I follow the member for Watson. He and I attended the same school. He was a year ahead of me. Our paths parted at that point. The member for Watson went to study at university. I am sure he got involved in student politics and unions. He went to the state parliament of New South Wales and then ended up here. I, through university, worked in my family's business, the third generation of my family to do so. Upon completing that degree, I started work full time and had 23 years working for my father. The Prime Minister last night said something that really captured my heart in a speech he gave to the Business Council of Australia. He challenged the business community not to sit in the grandstand, not to stay in the armchair but to engage in the debate.


There has been a lot said this week about mature and sensible debate. I have had 14 months here, and I am sad to say that I think that that is a political oxymoron. The Prime Minister this week has raised issues of our Federation—and I will talk about this later. We stand at a crossroads as a country. When I was sitting in my family's business, life made sense, and what the Prime Minister said last night encapsulates my motivation to be here. Unlike the member for Watson and all those opposite, sitting on this side of the House we have doctors, lawyers, farmers, vets, teachers—people who were in the front lines before they came here, people who have grappled with all that red tape. 


I rise to talk against the amendment and to support the original bill, the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill. I would like to thank the Prime Minister, first and foremost, for having the foresight to take this into his portfolio and to put in charge my good friend the member for Kooyong. By running this out of the Prime Minister's own portfolio, he dictated to our side how serious he was about attacking this problem, this most burdensome of problems, that chokes business at every turn. The member for Kooyong did me the great honour of coming to me very early upon my election, knowing that I came from a business background, and asking would I give him a hand. And I was humbled to do so.


The member for Kooyong has worked tirelessly, not just on the first repeal day but on this second repeal day. This is not the start of things; this is the continuation of a journey that this government will not turn its back on and that we will not make fun of. I understand—having been in business and having faced not just federal government but all three levels, which I will talk about later—what this looks like and what hurdles you have to jump through as a result.


I sat here for an hour and 35 minutes and watched those opposite laugh, interject and belittle every business operator in Australia, and treat them with disdain. And I say: shame on you. We are not only delivering—




Ms Brodtmann:
  Semicolons?




Mr LAUNDY:
  There it is again, 'hyphens and commas'. It shows you the depth of the business understanding on the other side. We went to the election with the commitment of $1 billion a year. I want to congratulate the parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, because today he announced $2.1 billion in savings. Keep it up, Josh! 


This government recognises the importance of cutting red tape. Every day we are looking for ways to build a strong and prosperous economy for Australia, and we are removing the burdens. A report released overnight by Deloitte Access states that government regulations cost $27 billion a year to administer—that is us—and cost businesses $67 billion a year to comply with. That is $94 billion—for those who have not done the mental arithmetic. 


We have established deregulation units across government, and each minister has been instructed to undertake portfolio audits and identify areas in his or her portfolio where overregulation is a problem. And there are many of these areas. You have heard about the 16,000 the former government took away; what they omitted to tell you about was the 21,000 pieces of new legislation in their last six-year term. That is just at a federal level, and that is on top of all the pre-existing legislation that already sits in the statute books that businesses have to deal with. 


As the Prime Minister said in his speech last night to the Business Council of Australia, 'Our job is to reduce regulations so that business is busy innovating rather than lobbying.' 




Mr Frydenberg:
  Hear, Hear!




Mr LAUNDY:
  I say 'hear, hear,' to that too, Member for Kooyong. One particular area of note in which we are achieving savings for Australian companies is our competitiveness agenda, where we have streamlined regulatory arrangements. Earlier this year I met with a range of industry representatives from the hygiene and cosmetics industry, and heard case after case of regulatory overlap, inefficiency, pointless bureaucracy, and duplication. 


And I will give you an example—I have said this in this House before—NICNAS, the TGA and APVMA cross three ministerial portfolios. Navigating products through those three portfolios was not only at the point of having ground to a halt, there was the absurd situation where a cosmetics company wanted to put some rolled oats into a pack to release for kids as a Christmas promotion. They were notified by NICNAS that it was, under their definitions, a chemical that could not be dispensed to children. Rolled oats? I don't know about you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta—I know you have a young family—but my kids live on rolled oats, especially in winter. 


This cross-ministerial portfolio—and bodies like NICNAS, TGA and APVMA, that operate off budget, that are a cost-recovery model—that is the stuff we are talking about here. That is what the member for Watson has missed completely. I notice he did not mention the one-stop shop for environmental approvals. I heard the member for Kooyong say $426 million in compliance costs—but, thinking as a businessman thinks, here is the kicker: it is estimated that we will gain $120 billion to the GDP of the economy over the next 12 years as a result.


One example the Prime Minister used last week was Cochlear. The member for Kooyong and I have spoken of this. Cochlear is very close to my family's heart for personal reasons. It is an organisation that I have spoken about prior in this place. We have changed the regulation to allow Cochlear to use the internationally recognised European Union certification—isn't that a mouthful—and avoid having to go through another certification process here in Australia. This means thousands of people will be able to access their devices up to a year earlier than they would been able to. These significant life-changing devices count, take it from me, on a personal level. To give you a local example, I met a gentleman in my electorate who closed his factory. It was too late; we could not save him, Member for Kooyong. He told me anecdotally that he has relocated his business and 22 jobs to New Zealand. Why? Because the cost of bringing chemicals into this country was prohibitive, and it was cheaper to do it in New Zealand. We change that today. Unfortunately for this gentleman and for the 22 Australians that lost their job it was too late, but it is not too late, looking forward, to ensure that this does not happen again.


While I applaud the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary for their work in this space, I cannot help but think to myself that there is so much more to do. I am not just talking about repealing unnecessary regulations and easing the burden of red tape for Australian business, as important as that is. In a week where we are challenging all in this place to have a mature and sensible debate about the future of our Federation, I believe what lies at the heart of this bill has been in fact a major failing of our Federation. I spoke in my maiden speech of the fact that with six states, two territories and a federal government, this country is like a business with nine head offices. When you add the 564 local governments across Australia, the problem becomes magnified in a way that is unsustainable and must be addressed.


At all three levels of government we are lacking people that come from a small and family business background—people who have a commercial understanding of what red tape looks like because they battle with it every day of their business life. They understand that every business in this country has two sides to their profit and loss statement, revenue and expenses, and that when revenue is soft the management of expenses becomes even more vital. Red tape has a direct impact on the expense side of every business in Australia. When you multiply the impact through each level of government it results in a dramatic increase in expenses and an equally dramatic decrease in business profits. In my mind, this is where the most massive failure of the past 113 years of our Federation lies.


We should not only have a mature and rational debate but also we must act. We must chance our mindset. Today, with my background in family business, I want to attempt to add to this debate in a way that I believe has been missing until today. What I am hoping to see is an understanding in government no matter federal, state or local that we are more than law makers and regulators—and here is the key—we are business partners. The past 113 years has focused far too heavily on the regulatory mentality without looking at the actions we take in this place through the eyes of a business partner, a partner who works to promote business and the enterprising spirit of Australians, rather than a government whose work all too often restrains Australian business.


Through our corporate tax system we take between 30c and 49c of every dollar of profit a business makes, depending on ownership structure. I cannot stress this enough: we are not simply regulators and legislators; we are stakeholders in the profitability of every business that calls Australia home.


To put the $94 billion in some context, if that is a company structure, a third is ours. The $94 billion of costs we are imposing takes $94 billion from business profitability in this country and we get between 30c and 49c in the dollar—to relate it back to the Deloitte Access Economics report released this morning. At this stage in our fiscal process we need to make sure that revenue through taxation is as high as it can be. We must change our thinking to be more than regulators. We are business partners. Rather than just legislators, we are stakeholders.


I am talking about cultural change, Member for Kooyong. In my maiden speech I challenged the ministers in this government to run their departments as you would run a business—lean and efficient. But, in saying that, I was short-sighted—as short-sighted as those that have come before me. Yes, ministers must lead from the front and promote this commercial mentality, but we must also work to encourage their departments to think like they are both regulators and stakeholders. It is the same challenge for them that it is for us. What I am trying to promote here is a complete change in culture. Ministers must continue to challenge their departments to streamline existing regulation and introduce future regulation in a way which makes the cost of complying as minimal as possible, so that profit can be as large as possible and so can our share.


We must have a mindset change across this entire parliament and look at the challenges ahead of the Australian economy with a more commercial approach. I believe it is vital for the Prime Minister to make these issues front and centre of COAG discussions. It should be a priority at the most senior levels of this country, as the more profit our businesses make the more revenue we as a government can collect through taxation and the more we can spend on the states and territories. With a coalition government, that revenue will be spent on large-scale projects that create jobs, improve productivity and promote prosperity throughout the country.


Given the fiscal position we find ourselves in as a nation, there is no doubt we need to address this revenue side of the government as well. But we must be smart about how we increase that revenue. In this respect I congratulate the Prime Minister for undertaking the white paper on reform of Australia's tax system, and I look forward to the discussions ahead in this area. It is time to have a mature and sensible discussion about the future of our Federation, but we cannot do that without pointing out the failings. When the regulatory framework ties up business, adds to their expenses and lowers their profitability to the point of pushing businesses offshore, these issues should be at the core of the debate. In his address last night, the Prime Minister said, 'We can be fans in the stands, we can be armchair critics or we can help to make it happen.' That is the call to arms. I congratulate the parliamentary secretary. That is his call to arms. He has done an outstanding job, and I am honoured to have been involved in this in some small part.


I would like to close with one thought to highlight how important this is. With a World Economic Forum global ranking of 124 out of 148 countries for 'burden of government regulation', it could not be more apparent that these measures today are urgent. They are a start and they need to continue not only for the future of our Federation but also, and much more importantly, for the future of our children.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (10:44):  One thing is clear: this is not much of a tea party. I know the parliamentary secretary is looking for an alternative form of engagement, but I do not recommend he looks to a role in the provision of high tea at the Windsor in that regard. What we see here is the supercharged rhetoric of the members opposite not matching the reality—the second time around. The last time we had this debate, the autumn repeal day—we talked about a bonfire. What we had was a bonfire of the vanity of the parliamentary secretary. It shows the priority of members opposite here that we are devoting today to ideology in place of substance. I think the member for Watson's contribution took us through that quite effectively. I did see the parliamentary secretary paying careful attention to the contribution of the shadow minister, as he should have done. 


I was interested to follow the member for Reid's speech for a couple of reasons.




Mr Frydenberg:
  Very good speech!




Mr GILES:
 I think it was a curate's egg of a speech. The one thing that was clear was the assessment of the member for Watson. The member for Watson's crystal ball worked pretty well, because it showed that the member for Reid had no interest in talking about the matters that are before the House.




Mr Nikolic:
  He has run small businesses, not like you.




Mr GILES:
  Yes, he has run a small business. That is not the matter which is before the House. He did not devote his speech to these three bills. I will take up the interjection, because he talked about vocations that people have before coming to this place that are worthwhile. I was pleased—and I think I can say touched!—that he recognised the front-line work of lawyers as being an appropriate calling to come here. So I thank the member for Reid for that. I was a little surprised to hear that, but I thank you for that vote of confidence. He talked about the need for a mature debate. What we have seen in the government's deregulatory agenda is anything but that. It is a triumph of stunts over substance.




Mr Frydenberg:
  You wish you came up with that.




Mr GILES:
  No, no. I will turn to that briefly, Parliamentary Secretary, because what Labor is interested in in this debate are the first principles. I think everyone in this place is opposed to unnecessary regulation. That is an easy statement to make. It is a little harder to give effect to, as this debate is demonstrating. Let us think about first principles. The member for Reid also touched on the Deloitte report, which has been reported on in today's The Age newspaper. I look forward to digesting that report. I noted the comments of Chris Richardson from Deloitte as reported in The Age. He said this:


Let's be clear. Rules and regulations are vitally necessary. They cement the key foundations of our society, protecting the rule of law and a wealth of standards in everything from health to safety and the environment.  


He went on to issue a challenge, a challenge that Labor members are up for, to look to the costs and to the benefits in enacting or, indeed, repealing legislation. To look at the costs and benefits—I think that is a pretty firm foundation for our engagement in this debate. It is very disappointing that the government's desire to manage the media cycle and no doubt to appease its ideological backers gets in the way of a proper consideration of the costs and benefits of particular pieces of legislation.


I was invited earlier to look to our record and I am very proud to do so. When you look at a worthwhile piece of deregulation, a worthwhile deregulatory agenda, I look at the former government's work through the COAG Reform Council and the Seamless National Economy. To touch on just one aspect of that which achieved great things in terms of consumer protection as well as productivity benefits and significant savings, I think about the step of establishing a single Australian consumer law—a single set of consumer protections—saving a billion dollars per annum. Sensible, effective, first-principles-informed deregulatory reform. Unnecessary regulation does not constitute the stunts that we are seeing today; it is a considered approach. Sometimes, as the member for Watson said, it is the routine business of government, the tidying up; on other occasions it is about doing hard work, having a mature debate. As has been said previously in this place, I believe by the member for Fraser, it is pretty clear to us that it is not a volume. This is not an exercise of piling up statutes, piling up hyphen-riven amendments; it is about the quality of the regulations, not the volume. That is pretty fundamental.


What we see here throughout this, in the desire to paint a clear ideological picture on the part of the member for Kooyong, are the ideological foundations of the debate going far beyond the practical matters that ought be considered here. Of the three bills that are before us today, I will largely confine my remarks to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, which amends and repeals legislation in Agriculture, Communications, Environment, Immigration, Border Protection, Industry, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Social Services, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs portfolios. Of course, it is one of three bills we will be debating today as part of the much vaunted spring repeal day package. But, despite the government's rhetoric, the savings in this bill are calculated to be a very small amount. To say it again: this is not much of a tea party. I note, as the member for Watson did, that this bill does not contain some of the measures that were outlined in the ministerial statement or some that have been featured reasonably prominently in media commentary. I will turn to this later in my contribution.


I note briefly the member for Watson dealt with the other two bills in his contribution and that these bills are largely concerned with repeal of amending legislation that is no longer in effect. I note briefly the irony of the parliamentary secretary effectively adding red tape in terms of enacting legislation that is clearly entirely redundant in terms of its effect.


Back in autumn I had the opportunity to speak on the previous omnibus repeal day during the consideration in detail stage, because, once again, the government lacks the courage of its convictions in this space and gagged debate there. It was not surprising that government members declined the opportunity to contribute to that debate, because then, as now, we have a lot of sound and fury that signify absolutely nothing. The parliamentary secretary then stood in this place, stood up loudly, beat his chest, made all kinds of claims about the Abbott's governments achievements at large. In fact, I particularly remember him invoking the great spirit of Menzies. It is telling that today in a less charged atmosphere he made no such invocations. I already have my doubts about this government being remembered favourably by anyone.


We have been remembering governments past in this place in recent weeks, and I think it bears us all reflecting on the enormous contrast between the breadth of vision, engagement and achievement of the Whitlam government and what we have seen in the past 14 months—achievements of substance by a government that transformed this country for the better or the combination of incoherence and ideology that has characterised this government. This is a government that does not do much, and what it does do it does badly. For instance, the Prime Minister associates this and the previous omnibus repeal bill with savings figures in the billions of dollars—although I note the parliamentary secretary has been dialling this down. Closer scrutiny of the explanatory memorandum reveals this figure to be relatively paltry for this bill. It is pretty small beer.


As the member for Watson has noted, this bill does not contain some of the deregulatory measures outlined in the ministerial statement—for example, ending the requirement to put mudflaps on motorbikes, changing OHS requirements for government building sites and changes to the Do Not Call Register are not among measures which are contained in this bill. Perhaps this may be seen as the Abbott government's competitive agenda in a nutshell: a series of announcements with very large numbers, and what is actually being achieved? Very little of substance.


Yesterday in this place we spent some time drawing out the government's hollow and vain rhetoric as it mutated into something much more sinister with the increase of the petrol tax. We saw the government facetiously cite the alcopops regulation, which took place under the former government, to justify this cynical circumventing of the parliament. This government is, effectively, comparing youth binge drinkers with everyday motorists. There is of course a massive difference between increasing the cost of alcopops to discourage youth binge drinking and this government's breaking of yet another election promise and increasing a tax that will hit people who are just trying to get to work or run some errands.


The Abbott government's own repeal day documents reveal the impact of the petrol tax ambush will be wider, with every petrol station to be slugged an amount of around $800 a year in new compliance costs to collect this tax. According to their own information, the government will hit the nation's 6,300 petrol stations with compliance costs totalling over $5 million. There is little doubt that this increased compliance cost will be passed on to motorists when they fill up at the bowser. They will be hit twice by this new petrol tax.


Make no mistake: this increase to the tax without concurrent spending on public transport will hurt the people I represent in the electorate of Scullin. There are, of course, limited and in many cases no alternatives to driving in Scullin and in outer suburbs right across Australia. We heard yesterday about where the revenue from this increase in the petrol tax will be going in Melbourne: to the east-west tollway, a tollway which does nothing for the people in Melbourne's northern suburbs except divert much-needed money away from investment in our roads and public transport.


I turn to one element of the bill in particular. We do have concerns about the effects of the bill. As well as the tidying up there are some matters of substance which do need to be attended to. In particular I am concerned about the reduction of information required to be contained in permits for the import or, indeed, the export of hazardous waste. I make this point: unlike those opposite, we do not believe that all environmental protection legislation is bad and in need of removal. We look to the evidence. We look to the first principles. I echo the contribution of that renowned socialist Chris Richardson of Access Economics. We look to the first principles to inform the necessity or otherwise of particular regulations. And it is particularly concerning to me that the parliamentary secretary has cited with such glowing approval the attempted repeal by the so-called Minister for the Environment of important environmental legislation in the EPBC Act. This reinforces the concerns I have that require further scrutiny. I note the aspect of the bill that I have touched upon—the proposed changes to hazardous waste—only saves $130,000. In this context I definitely think this is something which deserves much greater scrutiny before we potentially subject our environment to what could be devastating damage. 


As the member for Watson drew out quite effectively, the activity of repealing spent and redundant acts and legislative instruments is part of the normal operation of government. It is what every government does. It is what every government should do. It is telling that the achievements of this government are so thin they feel the need to shout this from the rooftops and dress it up in such rich ideological baggage. The Abbott government in putting before us these bills and the show that goes with them seem to be demanding applause for simply walking and chewing gum at the same time. Perhaps when we look at the record writ large that is a reasonable request. I repeat the words of the member for Watson: in government, without fanfare, without a song and dance, without wasting the parliament's time, Labor repealed 16,794 acts and instruments. Labor did not need a special day or days to do it; we got on with the job of government.


Really, underpinning this is a big debate about the role of government, and I do thank the member for Reid for touching upon that and for touching upon serious considerations about the future of Federation. But this is not a mature debate or how we should have a mature debate. What is really interesting about this bill and the related legislation—contrary to everything the member for Reid said—is that it reveals how ideologically driven the government is on the one hand and how narrow the scope of its ambitions are on the other.


This is a government that is obsessed with the notion that all government is bad and that a survival-of-the-fittest, dog-eat-dog world is the best. We have a contrary view. The weak should be protected from the strong. People need the law to be on their side when odds are stacked against them. And, while there is a real debate to be had about deregulation, it is through this first-principles frame that Labor will approach it, looking at what is necessary and not simply asserting it. This is a debate that has been entirely filled with assertion from members opposite. It is underpinned by a fundamental irony. In all this talk about reducing red tape, this package of bills, like the omnibus bills in the autumn, seem ultimately to be about making busywork to keep the member for Kooyong, the parliamentary secretary, busy.


The Australian people are entitled to something that is more than glib, disingenuous assurances that this bill does no harm. More scrutiny is necessary in relation to certain aspects of it, and that is why we have moved to have this bill subject to a Senate inquiry—a good and proper process. Labor continues to be committed to an organised and ongoing effort to minimise, simplify and create cost-effective regulation informed by first principles.


I started this contribution by noting that this does not constitute much of a tea party. This bill is all about ideology, celebrating a particular view of the world without giving that view particular expression, and that is the sad thing on the part of the parliamentary secretary. This is ultimately government members looking in the mirror and liking what they see, and that is fair enough, but the parliament's time would be much better spent debating our real priorities—the future of Medicare, the higher education reforms—not a narrow exercise in ideology dressed up as something that it is not.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (10:59):  I rise to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills. That the member for Scullin does not see them as 'a real priority' is extraordinary, because that just does not reflect the feedback I have been getting from people in my electorate—businesses, organisations and others. As Tasmania's representative on the coalition's deregulation committee, I am pleased to join my colleagues in welcoming this bill which sends another very powerful message to the people of Australia.


I am proud to join this outstanding parliamentary secretary who has been doing outstanding work in this space. Often we talk about leadership and, when you fundamentally distil it, leadership is an influence relationship. It is about standing next to the big problems of most concern to our community and doing something about them. This Prime Minister, the ministers in his cabinet and this parliamentary secretary are standing next to a very big problem that I hear about every day in my community. I hear them tell me that this is indeed a real problem for our community. The combined effect of the two repeal days, the one in March and the one we are having now, represents a doubling of our promised target. We said that we would save a billion dollars each year in red and green tape. This parliamentary secretary and the Prime Minister have delivered $2.1 billion in reduced compliance costs, with 400 measures to cut red tape across all agencies. That is, quite simply, real progress on problems that have a real impact on our national productivity.


What a contrast, in just the first year of the coalition government, with the inactivity in this area from those opposite during six years of 'hard Labor' from 2008 to 2013. You will no doubt recall Prime Minister Rudd's famous one on, one off promise—that for every new regulation that came through from the bureaucracy to the polity and out into our society, he would take one regulation out. He never met that promise. Indeed, what we saw was 21,000 new regulations come in—additional regulations—at the end of Labor's six years in office.


We have heard some comments this morning about lessons in economic history. I know the member for Kooyong is an economic historian. He looks at these things very carefully and he has written quite eloquently about the fact that, in the five financial years from mid-2007 until 2012, multifactor productivity in this country declined across Australia by three per cent. This is a real priority for our country because what we are doing will lift productivity; it will reduce the input costs on business, make them invest more and create more jobs. In my state of Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment rate in the country, that is particularly important.


In my home state of Tasmania I hear this persistent message from businesses, chambers of commerce and numerous other stakeholders. It reinforces what a red-hot button issue this is. They tell me about regulation imposing delays in getting projects approved and of the doubling up that occurs. I have people in the aged-care sector tell me that each year they have to go to hundreds of hours of effort to get their annual certification from both the state and the central government—hundreds of hours of essentially the same work. I have a small engineering firm telling me about an OH&S problem. The proprietor laid a harness down in front of me that is used for working on tall buildings. To me it looked like a new harness—the D-rings were in great shape, the stitching was in great shape—but he had to replace that harness simply because of its age. He had to get it checked twice every year—usually by people associated with the union movement and who imposed a cost on checking that harness—not because it was unsafe but because the binding, stifling regulation imposed by those opposite imposed that additional cost on his business. He would rather have been using that money to invest in his business.


Fixing these things is not a stunt, as the member for Scullin and his colleagues say it is. We are doing what we should do—listening to the people in our community and taking action. It is not as if Labor was not warned about the stifling impacts of their regulatory regime. Julia Gillard's own Borthwick-Milliner review in 2012, which looked at her government's regulation impact assessment processes, said 'a widespread lack of acceptance of and commitment by ministers and agencies' was a serious impediment to their effective use. The Gillard government was warned about the impact of their regulatory regime and they would not change because what we saw, in six years of Labor, was a deeply ingrained cultural foundation of risk aversion and centralised control. Every issue was always likely to get another regulatory sprinkle from Julia Gillard or Kevin Rudd. That was seen as the solution to all problems—a little bit more Julia and a little bit more Kevin.


That is not good enough today, and the Abbott government has meaningfully addressed these concerns. We are ingraining a different culture within the bureaucracy and the polity. The Prime Minister himself has taken the lead on these issues. He has made regulatory reform a criterion of success for his ministers—the bureaucrats whose pay is linked to how successful they are at taking away some of those binding coils of regulation that stifle productivity in our country.


What we are trying to achieve is unity of purpose. We are trying to get the federal government and the state governments working more closely together. I will give you two examples of where that did not occur in the past. My predecessor, in mid-2011, opened a $1 million Building the Education Revolution facility at the Ringarooma Primary School at the same time that the state education minister—a Green in the Labor cabinet—was planning to close the Ringarooma Primary School. It was a clear case of left-hand, right-hand, with the Labor-Green government in Canberra and the Labor-Green government in Hobart each not knowing what the other was doing.


Nicola Roxon, I remember, came to Tasmania when she was the health minister to announce new beds for Northern Tasmania at the same time that the state government was disinvesting in health to the point that the Launceston General Hospital was closing two wards. On the one hand, there was the federal government saying, 'Here is money for new beds' and, on the other hand, the state government was disinvesting and taking money out of the healthcare system. We have a better health minister today who will make sure, in consultation with Michael Ferguson—that outstanding health minister in Tasmania—that will never happen again.


As a courtesy to my colleagues, I will keep my remarks much shorter than I intended. There are a huge number of speakers on our side of the House, but I will end where I started by congratulating the member for Kooyong, that outstanding parliamentary secretary who is making a real difference in leading the effort to make sure that red tape does not continue to spiral out of control and we make a real difference with the regulatory regime in this country.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:07):  I speak in relation to Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 and the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014. In a day that would rival New Year's Day in the affection of Australians, we are now celebrating yet another of the Abbott government's repeal days; another day that will launch a million-dollar press release—not a billion-dollar press release; another day that borrows from the US Republican playbook, and another day when the government expects a standing ovation for simply doing the everyday task of government: repealing spent and redundant acts and legislative instruments.


This was work that the Labor government, when we were in power, did without fuss and fanfare. I spoke on these types of bills many, many times in the previous six years under the Labor government but I do not recall too many of the coalition members actually speaking. In fact, many times these types of bills were sent to the Federation Chamber, where there was bipartisan agreement—getting rid of a comma or a semicolon, obsolete wording, errors of drafting and the like. Of course the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014 corrects drafting errors, modernises language, removes gender-specific language and repeals spent and obsolete provisions and acts. It is a bit like what we did when we were in government, but we did not set aside a whole day and issue press releases saying how wonderful we were.


The Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 repeals about 650 amending acts or repeal acts between 1970 and 1979. That is all it was. Most of those provisions are spent, obsolete and redundant. Of course that is a big deal, according to this government. I think those opposite must be reading from the talking points of their ministers in relation to billions of dollars, because the truth is that these three bills together provide savings of $1.855 million including, by the way, the largest being in my shadow portfolio area of ageing, which is about $1.16 million in relation to notifications. That is what the explanatory memorandum and the documents associated with this particular legislation show.


That is as the shadow minister, the member for Watson, talks about—just 0.1 per cent of the figure claimed by the government. When we get those opposite talking like this about how wonderful this legislation is, it reminds me that the coalition is great at over-egging and scaremongering but also great at over-egging their achievements. This is what they are doing here today.


We demonstrated our commitment to minimising, simplifying and creating cost-effective legislation. We worked with the states and territories through the COAG process. Remember the COAG process? In my portfolio area of Indigenous affairs, the coalition does not seem to be working at all through the COAG process. It abolished the COAG Reform Council, which was measuring how the government was achieving the Closing the Gap targets—and it was supposed to be partisan, by the way. It is doing nothing through the COAG process in Indigenous health—in fact, that is the evidence that departmental officials gave to the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs that I am a member of. The government was supposed to be dealing with the COAG process in agreeing to the bipartisan targets for justice, because of the terrible incarceration rate in this country for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was supposed to be agreeing with us that, no matter which side of politics got in in September 2013, justice targets and Closing the Gap would be worked on. 


However, when we were in government we worked through the COAG process on the Seamless National Economy reforms. These reforms were about reducing the cost of business, and they were a success. In 2012 the Productivity Commission—not an organisation affiliated with the Australian Labor Party—assessed 17 of these reforms for its report Impacts of COAG reforms: business regulation and VET. The Productivity Commission suggested that these 17 reforms would increase the GDP by about 0.4 per cent, over $6 billion, and reduce business costs by about $4 billion a year. They estimated that the full implementation of those reforms that Labor pursued in government would lead to a dramatic increase in national productivity. 


In contrast, we have the coalition government talking about their wonderful work, without acknowledging—and speaker after speaker today has not acknowledged—the nearly 17,000 acts and legislative instruments that Labor got rid of when we were in government. Often the changes we made were minor, but we did not break into a tap dance at the dispatch box when we made them. We removed redundant regulations, sunset clauses and other provisions that needed correction. We did it because that is what any government does. We did it without pointscoring, and it was often a bipartisan approach. 


As I have said, I have spoken many times in relation to this legislation. I cannot say I gave my best speeches in the House of Representatives on it, but this legislation often was passed without any razzamatazz at all, to be honest. The majority of measures in this particular omnibus repeal day bill simply involve, as I said, repeal of redundant provisions. They are not contentious. They do not have any deregulatory savings attached to them. It is somewhat curious that the Prime Minister mentioned in his ministerial statement certain things—which were later reported in the media—that were going to be put in this particular legislation, including, for example, the requirement to attach mudflaps to motorbikes, changes to the Do Not Call Register by removing the requirement to reregister every eight years, and changes to occupational health and safety on government building sites. Many of these measures remain. 


No matter how much the government keeps talking about these things and over-egging these measures, the truth is that none of them will change the world in any dramatic way and they will not save much in terms of dollars in compliance costs. For example, we see in the bill the abolition of the Fishing Industry Policy Council of Australia. Just briefly, the Fishing Industry Policy Council of Australia was established under the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to provide a forum for the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries Services Australia and fishing industry officials. The forum has not convened, by the way, since the enabling legislation commenced, so abolishing it will not save a dollar. Also in the agricultural portfolio, the bill amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to reflect certain payments to industry marketing and research bodies that are no longer made and, in fact, have not been made since 2008. The amendments will not save a dollar in compliance costs. 


In the communications portfolio, Australians will no doubt be relieved to learn that the bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 so that ACMA can publish its notices in a variety of methods. Currently, the Broadcasting Services Act requires ACMA to publish notices in the Commonwealth government gazette. This bill enables ACMA to publish these notices on its website and in newspapers. Gee! That is groundbreaking stuff. Thank goodness we have devoted a whole day in the chamber to this sort of stuff. The bill also repeals a redundant section in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, as SBS has assumed television production and supply of activities previously undertaken by the National Indigenous TV Limited. 


In relation to other areas, another measure that is unlikely to set the cat amongst the pigeons is the abolition of the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council. From now on, the Department of the Environment will be able to engage with industry experts on a needs basis to gather advice and guidance on review process and other matters relating to the Product Stewardship for Oil Scheme. 


In the immigration portfolio, the bill repeals the Customs (Tariff Concession System Validations) Act 1999. The purpose of this act is to validate particular decisions in relation to tariff concession orders that were made between 15 July 1996 and 31 May 1999. Decisions outside the period that ended 15 years ago are not affected and are therefore redundant. The omnibus bill repeals and amends a whole range of acts in relation to industry.


In terms of my shadow portfolio area, we are seeing some changes in relation to HACC. There is the repeal of the Home and Community Care Act. The act was redundant when the bilateral Home and Community Care program review agreements were deemed national partnership agreements—remember those national partnership agreements? Those opposite do not really like them—under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. We are getting rid of provisions in an act of parliament that are no longer necessary. So that is great; it will save a lot of money! A provision in the Aged Care Act that the sector really like, that we support and that is the largest deregulation savings in this bill—$1.160 million of $1.855 million will be saved—removes the obligation for approved providers to notify the secretary of the Department of Social Services of certain changes to key personnel within 28 days. We support that. We think it is a sensible measure in relation to the act, and so we support this provision. We are going to be as bipartisan as best we can. It is pity that the coalition has not adopted a bipartisan approach on the dementia and severe behaviours supplement or the dementia and cognition supplement. One program is oversubscribed and the government has been incompetent in relation to it; the other is undersubscribed and the government is not rolling out support for people with dementia in their homes. So it is good that government can actually focus on this stuff—but how about them focusing on the stuff that counts in the aged care portfolio. 


We will see some amendments in relation to Indigenous affairs. This goes back to the days of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. When ATSIC were in operation, they used to make certain grants and loans to individuals and bodies and also to guarantee certain loans made to those individuals and bodies. When ATSIC were abolished, that power was passed to organisations like the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Indigenous Business Australia. What the proposal in this bill does is change the vesting of the statutory consent so that those bodies or, indeed, the Commonwealth, by the way, can waive the exercise of its statutory consent power by providing written notice to that organisation that its consent no longer be required. It is going to save a lot of money. To be honest, I think it is a pretty basic provision, and we will support it. 


I have some real concerns about the amendments to the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, because one of the first acts of the Northern Territory government was to get rid of the Banned Drinkers Register, which the Northern Territory Labor government had successfully implemented. It was making a difference in the Northern Territory in reducing the shocking rate of alcohol abuse, which is directly linked to assaults on women and children and other Indigenous people in the Territory. Indigenous women in this country are 31 times more likely to be hospitalised because of assault by a partner or from familial abuse than non-Indigenous women; in the Northern Territory, it is about 80 times. We tried to implement alcohol management in the Northern Territory, which was supposed to be supported by the coalition government when they were in opposition. However, they have gone slow on alcohol management plans. Also, they have not said a peep about the CLP government in the Northern Territory, whose policies have opened the door to more alcohol abuse and more assaults in the Northern Territory. 


A submission given to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs by the Northern Territory police—that is, a union submission—mentioned by the way in relation to this legislation before the chamber that there is a direct correlation between alcohol abuse, assaults, violence and criminality in the Northern Territory. What is the government doing here, in relation to this legislation? They are saying, 'We don't think an independent review is required under the legislation for the operation of Commonwealth and Northern Territory laws relating to alcohol in the Northern Territory.' That takes from the transparency and accountability that a review of how those policies are impacting in the Northern Territory would provide. This is what they are saying. As a member of the standing committee looking at alcohol management in Indigenous communities, I say that the trouble is that the Northern Territory government is not cooperating with this standing committee. It has stifled evidence again and again and has been stopping us from getting that evidence 


We have had non-cooperation from their colleagues and comrades in the Northern Territory and they are proposing that, because we have got an inquiry now and there is another formal review that the government is doing with the Northern Territory, that is good enough. I do not think it is good enough, to be honest with you. The other thing is simply getting rid of a provision that we think has some merit in relation to getting rid of the minister's power to request the Northern Territory government to appoint an assessor to conduct an assessment where they have not got the power to enforce the assessment in relation to licensing premises in certain circumstances. We think that is appropriate. The government has really over-egged itself in terms of this legislation before the chamber.

"Williams, Matt, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:22):  I find it quite amusing that the member for Blair came to us today and said that Labor have done a great job with deregulation and taking out so many regulations. If that was the case, why have we got so many industry associations and so many businesses that come and speak to me and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and say, 'We need to change this: we need to get rid of the compliance here and reduce the red tape there'? If they did their job properly, we would not be here today. 


What are we doing? We are making some really significant changes in so many areas and it is important to our country because the reduction of not only red tape but also compliance costs will make it easier for businesses and easier for government departments. I have been working with the parliamentary secretary, as many of us have over the year, to address these blockages and get some real results. So whether I speak to those associated with the health industry or the freight and logistics councils at a national level, they say to me, 'Yes, we're talking to Josh, yes, he's moving on this and making some real inroads.' That is why we are here today to announce some of these important changes.


In my state at a local level I have been talking to many industry associations such as resources and energy, the freight council, restaurant and catering, aged care, building and construction and local government. All of them say that there are areas of red tape and compliance that we need to do better with. That is what we have done.


On energy and resources, I want to talk about the environmental approvals. We have two of the key players here. The Minister for the Environment has done very well working with the South Australian Labor government. I do not often have reason to give credit to the South Australian Labor government—the member for Makin might be interested in this as well—but they have done well to sign a bilateral agreement to streamline environmental assessments as part of the Commonwealth government's one-stop shop reform. As we know, these new agreements create a single environmental assessment process and, in particular, they remove the duplication of federal, state and territory planning, which adds to time and costs for environmental approvals. Importantly, they save around $420 million a year. 


We have even got a former Labor minister, Martin Ferguson, who sees the wisdom in this policy who says it is a priority to implement. We hope all will get on board with this important initiative so that it can progress important projects such as job creation projects in my home state, including many in the mining sector, that require approvals at the environmental and planning stage. We have seen delays happen at Olympic Dam with BHP Billiton. This has been an issue in the past and we need to get our head around it and make some changes, as we have proposed, going forward. We had two-and-a-half years after the initial release for public consultation of the environmental approvals to when it was actually approved. This is the type of situation we need to prevent.


On key areas of importance for my state in terms of defence: the Defence Materiel Organisation will benefit from e-tendering project facilities to facilitate the electronic communication of tender requirements—$2.6 million in compliance costs saved. The Australian Standard for Defence Contracting templates is another important initiative that will reduce between five to 10 days of work for industry—another $1 million of compliance costs removed. I mentioned resources and energy before. The non-defence use of the Woomera prohibited area has been put through and it is an important initiative to simplify the process by which mining and resources businesses gain access to this area by introducing standard permit arrangements.


In terms of small business, as outlined in the 2014 autumn repeal day we have got a helpline to assist small business owners with advice on employee wages and workplace laws. I know from my wife's experience and others who talk to me in small business that these changes in laws and the information they need in some of these more technical areas are sometimes beyond them. So that is where this helpline is of great importance.


Finally, I just want to refer to a couple of other things affecting other sectors of our economy. One is the financial reporting for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, so that they submit the same financial reports on their annual information statements, and the other is ATO's new online tax service, myTax. Generally across government there are a whole lot of different initiatives in terms of online point of access for government services that are important changes. Local clubs and organisations who are limited by guarantee with less than $1 million in revenue no longer require an auditor. This was previously required through audited financial reports. Again, these are important changes. Today Deloitte released a report showing the impact of red tape—costing $27 billion to administer. 


We need to keep chipping away, keep making inroads and keep getting results. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Josh Frydenberg; the Prime Minister, who is driving this as well; and ministers, like the environment minister who is here, are doing a great job of getting results and helping businesses and government organisations for a better society.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:28):  What a lot of fuss and feet-stamping and stomping around the place! They are like kids who have just learned how to play in a new playground. They have just been given a new playground in the last 12 months and here the Liberals are in government, stomping around going, 'Look at me, look at me, look at all the great things we are doing.' The only problem is, they are just not doing anything that great. In fact, they are just doing the ordinary, mundane, everyday work that parliaments do and have done since time immemorial. Parliaments do this every single day. 


In fact, when Labor was in government we got rid of some 16,734 pieces of regulation. We did not make a song and dance about because there was no need—it is the ordinary work of government. That is what government does. It is meant to introduce new and improved regulations to make people's lives better and allow small business people to enjoy better protections and have more efficient systems of government and taxation and a whole range of things. At the same time, it should take away regulations that are redundant, superfluous, outdated and just do not do anything. To take away hyphens, commas, full stops, dot points and misspellings within acts is fine—all of that Labor supports. In fact, we support the bills that are before us, because there is nothing extraordinary or even ordinary in here; it is less than ordinary.


The three bills we are discussing today are the government's so-called repeal day legislation. There should be a repeal day every single day. Why leave it to just one day? Why should the parliament stop its ordinary work to have this special day where the government says: 'Look at us. Please give us a medal for doing our work'? It is the equivalent of ordinary workers who go to work every day and saying, 'On Monday I want a medal for going to work.' That is what the minister wants. He wants a medal for doing his job. Most people are happy to have the job and do the job. They may get accolades later but not before they have done it. The minister has not even done it yet and he wants the accolades and the medal today.


The country is stopping on the repeal day. This is so important for the government. On top of wanting a medal for it they want to have their own special day. This is the Liberal Party's special day. They go: 'Look at us. We want a special day so we can repeal the sort of stuff that was around in 1910, 1920 and 1930 that does not apply to anyone.' They have this whole hullabaloo over all this stuff. I actually feel sorry for the member for Kooyong because very soon—and it might even be today—he is going to run out of dot points, hyphens, misspellings and commas. He comes in here claiming he is going to fix the budget and the woes of the world comma by comma—'We will fix the economy comma by comma and dot point by dot point. We will take away the misspellings and redundant pieces of legislation.' 


All that would be a lot of fun. I would enjoy it and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would too. You would enjoy it. We could all come in here and have a national repeal day. I know let us have a national turn up to work day. Let us have a national we will talk in parliament day. Let us have a national the sun came up this morning day. Let us have the Liberal Party is really great day. Why don't we just do one of those? It will make them feel a lot better. 


Why don't the government actually do something real? This stuff here—and I will be very kind and fair here—is just rubbish. It is rubbish because it just does not do anything. There is a whole heap of fuss over absolutely nothing. The Labor Party are prepared to support this not on the basis that it is great or does anything outstanding or changes the world; just because it is something we would do every day of the week anyway. We will let it slide through. It is nothing special. We do not disagree with the government that we should take away commas that are in the wrong place, fix the misspellings and all the rest of it. It is a shame that the government try to pin badges on themselves and give themselves medals for doing this and say that somehow they are going to save all of us from something they have created in the first place.


The tragedy though—the really bad news—is that they are using this as a mask or a cloak because in other bills they are taking away consumer protection laws and regulations. Those good regulations are designed to protect ordinary mums and dads from losing not just hundreds of thousands of dollars but, for some, their whole life savings. I have seen it. I am tired of it. I am sure some members of the Liberal Party are tired of seeing ordinary working people lose their life savings to scammers and fraudsters. Labor worked very hard with the sector and the industry for many years to change the culture, lift the standards and lift education to make sure that in financial services we can protect people as best we can. It is sad but there are unfortunately people who do bad things and some of those bad things lead to people losing their life savings. What did we see this government do in the name of deregulation? It took away the consumer protection laws that we put in place that were designed to help protect them. 


What else did the government do with this so-called repeal of regulations? They took away from small business $4 billion worth of assistance. The member for Kooyong is still in the chamber. It is nice to see him listening to me. I am obviously saying things that are important enough for him to stay, so I thank him. The member for Kooyong should have a very close look at how much money the government—the so-called friends of small business—have taken away from small business. Small business used $4 billion worth of direct assistance. Small business in this country benefited to the tune of more than $4 billion in direct assistance that Labor put in place to help them through a range of things such as tough economic times and to reduce the regulatory burden and red tape to make life easier for them. 


On their first day on the job what did the so-called friends of small business, the Liberal Party, do? They smashed it. They took away more than $4 billion worth of direct assistance. There was the tax loss carry back, which meant that small business could improve their cash flow position and could invest in new equipment and people. There was the instant asset write-off, which under the Liberal Party was $1,000. When Labor got to government we gave small business $6,000 because we understood that this was a really important measure. Our policy at the last election was to take that to $10,000 because we know that small business will make best use of that assistance by investing it, and the only way they can get it is by investing in their business.


People can stick badges on themselves. I am getting the drift here too of what the government are actually about—and I thank the member for Kooyong. They want a medal for turning up to work every day. They love to drape the flag over themselves and talk about grandiose things. Now they want to have conversations about the Federation. Where have they been for the last 100 years? We have all been having conversations about the Federation. Is this Rip Van Winkle hour or something? Suddenly they have discovered there is a Federation and there may be some efficiency issues and to deal with those they have to work with the states. Well, hello? Hello, Liberal Party? Is there anyone inside? Is there anyone home? 


This is the stuff that governments do every single day of the week. You do not need a special day off for it, a day off from the ordinary work of the parliament, so we can hear the Minister for Small Business. I am listening for him, but there is dead silence. I cannot hear the Minister for Small Business. Where is the Minister for Small Business? Shouldn't he be banging the table and saying, 'We are the best friend of small business.' They love to badge themselves. I am really picking up the theme here. They cloak themselves in defence, national security and the Australian flag. Under that cloak you can do whatever you like and no-one can criticise you. Once you drape the flag over yourself, you are safe. Anything you do is in the name of national security so it is just okay. Where is the Minister for Small Business, who drapes the Australian flag over himself and says he is the best friend of small business? Where is he? I thank those in the gallery. I hope I gave you a little bit of good news and some entertainment.


When the Minister for Small Business remains silent on key issues within his portfolio that directly impact on small business negatively he is being derelict. It is derelict of his duty, derelict of his position and a snub to small business. Small-business people are hard-working people. I hear him, whether he is at the dispatch box or talking to some group, talk about the love that he has for small business. I would say to him: show some, stand up for small business and give them back some of the things that Labor had already put in place that the minister and the Liberal government have taken away. Do not just keep professing your love for small business; demonstrate it, show that love and give them something back because you took it away.


On his first day on the job, the Minister for Small Business's duty was to take an axe and wield it across small business, basically defund assistance programs and then claim credit for all the things we put in place—online reporting, streamlining of the Superannuation Clearing House, business name registrations. The list goes on and on of the hard work, the hard lifting and the stuff we got criticised for because the implementation is always complex and difficult. But, as a government, that is your job. That is what you are elected to do. So we went and did it. The Liberals then came to government, claimed credit for it and now they say 'look at us' while they drape themselves in a badge of repeal day.


It is the Liberal Party day-off day. The interesting thing about the Liberal Party day off today is they had a whole heap of their members on the list to speak on this stuff. They gagged their own members because their own members did not have anything to say. This is outrageous that we have this in the parliament.


Other people might say, and you would have heard this figure thrown around the place, there will be $2 billion worth of savings. Let us have a look for savings today. What are the savings contained in the omnibus repeal day bill as per the Liberal Party and as per what the bills say? Wait for it; it is not in the billions, it is not in the hundreds of millions and it is not even in the tens of millions—we getting down to really small numbers. Imagine the trillions of dollars that are in the national economy. Apparently the savings identified in this bill are a tidy $1.335 million. So all the hullabaloo, all the fuss, all the foot stamping around the place was for 1.1 $.335 million.


I welcome the one million bucks. This is good news, of course it is. But it just does not deserve the Liberal Party having a day off. Today is national Liberal Party day-off day and Tony Abbott wants two of these a year. He has already had a day-off day and now he wants to have another Liberal Party day-off day where they do not have to do much because the bills are here. They do not want speak on it because they have gagged their own speakers. So what are they going to do for the day? They can all just go and have a rest. There will be no divisions on this stuff because Labor is supporting it.


It is the Liberal Party have a day off day. Everybody else has to go to work. Everybody else does not get a medal for turning up on Wednesday to work, except the Liberal Party. They want a day off and they want a medal too. They want a medal for not turning up for work. This is just unbelievable.


Deregulation should be about deregulation. What are we actually looking at? What is in these bills? There are no deregulatory savings attached to the bills. So, minus claimed savings that are so small they are effectively, in budgeting terms, zero, have a look at what this represents in the claimed overall figure. The claimed overall figure they are going to save is $2 billion—there are a lot of zeros attached to that one. But according to the bill today—national Liberal Party day off repeal day—it will be 0.1 per cent. Where is the rest of it—you would have to start asking the question.


Apparently we are going to have two more of these repeal days. On the basis of just two so far, if we want to work down sliding scale, if it starts up here then it hits the floor on day 2. What does day 3 look like? When we get to No. 3 it is going to be the interesting bit. When they run out of commas, dot points, hyphenations and other bits of redundant legislation, what is next? I do not know. Maybe the next Liberal Party speaker can enlighten us on what they are going to get rid of next.


I know what they are doing though. They are slashing funding to small business, slashing funding to universities, increasing university fees to $100,000 and introducing a new GP tax. They said there would be no new taxes and no increased taxes yet what we are seeing are not only new taxes but also increased taxes. And then they claim that increasing the indexation is not an increase. Well, if it is not an increase then why did the Treasurer come in yesterday and say, 'Sure it is going to cost you more but it is only a little bit.' So, yes, it is going to hurt you but it is only going to hurt you a little. I get the nuance. Some in the Liberal Party say it is not an increase; it is actually a decrease. Others say it is going to hurt a little bit. Whether it hurts a little bit or a lot, it is still a broken promise. A broken promise is a broken promise.


The Prime Minister, when in opposition, came in again wrapping himself in the Australian flag, cloaking himself in national security and carrying on about getting rid of red tape. It is going to get rid of so much red tape you get the impression there is going to be none left. They are talking about compliance, defence and all the rest of it. The Liberal Party's trajectory and view on this is: let's get rid of red tape. The impression is that it is going to get down to zero. There will be no red tape, no compliance, no need to adhere to any rules, no regulations. I am with you, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, it would probably be taking it too far, wouldn't it? I agree 100 per cent. If it cannot be down to zero compliance, there must be some compliance. Why do we have regulations and laws? Why do we have compliance? Because it is actually good for people to have laws on the road to protect them and keep them safe, laws for small business to protect them and keep them safe from predators and big business, and a whole range of other really good things. Today is a farce. It is the national Liberal Party day-off day. (Time expired)

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (11:43):  I am very pleased to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring) Bill 2014. The measures in this bill will have a significant impact on reducing red tape across a range of portfolio areas. In the time available to me, I would like to make three points: firstly, unnecessary red tape is a serious problem facing our nation and our economy; secondly, the Abbott government is determined to reduce red tape; and, thirdly, in the communications sector—for which I have some portfolio responsibility as parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Communications—the minister and I have a strong focus on reducing red tape.


Let's start with the general proposition that red tape is a serious problem in our economy. It is clear that the prevalence of red tape has a negative impact on productivity. If you compare how Australia performs against other nations in the world, in 2014 we ranked 124th out of 148 countries for the burden of government regulation in the World Competitiveness Index. The cost of doing business in Australia relative to other nations is too high—simply too high. The Productivity Commission, for example, estimates that regulatory compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP—that is a staggering number.


And I would like to acknowledge here the outstanding work done while the coalition was in opposition by our red-tape reduction task force, chaired by Senator Arthur Sinodinos, with deputy chairs Kelly O'Dwyer, the member for Higgins, and Senator David Bushby. In particular, I would like to quote from something that Senator Sinodinos said in a speech in 2012:


Unnecessary red tape is a contributing factor to Australia's productivity challenge. The Productivity Commission estimates that reducing red tape will boost national GDP by $12 billion a year. Across industry, it's believed red tape accounts on average for four per cent of business costs.


The second reason why red tape is a serious problem is its tendency to continue to grow. If government does not take decisive action the unfortunate reality is that red tape tends to be ever expanding. Reporting obligations which are in place and which have been put there for all the best reasons tend to grow and grow and grow. The great virtue of the promise that this government made—or that the coalition made when in opposition and that we are implementing now that we are in government—to have two repeal days a year is that you have a systematic and continuing focus on the growth of regulation and opportunities to remove regulation—regulation that has outlived its usefulness or regulation, the cost of which exceeds the benefit.


The need for this action in relation to regulation and in relation to red tape is only increased because we have the misfortune of succeeding a government in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government which showed an extraordinary enthusiasm for adding regulatory burden to the Australian economy. The Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government—added over 21,000 new regulations and repealed 105, notwithstanding the promise made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, in 2007 that his government would have a 'one regulation in, one regulation out' policy. That was a promise that was never honoured.


And there is plenty of evidence of the pressure that this was imposing on participants in the economy. Let me refer you, for example, to the October 2012 National Red Tape Survey conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This was a survey of 870 businesses across all states and territories, which found that 73 per cent of businesses believed that the overall regulatory compliance burden had increased in the previous two years and that 60 per cent of businesses spent more than $5,000 per annum directly on costs related to regulatory requirements. And there is a long and depressing list of regulatory burdens that were in place at the time that the previous government had completed its handiwork—for example, the national child care law of 180 pages plus an additional 345 pages of regulations and 1,149 pages of guidelines. There was the reality that universities typically have regulatory compliance departments with 15, 20 or more staff dedicated to ensuring compliance with over 100 separate state and federal acts. In Indigenous service delivery, as at the time that the previous government left office, there were more than 200 Indigenous related programs administered by 17 Commonwealth agencies. Each program had its own application form and processes. And there is the example from the resources sector of one particular project which required 4,000 meetings before approval was granted and on which 12,000 state and 300 Commonwealth conditions were ultimately placed.


So under the previous government we had a very enthusiastic set of regulators who added substantial new regulatory burdens on a continuing basis every day they turned up for work. The previous speaker, the member for Oxley, spoke about turning up for work. There is no doubt that the previous government saw its role as being to increase regulation. Indeed, the previous Manager of Government Business, the member for Grayndler, used to enjoy telling the House how many pieces of legislation had been passed, because the only metric that he seemed to think was important was how many new laws and how much additional regulatory burden had come into force. On this side of the House we take a different perspective. We want to carefully look at the laws and regulations that are in place and ask, 'Are they still fit for purpose? Are they still delivering benefits which exceed their costs?'


That brings me to the second proposition that I want to put today: the determination of the Abbott government to reduce red tape; to have a process which acts as a corrective to the institutional factors which drive red tape to increase. The approach that we have taken has been warmly welcomed by many sectors of the community. But I want to quote particularly somebody from the non-profit sector—the community sector. Tony Nicholson, the executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence said, 'We warmly welcome the government's red-tape reduction agenda. Streamlining our reporting and compliance requirements makes a real difference as it frees up resources to be directed towards helping disadvantaged young families.'


I think that is a very powerful reminder, in the context of that particular organisation's mission, that time and resources which are allocated to meeting compliance requirements and reporting requirements are time and resources which are diverted from the core mission of any organisation which is subject to regulation. That is something those on the opposite side are very happy to ignore but it is something that those on this side of the parliament are acutely conscious of.


That is one reason why in coming to government we have set a very aggressive target in terms of the dollar value of the savings we want to deliver in reduction in compliance costs. Pleasingly, we are at a point where we have reached a net reduction of over $2 billion in compliance costs so far. The bill before the House today continues this work by removing almost 1,000 pieces and some 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation. And it builds on the work of the first repeal day in March of this year, when over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation and over $700 million of compliance costs were removed.


Thirdly, I would like to turn to some of the specific initiatives in the communications sector, where we are taking very seriously the importance of working to identify items of regulation which have served their purpose and are no longer required and where there is a capacity to remove that regulation and deliver benefit to industry participants and to consumers. That is of particular importance when you have a sector like the communications sector which is very heavily regulated and which is changing very quickly. As the technology is evolving at a rapid rate there are multiple instances of regulatory provisions which are no longer fit for purpose. They simply deal with, for example, industry practices or technologies which are no longer used. There is good potential to identify deregulatory initiatives in the communications sector and that has been the focus of the Minister for Communications and myself as his parliamentary secretary.


I want to highlight one set of measures in the legislation before the House this morning which is of importance in this general deregulatory thrust in the communications portfolio. Throughout the legislation in the portfolio there are extensive and prescriptive requirements in relation to consultation. For example, section 87A(9) of the Broadcasting Services Act requires the Australian Communications and Media Authority to seek public comment before imposing, varying or revoking conditions of a community TV license. Section 126 of the Broadcasting Services Act requires the Australian Communications and Media Authority to seek public comment before determining, varying or revoking a program standard under part 9 of the act. There are similar provisions in the Interactive Gambling Act, the Radiocommunications Act and the Telecommunications Act—all of them quite prescriptive and detailed. But this is the point: at the same time there is a general regime applicable to all regulators, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority and other agencies within the communications portfolio. Section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act requires that a rule maker, subject to limited exceptions must be satisfied that appropriate and reasonably practicable consultation has been undertaken prior to making a legislative instrument. That is a good principle. Of course, there ought to be reasonable and appropriate consultation before a legislative instrument is made. But when that principle is in place and has the force of law and applies as a general principle across the activities of all regulators and all rule makers, it really does cause you to ask the question: why do we additionally have a series of specific provisions which do exactly the same thing? One of the changes contained in the bills before the House this morning is to remove a series of provisions in the communications portfolio pieces of legislation which set out specific consultation requirements on the basis that the general requirement to consult, in section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act, will remain in place. 


I want to emphasise that there is not going to be any variance of the general principle of the importance of consultation, but that duplication will be removed and potentially there will be more flexibility in the mode of consultation, provided it meets that overriding test of being appropriate and reasonably practicable. 


The measures in the bills with regard to the communications portfolio are important ones and they complement other measures that we are taking as part of this second repeal day. For example, we are moving to a one-time sign-up system for the Do Not Call Register. The importance of this is that there are some nine million telephone numbers on the Do Not Call Register and it would hitherto have been a requirement, had we not made this change, that all of those people who are on the register would have been required to renew their registration, because there was a time limit on the previous status of having your number on the register. We have removed that requirement and that reflects the fact that millions of people have exercised a choice; they have made a conscious choice and we have removed the requirement for them to have to reregister. That is going to save a lot of time and money. 


Another reform which reduces red tape in the communications portfolio is a relaxation of the requirements applying to so-called battery backup for the National Broadband Network. Under the previous government's approach, consumers were required to have a battery backup system installed, regardless of their desire or need to have one. It was decreed by the then minister, Senator Conroy. He knew best and all consumers needed to have a battery backup system. Of course, many consumers may not want or need one. Many have indicated that they would be happy to rely upon their mobile phone connection for voice services in the event of a power failure. Indeed, the statistics show that only 75 per cent of Australian adults had a fixed line in the home as at December 2013. In other words, a quarter of Australians today have made an active choice to rely on their mobile phones for voice services—including, of course, in an emergency. Our approach is very different to the centralised Conrovian compulsion which characterised the previous government. I am pleased to say that on the question of battery backup, the fresh daylight of choice and freedom is rising and banishing the grim and leaden darkness of Conrovia. We are enabling informed choices on battery backup installations, leading to an annual saving estimated at over $20 million in compliance costs.


The coalition government is seizing the opportunity to reduce the regulatory cost of business across many sectors, including the communications sector. Let's remember why we are doing it: as a means to stimulate business activity, economic growth and jobs.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:58):  I rise today to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills. Obviously that word 'omnibus' is not used in everyday language so I thought I had better do a bit of research. I notice the member for Flinders is here so I went to his favourite research tool, Wikipedia, and also the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary just to calibrate. The definition of 'omnibus' is given as a volume containing several novels. I do not think that is what we are talking about here. If we combined a couple of novels such as when my third novel comes out and if we were to put all three together, that might be an omnibus. We are not talking about that. The other meaning for omnibus is an old word for a bus. Certainly all lawyers would have heard of the expression 'the man on the Clapham omnibus'. I will read from Wikipedia which says:


… a hypothetical reasonable person, used by the courts in English law where it is necessary to decide whether a party has acted as a reasonable person would—for example, in a civil action for negligence. The man on the Clapham omnibus is a reasonably educated and intelligent but nondescript person, against whom the defendant's conduct can be measured.


In Australia the Clapham omnibus equivalent expression would be, 'the man on the Bondi tram', or 'the man on the Bourke Street tram'. I did not realise that Bondi had a tram, but you get the expression of what an omnibus would be.


Certainly the man on the Clapham omnibus would say of this piece of legislation that has been dragged into this chamber today: 'Who are you trying to kid that this is some big celebratory day, this repeal day, when this is just the everyday work of government.' This is what governments do. When Labor was in government we repealed 16,794 acts and regulations during our time in office, but we did not put out a press release saying it. We did not make speeches, we did not walk the corridors saying, 'Where's my medal for turning up for work?' We did not walk around saying, 'This is fantastic. We are the best government ever.' I see that the member for Gippsland is here, so he would know about this: I think you do actually get a medal in the military for turning up for work, but that is after three years, which is my understanding. The member might be able to inform me on that. I do not think they give out medals just for turning up for one year and just for actually doing your job. This is ridiculous.


We have had press releases saying that this is the best thing since sliced bread. Really, this is just the Liberal Party politicians day off, as described by the member for Oxley. This is not worthy of a press release and certainly is not worthy of members. I heard the member for Kooyong say on Sky this morning that this was spring cleaning. If his job was spring cleaning and he did this, where he said that the three bills are part of the $2 billion delivery of savings, well, the claimed deregulatory savings are $1,855,000 or just 0.1 per cent of the figure claimed by the government. The member for Kooyong said that this is his spring-cleaning effort. If he were a cleaner, he would be sacked. He would not even be performance managed, he  would be thrown out of the house and told, 'This is not cleaning'. For him to claim that this is a significant thing is ridiculous. Obviously deregulation, as every sensible politician knows, is the everyday work of government. We can see it, because we are actually debating this piece of legislation, the everyday work of government, in the House rather than in the Federation Chamber. This exposes the facade and exposes the paucity of a legislative agenda of those opposite.


It is great that we see it through the prism of the death of Gough Whitlam, that great reformer. Sure, he had a few years in opposition to craft his agenda. When he came into office, he quickly, within 14 days, had done so much. He had upgraded the Office of Aboriginal Affairs to ministerial level. I say that in the presence of the member for Lingiari. Within 30 days of gaining office the Whitlam government had ended conscription—that birthday ballot—and brought our troops home from Vietnam, and introduced many other significant things that changed society. I will not go back over them because the eulogies and other speeches have detailed them. But that is the prism through which we look at this repeal day, this omnibus repeal day, or more accurately called 'the Liberal day-off day'.


The reality is the government do not have a good, strong, legislative agenda. You would think that after four years in opposition under the Prime Minister's leadership, under the member for Warringah's leadership, they would have mapped out a bit of a plan and had an agenda. They kept saying, 'We're going to be the experienced government, because we'll have experienced Howard government ministers.' Ironically they turned out to be complete duds. It is the new people coming through, the younger people elected after the Howard government, that are actually seen to have a bit of skill and ability. These other people have become a joke almost.


This legislation, claimed by the government to be this magnificent attempt to deregulate and reduce taxes, is really what governments do. Every government does it. The bill before the House has been spun by the government as part of a promise to deregulate $2.3 billion, but they should not be walking the corridors saying, 'Where's my medal?' and lining up at the whip's office when all they have done is the work of every government. It is actually articulating the work of the public servants who do all this sorting out of redundant materials and reviews that have occurred and the like, crossing out commas, changing the old word for 'email' to the new word for 'email'. That is not something that you should be celebrating as a government, seriously. After all those years, while the member for Warringah has been leader, you would think he would have a stronger agenda.


Obviously the government has been a disappointment in so many ways, not only in this legislation, but in the commitment as to what would happen before the election and what happened after the election as there is a great yawning chasm. We have heard it all—there would be no cuts to pensions, no surprises, no cuts to the ABC, no cuts to SBS, no rise in the GST. I think there was a promise about no petrol tax. I am sure the Nationals are still fuming over the way they were tricked by the member for Mayo into bringing a tax onto the bush, because that is really what this will be. We are all paying more at the petrol bowser and that is going to be a tax on the bush. I am sure the National Party are still furious about the way they were tricked.


When we were in government, like all sensible governments, we took a sensible, methodical approach to reducing red tape. What we see here today is smoke and mirrors, and not anywhere near the saving that had been promised by those out in the corridors. They were desperate for something to talk about in their electorates, desperate to be able to say, 'This is something good that we have done.' If  you look at the front of their electorate offices, there are tumbleweeds rolling past waiting for the MPs to come out. They are in hiding and they are scared of this budget. Has there ever been more of a stinking carcass of a budget foisted on the Australian people? I do not think so.


The only highlight in the retail of this budget was when the Treasurer was overseas. That was the only time when there was some time for the Australian people to understand it. But, unfortunately for the coalition government, the Treasurer is back. He has already flagged that there might even be further cuts when the budget is reviewed in December.


Before the election, the now Prime Minister and now Treasurer fabricated a crisis around the budget. But everyone knows, whilst there are some challenges coming, the budget was actually in a strong position. Obviously there have been some increases in spending since the coalition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—took government, but the fault for that lies at their door. They misled voters time and time again when they talked about spending on welfare and even something as simple as building submarines in the great state of South Australia. There was a simple commitment from the then shadow defence minister, who said, 'We will build submarines in South Australia.' There was not any spin or weasel words; David Johnston is a straight-shooting guy. I think he should honour that commitment.


The budget has lots of challenges, but I will return to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) legislation before the chamber—or, as I call it, the 'Liberal Party politicians' day off' legislation. I listened to the few speeches that have been given on this. I see there is a very, very long speaking list. I would have thought those opposite would have been lining up to celebrate this, but perhaps they have been gagged. I notice that they can only speak for five minutes or so each. I look forward to the great contributions celebrating this 'turning up for work' legislation.


I note in this context that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was one of the so-called bits of red tape that the government sought to get rid of. The earlier farcical repeal day wanted to get rid of this critical oversight office. They called it red tape. They sought to repeal the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, an organisation dedicated to reviewing Australia's counter-terrorism and national security legislation. It is an office that does great work. They say 'red tape'; we say 'checks and balances'. It is appropriate that government have some people monitoring what goes on in the area of particularly security legislation where so often we are compromising freedoms, liberty and individual choices. It is balanced with safety; I understand that. It is not done willy-nilly. It is done for a reason. But we also need checks and balances. We have seen, as the Snowdon documents revelations have shown, that government is not necessarily going to self-regulate well. Sometimes we need that independent oversight.


I note that we have had six or seven months without that office being filled in an environment where we are bringing in lots of important legislation that people have a lot of concerns about. I have been receiving lots of emails. The next wave of legislation, particularly dealing with metadata, has a lot of people in my electorate concerned. It is important that we have that Independent National Security Legislation Monitor role filled. I would urge the Attorney-General to do his job and fill that role. That position has been vacant since April and, in a time of great change, this is not acceptable. It is a hard role to fill, but I am sure that an appropriately credentialled and experienced monitor should be able to be found shortly and put in place.


By insisting on dramatically shortened sunset periods on statutory reviews both by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and by the committee, we improved the legislation that will come before this chamber in the near future.


Obviously red tape can be synonymous with checks and balances. Good government gets rid of unnecessary red tape. That is what good governments do. But, please, do not come in here, beating your chests, saying, 'We turned up for work.' It is ridiculous turning up and asking, 'Where is my medal for getting rid of some legislation?' As I said, when Labor were in office for six years, we repealed 16,794 acts and regulations. Most of that sort of work took place up in the Federation Chamber. I know I spoke on some of those bits of legislation. They were incredibly tedious and incredibly boring. That is the work of government. That is what government should continue to do.


But for the Liberal and National parties to say, 'This is the best thing since sliced bread,' just shows that they have no vision. This fortnight we have talked about what leaders with vision can achieve for this nation, even flawed leaders, as we have acknowledged of the late Mr Whitlam. We need the nation's leaders to have courage, not to be looking in the footlights and trying to spin cutting red tape as a great thing.


At the very same time we have the Prime Minister walking around the country saying, 'We need to have a discussion about Federation,' he needs to show a little bit of leadership in this chamber and in his party room. The reality is that this government does not have a serious vision. They have been disgraceful when it comes to acting on climate change. They successfully won on that at the election, but now we have been betrayed by the lack of action in the Direct Action policy, which seems to have evaporated. Even when it comes in, it will be neither direct nor have any action.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:13):  This bill is about good governance. As times change, many issues of governance change with those times. Rules and regulations become obsolete, and the coalition government is taking steps to ensure business and the Australian people are not weighed down with needless imposition by government into their lives. Not only that but rescinding these unnecessary measures saves money for the government and business. This means the coalition government can once again proceed to pull Australia out of the deficit disaster and financial mire in which we were left well and truly bogged by Labor and ensure business has more time and more money with which to employ Australians.


Interestingly, I had the pleasure to be on Mornings with Steve Austin on 612 ABC Brisbane last week with the member for Oxley. He commented, as did the member for Moreton just now, that these repeal bills were nothing special—that repealing unnecessary legislation was just a part of governing. He also said that while in power Labor had repealed thousands of pieces of redundant legislation but had done so without fanfare. The lack of fanfare could have been because, at the end of the day, there was a net increase—21,000 extra pieces of legislation—under Labor. 


The member for Moreton called repealing redundant legislation 'a politician's day off' and said that they had done everything without fanfare. In fact, however, then Prime Minister Rudd had a red-tape website. Under his smiling face, you could apply to get a fact sheet about red tape. So perhaps there was not as little fanfare as the member for Moreton recalls. The claim that they quietly cut red tape with a lack of fanfare is hard to believe—because the previous Rudd, Gillard and Rudd governments would turn up to the opening of an envelope if it got them media coverage. They even organised media for events that never occurred, such as when they published glossy brochures announcing they had delivered a surplus, which we know they never did. Lastly and most significantly, these repeal days actually save money—and we know that those opposite know nothing about saving money.


If what the member for Oxley said were true, then why is it necessary for this government to abolish the Fishing Industry Policy Council? Formed in 1991 by the last true Labor leader, Bob Hawke, it has met precisely zero times since its creation 23 years ago. Why is it necessary for us, the coalition, to repeal the Papua and New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1970 when the loan it refers to was finalised and paid back 20 years ago when Keating was Prime Minister? Perhaps, though, we should leave that act in place as a reminder to those opposite that loans do need to be repaid. 


If, as the member for Oxley—if no-one else—claims, Labor are so good at cleaning up, why are Australians of all ages, from those born today to those passing today, indebted to the tune of $15,000 each to the former Labor-Greens alliance government? A child born right now, this very minute I am speaking, is in debt because of the reckless inability of Labor and their Greens henchmen to stop burning a hole in the national credit card. We have heard a lot in this place, since the passing of Gough Whitlam, about legacy. That debt is the legacy of the last Labor rotation behind the wheel—the car crashed sideways into a tree because too many people were trying to drive and our economy was whisked away from the scene of the crime to be placed on life support. 


Those opposite drone on endlessly about rising costs, about students maybe having to pay extra for their education. That would not even be an issue if mum, dad and their two children did not have a $60,000 millstone around their necks courtesy of 'the best Treasurer in the world'. Perhaps we need an omnibus edition of a new bill, one that garnishees the member for Lilley's parliamentary salary to pay the Australian taxpayer back for his hubris. I would dub the member for Lilley the Icarus of economics—except that Icarus at least made it off the ground.


The coalition government has realised more than $2 billion in savings in just two repeal days—more than double our savings target and enough money to build hospitals, to build schools, to give a pension increase or to help pay off a tiny fraction of the economic chasm left by those opposite. Frankly, listening to the other side of the chamber attempting to blame-shift is becoming as trite and transparent as the emperor's new clothes. The coalition government would prefer to spend money on those things that enhance the lives and experiences of Australians, yet we remain hobbled by a debt not of our making. 


Despite the economic shambles we inherited, the coalition is governing for all Australians, not just the vested interests of Labor and its union puppeteers. I urge those opposite to remove the puppeteer's arm from the back of their shirts and support this bill for the good of Australia—to free up business to spend more time on creating wealth and jobs and to save government a significant amount of money. I congratulate the member for Kooyong on this bill and for the significant savings it will make in time and money, savings which will in turn boost productivity. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:18):  I do not know why the member for Ryan is in here crowing about the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and its related bills. I was not going to respond to her comments, but since she made some insensitive car crash analogies, I think it is appropriate to remind her about the extra $5.1 million in compliance costs for business that this government has just added with its new petrol tax arrangements. These are the small businesses—the franchisees—for whom the coalition claim to be reducing red tape. They have now imposed extra red tape on every service station in my electorate. My electorate is located in Western Sydney where, contrary to the Treasurer's understanding, we rely on cars—all of us. In some suburbs where public transport is at a premium or nonexistent, there are households with two cars in the double garage and two more on the driveway. If I were the member for Ryan, I would not come in here and crow about this bill when her government has today added to the compliance costs of hundreds of small businesses and franchisees, including those in her own electorate.


I am very pleased to continue my tradition of appearances in debates on statute stocktakes and other spent legislation repeal instruments. Back in the day, there would only ever be one or two speakers on these bills. How delightful to see that we have so many people listed to speak on these bills today. Because I am a former lawyer with a deep interest in statutory interpretation and administrative law principles, I always try to make these debates interesting and have provided some wide-ranging comments in the past. Members might like to cast their minds back to, for example, the debate on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012, in which I recalled an Irish stocktake where they repealed thousands of pieces of legislation. Their review identified a staggering 63,000 statutes as spent legislation or statutes that should be repealed. I discussed the development of Hong Kong competition law. My gem was 'why commas matter'. There was a very interesting case from 2006, Rogers Communications v Bell Alliant, where a comma made the difference in a contract dispute worth a large amount of money. I had the opportunity to comment on High Court appointments. To my great delight, on one occasion the now Minister for Communications commented that 'such bills do not elicit great oratory' but that my contribution had been an exception. You take compliments where you can get them!


Speaking of great oratory, just to be instructive about what we are dealing with here today I want to quote not myself but someone else who has spoken on similar bills that have come before the House previously:


This stocktake bill, being the seventh since 1934, forms part of an ongoing process to clean up the statute book by repealing legislation that is simply redundant. That is all it does: repeal 84 old annual appropriations acts, as has been done for appropriation acts from 1901 to 1999 … the current stocktake bill is not a controversial bill by any stretch of the imagination; it is simply housekeeping …


While this bill is worthwhile and we support the nature of the bill and the removal of those acts from the statute law, again this is tidying up and housekeeping. This bill does not make any changes with regard to the easing of regulatory burden on business as suggested in explanatory memorandum. It can hardly be described as a feature of a meaningful deregulation agenda to remove some appropriations acts that applied over three years some 20 years ago. Things from 20 years ago are some of the things we are tidying up.


They are very true words—it was a great speech and I have taken the opportunity to read it. It was made by the member for Wright on 29 May 2013. We can apply the words of the member for Wright here today, and I thank him for bringing these thoughts to my attention on a previous occasion. He is spot on when it comes to what these housekeeping bills actually are.


I would like to focus on some of the specific elements of schedule 2 of the legislation, dealing with the communications sphere—specifically the Broadcasting Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act. I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications talk about some of these provisions and I too would like to pick up on some of them. Part 2 of the amending legislation deals with repealing certain consultation requirements before certain legislative instruments are made—removing what are called amendments relating to consultation requirements in the Broadcasting Services Act, and also the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and the RadComms Act. I understand from the EM and from the bill itself that this is because the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 contains, in part 3, section 17, a requirement that rule makers should consult before making legislative instruments. There are related provisions dealing with circumstances where consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate and also consequences of the failure to consult. 


Whilst I understand the legislative intent is that we already have the Legislative Instruments Act which contains those provisions, and therefore there is no need for duplication in those specific communications related pieces of legislation, I want to question from a practitioner's point of view whether that is desirable. I am happy to stand corrected if this is indeed a precedent in other pieces of legislation that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the drafters have recommended, but I did have a cursory overview about whether such repeal is commonplace and I could not see anything to support that. As I said, I am happy to stand corrected. I would have thought that one of the golden rules of statutory interpretation was that you should be able to pick up a piece of legislation and read it on its own without having to go to other instruments or other pieces of legislation to deal with very particular aspects of that specific provision. I do not see, in this proposed amendment, that there is going to be, for example, a box with a note saying, 'For consultation requirements refer to the Legislative Instruments Act, part 3, section 17.' I would have thought that, in light of our emphasis on plain English drafting, that would have been something that was desirable. It is not too hard to read a piece of legislation—and you should always, of course, have the Acts Interpretation Act next to you—but if you have to have a third act next to you, just in case, I wonder whether that will affect the way the bill is interpreted in everyday legal practice and in everyday regulatory practice, not only by the industry but by practitioners themselves. I note the comments from the government that this is not a reduction in consultation requirements but I do query how it is to be read and, seriously, whether it would be desirable for there to be a reference to consultation provisions being in the Legislative Instruments Act. To give this a bit of strength from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, I did quote them in a contribution on 28 May last year:


The Office of Parliamentary Counsel states some of the drivers of complexity in legislation and give some common examples …


Those examples include:


a tendency to respond to events with legislative changes even when legislation is not necessary to address the issues … 


I do not know whether this was a specific item the industry said needed to be taken out, but the point I make is that this could end up being more complicated in practice for practitioners to deal with because all those provisions are removed from those three primary acts and now we simply have a reference—not even a reference, as far as I can see—to the Legislative Instruments Act.


The parliamentary secretary also mentioned changes to the Do Not Call Register which are part of the deregulation agenda. ACCAN's media release of today says that ACCAN welcomed indefinite registrations on the Do Not Call Register. I am sure that all my colleagues here are well aware that the issue of unsolicited telemarketing by any electronic means is by and large not welcome. OIAC research, that it appears from the release was commissioned by ACCAN, found that only two per cent of survey respondents indicated that they enjoyed receiving unsolicited marketing information. Of course they love hearing from us! 


On this point I draw the House's attention to a suggestion which I think has merit and I know has been considered elsewhere by the member for Bowman, which I noted in the press recently—and that is the notion of adding small businesses to the Do Not Call Register. My electorate office has a number which obviously used to belong to a small business, because just about every day we receive calls from the same marketing company. I can see that the member for Deakin shares my pain. I would have thought that this would be a sensible measure. I mention it quite seriously to suggest that, when we do look at this particular provision, is there a reason why we cannot consider having small businesses opt in to the register if they think that is going to be of benefit to them? We are talking about productivity when we talk about reducing regulatory burdens. As everyone here I think would know, one regulatory burden and something that affects productivity is if your staff are constantly being interrupted to do things that are not productive. 


Some of the substantive provisions in these amendments go to part 15 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which deals with special provisions for retransmission of programs. Part of the amendments deal with the fact—I know the member for Lingiari will be interested in this—that NITV, National Indigenous Television Ltd, is now part of the SBS family; it has been for a little while. I think the portfolio budget statement for Communications provides a very good summary:


As part of the SBS family, the National Indigenous Television service (NITV) is broadcast free-to-air with national coverage …


Isn't that a great thing, member for Lingiari?




Mr Snowdon:
  It is fantastic.




Ms ROWLAND:
  It continues:


… including through the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service. NITV is an important platform for the celebration of the unique languages and culture of Indigenous Australians, produced by Indigenous Australians, and now available to every Australian household. 


The reason I mention this is in the context of not only NITV but also the future of community television in this country. As the CTV sector recently found out, the minister has determined that they will be moved online—that is the platform for them. The reality is—and this is what the sector is saying as well—that there is an acceptance that that is where they need to go, but to be rushed into it without the amount of preparation and support they need is a very detrimental thing. That is not specifically why I raise this. 


One of the biggest gripes that the CTV sector has is this apparent obsession with ratings as the only indicia of the value of their content. As the sector pointed out, there are many networks with shows that have under 6,000 viewer ratings points. Unfortunately, some NITV programs regularly feature in those low ratings—things like SARL All Stars Carnival, Maori TV's Native Affairsand NITV News Week In Review. A lot of these end up rating lower than the threshold at which some in this place think should be the threshold of support. But no-one would be suggesting, would they, member for Lingiari, that that is the sole criterion by which you should judge the value of any programs?




Mr Snowdon:
  You would think not.




Ms ROWLAND:
  Indeed, you would think not. We need to be very careful when we rush in to repeal. Remember the last regulatory repeal day. On 19 March this year the parliamentary secretary came in and commended to the House repealing the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. We know how important that is. Subsequently, as Labor had called for, we had committee recommendations on this very issue, saying that, at a time when we need to make sure we have proper oversight of these laws for the benefit of our citizens, we need to ensure that the monitor remains. I put that out there just as a final warning of the dangers of rushing into these kinds of things.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (12:34):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills. In particular I want to start by congratulating the Prime Minister and his parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg, for the outstanding work they have done in pushing forward our second red-tape repeal day. 


We have already taken significant steps towards repealing red tape for Australian businesses and individuals with our first red-tape repeal day. We made a commitment prior to the election to hold regular repeal days, because we have always believed that by getting off the back of business we assist them in getting on with what they do best, and one of the things they do best is creating jobs in this economy. Removing outdated and unnecessary regulation is something that many parties in opposition propose. They promise to do it should they be elected. However, it is only this government which is getting on with the job of actually reducing the regulatory burden now that we are in government.


The Labor Party are a classic example of this. Before the election in 2007, under former Prime Minister Rudd, they committed to a policy of one-in one-out when it comes to regulation. The small business minister at the time, the Hon. Craig Emerson, even promised to take 'a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small businesses'. However, talk is cheap. We know that under the Labor Party in those six years, more than 21,000 new regulations were introduced. So much for the one-in one-out policy. So much for taking a big pair of scissors to red tape. It would be laughable if it were not so serious.


We stand in contrast to the false rhetoric of those opposite. We are not changing department names or making glib statements; we are actually doing what the former minister said: we are taking a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that strangles small business. The reason for this is that the coalition believes that reducing red tape is going to be one of the most important elements of driving economic growth. And we do not want economic growth for economic growth's sake. But improving the ability for our economy to grow will improve the lives of our citizens and create more jobs. It will hopefully mean people can fulfil their lives in the way they want.


Unfortunately, in 2014 Australia was ranked 124th out of 148 countries for the burden of government regulation in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index. The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation and associated compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP. Today, for the second time, we seek to repeal that lamentable legacy. This repeal day removes almost 1,000 pieces of regulation and more than 7,200 pages of legislation. This follows up from the work down in March, when the government removed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation, which delivered over $700 million worth of compliance cost benefits. Together with today's repeal day, this will lead to a total net deregulatory saving of over $2.1 billion, an important achievement for job creation in Australia.


Already, we have made big steps. We now require cabinet submissions proposing legislative changes go through a regulatory impact process, something the Labor Party in government abandoned. We have established designated deregulation units within ministers' departments and, where appropriate, linking the remuneration of senior members of the Public Service to their performance in reducing red and green tape. 


In addition to all those changes, and that is only a few, we are also seeking to eliminate the extensive duplication and regulatory overlap that exists between different layers of government, particularly between federal and state regulation. In my electorate of Deakin, I constantly hear the cry from businesses and individuals that they have to meet, in many cases, competing regulatory requirements at a state and federal level, and it is infuriating. It strangles innovation and entrepreneurship, and that is why this is so important. 


Another key way in which we will be removing red tape will be by streamlining and improving the regulatory obligations and reporting methods. There will be $88 million a year in compliance cost savings, including with respect to the Australian Taxation Office, Medicare and Centrelink. Something I have heard about constantly in the last few weeks is that five million Australians have created their myGov account. I have been getting extraordinary feedback on that.


I am going to end my contribution early to enable other speakers to speak on this omnibus repeal bill. Understandably, as a government, we are very keen to all have a say here, because this will be the future for driving economic growth in this country, not economic growth for its own sake but economic growth for the sake of the lives of our citizens and improving jobs. 


Now that Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg is in the chamber, I want to congratulate him again for driving this process. I have business men and women in Deakin who shake my hand and say, 'Please thank the parliamentary secretary for driving these changes.' I commend the bills to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (12:41):  Former Prime Minister John Howard has spoken about the issues that shaped him to get into politics and one of the chief ones was the impact of regulation on service stations. His parents, former Prime Minister Howard has written, felt that the Labor government maintained wartime petrol rationing for too long and they were frustrated by regulations that applied to local petrol stations from local councils. As John Howard once put it: 'What happened was my father had a garage near Dulwich Hill station and he got an edict from Marrickville council to remove the bowsers on the kerb. It accelerated a downward spiral for him and I guess it was something that helped to politicise me in the direction of profound sympathy for small business.'


One can only imagine what Mr Howard would make of a decision which sees the nation's 6,300 petrol stations hit with a compliance bill for $5.1 million for the privilege of collecting the Abbott government's new petrol tax. It is extraordinary that the so-called parties of Menzies has cast off so much of the values that Menzies stood for and is now rebuking the Howard legacy. What does the Liberal Party stand for any longer if it does not stand for the party of John Howard, if it is willing to spit in the eye of petrol station owners and slug them with new, unnecessary regulations? On the very day we are here talking about red tape, this is a government putting more red tape on to petrol station owners. You can just imagine John Howard shaking his head, 'First, they have undone the freeze in fuel indexation and then they are adding red tape to 6,300 small businesses.'


The government claims that the red tape measures are necessary and significant. And they are right, it is just that the necessary ones are trivial while the significant ones are unfair. Let me start with the trivia. Having crowed about the benefits of its first repeal day back in March, the government failed to tell the Australian people that that first red tape repeal day included 39 individual amendments changing the name 'electronic mail' to 'email'—difficult to see how that makes life easier for any Australian business—and hundreds of amendments adjusting spelling, grammar and punctuation. 


To have a day on which you remove spelling mistakes from the statute books is like saying we are going to have a 'national showing up for work and having a cup of tea day'. It is just the regular business of government to clean-up the statute books and it is exactly what Labor did during our time in office, without the preening and the crowing that has accompanied the exercise from the coalition.


The first red tape repeal day encompassed the repeal of such noted business obstacles as the Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1927, the Lighthouses Act 1949 and the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act 1969. The coalition crowed about the fact that it was removing a raft of amending acts, failing to tell Australians that an amending act ceases to take effect immediately after it has amended the principal act. 


As my Senate colleague Senator Ludwig has recently discovered, the government set up teams at a cost of millions of dollars through the Australian Public Service in order to add to its preening exercise. The Treasury team cost $2.1 million. The teams based in the industry and social security departments cost around $700,000 a year. All of that is so the government can have a biannual preening exercise about simply doing its job. When we were in office, Labor removed over 16,000 redundant acts, regulations and legislative instruments. We did not declare a 'war on bad punctuation'; we just figured that fixing typos is part of the work of good government.


Then there are the important reforms that the government is removing under the guise of red tape repeal. They attempt to gut Labor's future of financial advice consumer protection reforms, reforms that were backed by organisations such as Choice and National Seniors. These consumer protections were put in place in the wake of collapses such as Trio Capital and Storm Financial—and the minister at the table might chuckle, but these were crises that saw thousands of Australians lose their life savings and, in some cases, end up in debt, as a result of bad financial advice. That is why Labor put in those financial advice protections; not to impose additional red tape, but to ensure that older Australians are not scammed out of their life savings. 


The government too is trying to kill off the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission was set up to protect Australians from door-to-door scammers. Thankfully, there are relatively few such scammers, but those who exist are in fear of an organisation which allows householders to check up on whether a charity is legit. It allows someone to type in the details onto the acnc.gov.au website and quickly check whether the person at the door is a dodgy scammer or a legitimate charity.


We believe that transparency is appropriate in the sector and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission is delivering for charities. That is why four out of five charities support the charities commission, a figure which has remained unchanged in the year since the Abbott government has been in office. If the Abbott government's campaign against the charities commission had worked, you would think that charities might be less supportive. But actually this is the rare case of a regulator backed by its sector. What share of charities believe that charities regulation should return to the Australian Taxation Office? Just one in 20. Nineteen out of 20 Australian charities do not support the return of charities regulation to the tax office. 


So, where Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg might see red tape, we see measures that stop Aussies from being ripped off by dodgy financial advisers and unethical charity scammers. We believe that we need to have an appropriate level of regulation. What the coalition will not tell you about is the 690 new regulations they put in place since the last red tape repeal day. For a government that says it is declaring war on red tape, it certainly seems to be waving the white flag. 


Since the first red tape repeal day, some of the regulations that have been brought in include: the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation (Warlike Service) Determination 2014 (No. 4); the National Health (Botulinum Toxin Program) Special Arrangement Amendment Instrument 2014 (No. 2); the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Confidentiality) Determination No. 15 of 2014; the Australian Public Service Commissioner's Amendment (Notification of Decisions and Other Measures) Direction 2014; the Broadcasting Services (Licensee Audit Exemption) Instrument 2014; the Currency (Royal Australian Mint) Determination 2014 (No. 7); the Therapeutic Goods (Listing) Notice 2014 (No. 6); the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) (Warlike Service – Operation OKRA) Determination 2014; the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transfer of Industry Assets and Liabilities) Declaration 2014.


I could go on, but I have merely listed one-seventieth of the new regulations put onto the statute books by this government between their so-called regulation repeal day No. 1 and No. 2. A government that is declaring war on red tape is littering the statute books with new regulations. How hypocritical is that? The government claims to be getting rid of regulations but instead it is passing hundreds of them. Regulations are being passed at a rate of three or four a day since red tape repeal day No. 1 under this government; that is what they will not tell you on red tape repeal day No. 2. This is a stunt, pure and simple. 


The charities commission has received significant support. I spoke before about the support it has from the sector. And the charities commission is reducing the regulatory burden on Australian charities. I stood up with Andrew Barr in the ACT and Gail Gago in South Australia. Both represent sensible governments which recognise that the charities commission can reduce regulatory reporting duplication for Australian charities. 


In both those Labor jurisdictions we have governments keen to reduce the reporting burden on Australia's charities, by working with the charities commission. And yet governments in coalition-run states and territories have been unwilling to work with the charities commission. 


This government needs to stop declaring a war on an organisation overwhelmingly backed by charities. That is not just my view; Ernst & Young has noted in a report on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission:


A core component of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission's reporting framework and efforts around reducing red tape is the 'report once, use often' principle. This principle is consistent with recommendations issued by the Productivity Commission, the National Commission of Audit, the Australian National Audit Office, the Treasury and the Department of Finance.


Serious reform-minded organisations take the view, as charities do, that the charities commission is cutting red tape and that abolishing the charities commission would increase the paperwork burden on Australian charities.


The government has got it wrong. Minister Andrews's only argument for abolishing the commission has been debunked by this Ernst & Young report and it has also been debunked by independent submissions. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has said:


We understand the government has made a commitment to abolish the ACNC. While we do not agree with this approach, we would strongly encourage the government to maintain elements of the ACNC that were delivering improved outcomes for the sector.


It has noted the 'light touch' regulation that is embodied in the charities commission, the value of a charities register that provides valuable information for a range of stakeholders, the central reporting mechanism and the harmonisation across jurisdictions.


The Australian Institute of Company Directors supports keeping the charities commission. The Queensland Law Society, in a detailed submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, has discussed the flaws in the regulatory impact statement for the government's attempt to repeal the charities commission. It has described the regulatory impact statements for that repeal bill as being:


Less than rigorous, and not meeting the usually high standards and disciplines of the Commonwealth legislative process.


The Queensland Law Society have noted a claim in the regulatory impact statement that the ACNC repeal is said to give effect to a government election promise, but have said:


We can find no direct reference to such a promise in the Coalition's formal election platform 1 and it was not included as a policy commitment in the Coalition's election costings.


The Queensland Law Society further say that the regulatory impact statement states:


… 21,000 unincorporated charities are required to report to the ACNC where they previously were outside a regulatory framework. This appears not to take into account that these charities are already subject to federal regulation which is fragmented and uncoordinated.


And goes on to note that the critique of the charities commission for not becoming a reporting point 'fails to acknowledge the progress made in setting up a framework for streamlined reporting in the ACNC's first 15 months.'


They also note the speed with which the charities commission has managed to register charities—exceeding the 85 per cent benchmark within 28 days with a 95.6 per cent success rate. 


The charities commission is doing good work to reduce the reporting burden on Australian charities. Australians benefit from the charities commission and from financial advice protection. The removal of extraneous hyphens and commas should not be the subject of crowing by the government.

Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (12:56):  Cutting red tape matters. Overregulation hinders productivity, deters investment, stifles innovation and costs jobs. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and two related bills, knowing that this is an important day for Australians and Australian businesses. Today we erase 7,200 pages of regulations from the statute books. This is in addition to our first repeal day where we removed more than 10,000 pieces of legislation and over 50,000 pages of regulations. This year alone the government has announced more than 400 individual reduction measures resulting in exceeding our initial $1 billion compliance saving target and achieving savings of over $2 billion. This is a significant achievement.


By identifying and removing red tape which adds financial burden without delivering benefit we boost our nation's competitiveness to help create jobs and cut the costs of business. We are determined to ensure that interaction with government for individuals and businesses is less complex, less costly and more time efficient. Labor talked big on cutting red tape, with symbolic gestures such as adding 'deregulation' to the title of the Department of Finance. They promised a one-end one-out rule for regulation. History instead shows that, after six years, the former Labor government added 21,000 new regulations. In contrast, in just over 12 months, this government has not only exceeded our target in cutting red tape and compliance costs but also achieved savings of over $2 billion.


We have set about changing the regulation culture within government. This government is taking this task seriously. Our senior ministers have established advisory councils on regulation, and every federal department has created a deregulation unit to calculate the cost of complying with regulations administered by the department and its agencies. Further, regulatory impact statements are required for cabinet submissions, to ensure that the cost of regulation is weighed against its benefits. Deregulation will be a standing item on the COAG agenda, to enable federal and state governments to cut duplication and overregulation.


We are working to improve the quality of consultation between the government and those who will be affected by any new regulations. It is only fair that a robust discussion occurs when government proposes new regulations that adversely impact on how individuals go about their lives or their business. Furthermore, we will also ensure rigorous and mandatory post-implementation reviews to determine the effectiveness of new regulations. If it is determined that regulations no longer effectively meet their purpose repeal will be considered. For individuals and businesses dealing with government departments and agencies, this news is most welcome.


The cost of compliance is a major barrier to growth. The average Australian business deals with eight regulators in a given year. Businesses spend close to four per cent of their total annual expenditure on complying with regulatory requirements and spend approximately 19 hours a week on compliance related activities. This impacts businesses' capacity to grow and drive job creation.


In an electorates such as Dobell small-business operators are the engine room of our economy and they deserve support from government in order to grow. Many of the businesses I have spoken to in Dobell constantly tell me about the burden of compliance. An estimated 447,000 small businesses will benefit from a reduced tax compliance burden, with administrative changes to GST and pay as you go reporting. Businesses with no payable GST will no longer be required to lodge a business activity statement, and this represents compliance savings for small business in the vicinity of $76 million.


One of Dobell's largest growing industries is the aged-care sector. Repeal changes will mean aged-care providers will no longer be required to notify the Department of Social Services of staff changes unless it materially affects the provider's suitability to provide care. The Department of Social Services has estimated that this will lead to an annual saving of $1.16 million in compliance costs. Such measures are positively contributing to a stronger and more prosperous economy.


Our Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda is promoting lower costs and better skills. Central to this renewed focus is deregulation and reducing red tape, with the guiding principle that if a system, service or product is approved under the trusted international standard, then Australian regulators should not impose additional requirements without a demonstrable reason to do so. The Prime Minister recently advised the House of our success with his approach. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has advised Cochlear, the makers of the bionic ear, that its products are now eligible to use European Union certification. This decision streamline certification will enable Australian consumers to have access to the latest devices, sometimes up to a year earlier than previously anticipated.


Individuals are also benefiting from our deregulation agenda as we minimise and simplify interaction with government. The creation of MyGov has seen more than five million Australians establish accounts to access government services, including the ATO, Medicare, Centrelink, Child Support, Veterans' Affairs and the NDIS. This has seen an annual compliance cost saving of $88 million. MyTax, which is linked with MyGov, will save close to $160 million each year while assisting 1.4 million Australians by pre-populating tax returns.


This government is helping more Australians find and keep a job by reducing the time spent by job service agencies dealing with red tape. This will be achieved by removing the requirement for job service providers to collect extensive evidence about a job seeker who finds work, because this information is ready collected by the Department of Human Services. Similar changes will be extended to Australian Apprenticeship Support Network providers, who will no longer have to maintain over three million paper files. Furthermore, the Department of Employment estimate this will lead to an annual saving of $24.7 million in compliance costs.


For the households of Dobell and throughout Australia we are also introducing common-sense reforms, making dealing with government easier. We are changing the length of registration on the Do Not Call Register to an indefinite period, meeting more than 9.2 million individuals and families will no longer be required to reregister their phone and fax numbers.


Local clubs and organisations registered as a company limited by guarantee, with less than $1 million in revenue, will no longer require an auditor. Our deregulation and red tape reduction goals do not end with today's repeal day. There will be more to come in the future, because their remains so much more to be done. It is important that we continue to talk with individuals, families and businesses to identify where we can further reduce the compliance burden. As I have often said, government does not create jobs, business creates jobs. As such, it is important that the government provides a sufficient regulatory presence without restricting productivity and growth.


I commend the work of the parliamentary secretary, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, and congratulate him on his commitment on behalf of this government to our deregulation agenda. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (13:04):  I was not going to speak on this bill, because I find these red-tape repeal days or stunts of the government to be basically a sham. They are nothing but cheap tricks trying to distract the community. Quite often the bills that we have before us deal with minor things like fixing grammar and spelling, yet they claim that these changes are making massive savings to the budget. This particular red tape repeal charade only contains $1.8 million in savings of the total $2.33 billion that they are claiming. What a charade—to guillotine, to gag other debate on legislation to rush on a bill which is about correcting minor grammar, spelling and punctuation within existing bills and legislation.


So, why am I speaking? Because what has been revealed in these documents is the further extent of the ambush that this government has had in the last 24 hours in relation to increasing the petrol tax. It is an ambush on Australian motorists, in particular an ambush on regional families, because we all know that if you live in the regions you spend more on petrol because you have further to drive. In the government's own documents that we are debating today it is revealed that the impact of the petrol tax ambush is even wider, with every petrol station now being slugged an extra $800 a year in new compliance costs to collect tax for this government. I thought this bill was about reducing compliance and red tape, yet this government is whacking a further tax, slugging compliance costs, on every petrol station, including many of those in regional Victoria. According to its own documents this government will hit the nation's 6,300 petrol stations with a compliance cost of $5.1 million. They will pay for the privilege of collecting this government's increased petrol tax. There is little doubt that this increased compliance cost will be passed on to motorists when they fill up at the bowser—and by 'motorists' we mean mums and dads, we mean pensioners, we mean small businesses. We mean everybody that needs a car or truck that relies on regular petrol to get from A to B.


This Prime Minister is addicted to taxing Australians. There is just no other way to go about it. Quite often, as we are seeing, rather than debating it properly in this House and in the Senate, they are simply ambushing the Australian people. This new tax increase to the petrol stations is not the only problem that we are seeing with their whole approach to petrol. As I have said, the increase in the petrol tax will hit local motorists. The fuel excise will mean that central Victorians and regional Australians will pay more for their petrol.


And it comes from a government that also tries to claim that poor people do not drive cars or drive far. Let's leave for a moment that some of our poorest households struggle in their pay cycle to put money in the car to get from A to B when it gets to day 11 or day 12 in their pay cycle. Let's leave for a moment the fact that for many regional Australians the car is the only way that they can get from A to B. It is the only transport available, because we do not have public transport in large chunks of regional Australia. Let's also leave for a moment that this statement by the Treasurer is not only elitist but somewhat patronising. Poor people do not drive cars? Isn't it a problem if people cannot afford the very basics in life? Hasn't this government failed? Hasn't the Treasurer failed to support the most vulnerable people if they cannot put petrol in their car to get from A to B, particularly when it comes to regional Australia and regional MPs? They should be standing up and speaking against the changes to petrol. They should be speaking against the increases to the petrol tax—increases which are in this red tape repeal day hitting petrol stations—because that would just be a further increase to motorists. Petrol stations will simply pass that on.


How do we know that low-income households pay more for petrol than those on higher incomes? It comes down to percentage. We need to talk about the percentage of income that low-income households spend each year on the basics such as petrol.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Order! Member for Bendigo, whilst we have allowed a very broad-ranging debate in this House on this amendment, she might consider the amendment before the House.




Ms CHESTERS:
  Yes, thank you for pointing that out. My comments relate to page 5 of the government's October 2014 red-tape repeal documents, Table 1c: Summary of key regulatory costs reported or announced since September 2013, the line item which talks about the resuming of the indexation of the fuel excise to the consumer price index. So I am speaking to the documents which are being talked about in relation to these bills. I have just outlined the fuel excise to consumer price index increase, what it will cost petrol stations and also what it will cost Victorian motorists, particularly those on low incomes.


The fuel excise increase will in fact hit low-income earners the hardest. The percentage of their household income spent on petrol will increase due to the extra that they will have to pay. Lower income groups tend to live in the outer suburbs and regional areas because housing is more affordable. As a result, however, their transport costs will increase. This is kind of simple mathematics; if you live further out because it is cheaper, it is only natural to assume that you will have to pay more to get into town to get to work, to drop your children off at school or to get around. Infrastructure has not caught up with these areas yet. The public transport has not been built or the state or federal governments have no plan to build the public transport so that these households and families have the opportunity to have a viable public transport option. All they can do is rely on their car, and that is the problem when this government increases the excise on petrol. It hits those in the outer suburbs and the regional people disproportionately. It hits them the hardest because they do not have the opportunity to take public transport.


The public transport debate is something that we have seen this government turn a blind eye to. They are not interested in doing their bit to invest in public transport—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am really struggling with your presentation on this red-tape repeal bill as to where you are headed with this with regard to relevance to the bill. You might consider that in the rest of your address.




Ms CHESTERS:
  Thank you. I remind the Deputy Speaker that I am speaking in relation to the resumption of indexation of the fuel excise to the consumer price index, which is part of the government's own October 2014 red-tape repeal documents. These are the documents that the government is bringing before the House and contain their great charade around red-tape repeal. Perhaps the Speaker and members of the government do not like me talking about the fuel excise because of the impact that it will have on regional communities. If they have their own Facebook pages, they have probably exploded in outrage—like my page has in the last 24 hours—at the increase of the fuel excise and how that is going to impact on our families.


Fuel prices are high in regional Victoria, higher in regional Australia, which is—




Mrs Markus:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to relevance. This bill is talking about 256 regulations being repealed. If you could draw the member's attention to those regulations and her capacity to talk about those regulations that are being repealed today.




Ms Rishworth:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Bendigo has clearly indicated how she is speaking with relevance to the repeal day bill and associated documents. This has been a very wide-ranging debate and the member for Bendigo is speaking in order.




Mr Hawke:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to standing order 75, on relevance or tedious repetition. You have drawn the member's attention to her relevance to this bill on two occasions and she continues to go on about nothing at all. Standing order 75 prevents irrelevance or tedious repetition of the same point.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I do not think there is a point of order there. I call the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was listening to the points of order as they were raised. When these amendments were moved, the parliamentary secretary who introduced them referred to the full range of all issues relating to deregulation. Something in the order of 80 per cent of the speech given by the parliamentary secretary had nothing to do with the bills before the House. At no point—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business, what is your point of order?




Mr Burke:
  My point of order is on relevance and the breadth of this debate. That was established by the parliamentary secretary at the beginning of the debate. If members of the government want to change the rules midway through then those relevance rules which were not applied—with no points of order at all—to the parliamentary secretary's introduction will change the nature of this debate for the rest of today.




Ms CHESTERS:
  The bills I am referring to today are the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 and the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014. Comments made by previous speakers also outline clearly that these particular bills before us—and today's entire charade around red tape repeal day—does in fact relate to the resumption of indexation of the fuel excise in line with the consumer price index.


As I continue to repeat, the government has put the increase in the fuel excise back on the table. Yes, they are doing it in a sneaky way. They have put it into their red tape repeal documents; they have listed it here in their red tape repeal documents. They do not want to debate this issue. They do not want the Senate to have the opportunity to talk about increasing petrol tax because they know how much of a stinker it is in regional Victoria. It is an absolute stinker to be increasing petrol prices. It hits small business, it hits our farmers and it hits our families. That is what is before us today. It exposes how this government likes to hide behind its own red tape. It likes to create this charade. Contained in their red tape repeal day bill is the fact they are increasing compliance costs for petrol stations. That is what I have tried to highlight in this speech. With their charade of, 'We're going to repeal red tape; we're going to make it easier for business', they are making it harder for petrol stations. Through this particular measure they are making every single petrol station become a tax collector for this government.


This is what their red tape repeal day is all about—it is all about smokescreens and increasing pressure on families. Rather than being up-front about it, whether before the election or now, this government is trying to ambush the Australian people. Petrol costs are a big issue. They are a very big issue to people in the country and in 12 days time the price of petrol for regional Australians will increase.



Guess what is also going to happen in 12 days time? Prepolls for the Victorian state election will also happen. Perhaps that is why this government does not want to talk about what is really going on and why people do not like the increase to the petrol tax. People do not like the fact that this government will resume the indexation of the fuel excise in line with the consumer price index, a measure which is contained in this document. (Time expired)

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (13:19):  I am very happy to speak to the amendment to the government's amendment bill, rather than speaking on any topic of my choosing and making the same point over and over for the same 15 minutes. I encourage the new member to read standing order 75(a). It was very generous of you, Deputy Speaker, not to use your power to have her discontinue her speech—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  The member for Mitchell will address the bill.




Mr HAWKE:
  which was completely irrelevant. We could open up a whole range of irrelevancies, including your performance in government—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Mitchell will address the bill before the House.




Mr HAWKE:
  I am very happy to comply with the relevant standing orders, unlike members opposite. This amendment bill is extremely important. It is not a charade. It is not a sham. It is not a pretend bill. This is a real bill amending all of the different statutes which require a reduction in red tape in our society—and there are many. We heard from the previous government they did this as a matter of course. We have heard, from many speakers, that they did it secretly in many cases: 'This was just an ordinary day in the office for us—we came into parliament, we moved a bill and we changed spellings and deregulated by stealth.' It was so effective you never even saw it! That was the problem. It was so effective you never did see deregulation from the previous government. You never did hear about it; it was deregulation by stealth, the opposition would have us believe.


We know, of course, there is no such thing as deregulation by stealth. The previous government added enormous amounts of statutes and regulations to the bill—20,000 new acts and repeals—and that was a great addition to the burden of red tape on the Australian people. We do not accept the deregulation by stealth argument the opposition has put forward. We do not accept that this deregulation and removal of red tape is unnecessary in Australia today, because when you talk to businesses or people in the community, they are calling for many of the things that are in this amendment. They are saying: 'These are the things that are delaying our days, when we trying to get business done, when we are trying to employ people and trying to expand our business and its impact on the community.' These are the sorts of things that are taking up their time.


There are many good features you will find in this particular bill. In fact, this particular spring session is the second. I think the Manager of Opposition Business is about to pull a very big tactic because he is so frightened of deregulation. What have you got to hide, as an opposition, about deregulation? (Quorum formed) I am grateful to the Manager of Opposition Business for bringing in such an illustrious audience to hear about why the Abbott government is doing so much to cut red tape and cut regulations off Commonwealth statutes. I know that the members who have joined us are great advocates of deregulation and the government's deregulation agenda. Really, if the Manager of Opposition Business would spend as much time drafting questions—there is something coming up called question time—as he has mucking around tactically here, calling a brilliant House quorum on me, you might have a better standard of questions in question time. It is just a thought—not that I am trying to help over there. More time drafting questions is probably needed.




Ms Rishworth:
  Talk about the bill!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mitchell will address the bill.




Mr HAWKE:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, I got awfully distracted by this whole affair. Back to the bill, the bill in question, the omnibus repeal bill, which I am very, very happy to address. This is part of the government's ongoing deregulation agenda, and it is important that twice a year we have deregulation. It is common in the United States of America, where many statutes and other laws will expire with people leaving office. They will expire automatically. They have many mechanisms to reduce and remove the amount of red tape, laws and regulation in America. However, here in Australia we have not had mechanisms like this that are regular, thorough, complete, that ensure that constantly we remove inactive legislation and regulation that is of no effect that brings the total net regulatory burden down.


Of course we know that the total regulatory reduction in savings for individuals, businesses and the not-for-profit sector will be something in the order of $2.1 billion. It is not about spelling, it is not about a few dollars and cents. It is about $2.1 billion of savings for the individuals, businesses and the not-for-profit sector. It is actually double the target that we have set. You will find in this bill in particular, as well as the repeals of redundant provisions in the acts that are going, the streamlining of many processes. We are also abolishing three bodies in this bill: the Fishing Industry Policy Council, the Product Stewardship Advisory Group and the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council. Getting rid of all these bodies federally—we do not know how many there are, we do not know what they do—is a good thing to do. It is good to downsize the role of government in our society. 


On coming to office the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance asked, 'How many Commonwealth government bodies are there?' It sounds like a simple question; for anyone listening you would think there would be a simple answer. Maybe it would take a period of time to get an answer. How many Commonwealth government agencies does the Commonwealth government administer? The bottom line is that they cannot get a proper answer about how many bodies the Commonwealth government administers. That is how disorganised and how large the Commonwealth government has become: we cannot even identify the number of bodies that we are responsible for. So repealing these three bodies is yet another part, and we are going to be going through more government agencies to reduce the number of committees, bodies and things that we do not need; things that we do not need the government to be involved in or where there are duplicate services available at state level or duplicate services available at other layers of government.


We know, of course, that many of these things are duplicated at state level. The introduction of one-stop shops for environmental approvals is perhaps one of the biggest changes in the way our Commonwealth, our federation, does business in this country. 


One of the most significant problems that we have had as a society has been the knock back of huge amounts of investment, including in states like South Australia, which lost a massive uranium mine because of the overregulation of state and federal governments. There is the time taken when you apply for environmental approvals. There are the multilayers of environmental approvals. There is the reluctance of certain governments to approve big projects, even though they are to the great benefit of their state or the Commonwealth. The one-stop-shop process will ensure that we have better and more streamlined approvals.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:00):  What we just saw was extraordinary. We had government members en masse voting to take themselves off the speaking list. That is what they all just did. We had about eight people from the opposition on the speaking list so it was all going to happen within the time allotted anyway and we would have voted earlier. The only thing that happened with the gag motion was that government members made sure that they did not have to speak. Government members made sure that they were not forced into the humiliating position of having to defend all the hype that the member for Kooyong has attached to today, because today will be as big a fizzer as the last repeal day was.


We have today, for a full day of parliamentary sittings, a grand total of $1.8 million of savings. That is what they are here boasting about in the same week they have added $5.1 million worth of compliance costs onto motorists throughout Australia. More than double additional compliance costs have been put in place in the same week of their big repeal day that delivers only $1.8 million. And you really have to ask some questions about the $1.8 million.


The role of one of the bills we have in front of us is to change punctuation. Its role is to remove hyphens, semicolons and commas and to return commas to other places. It will correct a spelling error that was made in 1995 that the Howard government had not picked up on and we did not pick up on. The member for Kooyong has found it so we need to set aside a day to be able to deal with the additional costs associated with this!


We are dealing with a number of bills today. The first one is the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. This one amends or repeals legislation in the Agriculture, Communications, Environment, Immigration and Border Protection, Industry, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Social Services, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs portfolios. The majority of the measures in this bill are not contentious and in fact the majority of them have zero deregulatory savings attached to them. There is nothing in the majority of the measures to suggest that there is some great burden of regulation that is going to be lifted from small business as a result of their implementation.


Let me give you some examples of what we are getting rid of with the omnibus repeal day bill. We are getting rid of the Fishing Industry Policy Council, which was established by law in 1991 and has never met.




Mr Frydenberg:
  So why keep it?




Mr BURKE:
  We had from the member for Kooyong, 'So why keep it?' We are relaxed about getting rid of it but it is not worthy of the fanfare. It is not worthy of setting aside a day in parliament to say: 'There is something no-one has noticed since 1991. Let us all look at it now and make the member for Kooyong seem incredibly important, because the entire fishing industry will no longer be weighed down by a body that they did not know existed and had not met.'


This bill is amending acts in the Agriculture portfolio to reflect the fact that programs and payments described in those acts are no longer operating or being paid. So no-one is getting the money and the program is not operating any more. By all means get rid of it, but this is like asking for congratulations for being able to queue to get a cup of coffee. It is like being asked to be praised for doing the ordinary work of government. What we have today on these issues is nothing more than the ordinary work of government.


The Australian Communications and Media Authority will now be able to publish certain notices in a variety of methods, including on its website, instead of just the Commonwealth Gazette. Fine. That is an ordinary part of the ordinary business of government.


There is the repeal of an act in the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio that relates to particular tariff decisions made between 1996 and 1999 that are no longer relevant and the repeal of the Patents Amendment (Patent Cooperation Treaty) Act 1979 that amended the Patents Act 1952. The amending act was spent once the amendments passed into law. So in 1979 it had its impact and the amendments took place so you do not need it any more. But that is not worthy of fanfare or an entire day in the parliament to say, 'Great, we are now doing this.' 


I just do not know why on earth we are not debating this in the Federation Chamber, but I do know that every time the government comes forward now saying something is not controversial and asking, 'Will you please send it to the Federation Chamber,' we will have today to compare it with when we make the decision as to what is controversial and what is not. The government has set a very strange standard here in deciding what the view of the House is on what is controversial and should be sent to the Federation Chamber. Issues only go to the Federation Chamber by mutual agreement. The government have set a very unusual standard of what the threshold is for what is considered controversial.


It is repealing the Skilling Australia's Workforce Act 2005, which has already been superseded, repealing the Home and Community Care Act 1985, which was made redundant when the review agreements were deemed national partnership agreements in 2009, and removing social security payments by amending several acts to reflect the fact that no-one has been able to qualify for them since 2000. It is repealing two acts in the Treasury portfolio relating to the termination payments tax. The last termination payment subject to the tax occurred before 1 July 2005. Here is something that is going to be a big relief to small business—repealing the Papua New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1970, which had approved a Commonwealth guarantee on a loan made to Papua New Guinea which has been fully repaid anyway.


With all of these measures there are no deregulatory savings attached. The government want to talk about how much burden we are taking off small business and they give you the total number of acts they are repealing. Overwhelming all the measures I have just referred to are just tiding up, as government does from time to time and as we did. In fact, there are only five measures in this bill that have any deregulatory savings attached to them, worth a total of $1.3 million. These measures are: abolishing the Product Stewardship Advisory Group; amendments to the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, which, among other things, removes the requirement of importers, producers and suppliers of fuel to provide an annual report to environment, saving $30,000; amendments to the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, saving $130,000; simplifying key personnel notification requirements for approved aged care providers, saving $1,160,000; and assisting research and analysis using protected information, saving $5,000.


They are all savings worth having but, make no mistake, the decision of the government that they would dedicate a full day of the House of Representatives debating it means we will spend more money by the parliament sitting than we will be saving. It means the net cost to the budget is a negative because they were not willing to deal with this in the way that we would normally deal with noncontroversial run-of-the-mill legislation.


We do not take issue with the majority of measures contained in the bill. There are some advisory groups within the environment portfolio in particular where there will be a Senate legislation committee inquiry. We just want to confirm that those advisory groups are no longer playing a relevant role, so we will check that. But, other than that, we are completely relaxed about what is in front of us. We will vote for it when the vote comes up later today and we will reserve our right on a couple of those committees while the Senate inquiry determines whether or not a couple of those advisory bodies were in fact playing a relevant role. These include the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council and measures in the hazardous waste act. Understandably, we are taking a cautious approach to ensure that the government's claim that these groups are no longer relevant is in fact valid.


We are committed to an organised and ongoing effort to minimise, simplify and create cost-effective regulation. We are not interested in doing it in a way where the Commonwealth comes out with a net negative on savings that were only being ascribed to the Commonwealth anyway. So for some of these groups, the only savings are not to small business but to the Commonwealth and the cost to the Commonwealth, by insisting we have to have the debate in this chamber, is more than what will be saved. This is reminiscent of a government that as soon as they came to office, having spoken about debt and deficit, decided they would double the deficit and make debt unlimited. In the same way, they came in saying that they wanted to get rid of red tape because red tape costs money and in one day they spend more than they will save. In the same week, they more than doubled the total savings that are allegedly going to come to small business by adding a new compliance burden to every petrol station in the country—$800 per petrol station in Australia on the government's own figures.


The second of the bills is the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014. It repeals 656 acts from the period 1970 to 1979 that are of no consequence at all. They have decided to do this in a staged way. So on repeal day No. 1, we dealt with everything up to 1969 and now we appear to be going a decade at a time so we can work through each decade as we get closer to the next election. In doing so, we will continue to waste entire days of parliamentary sitting time when there are real issues to debate, when there are issues that are genuinely contentious because the government decided they needed to waste a day in here when a noncontroversial debate can very easily happen in the Federation Chamber and none of this is time critical. If it went through a few weeks later, it would make no difference to anything other than their media strategy.


The bill for the amending acts is filled with the repeal of amending legislation. When you have got a principal bill, an amendment bill comes in to change the bill. The moment the bill is proclaimed and the original bill itself has been amended, the amending bill ceases to be relevant. So all they are doing here is just getting rid all at once of bills that technically remain on the statute books that have done their job. You could do a global search on every piece of legislation containing the word 'amending' and get rid of them all at once. But they have decided to make it look like they are going through this methodically. Every amending bill, once proclaimed, has had its impact. There is no reason to do these a decade at a time. This is so the member for Kooyong can claim to have a three-year program.


I must say, I very rarely read political memoirs from anyone on either side of politics. But if the member for Kooyong brings out a book on his time as parliamentary secretary, I am not going near it. There is no way in the world I am going to read a chapter on redundant legislation followed by a chapter on commerce and finish off with the grand chapter on hyphens for his crowning achievements on deregulation.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  He is referring now to a global figure that he wants to point to, none of which is ever relevant to any of the repeal days that we are allegedly meant to focus on. The Navigation Act 1970 amended the Navigation Act 1968. The amending act became redundant once the amendments passed into law. So, okay, we are going to repeal it. It will make no difference to anyone—other than it may form an additional page in a chapter of the memoirs of the member for Kooyong. The Book Bounty Act 1970 amended the Book Bounty Act 1969. Book bounties themselves were repealed in 1990. So with the principal legislation being amended, gone, the amending act technically remains on the statute books. Now we are going to dedicate a day to getting rid of something like that as well. The Home Savings Grant Act 1975 which, amended the Home Savings Grant Act 1964, itself was repealed in 2006.


So with the substantial acts being repealed, obviously the amending acts are no longer relevant. If you want to clean them up, by all means clean them up. But why on earth is this meant to be an important day in the history of the Federation for a bonfire of regulation for amending acts that have not been relevant for years and, in fact, ceased to be relevant within moments of them being proclaimed decades ago?


The Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Act 1979 amended the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965. Having been a minister for agriculture, I looked at this and thought, 'Well, why was I never briefed on this when I was minister for agriculture?' The answer, of course, is the 1965 legislation, which provided for the grant of financial assistance to the states for assistance to the poultry industry, was itself repealed in 1996. It has been gone since 1996, and we are meant to be excited here that we are cleaning up the records, getting rid of red tape for an amending bill when the principal legislation has already gone. The explanatory memorandum on the amending acts says it all:




None of the corrections makes any change to the substance of the law
.



Notwithstanding that, the bill has been calculated to generate $100,000 in deregulatory savings. Exactly how you reconcile those concepts and exactly how you have none of these changes making any difference to the substance of the law, but it saves $100,000, is impressive accounting. I look forward to the member for Kooyong addressing this in his later remarks. Thanks to the vote gagging his own members, they will not get to speak, but he will still get a chance to come back into the House later today to let us know how, when none of the changes make any difference to the substance of the law, you can save $100,000 by doing it. Maybe he can factor that against the cost of parliament sitting today, given that this is the only issue we are dedicating ourselves to.


The Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014, otherwise known as the punctuation-led recovery bill, fixes up incorrect cross-references, punctuation errors and spelling errors and places words in their correct alphabetical order—all reasonable things to do at some point in time but hardly worthy of saying, 'We're going to dedicate a day in parliament to this.' What other issue do we dedicate a day in parliament to? We do not dedicate a full day in parliament to talking about what the government wants to do to the pension. We do not have a day in parliament dedicated to which side of politics is committed to the future of Medicare. But we do have a day for getting rid of legislation which makes no difference to the substance of the law and which corrects alphabetical order and punctuation! In terms of the priorities of this government, today can only be described as madness.


There are deregulatory issues to be dealt with, but they are not in front of us today. The only thing that is in front of us today that is significant in terms of deregulation is rhetoric and a media release. For example, the Statute Law Revision Bill changes the expression 'servant' to 'employee'. I am glad that change is being made. It may or may not be changed back during later industrial relations ideas that might come from those opposite, but it happens over 49 pieces of legislation and is, obviously, not an unreasonable change—but, once again, it is part of the ordinary housekeeping of government.


The bill changes gender-specific language to gender-neutral language in seven locations in the Acts Interpretation Act and 87 locations in the Defence Act. This is something that should happen, and I am glad it is happening, but it is certainly not making a difference to small business compliance. I do not know where they get that rhetoric from. It also inserts a new dictionary into the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Again, the explanatory memorandum in this bill says it all:


None of the corrections make any change to the substance of the law.


Notwithstanding that you have that statement, 'None of the corrections make any change to the substance of the law,' the bill has been calculated to generate—wait for it!—$420,000 worth of savings. So none of the corrections makes any difference to the substance of the law but—bingo!—you save $420,000 on the way through. It is true! Getting better cross-referencing in legislation is the right thing to do, but how changing semicolons to full stops, capitalising 82 words, bolding and italicising six phrases or removing erroneous commas contribute to $420,000 in deregulatory savings is a mystery to me—an absolute mystery to me! And I gather, from the text messages currently being furiously sent by the member for Kooyong, that it was a mystery to him until this moment as well.


Our record has been about deregulation without the fanfare. We repealed 16,794 acts and legislative instruments when in government. It is part of the ordinary routine functions of government. Examples of the types of repeal of redundant acts that we undertook were: the repeal of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Act 1919—the one for implementing the Treaty of Versailles—which was still around when we came to office. It was not a disaster that the Howard government or the Fraser government or anyone had not got rid of it, and we never tried to have a grandstanding day. It was silly that it was still on the books, so, as it came to our attention, we got rid of it.


Similarly, in 2012 we repealed the Administrative Arrangements Act 1987, as part of modifications and amendments it had made had already taken effect and there were no instruments or regulations in force under the provisions of that act. So we got rid of it. There was the repeal of the States Grants (Beef Industry) Act 1975. That act had provided for financial assistance to be payable to a state in relation to beef producers. It was redundant. No financial assistance had been paid since 1977. It was redundant and it was repealed in 2011. We also did a routine clean-up of the statute books, in the statute law revision acts of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the statute stocktake appropriation acts of 2012 and 2013 and the Statute Stocktake Act 2011—without the fuss or fanfare.


But then there was the greater deregulation agenda—the deregulation agenda that mattered—which was the Seamless National Economy. That was an agenda aimed at reducing costs for business in complying with unnecessary and inconsistent regulation. That was about dealing with red tape that affects people, not red tape that you have to search dusty old books in the library to try to find, because it is not actually affecting anybody.


Completion of only 17 of the Seamless National Economy reforms was estimated by the Productivity Commission to reduce business costs by $4 billion a year—$4 billion a year! That is roughly double what the government are claiming they are going to be able to achieve. And I have to say that, in terms of their numbers, if they are claiming dollar values for punctuation, I think the numbers they are pointing to need to be viewed with a high degree of suspicion.


The Productivity Commission also estimated that full implementation of the Seamless National Economy reforms would increase productivity through increased gross domestic product by $6 billion a year. Those figures are in stark contrast to the $1.8 million that we are debating today. What we are dealing with today is the ordinary work of government.


I said after the prime ministerial statement last week that I hoped the next repeal day would be better than the last. The last was pretty bad, but it takes a very special parliamentary secretary to say, 'That level of humiliation wasn't enough,' and that he can go one step further! And today the member for Kooyong has delivered. Today the member for Kooyong has made the last repeal day look constructive!


I got stuck into the last one at the time, but it at least did better than $1.8 million—it at least did better than that. Make no mistake; some of what they called 'deregulatory reform' last time round was removing essential protections and having changes that actually hurt people. Nothing was clearer than when they referred to getting rid of red tape, but what it meant was to in future cut the wages of Commonwealth cleaners. That was part of what happened last time.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  While the dollar figures where higher, the reality was that they dressed up as deregulation what actually amounted to cutting the wages of some of the lowest-paid workers, including the very workers who clean the offices for the people who did it to them. 


I want to remind the House of what happened, because when these bills got to the Senate we made it clear that if our amendment was carried we would insist on it. The government ultimately accepted the amendment and we let the bills through in good faith, only to find that within 24 hours they had found another method to still cut the wages of Commonwealth cleaners. If this government want to talk about the total savings, they need to be honest about the irrelevance of most of the measures that we talk about and the real harm that they have done against some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. There is nothing this parliament should be proud of when the last repeal day meant future wage cuts for the people who serve all of us, and every department, in some of the lowest-paid jobs. 


To hear the interjections that have happened during this part of my speech from the parliamentary secretary, saying, 'Oh, it is all deals with unions', I say that the members of those unions are paid a lot less than us. The members of those unions are serving all of our offices and all of the public service and are doing a hard-day's work or hard middle-of-the-night's work. For their pay cut to be part of the fanfare of so-called 'getting rid of red tape' shows a contempt for those individuals in a way that I had hoped this parliament would never show, no matter who was in office. It is one thing for those opposite to say that they do not agree with those rules and that they want a tender process that allows the lowest bidder, whether or not they are keeping to the guidelines, but the audacity of claiming that cleaners getting better wages was an example of red tape—no, it was not red tape; it was their livelihood. It was not red tape in some small business burden. It was how much money the people who clean our offices had to take home. 


The policy that the government adopted was bad enough, but to dress it up with the rhetoric of red tape—and I use the term carefully in this place—was offensive. It was just out and out offensive to claim that better wages for low-paid cleaners was an issue of red tape. If the government wants to pursue lower wages for people, they should have the courage and the guts to do it head-on. But do not have a situation where you dress it up as part of a red tape repeal, reach an agreement with the opposition and then find a side way of doing it anyway within 24 hours. The government treated people with contempt, they then did a deal that gave people hope and then, within 24 hours, they trashed that hope again—and in the rhetoric after said, 'Oh, but everyone will still be paid the same amount at the moment'. Well, they will not be after the next tender, and their wages will be cut because of a deliberate act by this government that was dressed up within the rhetoric of the red tape repeal because the government did not have the courage to deal with it head-on. Decent wages for cleaners should not be viewed as red tape. It should never have happened. The behaviour of the government on the last repeal day was appalling. It is something that will not only affect the view of people in the cleaning industry towards this government; it is also something that will be attached to the character of this government for a very long time to come.


I have gone fairly broadly across the issues relating to red tape repeal. I have done so largely because the rhetoric surrounding this bill goes a long way beyond the actual contents of this bill. Obviously we will be voting for the second reading, but I move a second reading amendment:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House notes that:


(1) repealing spent and redundant acts and regulations is part of the ordinary, routine function of any government and the former Labor Government repealed 16,794 acts and regulations during its time in office;


(2) the former Labor Government had a strong record of deregulation reform which significantly improved the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian economy and, in particular, the former Labor Government through its Seamless National Economy reforms was delivering significant cost savings to businesses—just 17 of these reforms were estimated to lower business costs by $4 billion per year with the full reforms to increase Australia's productivity and deliver a $6 billion boost to GDP per year;


(3) the three bills being debated together provide claimed deregulatory savings of $1,855,000, or just 0.1 per cent of the figure claimed by the Government, with a vast majority of the changes in this bill having no impact in terms of costs or regulatory burden on businesses, individuals and the community sector in Australia; and


(4) the commitment to deregulation should not be used as a cover for threatening fairness, workplace safety, or the protections of our environment.""


The principle of deregulation and getting rid of red tape is one that we should be able to have a mature debate about. Unfortunately, the significant issues in red tape are not before the parliament today. And just watch for the people who have tuned into the radio or today or are watching the telecast because they know that this is the member for Kooyong's big day and the parliamentary ratings will quadruple. The people who are paying attention should listen to the arguments that are put up by the remaining speakers from the government. There are not many of them because most of them voted to get them themselves off the list before the debate commenced. But listen to the arguments and you can bet one thing: their speeches will not be about the bill before the House. Their speeches will be about other issues, because what is in front of the House today is almost entirely inconsequential. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Is the amendment seconded?




Ms Brodtmann:
  I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Watson has moved an amendment to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (10:29):  Is it any wonder people are cynical? Is it any wonder—




Mr Giles:
  No.




Mr LAUNDY:
  Thank you to the honourable member opposite. We have just spent an hour and a half talking about where this debate should happen. It is just mind blowing. 


I follow the member for Watson. He and I attended the same school. He was a year ahead of me. Our paths parted at that point. The member for Watson went to study at university. I am sure he got involved in student politics and unions. He went to the state parliament of New South Wales and then ended up here. I, through university, worked in my family's business, the third generation of my family to do so. Upon completing that degree, I started work full time and had 23 years working for my father. The Prime Minister last night said something that really captured my heart in a speech he gave to the Business Council of Australia. He challenged the business community not to sit in the grandstand, not to stay in the armchair but to engage in the debate.


There has been a lot said this week about mature and sensible debate. I have had 14 months here, and I am sad to say that I think that that is a political oxymoron. The Prime Minister this week has raised issues of our Federation—and I will talk about this later. We stand at a crossroads as a country. When I was sitting in my family's business, life made sense, and what the Prime Minister said last night encapsulates my motivation to be here. Unlike the member for Watson and all those opposite, sitting on this side of the House we have doctors, lawyers, farmers, vets, teachers—people who were in the front lines before they came here, people who have grappled with all that red tape. 


I rise to talk against the amendment and to support the original bill, the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill. I would like to thank the Prime Minister, first and foremost, for having the foresight to take this into his portfolio and to put in charge my good friend the member for Kooyong. By running this out of the Prime Minister's own portfolio, he dictated to our side how serious he was about attacking this problem, this most burdensome of problems, that chokes business at every turn. The member for Kooyong did me the great honour of coming to me very early upon my election, knowing that I came from a business background, and asking would I give him a hand. And I was humbled to do so.


The member for Kooyong has worked tirelessly, not just on the first repeal day but on this second repeal day. This is not the start of things; this is the continuation of a journey that this government will not turn its back on and that we will not make fun of. I understand—having been in business and having faced not just federal government but all three levels, which I will talk about later—what this looks like and what hurdles you have to jump through as a result.


I sat here for an hour and 35 minutes and watched those opposite laugh, interject and belittle every business operator in Australia, and treat them with disdain. And I say: shame on you. We are not only delivering—




Ms Brodtmann:
  Semicolons?




Mr LAUNDY:
  There it is again, 'hyphens and commas'. It shows you the depth of the business understanding on the other side. We went to the election with the commitment of $1 billion a year. I want to congratulate the parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, because today he announced $2.1 billion in savings. Keep it up, Josh! 


This government recognises the importance of cutting red tape. Every day we are looking for ways to build a strong and prosperous economy for Australia, and we are removing the burdens. A report released overnight by Deloitte Access states that government regulations cost $27 billion a year to administer—that is us—and cost businesses $67 billion a year to comply with. That is $94 billion—for those who have not done the mental arithmetic. 


We have established deregulation units across government, and each minister has been instructed to undertake portfolio audits and identify areas in his or her portfolio where overregulation is a problem. And there are many of these areas. You have heard about the 16,000 the former government took away; what they omitted to tell you about was the 21,000 pieces of new legislation in their last six-year term. That is just at a federal level, and that is on top of all the pre-existing legislation that already sits in the statute books that businesses have to deal with. 


As the Prime Minister said in his speech last night to the Business Council of Australia, 'Our job is to reduce regulations so that business is busy innovating rather than lobbying.' 




Mr Frydenberg:
  Hear, Hear!




Mr LAUNDY:
  I say 'hear, hear,' to that too, Member for Kooyong. One particular area of note in which we are achieving savings for Australian companies is our competitiveness agenda, where we have streamlined regulatory arrangements. Earlier this year I met with a range of industry representatives from the hygiene and cosmetics industry, and heard case after case of regulatory overlap, inefficiency, pointless bureaucracy, and duplication. 


And I will give you an example—I have said this in this House before—NICNAS, the TGA and APVMA cross three ministerial portfolios. Navigating products through those three portfolios was not only at the point of having ground to a halt, there was the absurd situation where a cosmetics company wanted to put some rolled oats into a pack to release for kids as a Christmas promotion. They were notified by NICNAS that it was, under their definitions, a chemical that could not be dispensed to children. Rolled oats? I don't know about you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta—I know you have a young family—but my kids live on rolled oats, especially in winter. 


This cross-ministerial portfolio—and bodies like NICNAS, TGA and APVMA, that operate off budget, that are a cost-recovery model—that is the stuff we are talking about here. That is what the member for Watson has missed completely. I notice he did not mention the one-stop shop for environmental approvals. I heard the member for Kooyong say $426 million in compliance costs—but, thinking as a businessman thinks, here is the kicker: it is estimated that we will gain $120 billion to the GDP of the economy over the next 12 years as a result.


One example the Prime Minister used last week was Cochlear. The member for Kooyong and I have spoken of this. Cochlear is very close to my family's heart for personal reasons. It is an organisation that I have spoken about prior in this place. We have changed the regulation to allow Cochlear to use the internationally recognised European Union certification—isn't that a mouthful—and avoid having to go through another certification process here in Australia. This means thousands of people will be able to access their devices up to a year earlier than they would been able to. These significant life-changing devices count, take it from me, on a personal level. To give you a local example, I met a gentleman in my electorate who closed his factory. It was too late; we could not save him, Member for Kooyong. He told me anecdotally that he has relocated his business and 22 jobs to New Zealand. Why? Because the cost of bringing chemicals into this country was prohibitive, and it was cheaper to do it in New Zealand. We change that today. Unfortunately for this gentleman and for the 22 Australians that lost their job it was too late, but it is not too late, looking forward, to ensure that this does not happen again.


While I applaud the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary for their work in this space, I cannot help but think to myself that there is so much more to do. I am not just talking about repealing unnecessary regulations and easing the burden of red tape for Australian business, as important as that is. In a week where we are challenging all in this place to have a mature and sensible debate about the future of our Federation, I believe what lies at the heart of this bill has been in fact a major failing of our Federation. I spoke in my maiden speech of the fact that with six states, two territories and a federal government, this country is like a business with nine head offices. When you add the 564 local governments across Australia, the problem becomes magnified in a way that is unsustainable and must be addressed.


At all three levels of government we are lacking people that come from a small and family business background—people who have a commercial understanding of what red tape looks like because they battle with it every day of their business life. They understand that every business in this country has two sides to their profit and loss statement, revenue and expenses, and that when revenue is soft the management of expenses becomes even more vital. Red tape has a direct impact on the expense side of every business in Australia. When you multiply the impact through each level of government it results in a dramatic increase in expenses and an equally dramatic decrease in business profits. In my mind, this is where the most massive failure of the past 113 years of our Federation lies.


We should not only have a mature and rational debate but also we must act. We must chance our mindset. Today, with my background in family business, I want to attempt to add to this debate in a way that I believe has been missing until today. What I am hoping to see is an understanding in government no matter federal, state or local that we are more than law makers and regulators—and here is the key—we are business partners. The past 113 years has focused far too heavily on the regulatory mentality without looking at the actions we take in this place through the eyes of a business partner, a partner who works to promote business and the enterprising spirit of Australians, rather than a government whose work all too often restrains Australian business.


Through our corporate tax system we take between 30c and 49c of every dollar of profit a business makes, depending on ownership structure. I cannot stress this enough: we are not simply regulators and legislators; we are stakeholders in the profitability of every business that calls Australia home.


To put the $94 billion in some context, if that is a company structure, a third is ours. The $94 billion of costs we are imposing takes $94 billion from business profitability in this country and we get between 30c and 49c in the dollar—to relate it back to the Deloitte Access Economics report released this morning. At this stage in our fiscal process we need to make sure that revenue through taxation is as high as it can be. We must change our thinking to be more than regulators. We are business partners. Rather than just legislators, we are stakeholders.


I am talking about cultural change, Member for Kooyong. In my maiden speech I challenged the ministers in this government to run their departments as you would run a business—lean and efficient. But, in saying that, I was short-sighted—as short-sighted as those that have come before me. Yes, ministers must lead from the front and promote this commercial mentality, but we must also work to encourage their departments to think like they are both regulators and stakeholders. It is the same challenge for them that it is for us. What I am trying to promote here is a complete change in culture. Ministers must continue to challenge their departments to streamline existing regulation and introduce future regulation in a way which makes the cost of complying as minimal as possible, so that profit can be as large as possible and so can our share.


We must have a mindset change across this entire parliament and look at the challenges ahead of the Australian economy with a more commercial approach. I believe it is vital for the Prime Minister to make these issues front and centre of COAG discussions. It should be a priority at the most senior levels of this country, as the more profit our businesses make the more revenue we as a government can collect through taxation and the more we can spend on the states and territories. With a coalition government, that revenue will be spent on large-scale projects that create jobs, improve productivity and promote prosperity throughout the country.


Given the fiscal position we find ourselves in as a nation, there is no doubt we need to address this revenue side of the government as well. But we must be smart about how we increase that revenue. In this respect I congratulate the Prime Minister for undertaking the white paper on reform of Australia's tax system, and I look forward to the discussions ahead in this area. It is time to have a mature and sensible discussion about the future of our Federation, but we cannot do that without pointing out the failings. When the regulatory framework ties up business, adds to their expenses and lowers their profitability to the point of pushing businesses offshore, these issues should be at the core of the debate. In his address last night, the Prime Minister said, 'We can be fans in the stands, we can be armchair critics or we can help to make it happen.' That is the call to arms. I congratulate the parliamentary secretary. That is his call to arms. He has done an outstanding job, and I am honoured to have been involved in this in some small part.


I would like to close with one thought to highlight how important this is. With a World Economic Forum global ranking of 124 out of 148 countries for 'burden of government regulation', it could not be more apparent that these measures today are urgent. They are a start and they need to continue not only for the future of our Federation but also, and much more importantly, for the future of our children.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (10:44):  One thing is clear: this is not much of a tea party. I know the parliamentary secretary is looking for an alternative form of engagement, but I do not recommend he looks to a role in the provision of high tea at the Windsor in that regard. What we see here is the supercharged rhetoric of the members opposite not matching the reality—the second time around. The last time we had this debate, the autumn repeal day—we talked about a bonfire. What we had was a bonfire of the vanity of the parliamentary secretary. It shows the priority of members opposite here that we are devoting today to ideology in place of substance. I think the member for Watson's contribution took us through that quite effectively. I did see the parliamentary secretary paying careful attention to the contribution of the shadow minister, as he should have done. 


I was interested to follow the member for Reid's speech for a couple of reasons.




Mr Frydenberg:
  Very good speech!




Mr GILES:
 I think it was a curate's egg of a speech. The one thing that was clear was the assessment of the member for Watson. The member for Watson's crystal ball worked pretty well, because it showed that the member for Reid had no interest in talking about the matters that are before the House.




Mr Nikolic:
  He has run small businesses, not like you.




Mr GILES:
  Yes, he has run a small business. That is not the matter which is before the House. He did not devote his speech to these three bills. I will take up the interjection, because he talked about vocations that people have before coming to this place that are worthwhile. I was pleased—and I think I can say touched!—that he recognised the front-line work of lawyers as being an appropriate calling to come here. So I thank the member for Reid for that. I was a little surprised to hear that, but I thank you for that vote of confidence. He talked about the need for a mature debate. What we have seen in the government's deregulatory agenda is anything but that. It is a triumph of stunts over substance.




Mr Frydenberg:
  You wish you came up with that.




Mr GILES:
  No, no. I will turn to that briefly, Parliamentary Secretary, because what Labor is interested in in this debate are the first principles. I think everyone in this place is opposed to unnecessary regulation. That is an easy statement to make. It is a little harder to give effect to, as this debate is demonstrating. Let us think about first principles. The member for Reid also touched on the Deloitte report, which has been reported on in today's The Age newspaper. I look forward to digesting that report. I noted the comments of Chris Richardson from Deloitte as reported in The Age. He said this:


Let's be clear. Rules and regulations are vitally necessary. They cement the key foundations of our society, protecting the rule of law and a wealth of standards in everything from health to safety and the environment.  


He went on to issue a challenge, a challenge that Labor members are up for, to look to the costs and to the benefits in enacting or, indeed, repealing legislation. To look at the costs and benefits—I think that is a pretty firm foundation for our engagement in this debate. It is very disappointing that the government's desire to manage the media cycle and no doubt to appease its ideological backers gets in the way of a proper consideration of the costs and benefits of particular pieces of legislation.


I was invited earlier to look to our record and I am very proud to do so. When you look at a worthwhile piece of deregulation, a worthwhile deregulatory agenda, I look at the former government's work through the COAG Reform Council and the Seamless National Economy. To touch on just one aspect of that which achieved great things in terms of consumer protection as well as productivity benefits and significant savings, I think about the step of establishing a single Australian consumer law—a single set of consumer protections—saving a billion dollars per annum. Sensible, effective, first-principles-informed deregulatory reform. Unnecessary regulation does not constitute the stunts that we are seeing today; it is a considered approach. Sometimes, as the member for Watson said, it is the routine business of government, the tidying up; on other occasions it is about doing hard work, having a mature debate. As has been said previously in this place, I believe by the member for Fraser, it is pretty clear to us that it is not a volume. This is not an exercise of piling up statutes, piling up hyphen-riven amendments; it is about the quality of the regulations, not the volume. That is pretty fundamental.


What we see here throughout this, in the desire to paint a clear ideological picture on the part of the member for Kooyong, are the ideological foundations of the debate going far beyond the practical matters that ought be considered here. Of the three bills that are before us today, I will largely confine my remarks to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, which amends and repeals legislation in Agriculture, Communications, Environment, Immigration, Border Protection, Industry, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Social Services, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs portfolios. Of course, it is one of three bills we will be debating today as part of the much vaunted spring repeal day package. But, despite the government's rhetoric, the savings in this bill are calculated to be a very small amount. To say it again: this is not much of a tea party. I note, as the member for Watson did, that this bill does not contain some of the measures that were outlined in the ministerial statement or some that have been featured reasonably prominently in media commentary. I will turn to this later in my contribution.


I note briefly the member for Watson dealt with the other two bills in his contribution and that these bills are largely concerned with repeal of amending legislation that is no longer in effect. I note briefly the irony of the parliamentary secretary effectively adding red tape in terms of enacting legislation that is clearly entirely redundant in terms of its effect.


Back in autumn I had the opportunity to speak on the previous omnibus repeal day during the consideration in detail stage, because, once again, the government lacks the courage of its convictions in this space and gagged debate there. It was not surprising that government members declined the opportunity to contribute to that debate, because then, as now, we have a lot of sound and fury that signify absolutely nothing. The parliamentary secretary then stood in this place, stood up loudly, beat his chest, made all kinds of claims about the Abbott's governments achievements at large. In fact, I particularly remember him invoking the great spirit of Menzies. It is telling that today in a less charged atmosphere he made no such invocations. I already have my doubts about this government being remembered favourably by anyone.


We have been remembering governments past in this place in recent weeks, and I think it bears us all reflecting on the enormous contrast between the breadth of vision, engagement and achievement of the Whitlam government and what we have seen in the past 14 months—achievements of substance by a government that transformed this country for the better or the combination of incoherence and ideology that has characterised this government. This is a government that does not do much, and what it does do it does badly. For instance, the Prime Minister associates this and the previous omnibus repeal bill with savings figures in the billions of dollars—although I note the parliamentary secretary has been dialling this down. Closer scrutiny of the explanatory memorandum reveals this figure to be relatively paltry for this bill. It is pretty small beer.


As the member for Watson has noted, this bill does not contain some of the deregulatory measures outlined in the ministerial statement—for example, ending the requirement to put mudflaps on motorbikes, changing OHS requirements for government building sites and changes to the Do Not Call Register are not among measures which are contained in this bill. Perhaps this may be seen as the Abbott government's competitive agenda in a nutshell: a series of announcements with very large numbers, and what is actually being achieved? Very little of substance.


Yesterday in this place we spent some time drawing out the government's hollow and vain rhetoric as it mutated into something much more sinister with the increase of the petrol tax. We saw the government facetiously cite the alcopops regulation, which took place under the former government, to justify this cynical circumventing of the parliament. This government is, effectively, comparing youth binge drinkers with everyday motorists. There is of course a massive difference between increasing the cost of alcopops to discourage youth binge drinking and this government's breaking of yet another election promise and increasing a tax that will hit people who are just trying to get to work or run some errands.


The Abbott government's own repeal day documents reveal the impact of the petrol tax ambush will be wider, with every petrol station to be slugged an amount of around $800 a year in new compliance costs to collect this tax. According to their own information, the government will hit the nation's 6,300 petrol stations with compliance costs totalling over $5 million. There is little doubt that this increased compliance cost will be passed on to motorists when they fill up at the bowser. They will be hit twice by this new petrol tax.


Make no mistake: this increase to the tax without concurrent spending on public transport will hurt the people I represent in the electorate of Scullin. There are, of course, limited and in many cases no alternatives to driving in Scullin and in outer suburbs right across Australia. We heard yesterday about where the revenue from this increase in the petrol tax will be going in Melbourne: to the east-west tollway, a tollway which does nothing for the people in Melbourne's northern suburbs except divert much-needed money away from investment in our roads and public transport.


I turn to one element of the bill in particular. We do have concerns about the effects of the bill. As well as the tidying up there are some matters of substance which do need to be attended to. In particular I am concerned about the reduction of information required to be contained in permits for the import or, indeed, the export of hazardous waste. I make this point: unlike those opposite, we do not believe that all environmental protection legislation is bad and in need of removal. We look to the evidence. We look to the first principles. I echo the contribution of that renowned socialist Chris Richardson of Access Economics. We look to the first principles to inform the necessity or otherwise of particular regulations. And it is particularly concerning to me that the parliamentary secretary has cited with such glowing approval the attempted repeal by the so-called Minister for the Environment of important environmental legislation in the EPBC Act. This reinforces the concerns I have that require further scrutiny. I note the aspect of the bill that I have touched upon—the proposed changes to hazardous waste—only saves $130,000. In this context I definitely think this is something which deserves much greater scrutiny before we potentially subject our environment to what could be devastating damage. 


As the member for Watson drew out quite effectively, the activity of repealing spent and redundant acts and legislative instruments is part of the normal operation of government. It is what every government does. It is what every government should do. It is telling that the achievements of this government are so thin they feel the need to shout this from the rooftops and dress it up in such rich ideological baggage. The Abbott government in putting before us these bills and the show that goes with them seem to be demanding applause for simply walking and chewing gum at the same time. Perhaps when we look at the record writ large that is a reasonable request. I repeat the words of the member for Watson: in government, without fanfare, without a song and dance, without wasting the parliament's time, Labor repealed 16,794 acts and instruments. Labor did not need a special day or days to do it; we got on with the job of government.


Really, underpinning this is a big debate about the role of government, and I do thank the member for Reid for touching upon that and for touching upon serious considerations about the future of Federation. But this is not a mature debate or how we should have a mature debate. What is really interesting about this bill and the related legislation—contrary to everything the member for Reid said—is that it reveals how ideologically driven the government is on the one hand and how narrow the scope of its ambitions are on the other.


This is a government that is obsessed with the notion that all government is bad and that a survival-of-the-fittest, dog-eat-dog world is the best. We have a contrary view. The weak should be protected from the strong. People need the law to be on their side when odds are stacked against them. And, while there is a real debate to be had about deregulation, it is through this first-principles frame that Labor will approach it, looking at what is necessary and not simply asserting it. This is a debate that has been entirely filled with assertion from members opposite. It is underpinned by a fundamental irony. In all this talk about reducing red tape, this package of bills, like the omnibus bills in the autumn, seem ultimately to be about making busywork to keep the member for Kooyong, the parliamentary secretary, busy.


The Australian people are entitled to something that is more than glib, disingenuous assurances that this bill does no harm. More scrutiny is necessary in relation to certain aspects of it, and that is why we have moved to have this bill subject to a Senate inquiry—a good and proper process. Labor continues to be committed to an organised and ongoing effort to minimise, simplify and create cost-effective regulation informed by first principles.


I started this contribution by noting that this does not constitute much of a tea party. This bill is all about ideology, celebrating a particular view of the world without giving that view particular expression, and that is the sad thing on the part of the parliamentary secretary. This is ultimately government members looking in the mirror and liking what they see, and that is fair enough, but the parliament's time would be much better spent debating our real priorities—the future of Medicare, the higher education reforms—not a narrow exercise in ideology dressed up as something that it is not.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (10:59):  I rise to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills. That the member for Scullin does not see them as 'a real priority' is extraordinary, because that just does not reflect the feedback I have been getting from people in my electorate—businesses, organisations and others. As Tasmania's representative on the coalition's deregulation committee, I am pleased to join my colleagues in welcoming this bill which sends another very powerful message to the people of Australia.


I am proud to join this outstanding parliamentary secretary who has been doing outstanding work in this space. Often we talk about leadership and, when you fundamentally distil it, leadership is an influence relationship. It is about standing next to the big problems of most concern to our community and doing something about them. This Prime Minister, the ministers in his cabinet and this parliamentary secretary are standing next to a very big problem that I hear about every day in my community. I hear them tell me that this is indeed a real problem for our community. The combined effect of the two repeal days, the one in March and the one we are having now, represents a doubling of our promised target. We said that we would save a billion dollars each year in red and green tape. This parliamentary secretary and the Prime Minister have delivered $2.1 billion in reduced compliance costs, with 400 measures to cut red tape across all agencies. That is, quite simply, real progress on problems that have a real impact on our national productivity.


What a contrast, in just the first year of the coalition government, with the inactivity in this area from those opposite during six years of 'hard Labor' from 2008 to 2013. You will no doubt recall Prime Minister Rudd's famous one on, one off promise—that for every new regulation that came through from the bureaucracy to the polity and out into our society, he would take one regulation out. He never met that promise. Indeed, what we saw was 21,000 new regulations come in—additional regulations—at the end of Labor's six years in office.


We have heard some comments this morning about lessons in economic history. I know the member for Kooyong is an economic historian. He looks at these things very carefully and he has written quite eloquently about the fact that, in the five financial years from mid-2007 until 2012, multifactor productivity in this country declined across Australia by three per cent. This is a real priority for our country because what we are doing will lift productivity; it will reduce the input costs on business, make them invest more and create more jobs. In my state of Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment rate in the country, that is particularly important.


In my home state of Tasmania I hear this persistent message from businesses, chambers of commerce and numerous other stakeholders. It reinforces what a red-hot button issue this is. They tell me about regulation imposing delays in getting projects approved and of the doubling up that occurs. I have people in the aged-care sector tell me that each year they have to go to hundreds of hours of effort to get their annual certification from both the state and the central government—hundreds of hours of essentially the same work. I have a small engineering firm telling me about an OH&S problem. The proprietor laid a harness down in front of me that is used for working on tall buildings. To me it looked like a new harness—the D-rings were in great shape, the stitching was in great shape—but he had to replace that harness simply because of its age. He had to get it checked twice every year—usually by people associated with the union movement and who imposed a cost on checking that harness—not because it was unsafe but because the binding, stifling regulation imposed by those opposite imposed that additional cost on his business. He would rather have been using that money to invest in his business.


Fixing these things is not a stunt, as the member for Scullin and his colleagues say it is. We are doing what we should do—listening to the people in our community and taking action. It is not as if Labor was not warned about the stifling impacts of their regulatory regime. Julia Gillard's own Borthwick-Milliner review in 2012, which looked at her government's regulation impact assessment processes, said 'a widespread lack of acceptance of and commitment by ministers and agencies' was a serious impediment to their effective use. The Gillard government was warned about the impact of their regulatory regime and they would not change because what we saw, in six years of Labor, was a deeply ingrained cultural foundation of risk aversion and centralised control. Every issue was always likely to get another regulatory sprinkle from Julia Gillard or Kevin Rudd. That was seen as the solution to all problems—a little bit more Julia and a little bit more Kevin.


That is not good enough today, and the Abbott government has meaningfully addressed these concerns. We are ingraining a different culture within the bureaucracy and the polity. The Prime Minister himself has taken the lead on these issues. He has made regulatory reform a criterion of success for his ministers—the bureaucrats whose pay is linked to how successful they are at taking away some of those binding coils of regulation that stifle productivity in our country.


What we are trying to achieve is unity of purpose. We are trying to get the federal government and the state governments working more closely together. I will give you two examples of where that did not occur in the past. My predecessor, in mid-2011, opened a $1 million Building the Education Revolution facility at the Ringarooma Primary School at the same time that the state education minister—a Green in the Labor cabinet—was planning to close the Ringarooma Primary School. It was a clear case of left-hand, right-hand, with the Labor-Green government in Canberra and the Labor-Green government in Hobart each not knowing what the other was doing.


Nicola Roxon, I remember, came to Tasmania when she was the health minister to announce new beds for Northern Tasmania at the same time that the state government was disinvesting in health to the point that the Launceston General Hospital was closing two wards. On the one hand, there was the federal government saying, 'Here is money for new beds' and, on the other hand, the state government was disinvesting and taking money out of the healthcare system. We have a better health minister today who will make sure, in consultation with Michael Ferguson—that outstanding health minister in Tasmania—that will never happen again.


As a courtesy to my colleagues, I will keep my remarks much shorter than I intended. There are a huge number of speakers on our side of the House, but I will end where I started by congratulating the member for Kooyong, that outstanding parliamentary secretary who is making a real difference in leading the effort to make sure that red tape does not continue to spiral out of control and we make a real difference with the regulatory regime in this country.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:07):  I speak in relation to Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 and the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014. In a day that would rival New Year's Day in the affection of Australians, we are now celebrating yet another of the Abbott government's repeal days; another day that will launch a million-dollar press release—not a billion-dollar press release; another day that borrows from the US Republican playbook, and another day when the government expects a standing ovation for simply doing the everyday task of government: repealing spent and redundant acts and legislative instruments.


This was work that the Labor government, when we were in power, did without fuss and fanfare. I spoke on these types of bills many, many times in the previous six years under the Labor government but I do not recall too many of the coalition members actually speaking. In fact, many times these types of bills were sent to the Federation Chamber, where there was bipartisan agreement—getting rid of a comma or a semicolon, obsolete wording, errors of drafting and the like. Of course the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014 corrects drafting errors, modernises language, removes gender-specific language and repeals spent and obsolete provisions and acts. It is a bit like what we did when we were in government, but we did not set aside a whole day and issue press releases saying how wonderful we were.


The Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 repeals about 650 amending acts or repeal acts between 1970 and 1979. That is all it was. Most of those provisions are spent, obsolete and redundant. Of course that is a big deal, according to this government. I think those opposite must be reading from the talking points of their ministers in relation to billions of dollars, because the truth is that these three bills together provide savings of $1.855 million including, by the way, the largest being in my shadow portfolio area of ageing, which is about $1.16 million in relation to notifications. That is what the explanatory memorandum and the documents associated with this particular legislation show.


That is as the shadow minister, the member for Watson, talks about—just 0.1 per cent of the figure claimed by the government. When we get those opposite talking like this about how wonderful this legislation is, it reminds me that the coalition is great at over-egging and scaremongering but also great at over-egging their achievements. This is what they are doing here today.


We demonstrated our commitment to minimising, simplifying and creating cost-effective legislation. We worked with the states and territories through the COAG process. Remember the COAG process? In my portfolio area of Indigenous affairs, the coalition does not seem to be working at all through the COAG process. It abolished the COAG Reform Council, which was measuring how the government was achieving the Closing the Gap targets—and it was supposed to be partisan, by the way. It is doing nothing through the COAG process in Indigenous health—in fact, that is the evidence that departmental officials gave to the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs that I am a member of. The government was supposed to be dealing with the COAG process in agreeing to the bipartisan targets for justice, because of the terrible incarceration rate in this country for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was supposed to be agreeing with us that, no matter which side of politics got in in September 2013, justice targets and Closing the Gap would be worked on. 


However, when we were in government we worked through the COAG process on the Seamless National Economy reforms. These reforms were about reducing the cost of business, and they were a success. In 2012 the Productivity Commission—not an organisation affiliated with the Australian Labor Party—assessed 17 of these reforms for its report Impacts of COAG reforms: business regulation and VET. The Productivity Commission suggested that these 17 reforms would increase the GDP by about 0.4 per cent, over $6 billion, and reduce business costs by about $4 billion a year. They estimated that the full implementation of those reforms that Labor pursued in government would lead to a dramatic increase in national productivity. 


In contrast, we have the coalition government talking about their wonderful work, without acknowledging—and speaker after speaker today has not acknowledged—the nearly 17,000 acts and legislative instruments that Labor got rid of when we were in government. Often the changes we made were minor, but we did not break into a tap dance at the dispatch box when we made them. We removed redundant regulations, sunset clauses and other provisions that needed correction. We did it because that is what any government does. We did it without pointscoring, and it was often a bipartisan approach. 


As I have said, I have spoken many times in relation to this legislation. I cannot say I gave my best speeches in the House of Representatives on it, but this legislation often was passed without any razzamatazz at all, to be honest. The majority of measures in this particular omnibus repeal day bill simply involve, as I said, repeal of redundant provisions. They are not contentious. They do not have any deregulatory savings attached to them. It is somewhat curious that the Prime Minister mentioned in his ministerial statement certain things—which were later reported in the media—that were going to be put in this particular legislation, including, for example, the requirement to attach mudflaps to motorbikes, changes to the Do Not Call Register by removing the requirement to reregister every eight years, and changes to occupational health and safety on government building sites. Many of these measures remain. 


No matter how much the government keeps talking about these things and over-egging these measures, the truth is that none of them will change the world in any dramatic way and they will not save much in terms of dollars in compliance costs. For example, we see in the bill the abolition of the Fishing Industry Policy Council of Australia. Just briefly, the Fishing Industry Policy Council of Australia was established under the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to provide a forum for the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries Services Australia and fishing industry officials. The forum has not convened, by the way, since the enabling legislation commenced, so abolishing it will not save a dollar. Also in the agricultural portfolio, the bill amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to reflect certain payments to industry marketing and research bodies that are no longer made and, in fact, have not been made since 2008. The amendments will not save a dollar in compliance costs. 


In the communications portfolio, Australians will no doubt be relieved to learn that the bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 so that ACMA can publish its notices in a variety of methods. Currently, the Broadcasting Services Act requires ACMA to publish notices in the Commonwealth government gazette. This bill enables ACMA to publish these notices on its website and in newspapers. Gee! That is groundbreaking stuff. Thank goodness we have devoted a whole day in the chamber to this sort of stuff. The bill also repeals a redundant section in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, as SBS has assumed television production and supply of activities previously undertaken by the National Indigenous TV Limited. 


In relation to other areas, another measure that is unlikely to set the cat amongst the pigeons is the abolition of the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council. From now on, the Department of the Environment will be able to engage with industry experts on a needs basis to gather advice and guidance on review process and other matters relating to the Product Stewardship for Oil Scheme. 


In the immigration portfolio, the bill repeals the Customs (Tariff Concession System Validations) Act 1999. The purpose of this act is to validate particular decisions in relation to tariff concession orders that were made between 15 July 1996 and 31 May 1999. Decisions outside the period that ended 15 years ago are not affected and are therefore redundant. The omnibus bill repeals and amends a whole range of acts in relation to industry.


In terms of my shadow portfolio area, we are seeing some changes in relation to HACC. There is the repeal of the Home and Community Care Act. The act was redundant when the bilateral Home and Community Care program review agreements were deemed national partnership agreements—remember those national partnership agreements? Those opposite do not really like them—under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. We are getting rid of provisions in an act of parliament that are no longer necessary. So that is great; it will save a lot of money! A provision in the Aged Care Act that the sector really like, that we support and that is the largest deregulation savings in this bill—$1.160 million of $1.855 million will be saved—removes the obligation for approved providers to notify the secretary of the Department of Social Services of certain changes to key personnel within 28 days. We support that. We think it is a sensible measure in relation to the act, and so we support this provision. We are going to be as bipartisan as best we can. It is pity that the coalition has not adopted a bipartisan approach on the dementia and severe behaviours supplement or the dementia and cognition supplement. One program is oversubscribed and the government has been incompetent in relation to it; the other is undersubscribed and the government is not rolling out support for people with dementia in their homes. So it is good that government can actually focus on this stuff—but how about them focusing on the stuff that counts in the aged care portfolio. 


We will see some amendments in relation to Indigenous affairs. This goes back to the days of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. When ATSIC were in operation, they used to make certain grants and loans to individuals and bodies and also to guarantee certain loans made to those individuals and bodies. When ATSIC were abolished, that power was passed to organisations like the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Indigenous Business Australia. What the proposal in this bill does is change the vesting of the statutory consent so that those bodies or, indeed, the Commonwealth, by the way, can waive the exercise of its statutory consent power by providing written notice to that organisation that its consent no longer be required. It is going to save a lot of money. To be honest, I think it is a pretty basic provision, and we will support it. 


I have some real concerns about the amendments to the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, because one of the first acts of the Northern Territory government was to get rid of the Banned Drinkers Register, which the Northern Territory Labor government had successfully implemented. It was making a difference in the Northern Territory in reducing the shocking rate of alcohol abuse, which is directly linked to assaults on women and children and other Indigenous people in the Territory. Indigenous women in this country are 31 times more likely to be hospitalised because of assault by a partner or from familial abuse than non-Indigenous women; in the Northern Territory, it is about 80 times. We tried to implement alcohol management in the Northern Territory, which was supposed to be supported by the coalition government when they were in opposition. However, they have gone slow on alcohol management plans. Also, they have not said a peep about the CLP government in the Northern Territory, whose policies have opened the door to more alcohol abuse and more assaults in the Northern Territory. 


A submission given to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs by the Northern Territory police—that is, a union submission—mentioned by the way in relation to this legislation before the chamber that there is a direct correlation between alcohol abuse, assaults, violence and criminality in the Northern Territory. What is the government doing here, in relation to this legislation? They are saying, 'We don't think an independent review is required under the legislation for the operation of Commonwealth and Northern Territory laws relating to alcohol in the Northern Territory.' That takes from the transparency and accountability that a review of how those policies are impacting in the Northern Territory would provide. This is what they are saying. As a member of the standing committee looking at alcohol management in Indigenous communities, I say that the trouble is that the Northern Territory government is not cooperating with this standing committee. It has stifled evidence again and again and has been stopping us from getting that evidence 


We have had non-cooperation from their colleagues and comrades in the Northern Territory and they are proposing that, because we have got an inquiry now and there is another formal review that the government is doing with the Northern Territory, that is good enough. I do not think it is good enough, to be honest with you. The other thing is simply getting rid of a provision that we think has some merit in relation to getting rid of the minister's power to request the Northern Territory government to appoint an assessor to conduct an assessment where they have not got the power to enforce the assessment in relation to licensing premises in certain circumstances. We think that is appropriate. The government has really over-egged itself in terms of this legislation before the chamber.

"Williams, Matt, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:22):  I find it quite amusing that the member for Blair came to us today and said that Labor have done a great job with deregulation and taking out so many regulations. If that was the case, why have we got so many industry associations and so many businesses that come and speak to me and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and say, 'We need to change this: we need to get rid of the compliance here and reduce the red tape there'? If they did their job properly, we would not be here today. 


What are we doing? We are making some really significant changes in so many areas and it is important to our country because the reduction of not only red tape but also compliance costs will make it easier for businesses and easier for government departments. I have been working with the parliamentary secretary, as many of us have over the year, to address these blockages and get some real results. So whether I speak to those associated with the health industry or the freight and logistics councils at a national level, they say to me, 'Yes, we're talking to Josh, yes, he's moving on this and making some real inroads.' That is why we are here today to announce some of these important changes.


In my state at a local level I have been talking to many industry associations such as resources and energy, the freight council, restaurant and catering, aged care, building and construction and local government. All of them say that there are areas of red tape and compliance that we need to do better with. That is what we have done.


On energy and resources, I want to talk about the environmental approvals. We have two of the key players here. The Minister for the Environment has done very well working with the South Australian Labor government. I do not often have reason to give credit to the South Australian Labor government—the member for Makin might be interested in this as well—but they have done well to sign a bilateral agreement to streamline environmental assessments as part of the Commonwealth government's one-stop shop reform. As we know, these new agreements create a single environmental assessment process and, in particular, they remove the duplication of federal, state and territory planning, which adds to time and costs for environmental approvals. Importantly, they save around $420 million a year. 


We have even got a former Labor minister, Martin Ferguson, who sees the wisdom in this policy who says it is a priority to implement. We hope all will get on board with this important initiative so that it can progress important projects such as job creation projects in my home state, including many in the mining sector, that require approvals at the environmental and planning stage. We have seen delays happen at Olympic Dam with BHP Billiton. This has been an issue in the past and we need to get our head around it and make some changes, as we have proposed, going forward. We had two-and-a-half years after the initial release for public consultation of the environmental approvals to when it was actually approved. This is the type of situation we need to prevent.


On key areas of importance for my state in terms of defence: the Defence Materiel Organisation will benefit from e-tendering project facilities to facilitate the electronic communication of tender requirements—$2.6 million in compliance costs saved. The Australian Standard for Defence Contracting templates is another important initiative that will reduce between five to 10 days of work for industry—another $1 million of compliance costs removed. I mentioned resources and energy before. The non-defence use of the Woomera prohibited area has been put through and it is an important initiative to simplify the process by which mining and resources businesses gain access to this area by introducing standard permit arrangements.


In terms of small business, as outlined in the 2014 autumn repeal day we have got a helpline to assist small business owners with advice on employee wages and workplace laws. I know from my wife's experience and others who talk to me in small business that these changes in laws and the information they need in some of these more technical areas are sometimes beyond them. So that is where this helpline is of great importance.


Finally, I just want to refer to a couple of other things affecting other sectors of our economy. One is the financial reporting for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, so that they submit the same financial reports on their annual information statements, and the other is ATO's new online tax service, myTax. Generally across government there are a whole lot of different initiatives in terms of online point of access for government services that are important changes. Local clubs and organisations who are limited by guarantee with less than $1 million in revenue no longer require an auditor. This was previously required through audited financial reports. Again, these are important changes. Today Deloitte released a report showing the impact of red tape—costing $27 billion to administer. 


We need to keep chipping away, keep making inroads and keep getting results. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Josh Frydenberg; the Prime Minister, who is driving this as well; and ministers, like the environment minister who is here, are doing a great job of getting results and helping businesses and government organisations for a better society.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:28):  What a lot of fuss and feet-stamping and stomping around the place! They are like kids who have just learned how to play in a new playground. They have just been given a new playground in the last 12 months and here the Liberals are in government, stomping around going, 'Look at me, look at me, look at all the great things we are doing.' The only problem is, they are just not doing anything that great. In fact, they are just doing the ordinary, mundane, everyday work that parliaments do and have done since time immemorial. Parliaments do this every single day. 


In fact, when Labor was in government we got rid of some 16,734 pieces of regulation. We did not make a song and dance about because there was no need—it is the ordinary work of government. That is what government does. It is meant to introduce new and improved regulations to make people's lives better and allow small business people to enjoy better protections and have more efficient systems of government and taxation and a whole range of things. At the same time, it should take away regulations that are redundant, superfluous, outdated and just do not do anything. To take away hyphens, commas, full stops, dot points and misspellings within acts is fine—all of that Labor supports. In fact, we support the bills that are before us, because there is nothing extraordinary or even ordinary in here; it is less than ordinary.


The three bills we are discussing today are the government's so-called repeal day legislation. There should be a repeal day every single day. Why leave it to just one day? Why should the parliament stop its ordinary work to have this special day where the government says: 'Look at us. Please give us a medal for doing our work'? It is the equivalent of ordinary workers who go to work every day and saying, 'On Monday I want a medal for going to work.' That is what the minister wants. He wants a medal for doing his job. Most people are happy to have the job and do the job. They may get accolades later but not before they have done it. The minister has not even done it yet and he wants the accolades and the medal today.


The country is stopping on the repeal day. This is so important for the government. On top of wanting a medal for it they want to have their own special day. This is the Liberal Party's special day. They go: 'Look at us. We want a special day so we can repeal the sort of stuff that was around in 1910, 1920 and 1930 that does not apply to anyone.' They have this whole hullabaloo over all this stuff. I actually feel sorry for the member for Kooyong because very soon—and it might even be today—he is going to run out of dot points, hyphens, misspellings and commas. He comes in here claiming he is going to fix the budget and the woes of the world comma by comma—'We will fix the economy comma by comma and dot point by dot point. We will take away the misspellings and redundant pieces of legislation.' 


All that would be a lot of fun. I would enjoy it and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would too. You would enjoy it. We could all come in here and have a national repeal day. I know let us have a national turn up to work day. Let us have a national we will talk in parliament day. Let us have a national the sun came up this morning day. Let us have the Liberal Party is really great day. Why don't we just do one of those? It will make them feel a lot better. 


Why don't the government actually do something real? This stuff here—and I will be very kind and fair here—is just rubbish. It is rubbish because it just does not do anything. There is a whole heap of fuss over absolutely nothing. The Labor Party are prepared to support this not on the basis that it is great or does anything outstanding or changes the world; just because it is something we would do every day of the week anyway. We will let it slide through. It is nothing special. We do not disagree with the government that we should take away commas that are in the wrong place, fix the misspellings and all the rest of it. It is a shame that the government try to pin badges on themselves and give themselves medals for doing this and say that somehow they are going to save all of us from something they have created in the first place.


The tragedy though—the really bad news—is that they are using this as a mask or a cloak because in other bills they are taking away consumer protection laws and regulations. Those good regulations are designed to protect ordinary mums and dads from losing not just hundreds of thousands of dollars but, for some, their whole life savings. I have seen it. I am tired of it. I am sure some members of the Liberal Party are tired of seeing ordinary working people lose their life savings to scammers and fraudsters. Labor worked very hard with the sector and the industry for many years to change the culture, lift the standards and lift education to make sure that in financial services we can protect people as best we can. It is sad but there are unfortunately people who do bad things and some of those bad things lead to people losing their life savings. What did we see this government do in the name of deregulation? It took away the consumer protection laws that we put in place that were designed to help protect them. 


What else did the government do with this so-called repeal of regulations? They took away from small business $4 billion worth of assistance. The member for Kooyong is still in the chamber. It is nice to see him listening to me. I am obviously saying things that are important enough for him to stay, so I thank him. The member for Kooyong should have a very close look at how much money the government—the so-called friends of small business—have taken away from small business. Small business used $4 billion worth of direct assistance. Small business in this country benefited to the tune of more than $4 billion in direct assistance that Labor put in place to help them through a range of things such as tough economic times and to reduce the regulatory burden and red tape to make life easier for them. 


On their first day on the job what did the so-called friends of small business, the Liberal Party, do? They smashed it. They took away more than $4 billion worth of direct assistance. There was the tax loss carry back, which meant that small business could improve their cash flow position and could invest in new equipment and people. There was the instant asset write-off, which under the Liberal Party was $1,000. When Labor got to government we gave small business $6,000 because we understood that this was a really important measure. Our policy at the last election was to take that to $10,000 because we know that small business will make best use of that assistance by investing it, and the only way they can get it is by investing in their business.


People can stick badges on themselves. I am getting the drift here too of what the government are actually about—and I thank the member for Kooyong. They want a medal for turning up to work every day. They love to drape the flag over themselves and talk about grandiose things. Now they want to have conversations about the Federation. Where have they been for the last 100 years? We have all been having conversations about the Federation. Is this Rip Van Winkle hour or something? Suddenly they have discovered there is a Federation and there may be some efficiency issues and to deal with those they have to work with the states. Well, hello? Hello, Liberal Party? Is there anyone inside? Is there anyone home? 


This is the stuff that governments do every single day of the week. You do not need a special day off for it, a day off from the ordinary work of the parliament, so we can hear the Minister for Small Business. I am listening for him, but there is dead silence. I cannot hear the Minister for Small Business. Where is the Minister for Small Business? Shouldn't he be banging the table and saying, 'We are the best friend of small business.' They love to badge themselves. I am really picking up the theme here. They cloak themselves in defence, national security and the Australian flag. Under that cloak you can do whatever you like and no-one can criticise you. Once you drape the flag over yourself, you are safe. Anything you do is in the name of national security so it is just okay. Where is the Minister for Small Business, who drapes the Australian flag over himself and says he is the best friend of small business? Where is he? I thank those in the gallery. I hope I gave you a little bit of good news and some entertainment.


When the Minister for Small Business remains silent on key issues within his portfolio that directly impact on small business negatively he is being derelict. It is derelict of his duty, derelict of his position and a snub to small business. Small-business people are hard-working people. I hear him, whether he is at the dispatch box or talking to some group, talk about the love that he has for small business. I would say to him: show some, stand up for small business and give them back some of the things that Labor had already put in place that the minister and the Liberal government have taken away. Do not just keep professing your love for small business; demonstrate it, show that love and give them something back because you took it away.


On his first day on the job, the Minister for Small Business's duty was to take an axe and wield it across small business, basically defund assistance programs and then claim credit for all the things we put in place—online reporting, streamlining of the Superannuation Clearing House, business name registrations. The list goes on and on of the hard work, the hard lifting and the stuff we got criticised for because the implementation is always complex and difficult. But, as a government, that is your job. That is what you are elected to do. So we went and did it. The Liberals then came to government, claimed credit for it and now they say 'look at us' while they drape themselves in a badge of repeal day.


It is the Liberal Party day-off day. The interesting thing about the Liberal Party day off today is they had a whole heap of their members on the list to speak on this stuff. They gagged their own members because their own members did not have anything to say. This is outrageous that we have this in the parliament.


Other people might say, and you would have heard this figure thrown around the place, there will be $2 billion worth of savings. Let us have a look for savings today. What are the savings contained in the omnibus repeal day bill as per the Liberal Party and as per what the bills say? Wait for it; it is not in the billions, it is not in the hundreds of millions and it is not even in the tens of millions—we getting down to really small numbers. Imagine the trillions of dollars that are in the national economy. Apparently the savings identified in this bill are a tidy $1.335 million. So all the hullabaloo, all the fuss, all the foot stamping around the place was for 1.1 $.335 million.


I welcome the one million bucks. This is good news, of course it is. But it just does not deserve the Liberal Party having a day off. Today is national Liberal Party day-off day and Tony Abbott wants two of these a year. He has already had a day-off day and now he wants to have another Liberal Party day-off day where they do not have to do much because the bills are here. They do not want speak on it because they have gagged their own speakers. So what are they going to do for the day? They can all just go and have a rest. There will be no divisions on this stuff because Labor is supporting it.


It is the Liberal Party have a day off day. Everybody else has to go to work. Everybody else does not get a medal for turning up on Wednesday to work, except the Liberal Party. They want a day off and they want a medal too. They want a medal for not turning up for work. This is just unbelievable.


Deregulation should be about deregulation. What are we actually looking at? What is in these bills? There are no deregulatory savings attached to the bills. So, minus claimed savings that are so small they are effectively, in budgeting terms, zero, have a look at what this represents in the claimed overall figure. The claimed overall figure they are going to save is $2 billion—there are a lot of zeros attached to that one. But according to the bill today—national Liberal Party day off repeal day—it will be 0.1 per cent. Where is the rest of it—you would have to start asking the question.


Apparently we are going to have two more of these repeal days. On the basis of just two so far, if we want to work down sliding scale, if it starts up here then it hits the floor on day 2. What does day 3 look like? When we get to No. 3 it is going to be the interesting bit. When they run out of commas, dot points, hyphenations and other bits of redundant legislation, what is next? I do not know. Maybe the next Liberal Party speaker can enlighten us on what they are going to get rid of next.


I know what they are doing though. They are slashing funding to small business, slashing funding to universities, increasing university fees to $100,000 and introducing a new GP tax. They said there would be no new taxes and no increased taxes yet what we are seeing are not only new taxes but also increased taxes. And then they claim that increasing the indexation is not an increase. Well, if it is not an increase then why did the Treasurer come in yesterday and say, 'Sure it is going to cost you more but it is only a little bit.' So, yes, it is going to hurt you but it is only going to hurt you a little. I get the nuance. Some in the Liberal Party say it is not an increase; it is actually a decrease. Others say it is going to hurt a little bit. Whether it hurts a little bit or a lot, it is still a broken promise. A broken promise is a broken promise.


The Prime Minister, when in opposition, came in again wrapping himself in the Australian flag, cloaking himself in national security and carrying on about getting rid of red tape. It is going to get rid of so much red tape you get the impression there is going to be none left. They are talking about compliance, defence and all the rest of it. The Liberal Party's trajectory and view on this is: let's get rid of red tape. The impression is that it is going to get down to zero. There will be no red tape, no compliance, no need to adhere to any rules, no regulations. I am with you, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, it would probably be taking it too far, wouldn't it? I agree 100 per cent. If it cannot be down to zero compliance, there must be some compliance. Why do we have regulations and laws? Why do we have compliance? Because it is actually good for people to have laws on the road to protect them and keep them safe, laws for small business to protect them and keep them safe from predators and big business, and a whole range of other really good things. Today is a farce. It is the national Liberal Party day-off day. (Time expired)

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (11:43):  I am very pleased to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring) Bill 2014. The measures in this bill will have a significant impact on reducing red tape across a range of portfolio areas. In the time available to me, I would like to make three points: firstly, unnecessary red tape is a serious problem facing our nation and our economy; secondly, the Abbott government is determined to reduce red tape; and, thirdly, in the communications sector—for which I have some portfolio responsibility as parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Communications—the minister and I have a strong focus on reducing red tape.


Let's start with the general proposition that red tape is a serious problem in our economy. It is clear that the prevalence of red tape has a negative impact on productivity. If you compare how Australia performs against other nations in the world, in 2014 we ranked 124th out of 148 countries for the burden of government regulation in the World Competitiveness Index. The cost of doing business in Australia relative to other nations is too high—simply too high. The Productivity Commission, for example, estimates that regulatory compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP—that is a staggering number.


And I would like to acknowledge here the outstanding work done while the coalition was in opposition by our red-tape reduction task force, chaired by Senator Arthur Sinodinos, with deputy chairs Kelly O'Dwyer, the member for Higgins, and Senator David Bushby. In particular, I would like to quote from something that Senator Sinodinos said in a speech in 2012:


Unnecessary red tape is a contributing factor to Australia's productivity challenge. The Productivity Commission estimates that reducing red tape will boost national GDP by $12 billion a year. Across industry, it's believed red tape accounts on average for four per cent of business costs.


The second reason why red tape is a serious problem is its tendency to continue to grow. If government does not take decisive action the unfortunate reality is that red tape tends to be ever expanding. Reporting obligations which are in place and which have been put there for all the best reasons tend to grow and grow and grow. The great virtue of the promise that this government made—or that the coalition made when in opposition and that we are implementing now that we are in government—to have two repeal days a year is that you have a systematic and continuing focus on the growth of regulation and opportunities to remove regulation—regulation that has outlived its usefulness or regulation, the cost of which exceeds the benefit.


The need for this action in relation to regulation and in relation to red tape is only increased because we have the misfortune of succeeding a government in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government which showed an extraordinary enthusiasm for adding regulatory burden to the Australian economy. The Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government—added over 21,000 new regulations and repealed 105, notwithstanding the promise made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, in 2007 that his government would have a 'one regulation in, one regulation out' policy. That was a promise that was never honoured.


And there is plenty of evidence of the pressure that this was imposing on participants in the economy. Let me refer you, for example, to the October 2012 National Red Tape Survey conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This was a survey of 870 businesses across all states and territories, which found that 73 per cent of businesses believed that the overall regulatory compliance burden had increased in the previous two years and that 60 per cent of businesses spent more than $5,000 per annum directly on costs related to regulatory requirements. And there is a long and depressing list of regulatory burdens that were in place at the time that the previous government had completed its handiwork—for example, the national child care law of 180 pages plus an additional 345 pages of regulations and 1,149 pages of guidelines. There was the reality that universities typically have regulatory compliance departments with 15, 20 or more staff dedicated to ensuring compliance with over 100 separate state and federal acts. In Indigenous service delivery, as at the time that the previous government left office, there were more than 200 Indigenous related programs administered by 17 Commonwealth agencies. Each program had its own application form and processes. And there is the example from the resources sector of one particular project which required 4,000 meetings before approval was granted and on which 12,000 state and 300 Commonwealth conditions were ultimately placed.


So under the previous government we had a very enthusiastic set of regulators who added substantial new regulatory burdens on a continuing basis every day they turned up for work. The previous speaker, the member for Oxley, spoke about turning up for work. There is no doubt that the previous government saw its role as being to increase regulation. Indeed, the previous Manager of Government Business, the member for Grayndler, used to enjoy telling the House how many pieces of legislation had been passed, because the only metric that he seemed to think was important was how many new laws and how much additional regulatory burden had come into force. On this side of the House we take a different perspective. We want to carefully look at the laws and regulations that are in place and ask, 'Are they still fit for purpose? Are they still delivering benefits which exceed their costs?'


That brings me to the second proposition that I want to put today: the determination of the Abbott government to reduce red tape; to have a process which acts as a corrective to the institutional factors which drive red tape to increase. The approach that we have taken has been warmly welcomed by many sectors of the community. But I want to quote particularly somebody from the non-profit sector—the community sector. Tony Nicholson, the executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence said, 'We warmly welcome the government's red-tape reduction agenda. Streamlining our reporting and compliance requirements makes a real difference as it frees up resources to be directed towards helping disadvantaged young families.'


I think that is a very powerful reminder, in the context of that particular organisation's mission, that time and resources which are allocated to meeting compliance requirements and reporting requirements are time and resources which are diverted from the core mission of any organisation which is subject to regulation. That is something those on the opposite side are very happy to ignore but it is something that those on this side of the parliament are acutely conscious of.


That is one reason why in coming to government we have set a very aggressive target in terms of the dollar value of the savings we want to deliver in reduction in compliance costs. Pleasingly, we are at a point where we have reached a net reduction of over $2 billion in compliance costs so far. The bill before the House today continues this work by removing almost 1,000 pieces and some 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation. And it builds on the work of the first repeal day in March of this year, when over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation and over $700 million of compliance costs were removed.


Thirdly, I would like to turn to some of the specific initiatives in the communications sector, where we are taking very seriously the importance of working to identify items of regulation which have served their purpose and are no longer required and where there is a capacity to remove that regulation and deliver benefit to industry participants and to consumers. That is of particular importance when you have a sector like the communications sector which is very heavily regulated and which is changing very quickly. As the technology is evolving at a rapid rate there are multiple instances of regulatory provisions which are no longer fit for purpose. They simply deal with, for example, industry practices or technologies which are no longer used. There is good potential to identify deregulatory initiatives in the communications sector and that has been the focus of the Minister for Communications and myself as his parliamentary secretary.


I want to highlight one set of measures in the legislation before the House this morning which is of importance in this general deregulatory thrust in the communications portfolio. Throughout the legislation in the portfolio there are extensive and prescriptive requirements in relation to consultation. For example, section 87A(9) of the Broadcasting Services Act requires the Australian Communications and Media Authority to seek public comment before imposing, varying or revoking conditions of a community TV license. Section 126 of the Broadcasting Services Act requires the Australian Communications and Media Authority to seek public comment before determining, varying or revoking a program standard under part 9 of the act. There are similar provisions in the Interactive Gambling Act, the Radiocommunications Act and the Telecommunications Act—all of them quite prescriptive and detailed. But this is the point: at the same time there is a general regime applicable to all regulators, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority and other agencies within the communications portfolio. Section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act requires that a rule maker, subject to limited exceptions must be satisfied that appropriate and reasonably practicable consultation has been undertaken prior to making a legislative instrument. That is a good principle. Of course, there ought to be reasonable and appropriate consultation before a legislative instrument is made. But when that principle is in place and has the force of law and applies as a general principle across the activities of all regulators and all rule makers, it really does cause you to ask the question: why do we additionally have a series of specific provisions which do exactly the same thing? One of the changes contained in the bills before the House this morning is to remove a series of provisions in the communications portfolio pieces of legislation which set out specific consultation requirements on the basis that the general requirement to consult, in section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act, will remain in place. 


I want to emphasise that there is not going to be any variance of the general principle of the importance of consultation, but that duplication will be removed and potentially there will be more flexibility in the mode of consultation, provided it meets that overriding test of being appropriate and reasonably practicable. 


The measures in the bills with regard to the communications portfolio are important ones and they complement other measures that we are taking as part of this second repeal day. For example, we are moving to a one-time sign-up system for the Do Not Call Register. The importance of this is that there are some nine million telephone numbers on the Do Not Call Register and it would hitherto have been a requirement, had we not made this change, that all of those people who are on the register would have been required to renew their registration, because there was a time limit on the previous status of having your number on the register. We have removed that requirement and that reflects the fact that millions of people have exercised a choice; they have made a conscious choice and we have removed the requirement for them to have to reregister. That is going to save a lot of time and money. 


Another reform which reduces red tape in the communications portfolio is a relaxation of the requirements applying to so-called battery backup for the National Broadband Network. Under the previous government's approach, consumers were required to have a battery backup system installed, regardless of their desire or need to have one. It was decreed by the then minister, Senator Conroy. He knew best and all consumers needed to have a battery backup system. Of course, many consumers may not want or need one. Many have indicated that they would be happy to rely upon their mobile phone connection for voice services in the event of a power failure. Indeed, the statistics show that only 75 per cent of Australian adults had a fixed line in the home as at December 2013. In other words, a quarter of Australians today have made an active choice to rely on their mobile phones for voice services—including, of course, in an emergency. Our approach is very different to the centralised Conrovian compulsion which characterised the previous government. I am pleased to say that on the question of battery backup, the fresh daylight of choice and freedom is rising and banishing the grim and leaden darkness of Conrovia. We are enabling informed choices on battery backup installations, leading to an annual saving estimated at over $20 million in compliance costs.


The coalition government is seizing the opportunity to reduce the regulatory cost of business across many sectors, including the communications sector. Let's remember why we are doing it: as a means to stimulate business activity, economic growth and jobs.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:58):  I rise today to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills. Obviously that word 'omnibus' is not used in everyday language so I thought I had better do a bit of research. I notice the member for Flinders is here so I went to his favourite research tool, Wikipedia, and also the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary just to calibrate. The definition of 'omnibus' is given as a volume containing several novels. I do not think that is what we are talking about here. If we combined a couple of novels such as when my third novel comes out and if we were to put all three together, that might be an omnibus. We are not talking about that. The other meaning for omnibus is an old word for a bus. Certainly all lawyers would have heard of the expression 'the man on the Clapham omnibus'. I will read from Wikipedia which says:


… a hypothetical reasonable person, used by the courts in English law where it is necessary to decide whether a party has acted as a reasonable person would—for example, in a civil action for negligence. The man on the Clapham omnibus is a reasonably educated and intelligent but nondescript person, against whom the defendant's conduct can be measured.


In Australia the Clapham omnibus equivalent expression would be, 'the man on the Bondi tram', or 'the man on the Bourke Street tram'. I did not realise that Bondi had a tram, but you get the expression of what an omnibus would be.


Certainly the man on the Clapham omnibus would say of this piece of legislation that has been dragged into this chamber today: 'Who are you trying to kid that this is some big celebratory day, this repeal day, when this is just the everyday work of government.' This is what governments do. When Labor was in government we repealed 16,794 acts and regulations during our time in office, but we did not put out a press release saying it. We did not make speeches, we did not walk the corridors saying, 'Where's my medal for turning up for work?' We did not walk around saying, 'This is fantastic. We are the best government ever.' I see that the member for Gippsland is here, so he would know about this: I think you do actually get a medal in the military for turning up for work, but that is after three years, which is my understanding. The member might be able to inform me on that. I do not think they give out medals just for turning up for one year and just for actually doing your job. This is ridiculous.


We have had press releases saying that this is the best thing since sliced bread. Really, this is just the Liberal Party politicians day off, as described by the member for Oxley. This is not worthy of a press release and certainly is not worthy of members. I heard the member for Kooyong say on Sky this morning that this was spring cleaning. If his job was spring cleaning and he did this, where he said that the three bills are part of the $2 billion delivery of savings, well, the claimed deregulatory savings are $1,855,000 or just 0.1 per cent of the figure claimed by the government. The member for Kooyong said that this is his spring-cleaning effort. If he were a cleaner, he would be sacked. He would not even be performance managed, he  would be thrown out of the house and told, 'This is not cleaning'. For him to claim that this is a significant thing is ridiculous. Obviously deregulation, as every sensible politician knows, is the everyday work of government. We can see it, because we are actually debating this piece of legislation, the everyday work of government, in the House rather than in the Federation Chamber. This exposes the facade and exposes the paucity of a legislative agenda of those opposite.


It is great that we see it through the prism of the death of Gough Whitlam, that great reformer. Sure, he had a few years in opposition to craft his agenda. When he came into office, he quickly, within 14 days, had done so much. He had upgraded the Office of Aboriginal Affairs to ministerial level. I say that in the presence of the member for Lingiari. Within 30 days of gaining office the Whitlam government had ended conscription—that birthday ballot—and brought our troops home from Vietnam, and introduced many other significant things that changed society. I will not go back over them because the eulogies and other speeches have detailed them. But that is the prism through which we look at this repeal day, this omnibus repeal day, or more accurately called 'the Liberal day-off day'.


The reality is the government do not have a good, strong, legislative agenda. You would think that after four years in opposition under the Prime Minister's leadership, under the member for Warringah's leadership, they would have mapped out a bit of a plan and had an agenda. They kept saying, 'We're going to be the experienced government, because we'll have experienced Howard government ministers.' Ironically they turned out to be complete duds. It is the new people coming through, the younger people elected after the Howard government, that are actually seen to have a bit of skill and ability. These other people have become a joke almost.


This legislation, claimed by the government to be this magnificent attempt to deregulate and reduce taxes, is really what governments do. Every government does it. The bill before the House has been spun by the government as part of a promise to deregulate $2.3 billion, but they should not be walking the corridors saying, 'Where's my medal?' and lining up at the whip's office when all they have done is the work of every government. It is actually articulating the work of the public servants who do all this sorting out of redundant materials and reviews that have occurred and the like, crossing out commas, changing the old word for 'email' to the new word for 'email'. That is not something that you should be celebrating as a government, seriously. After all those years, while the member for Warringah has been leader, you would think he would have a stronger agenda.


Obviously the government has been a disappointment in so many ways, not only in this legislation, but in the commitment as to what would happen before the election and what happened after the election as there is a great yawning chasm. We have heard it all—there would be no cuts to pensions, no surprises, no cuts to the ABC, no cuts to SBS, no rise in the GST. I think there was a promise about no petrol tax. I am sure the Nationals are still fuming over the way they were tricked by the member for Mayo into bringing a tax onto the bush, because that is really what this will be. We are all paying more at the petrol bowser and that is going to be a tax on the bush. I am sure the National Party are still furious about the way they were tricked.


When we were in government, like all sensible governments, we took a sensible, methodical approach to reducing red tape. What we see here today is smoke and mirrors, and not anywhere near the saving that had been promised by those out in the corridors. They were desperate for something to talk about in their electorates, desperate to be able to say, 'This is something good that we have done.' If  you look at the front of their electorate offices, there are tumbleweeds rolling past waiting for the MPs to come out. They are in hiding and they are scared of this budget. Has there ever been more of a stinking carcass of a budget foisted on the Australian people? I do not think so.


The only highlight in the retail of this budget was when the Treasurer was overseas. That was the only time when there was some time for the Australian people to understand it. But, unfortunately for the coalition government, the Treasurer is back. He has already flagged that there might even be further cuts when the budget is reviewed in December.


Before the election, the now Prime Minister and now Treasurer fabricated a crisis around the budget. But everyone knows, whilst there are some challenges coming, the budget was actually in a strong position. Obviously there have been some increases in spending since the coalition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—took government, but the fault for that lies at their door. They misled voters time and time again when they talked about spending on welfare and even something as simple as building submarines in the great state of South Australia. There was a simple commitment from the then shadow defence minister, who said, 'We will build submarines in South Australia.' There was not any spin or weasel words; David Johnston is a straight-shooting guy. I think he should honour that commitment.


The budget has lots of challenges, but I will return to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) legislation before the chamber—or, as I call it, the 'Liberal Party politicians' day off' legislation. I listened to the few speeches that have been given on this. I see there is a very, very long speaking list. I would have thought those opposite would have been lining up to celebrate this, but perhaps they have been gagged. I notice that they can only speak for five minutes or so each. I look forward to the great contributions celebrating this 'turning up for work' legislation.


I note in this context that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was one of the so-called bits of red tape that the government sought to get rid of. The earlier farcical repeal day wanted to get rid of this critical oversight office. They called it red tape. They sought to repeal the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, an organisation dedicated to reviewing Australia's counter-terrorism and national security legislation. It is an office that does great work. They say 'red tape'; we say 'checks and balances'. It is appropriate that government have some people monitoring what goes on in the area of particularly security legislation where so often we are compromising freedoms, liberty and individual choices. It is balanced with safety; I understand that. It is not done willy-nilly. It is done for a reason. But we also need checks and balances. We have seen, as the Snowdon documents revelations have shown, that government is not necessarily going to self-regulate well. Sometimes we need that independent oversight.


I note that we have had six or seven months without that office being filled in an environment where we are bringing in lots of important legislation that people have a lot of concerns about. I have been receiving lots of emails. The next wave of legislation, particularly dealing with metadata, has a lot of people in my electorate concerned. It is important that we have that Independent National Security Legislation Monitor role filled. I would urge the Attorney-General to do his job and fill that role. That position has been vacant since April and, in a time of great change, this is not acceptable. It is a hard role to fill, but I am sure that an appropriately credentialled and experienced monitor should be able to be found shortly and put in place.


By insisting on dramatically shortened sunset periods on statutory reviews both by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and by the committee, we improved the legislation that will come before this chamber in the near future.


Obviously red tape can be synonymous with checks and balances. Good government gets rid of unnecessary red tape. That is what good governments do. But, please, do not come in here, beating your chests, saying, 'We turned up for work.' It is ridiculous turning up and asking, 'Where is my medal for getting rid of some legislation?' As I said, when Labor were in office for six years, we repealed 16,794 acts and regulations. Most of that sort of work took place up in the Federation Chamber. I know I spoke on some of those bits of legislation. They were incredibly tedious and incredibly boring. That is the work of government. That is what government should continue to do.


But for the Liberal and National parties to say, 'This is the best thing since sliced bread,' just shows that they have no vision. This fortnight we have talked about what leaders with vision can achieve for this nation, even flawed leaders, as we have acknowledged of the late Mr Whitlam. We need the nation's leaders to have courage, not to be looking in the footlights and trying to spin cutting red tape as a great thing.


At the very same time we have the Prime Minister walking around the country saying, 'We need to have a discussion about Federation,' he needs to show a little bit of leadership in this chamber and in his party room. The reality is that this government does not have a serious vision. They have been disgraceful when it comes to acting on climate change. They successfully won on that at the election, but now we have been betrayed by the lack of action in the Direct Action policy, which seems to have evaporated. Even when it comes in, it will be neither direct nor have any action.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:13):  This bill is about good governance. As times change, many issues of governance change with those times. Rules and regulations become obsolete, and the coalition government is taking steps to ensure business and the Australian people are not weighed down with needless imposition by government into their lives. Not only that but rescinding these unnecessary measures saves money for the government and business. This means the coalition government can once again proceed to pull Australia out of the deficit disaster and financial mire in which we were left well and truly bogged by Labor and ensure business has more time and more money with which to employ Australians.


Interestingly, I had the pleasure to be on Mornings with Steve Austin on 612 ABC Brisbane last week with the member for Oxley. He commented, as did the member for Moreton just now, that these repeal bills were nothing special—that repealing unnecessary legislation was just a part of governing. He also said that while in power Labor had repealed thousands of pieces of redundant legislation but had done so without fanfare. The lack of fanfare could have been because, at the end of the day, there was a net increase—21,000 extra pieces of legislation—under Labor. 


The member for Moreton called repealing redundant legislation 'a politician's day off' and said that they had done everything without fanfare. In fact, however, then Prime Minister Rudd had a red-tape website. Under his smiling face, you could apply to get a fact sheet about red tape. So perhaps there was not as little fanfare as the member for Moreton recalls. The claim that they quietly cut red tape with a lack of fanfare is hard to believe—because the previous Rudd, Gillard and Rudd governments would turn up to the opening of an envelope if it got them media coverage. They even organised media for events that never occurred, such as when they published glossy brochures announcing they had delivered a surplus, which we know they never did. Lastly and most significantly, these repeal days actually save money—and we know that those opposite know nothing about saving money.


If what the member for Oxley said were true, then why is it necessary for this government to abolish the Fishing Industry Policy Council? Formed in 1991 by the last true Labor leader, Bob Hawke, it has met precisely zero times since its creation 23 years ago. Why is it necessary for us, the coalition, to repeal the Papua and New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1970 when the loan it refers to was finalised and paid back 20 years ago when Keating was Prime Minister? Perhaps, though, we should leave that act in place as a reminder to those opposite that loans do need to be repaid. 


If, as the member for Oxley—if no-one else—claims, Labor are so good at cleaning up, why are Australians of all ages, from those born today to those passing today, indebted to the tune of $15,000 each to the former Labor-Greens alliance government? A child born right now, this very minute I am speaking, is in debt because of the reckless inability of Labor and their Greens henchmen to stop burning a hole in the national credit card. We have heard a lot in this place, since the passing of Gough Whitlam, about legacy. That debt is the legacy of the last Labor rotation behind the wheel—the car crashed sideways into a tree because too many people were trying to drive and our economy was whisked away from the scene of the crime to be placed on life support. 


Those opposite drone on endlessly about rising costs, about students maybe having to pay extra for their education. That would not even be an issue if mum, dad and their two children did not have a $60,000 millstone around their necks courtesy of 'the best Treasurer in the world'. Perhaps we need an omnibus edition of a new bill, one that garnishees the member for Lilley's parliamentary salary to pay the Australian taxpayer back for his hubris. I would dub the member for Lilley the Icarus of economics—except that Icarus at least made it off the ground.


The coalition government has realised more than $2 billion in savings in just two repeal days—more than double our savings target and enough money to build hospitals, to build schools, to give a pension increase or to help pay off a tiny fraction of the economic chasm left by those opposite. Frankly, listening to the other side of the chamber attempting to blame-shift is becoming as trite and transparent as the emperor's new clothes. The coalition government would prefer to spend money on those things that enhance the lives and experiences of Australians, yet we remain hobbled by a debt not of our making. 


Despite the economic shambles we inherited, the coalition is governing for all Australians, not just the vested interests of Labor and its union puppeteers. I urge those opposite to remove the puppeteer's arm from the back of their shirts and support this bill for the good of Australia—to free up business to spend more time on creating wealth and jobs and to save government a significant amount of money. I congratulate the member for Kooyong on this bill and for the significant savings it will make in time and money, savings which will in turn boost productivity. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:18):  I do not know why the member for Ryan is in here crowing about the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and its related bills. I was not going to respond to her comments, but since she made some insensitive car crash analogies, I think it is appropriate to remind her about the extra $5.1 million in compliance costs for business that this government has just added with its new petrol tax arrangements. These are the small businesses—the franchisees—for whom the coalition claim to be reducing red tape. They have now imposed extra red tape on every service station in my electorate. My electorate is located in Western Sydney where, contrary to the Treasurer's understanding, we rely on cars—all of us. In some suburbs where public transport is at a premium or nonexistent, there are households with two cars in the double garage and two more on the driveway. If I were the member for Ryan, I would not come in here and crow about this bill when her government has today added to the compliance costs of hundreds of small businesses and franchisees, including those in her own electorate.


I am very pleased to continue my tradition of appearances in debates on statute stocktakes and other spent legislation repeal instruments. Back in the day, there would only ever be one or two speakers on these bills. How delightful to see that we have so many people listed to speak on these bills today. Because I am a former lawyer with a deep interest in statutory interpretation and administrative law principles, I always try to make these debates interesting and have provided some wide-ranging comments in the past. Members might like to cast their minds back to, for example, the debate on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012, in which I recalled an Irish stocktake where they repealed thousands of pieces of legislation. Their review identified a staggering 63,000 statutes as spent legislation or statutes that should be repealed. I discussed the development of Hong Kong competition law. My gem was 'why commas matter'. There was a very interesting case from 2006, Rogers Communications v Bell Alliant, where a comma made the difference in a contract dispute worth a large amount of money. I had the opportunity to comment on High Court appointments. To my great delight, on one occasion the now Minister for Communications commented that 'such bills do not elicit great oratory' but that my contribution had been an exception. You take compliments where you can get them!


Speaking of great oratory, just to be instructive about what we are dealing with here today I want to quote not myself but someone else who has spoken on similar bills that have come before the House previously:


This stocktake bill, being the seventh since 1934, forms part of an ongoing process to clean up the statute book by repealing legislation that is simply redundant. That is all it does: repeal 84 old annual appropriations acts, as has been done for appropriation acts from 1901 to 1999 … the current stocktake bill is not a controversial bill by any stretch of the imagination; it is simply housekeeping …


While this bill is worthwhile and we support the nature of the bill and the removal of those acts from the statute law, again this is tidying up and housekeeping. This bill does not make any changes with regard to the easing of regulatory burden on business as suggested in explanatory memorandum. It can hardly be described as a feature of a meaningful deregulation agenda to remove some appropriations acts that applied over three years some 20 years ago. Things from 20 years ago are some of the things we are tidying up.


They are very true words—it was a great speech and I have taken the opportunity to read it. It was made by the member for Wright on 29 May 2013. We can apply the words of the member for Wright here today, and I thank him for bringing these thoughts to my attention on a previous occasion. He is spot on when it comes to what these housekeeping bills actually are.


I would like to focus on some of the specific elements of schedule 2 of the legislation, dealing with the communications sphere—specifically the Broadcasting Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act. I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications talk about some of these provisions and I too would like to pick up on some of them. Part 2 of the amending legislation deals with repealing certain consultation requirements before certain legislative instruments are made—removing what are called amendments relating to consultation requirements in the Broadcasting Services Act, and also the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and the RadComms Act. I understand from the EM and from the bill itself that this is because the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 contains, in part 3, section 17, a requirement that rule makers should consult before making legislative instruments. There are related provisions dealing with circumstances where consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate and also consequences of the failure to consult. 


Whilst I understand the legislative intent is that we already have the Legislative Instruments Act which contains those provisions, and therefore there is no need for duplication in those specific communications related pieces of legislation, I want to question from a practitioner's point of view whether that is desirable. I am happy to stand corrected if this is indeed a precedent in other pieces of legislation that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the drafters have recommended, but I did have a cursory overview about whether such repeal is commonplace and I could not see anything to support that. As I said, I am happy to stand corrected. I would have thought that one of the golden rules of statutory interpretation was that you should be able to pick up a piece of legislation and read it on its own without having to go to other instruments or other pieces of legislation to deal with very particular aspects of that specific provision. I do not see, in this proposed amendment, that there is going to be, for example, a box with a note saying, 'For consultation requirements refer to the Legislative Instruments Act, part 3, section 17.' I would have thought that, in light of our emphasis on plain English drafting, that would have been something that was desirable. It is not too hard to read a piece of legislation—and you should always, of course, have the Acts Interpretation Act next to you—but if you have to have a third act next to you, just in case, I wonder whether that will affect the way the bill is interpreted in everyday legal practice and in everyday regulatory practice, not only by the industry but by practitioners themselves. I note the comments from the government that this is not a reduction in consultation requirements but I do query how it is to be read and, seriously, whether it would be desirable for there to be a reference to consultation provisions being in the Legislative Instruments Act. To give this a bit of strength from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, I did quote them in a contribution on 28 May last year:


The Office of Parliamentary Counsel states some of the drivers of complexity in legislation and give some common examples …


Those examples include:


a tendency to respond to events with legislative changes even when legislation is not necessary to address the issues … 


I do not know whether this was a specific item the industry said needed to be taken out, but the point I make is that this could end up being more complicated in practice for practitioners to deal with because all those provisions are removed from those three primary acts and now we simply have a reference—not even a reference, as far as I can see—to the Legislative Instruments Act.


The parliamentary secretary also mentioned changes to the Do Not Call Register which are part of the deregulation agenda. ACCAN's media release of today says that ACCAN welcomed indefinite registrations on the Do Not Call Register. I am sure that all my colleagues here are well aware that the issue of unsolicited telemarketing by any electronic means is by and large not welcome. OIAC research, that it appears from the release was commissioned by ACCAN, found that only two per cent of survey respondents indicated that they enjoyed receiving unsolicited marketing information. Of course they love hearing from us! 


On this point I draw the House's attention to a suggestion which I think has merit and I know has been considered elsewhere by the member for Bowman, which I noted in the press recently—and that is the notion of adding small businesses to the Do Not Call Register. My electorate office has a number which obviously used to belong to a small business, because just about every day we receive calls from the same marketing company. I can see that the member for Deakin shares my pain. I would have thought that this would be a sensible measure. I mention it quite seriously to suggest that, when we do look at this particular provision, is there a reason why we cannot consider having small businesses opt in to the register if they think that is going to be of benefit to them? We are talking about productivity when we talk about reducing regulatory burdens. As everyone here I think would know, one regulatory burden and something that affects productivity is if your staff are constantly being interrupted to do things that are not productive. 


Some of the substantive provisions in these amendments go to part 15 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which deals with special provisions for retransmission of programs. Part of the amendments deal with the fact—I know the member for Lingiari will be interested in this—that NITV, National Indigenous Television Ltd, is now part of the SBS family; it has been for a little while. I think the portfolio budget statement for Communications provides a very good summary:


As part of the SBS family, the National Indigenous Television service (NITV) is broadcast free-to-air with national coverage …


Isn't that a great thing, member for Lingiari?




Mr Snowdon:
  It is fantastic.




Ms ROWLAND:
  It continues:


… including through the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service. NITV is an important platform for the celebration of the unique languages and culture of Indigenous Australians, produced by Indigenous Australians, and now available to every Australian household. 


The reason I mention this is in the context of not only NITV but also the future of community television in this country. As the CTV sector recently found out, the minister has determined that they will be moved online—that is the platform for them. The reality is—and this is what the sector is saying as well—that there is an acceptance that that is where they need to go, but to be rushed into it without the amount of preparation and support they need is a very detrimental thing. That is not specifically why I raise this. 


One of the biggest gripes that the CTV sector has is this apparent obsession with ratings as the only indicia of the value of their content. As the sector pointed out, there are many networks with shows that have under 6,000 viewer ratings points. Unfortunately, some NITV programs regularly feature in those low ratings—things like SARL All Stars Carnival, Maori TV's Native Affairsand NITV News Week In Review. A lot of these end up rating lower than the threshold at which some in this place think should be the threshold of support. But no-one would be suggesting, would they, member for Lingiari, that that is the sole criterion by which you should judge the value of any programs?




Mr Snowdon:
  You would think not.




Ms ROWLAND:
  Indeed, you would think not. We need to be very careful when we rush in to repeal. Remember the last regulatory repeal day. On 19 March this year the parliamentary secretary came in and commended to the House repealing the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. We know how important that is. Subsequently, as Labor had called for, we had committee recommendations on this very issue, saying that, at a time when we need to make sure we have proper oversight of these laws for the benefit of our citizens, we need to ensure that the monitor remains. I put that out there just as a final warning of the dangers of rushing into these kinds of things.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (12:34):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills. In particular I want to start by congratulating the Prime Minister and his parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg, for the outstanding work they have done in pushing forward our second red-tape repeal day. 


We have already taken significant steps towards repealing red tape for Australian businesses and individuals with our first red-tape repeal day. We made a commitment prior to the election to hold regular repeal days, because we have always believed that by getting off the back of business we assist them in getting on with what they do best, and one of the things they do best is creating jobs in this economy. Removing outdated and unnecessary regulation is something that many parties in opposition propose. They promise to do it should they be elected. However, it is only this government which is getting on with the job of actually reducing the regulatory burden now that we are in government.


The Labor Party are a classic example of this. Before the election in 2007, under former Prime Minister Rudd, they committed to a policy of one-in one-out when it comes to regulation. The small business minister at the time, the Hon. Craig Emerson, even promised to take 'a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small businesses'. However, talk is cheap. We know that under the Labor Party in those six years, more than 21,000 new regulations were introduced. So much for the one-in one-out policy. So much for taking a big pair of scissors to red tape. It would be laughable if it were not so serious.


We stand in contrast to the false rhetoric of those opposite. We are not changing department names or making glib statements; we are actually doing what the former minister said: we are taking a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that strangles small business. The reason for this is that the coalition believes that reducing red tape is going to be one of the most important elements of driving economic growth. And we do not want economic growth for economic growth's sake. But improving the ability for our economy to grow will improve the lives of our citizens and create more jobs. It will hopefully mean people can fulfil their lives in the way they want.


Unfortunately, in 2014 Australia was ranked 124th out of 148 countries for the burden of government regulation in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index. The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation and associated compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP. Today, for the second time, we seek to repeal that lamentable legacy. This repeal day removes almost 1,000 pieces of regulation and more than 7,200 pages of legislation. This follows up from the work down in March, when the government removed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation, which delivered over $700 million worth of compliance cost benefits. Together with today's repeal day, this will lead to a total net deregulatory saving of over $2.1 billion, an important achievement for job creation in Australia.


Already, we have made big steps. We now require cabinet submissions proposing legislative changes go through a regulatory impact process, something the Labor Party in government abandoned. We have established designated deregulation units within ministers' departments and, where appropriate, linking the remuneration of senior members of the Public Service to their performance in reducing red and green tape. 


In addition to all those changes, and that is only a few, we are also seeking to eliminate the extensive duplication and regulatory overlap that exists between different layers of government, particularly between federal and state regulation. In my electorate of Deakin, I constantly hear the cry from businesses and individuals that they have to meet, in many cases, competing regulatory requirements at a state and federal level, and it is infuriating. It strangles innovation and entrepreneurship, and that is why this is so important. 


Another key way in which we will be removing red tape will be by streamlining and improving the regulatory obligations and reporting methods. There will be $88 million a year in compliance cost savings, including with respect to the Australian Taxation Office, Medicare and Centrelink. Something I have heard about constantly in the last few weeks is that five million Australians have created their myGov account. I have been getting extraordinary feedback on that.


I am going to end my contribution early to enable other speakers to speak on this omnibus repeal bill. Understandably, as a government, we are very keen to all have a say here, because this will be the future for driving economic growth in this country, not economic growth for its own sake but economic growth for the sake of the lives of our citizens and improving jobs. 


Now that Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg is in the chamber, I want to congratulate him again for driving this process. I have business men and women in Deakin who shake my hand and say, 'Please thank the parliamentary secretary for driving these changes.' I commend the bills to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (12:41):  Former Prime Minister John Howard has spoken about the issues that shaped him to get into politics and one of the chief ones was the impact of regulation on service stations. His parents, former Prime Minister Howard has written, felt that the Labor government maintained wartime petrol rationing for too long and they were frustrated by regulations that applied to local petrol stations from local councils. As John Howard once put it: 'What happened was my father had a garage near Dulwich Hill station and he got an edict from Marrickville council to remove the bowsers on the kerb. It accelerated a downward spiral for him and I guess it was something that helped to politicise me in the direction of profound sympathy for small business.'


One can only imagine what Mr Howard would make of a decision which sees the nation's 6,300 petrol stations hit with a compliance bill for $5.1 million for the privilege of collecting the Abbott government's new petrol tax. It is extraordinary that the so-called parties of Menzies has cast off so much of the values that Menzies stood for and is now rebuking the Howard legacy. What does the Liberal Party stand for any longer if it does not stand for the party of John Howard, if it is willing to spit in the eye of petrol station owners and slug them with new, unnecessary regulations? On the very day we are here talking about red tape, this is a government putting more red tape on to petrol station owners. You can just imagine John Howard shaking his head, 'First, they have undone the freeze in fuel indexation and then they are adding red tape to 6,300 small businesses.'


The government claims that the red tape measures are necessary and significant. And they are right, it is just that the necessary ones are trivial while the significant ones are unfair. Let me start with the trivia. Having crowed about the benefits of its first repeal day back in March, the government failed to tell the Australian people that that first red tape repeal day included 39 individual amendments changing the name 'electronic mail' to 'email'—difficult to see how that makes life easier for any Australian business—and hundreds of amendments adjusting spelling, grammar and punctuation. 


To have a day on which you remove spelling mistakes from the statute books is like saying we are going to have a 'national showing up for work and having a cup of tea day'. It is just the regular business of government to clean-up the statute books and it is exactly what Labor did during our time in office, without the preening and the crowing that has accompanied the exercise from the coalition.


The first red tape repeal day encompassed the repeal of such noted business obstacles as the Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1927, the Lighthouses Act 1949 and the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act 1969. The coalition crowed about the fact that it was removing a raft of amending acts, failing to tell Australians that an amending act ceases to take effect immediately after it has amended the principal act. 


As my Senate colleague Senator Ludwig has recently discovered, the government set up teams at a cost of millions of dollars through the Australian Public Service in order to add to its preening exercise. The Treasury team cost $2.1 million. The teams based in the industry and social security departments cost around $700,000 a year. All of that is so the government can have a biannual preening exercise about simply doing its job. When we were in office, Labor removed over 16,000 redundant acts, regulations and legislative instruments. We did not declare a 'war on bad punctuation'; we just figured that fixing typos is part of the work of good government.


Then there are the important reforms that the government is removing under the guise of red tape repeal. They attempt to gut Labor's future of financial advice consumer protection reforms, reforms that were backed by organisations such as Choice and National Seniors. These consumer protections were put in place in the wake of collapses such as Trio Capital and Storm Financial—and the minister at the table might chuckle, but these were crises that saw thousands of Australians lose their life savings and, in some cases, end up in debt, as a result of bad financial advice. That is why Labor put in those financial advice protections; not to impose additional red tape, but to ensure that older Australians are not scammed out of their life savings. 


The government too is trying to kill off the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission was set up to protect Australians from door-to-door scammers. Thankfully, there are relatively few such scammers, but those who exist are in fear of an organisation which allows householders to check up on whether a charity is legit. It allows someone to type in the details onto the acnc.gov.au website and quickly check whether the person at the door is a dodgy scammer or a legitimate charity.


We believe that transparency is appropriate in the sector and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission is delivering for charities. That is why four out of five charities support the charities commission, a figure which has remained unchanged in the year since the Abbott government has been in office. If the Abbott government's campaign against the charities commission had worked, you would think that charities might be less supportive. But actually this is the rare case of a regulator backed by its sector. What share of charities believe that charities regulation should return to the Australian Taxation Office? Just one in 20. Nineteen out of 20 Australian charities do not support the return of charities regulation to the tax office. 


So, where Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg might see red tape, we see measures that stop Aussies from being ripped off by dodgy financial advisers and unethical charity scammers. We believe that we need to have an appropriate level of regulation. What the coalition will not tell you about is the 690 new regulations they put in place since the last red tape repeal day. For a government that says it is declaring war on red tape, it certainly seems to be waving the white flag. 


Since the first red tape repeal day, some of the regulations that have been brought in include: the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation (Warlike Service) Determination 2014 (No. 4); the National Health (Botulinum Toxin Program) Special Arrangement Amendment Instrument 2014 (No. 2); the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Confidentiality) Determination No. 15 of 2014; the Australian Public Service Commissioner's Amendment (Notification of Decisions and Other Measures) Direction 2014; the Broadcasting Services (Licensee Audit Exemption) Instrument 2014; the Currency (Royal Australian Mint) Determination 2014 (No. 7); the Therapeutic Goods (Listing) Notice 2014 (No. 6); the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) (Warlike Service – Operation OKRA) Determination 2014; the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transfer of Industry Assets and Liabilities) Declaration 2014.


I could go on, but I have merely listed one-seventieth of the new regulations put onto the statute books by this government between their so-called regulation repeal day No. 1 and No. 2. A government that is declaring war on red tape is littering the statute books with new regulations. How hypocritical is that? The government claims to be getting rid of regulations but instead it is passing hundreds of them. Regulations are being passed at a rate of three or four a day since red tape repeal day No. 1 under this government; that is what they will not tell you on red tape repeal day No. 2. This is a stunt, pure and simple. 


The charities commission has received significant support. I spoke before about the support it has from the sector. And the charities commission is reducing the regulatory burden on Australian charities. I stood up with Andrew Barr in the ACT and Gail Gago in South Australia. Both represent sensible governments which recognise that the charities commission can reduce regulatory reporting duplication for Australian charities. 


In both those Labor jurisdictions we have governments keen to reduce the reporting burden on Australia's charities, by working with the charities commission. And yet governments in coalition-run states and territories have been unwilling to work with the charities commission. 


This government needs to stop declaring a war on an organisation overwhelmingly backed by charities. That is not just my view; Ernst & Young has noted in a report on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission:


A core component of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission's reporting framework and efforts around reducing red tape is the 'report once, use often' principle. This principle is consistent with recommendations issued by the Productivity Commission, the National Commission of Audit, the Australian National Audit Office, the Treasury and the Department of Finance.


Serious reform-minded organisations take the view, as charities do, that the charities commission is cutting red tape and that abolishing the charities commission would increase the paperwork burden on Australian charities.


The government has got it wrong. Minister Andrews's only argument for abolishing the commission has been debunked by this Ernst & Young report and it has also been debunked by independent submissions. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has said:


We understand the government has made a commitment to abolish the ACNC. While we do not agree with this approach, we would strongly encourage the government to maintain elements of the ACNC that were delivering improved outcomes for the sector.


It has noted the 'light touch' regulation that is embodied in the charities commission, the value of a charities register that provides valuable information for a range of stakeholders, the central reporting mechanism and the harmonisation across jurisdictions.


The Australian Institute of Company Directors supports keeping the charities commission. The Queensland Law Society, in a detailed submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, has discussed the flaws in the regulatory impact statement for the government's attempt to repeal the charities commission. It has described the regulatory impact statements for that repeal bill as being:


Less than rigorous, and not meeting the usually high standards and disciplines of the Commonwealth legislative process.


The Queensland Law Society have noted a claim in the regulatory impact statement that the ACNC repeal is said to give effect to a government election promise, but have said:


We can find no direct reference to such a promise in the Coalition's formal election platform 1 and it was not included as a policy commitment in the Coalition's election costings.


The Queensland Law Society further say that the regulatory impact statement states:


… 21,000 unincorporated charities are required to report to the ACNC where they previously were outside a regulatory framework. This appears not to take into account that these charities are already subject to federal regulation which is fragmented and uncoordinated.


And goes on to note that the critique of the charities commission for not becoming a reporting point 'fails to acknowledge the progress made in setting up a framework for streamlined reporting in the ACNC's first 15 months.'


They also note the speed with which the charities commission has managed to register charities—exceeding the 85 per cent benchmark within 28 days with a 95.6 per cent success rate. 


The charities commission is doing good work to reduce the reporting burden on Australian charities. Australians benefit from the charities commission and from financial advice protection. The removal of extraneous hyphens and commas should not be the subject of crowing by the government.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (12:56):  Cutting red tape matters. Overregulation hinders productivity, deters investment, stifles innovation and costs jobs. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and two related bills, knowing that this is an important day for Australians and Australian businesses. Today we erase 7,200 pages of regulations from the statute books. This is in addition to our first repeal day where we removed more than 10,000 pieces of legislation and over 50,000 pages of regulations. This year alone the government has announced more than 400 individual reduction measures resulting in exceeding our initial $1 billion compliance saving target and achieving savings of over $2 billion. This is a significant achievement.


By identifying and removing red tape which adds financial burden without delivering benefit we boost our nation's competitiveness to help create jobs and cut the costs of business. We are determined to ensure that interaction with government for individuals and businesses is less complex, less costly and more time efficient. Labor talked big on cutting red tape, with symbolic gestures such as adding 'deregulation' to the title of the Department of Finance. They promised a one-end one-out rule for regulation. History instead shows that, after six years, the former Labor government added 21,000 new regulations. In contrast, in just over 12 months, this government has not only exceeded our target in cutting red tape and compliance costs but also achieved savings of over $2 billion.


We have set about changing the regulation culture within government. This government is taking this task seriously. Our senior ministers have established advisory councils on regulation, and every federal department has created a deregulation unit to calculate the cost of complying with regulations administered by the department and its agencies. Further, regulatory impact statements are required for cabinet submissions, to ensure that the cost of regulation is weighed against its benefits. Deregulation will be a standing item on the COAG agenda, to enable federal and state governments to cut duplication and overregulation.


We are working to improve the quality of consultation between the government and those who will be affected by any new regulations. It is only fair that a robust discussion occurs when government proposes new regulations that adversely impact on how individuals go about their lives or their business. Furthermore, we will also ensure rigorous and mandatory post-implementation reviews to determine the effectiveness of new regulations. If it is determined that regulations no longer effectively meet their purpose repeal will be considered. For individuals and businesses dealing with government departments and agencies, this news is most welcome.


The cost of compliance is a major barrier to growth. The average Australian business deals with eight regulators in a given year. Businesses spend close to four per cent of their total annual expenditure on complying with regulatory requirements and spend approximately 19 hours a week on compliance related activities. This impacts businesses' capacity to grow and drive job creation.


In an electorates such as Dobell small-business operators are the engine room of our economy and they deserve support from government in order to grow. Many of the businesses I have spoken to in Dobell constantly tell me about the burden of compliance. An estimated 447,000 small businesses will benefit from a reduced tax compliance burden, with administrative changes to GST and pay as you go reporting. Businesses with no payable GST will no longer be required to lodge a business activity statement, and this represents compliance savings for small business in the vicinity of $76 million.


One of Dobell's largest growing industries is the aged-care sector. Repeal changes will mean aged-care providers will no longer be required to notify the Department of Social Services of staff changes unless it materially affects the provider's suitability to provide care. The Department of Social Services has estimated that this will lead to an annual saving of $1.16 million in compliance costs. Such measures are positively contributing to a stronger and more prosperous economy.


Our Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda is promoting lower costs and better skills. Central to this renewed focus is deregulation and reducing red tape, with the guiding principle that if a system, service or product is approved under the trusted international standard, then Australian regulators should not impose additional requirements without a demonstrable reason to do so. The Prime Minister recently advised the House of our success with his approach. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has advised Cochlear, the makers of the bionic ear, that its products are now eligible to use European Union certification. This decision streamline certification will enable Australian consumers to have access to the latest devices, sometimes up to a year earlier than previously anticipated.


Individuals are also benefiting from our deregulation agenda as we minimise and simplify interaction with government. The creation of MyGov has seen more than five million Australians establish accounts to access government services, including the ATO, Medicare, Centrelink, Child Support, Veterans' Affairs and the NDIS. This has seen an annual compliance cost saving of $88 million. MyTax, which is linked with MyGov, will save close to $160 million each year while assisting 1.4 million Australians by pre-populating tax returns.


This government is helping more Australians find and keep a job by reducing the time spent by job service agencies dealing with red tape. This will be achieved by removing the requirement for job service providers to collect extensive evidence about a job seeker who finds work, because this information is ready collected by the Department of Human Services. Similar changes will be extended to Australian Apprenticeship Support Network providers, who will no longer have to maintain over three million paper files. Furthermore, the Department of Employment estimate this will lead to an annual saving of $24.7 million in compliance costs.


For the households of Dobell and throughout Australia we are also introducing common-sense reforms, making dealing with government easier. We are changing the length of registration on the Do Not Call Register to an indefinite period, meeting more than 9.2 million individuals and families will no longer be required to reregister their phone and fax numbers.


Local clubs and organisations registered as a company limited by guarantee, with less than $1 million in revenue, will no longer require an auditor. Our deregulation and red tape reduction goals do not end with today's repeal day. There will be more to come in the future, because their remains so much more to be done. It is important that we continue to talk with individuals, families and businesses to identify where we can further reduce the compliance burden. As I have often said, government does not create jobs, business creates jobs. As such, it is important that the government provides a sufficient regulatory presence without restricting productivity and growth.


I commend the work of the parliamentary secretary, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, and congratulate him on his commitment on behalf of this government to our deregulation agenda. I commend this bill to the House.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (13:04):  I was not going to speak on this bill, because I find these red-tape repeal days or stunts of the government to be basically a sham. They are nothing but cheap tricks trying to distract the community. Quite often the bills that we have before us deal with minor things like fixing grammar and spelling, yet they claim that these changes are making massive savings to the budget. This particular red tape repeal charade only contains $1.8 million in savings of the total $2.33 billion that they are claiming. What a charade—to guillotine, to gag other debate on legislation to rush on a bill which is about correcting minor grammar, spelling and punctuation within existing bills and legislation.


So, why am I speaking? Because what has been revealed in these documents is the further extent of the ambush that this government has had in the last 24 hours in relation to increasing the petrol tax. It is an ambush on Australian motorists, in particular an ambush on regional families, because we all know that if you live in the regions you spend more on petrol because you have further to drive. In the government's own documents that we are debating today it is revealed that the impact of the petrol tax ambush is even wider, with every petrol station now being slugged an extra $800 a year in new compliance costs to collect tax for this government. I thought this bill was about reducing compliance and red tape, yet this government is whacking a further tax, slugging compliance costs, on every petrol station, including many of those in regional Victoria. According to its own documents this government will hit the nation's 6,300 petrol stations with a compliance cost of $5.1 million. They will pay for the privilege of collecting this government's increased petrol tax. There is little doubt that this increased compliance cost will be passed on to motorists when they fill up at the bowser—and by 'motorists' we mean mums and dads, we mean pensioners, we mean small businesses. We mean everybody that needs a car or truck that relies on regular petrol to get from A to B.


This Prime Minister is addicted to taxing Australians. There is just no other way to go about it. Quite often, as we are seeing, rather than debating it properly in this House and in the Senate, they are simply ambushing the Australian people. This new tax increase to the petrol stations is not the only problem that we are seeing with their whole approach to petrol. As I have said, the increase in the petrol tax will hit local motorists. The fuel excise will mean that central Victorians and regional Australians will pay more for their petrol.


And it comes from a government that also tries to claim that poor people do not drive cars or drive far. Let's leave for a moment that some of our poorest households struggle in their pay cycle to put money in the car to get from A to B when it gets to day 11 or day 12 in their pay cycle. Let's leave for a moment the fact that for many regional Australians the car is the only way that they can get from A to B. It is the only transport available, because we do not have public transport in large chunks of regional Australia. Let's also leave for a moment that this statement by the Treasurer is not only elitist but somewhat patronising. Poor people do not drive cars? Isn't it a problem if people cannot afford the very basics in life? Hasn't this government failed? Hasn't the Treasurer failed to support the most vulnerable people if they cannot put petrol in their car to get from A to B, particularly when it comes to regional Australia and regional MPs? They should be standing up and speaking against the changes to petrol. They should be speaking against the increases to the petrol tax—increases which are in this red tape repeal day hitting petrol stations—because that would just be a further increase to motorists. Petrol stations will simply pass that on.


How do we know that low-income households pay more for petrol than those on higher incomes? It comes down to percentage. We need to talk about the percentage of income that low-income households spend each year on the basics such as petrol.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Order! Member for Bendigo, whilst we have allowed a very broad-ranging debate in this House on this amendment, she might consider the amendment before the House.




Ms CHESTERS:
  Yes, thank you for pointing that out. My comments relate to page 5 of the government's October 2014 red-tape repeal documents, Table 1c: Summary of key regulatory costs reported or announced since September 2013, the line item which talks about the resuming of the indexation of the fuel excise to the consumer price index. So I am speaking to the documents which are being talked about in relation to these bills. I have just outlined the fuel excise to consumer price index increase, what it will cost petrol stations and also what it will cost Victorian motorists, particularly those on low incomes.


The fuel excise increase will in fact hit low-income earners the hardest. The percentage of their household income spent on petrol will increase due to the extra that they will have to pay. Lower income groups tend to live in the outer suburbs and regional areas because housing is more affordable. As a result, however, their transport costs will increase. This is kind of simple mathematics; if you live further out because it is cheaper, it is only natural to assume that you will have to pay more to get into town to get to work, to drop your children off at school or to get around. Infrastructure has not caught up with these areas yet. The public transport has not been built or the state or federal governments have no plan to build the public transport so that these households and families have the opportunity to have a viable public transport option. All they can do is rely on their car, and that is the problem when this government increases the excise on petrol. It hits those in the outer suburbs and the regional people disproportionately. It hits them the hardest because they do not have the opportunity to take public transport.


The public transport debate is something that we have seen this government turn a blind eye to. They are not interested in doing their bit to invest in public transport—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am really struggling with your presentation on this red-tape repeal bill as to where you are headed with this with regard to relevance to the bill. You might consider that in the rest of your address.




Ms CHESTERS:
  Thank you. I remind the Deputy Speaker that I am speaking in relation to the resumption of indexation of the fuel excise to the consumer price index, which is part of the government's own October 2014 red-tape repeal documents. These are the documents that the government is bringing before the House and contain their great charade around red-tape repeal. Perhaps the Speaker and members of the government do not like me talking about the fuel excise because of the impact that it will have on regional communities. If they have their own Facebook pages, they have probably exploded in outrage—like my page has in the last 24 hours—at the increase of the fuel excise and how that is going to impact on our families.


Fuel prices are high in regional Victoria, higher in regional Australia, which is—




Mrs Markus:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to relevance. This bill is talking about 256 regulations being repealed. If you could draw the member's attention to those regulations and her capacity to talk about those regulations that are being repealed today.




Ms Rishworth:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Bendigo has clearly indicated how she is speaking with relevance to the repeal day bill and associated documents. This has been a very wide-ranging debate and the member for Bendigo is speaking in order.




Mr Hawke:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to standing order 75, on relevance or tedious repetition. You have drawn the member's attention to her relevance to this bill on two occasions and she continues to go on about nothing at all. Standing order 75 prevents irrelevance or tedious repetition of the same point.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I do not think there is a point of order there. I call the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was listening to the points of order as they were raised. When these amendments were moved, the parliamentary secretary who introduced them referred to the full range of all issues relating to deregulation. Something in the order of 80 per cent of the speech given by the parliamentary secretary had nothing to do with the bills before the House. At no point—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business, what is your point of order?




Mr Burke:
  My point of order is on relevance and the breadth of this debate. That was established by the parliamentary secretary at the beginning of the debate. If members of the government want to change the rules midway through then those relevance rules which were not applied—with no points of order at all—to the parliamentary secretary's introduction will change the nature of this debate for the rest of today.




Ms CHESTERS:
  The bills I am referring to today are the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 and the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014. Comments made by previous speakers also outline clearly that these particular bills before us—and today's entire charade around red tape repeal day—does in fact relate to the resumption of indexation of the fuel excise in line with the consumer price index.


As I continue to repeat, the government has put the increase in the fuel excise back on the table. Yes, they are doing it in a sneaky way. They have put it into their red tape repeal documents; they have listed it here in their red tape repeal documents. They do not want to debate this issue. They do not want the Senate to have the opportunity to talk about increasing petrol tax because they know how much of a stinker it is in regional Victoria. It is an absolute stinker to be increasing petrol prices. It hits small business, it hits our farmers and it hits our families. That is what is before us today. It exposes how this government likes to hide behind its own red tape. It likes to create this charade. Contained in their red tape repeal day bill is the fact they are increasing compliance costs for petrol stations. That is what I have tried to highlight in this speech. With their charade of, 'We're going to repeal red tape; we're going to make it easier for business', they are making it harder for petrol stations. Through this particular measure they are making every single petrol station become a tax collector for this government.


This is what their red tape repeal day is all about—it is all about smokescreens and increasing pressure on families. Rather than being up-front about it, whether before the election or now, this government is trying to ambush the Australian people. Petrol costs are a big issue. They are a very big issue to people in the country and in 12 days time the price of petrol for regional Australians will increase.



Guess what is also going to happen in 12 days time? Prepolls for the Victorian state election will also happen. Perhaps that is why this government does not want to talk about what is really going on and why people do not like the increase to the petrol tax. People do not like the fact that this government will resume the indexation of the fuel excise in line with the consumer price index, a measure which is contained in this document. (Time expired)

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (13:19):  I am very happy to speak to the amendment to the government's amendment bill, rather than speaking on any topic of my choosing and making the same point over and over for the same 15 minutes. I encourage the new member to read standing order 75(a). It was very generous of you, Deputy Speaker, not to use your power to have her discontinue her speech—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  The member for Mitchell will address the bill.




Mr HAWKE:
  which was completely irrelevant. We could open up a whole range of irrelevancies, including your performance in government—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Mitchell will address the bill before the House.




Mr HAWKE:
  I am very happy to comply with the relevant standing orders, unlike members opposite. This amendment bill is extremely important. It is not a charade. It is not a sham. It is not a pretend bill. This is a real bill amending all of the different statutes which require a reduction in red tape in our society—and there are many. We heard from the previous government they did this as a matter of course. We have heard, from many speakers, that they did it secretly in many cases: 'This was just an ordinary day in the office for us—we came into parliament, we moved a bill and we changed spellings and deregulated by stealth.' It was so effective you never even saw it! That was the problem. It was so effective you never did see deregulation from the previous government. You never did hear about it; it was deregulation by stealth, the opposition would have us believe.


We know, of course, there is no such thing as deregulation by stealth. The previous government added enormous amounts of statutes and regulations to the bill—20,000 new acts and repeals—and that was a great addition to the burden of red tape on the Australian people. We do not accept the deregulation by stealth argument the opposition has put forward. We do not accept that this deregulation and removal of red tape is unnecessary in Australia today, because when you talk to businesses or people in the community, they are calling for many of the things that are in this amendment. They are saying: 'These are the things that are delaying our days, when we trying to get business done, when we are trying to employ people and trying to expand our business and its impact on the community.' These are the sorts of things that are taking up their time.


There are many good features you will find in this particular bill. In fact, this particular spring session is the second. I think the Manager of Opposition Business is about to pull a very big tactic because he is so frightened of deregulation. What have you got to hide, as an opposition, about deregulation? (Quorum formed) I am grateful to the Manager of Opposition Business for bringing in such an illustrious audience to hear about why the Abbott government is doing so much to cut red tape and cut regulations off Commonwealth statutes. I know that the members who have joined us are great advocates of deregulation and the government's deregulation agenda. Really, if the Manager of Opposition Business would spend as much time drafting questions—there is something coming up called question time—as he has mucking around tactically here, calling a brilliant House quorum on me, you might have a better standard of questions in question time. It is just a thought—not that I am trying to help over there. More time drafting questions is probably needed.




Ms Rishworth:
  Talk about the bill!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mitchell will address the bill.




Mr HAWKE:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, I got awfully distracted by this whole affair. Back to the bill, the bill in question, the omnibus repeal bill, which I am very, very happy to address. This is part of the government's ongoing deregulation agenda, and it is important that twice a year we have deregulation. It is common in the United States of America, where many statutes and other laws will expire with people leaving office. They will expire automatically. They have many mechanisms to reduce and remove the amount of red tape, laws and regulation in America. However, here in Australia we have not had mechanisms like this that are regular, thorough, complete, that ensure that constantly we remove inactive legislation and regulation that is of no effect that brings the total net regulatory burden down.


Of course we know that the total regulatory reduction in savings for individuals, businesses and the not-for-profit sector will be something in the order of $2.1 billion. It is not about spelling, it is not about a few dollars and cents. It is about $2.1 billion of savings for the individuals, businesses and the not-for-profit sector. It is actually double the target that we have set. You will find in this bill in particular, as well as the repeals of redundant provisions in the acts that are going, the streamlining of many processes. We are also abolishing three bodies in this bill: the Fishing Industry Policy Council, the Product Stewardship Advisory Group and the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council. Getting rid of all these bodies federally—we do not know how many there are, we do not know what they do—is a good thing to do. It is good to downsize the role of government in our society. 


On coming to office the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance asked, 'How many Commonwealth government bodies are there?' It sounds like a simple question; for anyone listening you would think there would be a simple answer. Maybe it would take a period of time to get an answer. How many Commonwealth government agencies does the Commonwealth government administer? The bottom line is that they cannot get a proper answer about how many bodies the Commonwealth government administers. That is how disorganised and how large the Commonwealth government has become: we cannot even identify the number of bodies that we are responsible for. So repealing these three bodies is yet another part, and we are going to be going through more government agencies to reduce the number of committees, bodies and things that we do not need; things that we do not need the government to be involved in or where there are duplicate services available at state level or duplicate services available at other layers of government.


We know, of course, that many of these things are duplicated at state level. The introduction of one-stop shops for environmental approvals is perhaps one of the biggest changes in the way our Commonwealth, our federation, does business in this country. 


One of the most significant problems that we have had as a society has been the knock back of huge amounts of investment, including in states like South Australia, which lost a massive uranium mine because of the overregulation of state and federal governments. There is the time taken when you apply for environmental approvals. There are the multilayers of environmental approvals. There is the reluctance of certain governments to approve big projects, even though they are to the great benefit of their state or the Commonwealth. The one-stop-shop process will ensure that we have better and more streamlined approvals.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (13:30):  Last weekend in Tasmania, at Waddamana, there was a celebration to mark the 100th anniversary of Hydro Tasmania. In those over 100 years, Hydro Tasmania has grown to be Australia's largest renewable energy company. It now employs more than 1,000 people and has assets of more than $5 billion. It was the first power station in Tasmania and opened in 1916 at Waddamana. 


Hydro Tasmania is a large renewable hydro scheme, with over 30 hydro-electric power stations and three wind farms. It is a major institution in my home state of Tasmania. But, like so many other things, Hydro Tasmania's growth and history is more than just about dams, constructions, power stations or electricity output. It is the story of the thousands of workers who toiled to build it and their families who thrived in remote communities right across Tasmania. This was most famously depicted in the novel titled The sound of one hand clapping by Tasmania's recent Booker Prize winner, Richard Flanagan.


Of course, it is difficult to talk about Hydro's history without mentioning one of the great political debates in Tasmania's history—the Franklin Dam. Whatever your opinion of this project, there is no doubt that the controversy surrounding the Franklin Dam and the subsequent legal battles over its construction had and will continue to have a significant impact on Australia's legal history for generations to come. 


I congratulate Hydro Tasmania on its 100 years and the families involved in its construction and their children.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (14:44):  I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for the question. Certainly Australia's airports are doing their part to build the infrastructure of the 21st century. There are billions of dollars worth of projects underway at the present time in our capital city airports alone. The honourable member would notice, every time she leaves Brisbane Airport, the tremendous work that is being done in constructing the parallel runway in Brisbane—something like 13 million cubic metres of sand has to be moved on to that site and that is well and truly underway. This project is part of a $5 billion commitment to the Brisbane community which will come as a result of this investment at Brisbane Airport.


There are similar examples in other parts of the country—significant terminal upgrades and significant commitments to new runways which will make a real difference. Around 60 million journeys were made by Australians travelling on domestic air services in the year ending 30 June 2014—an increase of 1½ per cent over previous years. It is interesting to note that routes like Sydney-Melbourne, Brisbane-Sydney and Brisbane-Melbourne are among the busiest air routes in the world. Australians certainly need their air services to get from one part of what is a very large continent to another.


In addition to what is happening in Brisbane, those who visit Melbourne will notice the work going on there on new terminal buildings and terminal upgrades. They also have a plan for a new parallel runway. Better facilities are being provided in Perth for fly-in, fly-out workers and all of the passengers travelling through that airport. Again, there is another plan for a parallel runway. Adelaide Airport—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr TRUSS:
  I note the member's interjection. Adelaide Airport has just announced a 30-year blueprint for a $2 billion expansion. Again, that is a great vote of confidence in South Australia. In Hobart, the airport runway extension planning is underway, assisted by a $38 million contribution from the federal government. When we come to Sydney, Kingsford Smith airport has major plans to upgrade its road network and in Western Sydney the decision has been made to build a new airport; $3.6 billion worth of roads to service that area and the whole of the Western Sydney community is underway.


This government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century. Our airport owners and operators are joining in that task to ensure that Australia has the infrastructure it needs to service its growing population and that we can travel conveniently around our country whenever we choose.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (15:12):  Yesterday in this chamber, while speaking on the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and the importance of integrity, I made reference to a dishonest campaign run by the former member for Corangamite. The Second Deputy Speaker asked me to withdraw these comments on the basis that I was impugning a member. I initially objected by reason that the person to whom I was referring was a former member and not a member. In light of standing order 90, I ask for your guidance on this matter.



The SPEAKER:  The member will resume her seat. The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.




Mr Burke:

The SPEAKER:  I will deal with the question, thank you. Resume your seat. The member for Corangamite has the call.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Would you like me to repeat the question, Madam Speaker?



The SPEAKER:  No.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Just the last bit. In light of standing order 90, I ask for your guidance on this matter. Thank you.



The SPEAKER:  Under the standing orders, questions to the Speaker are supposed to be about administrative matters and administrative matters only. However, there is an important point that I wish to make and that is this: once a member is asked to withdraw by the chair, there is an obligation to comply with the ruling of the chair; otherwise the matter is compounded and indeed it becomes a reflection on the chair. However, for the purposes of clarity, standing orders 89 and 90, which are the relevant standing orders, apply only to current members and senators. Indeed, 90 applies to members only and 89 applies to members and senators. Joan Child, a former distinguished Speaker in this chair, has noted that. There are other instances when people have been required to withdraw when a former member was mentioned. I think the best way to proceed is that we abide entirely by the standing orders and that standing orders 89 and 90 apply only to current members and senators.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We have just had a question to the Speaker that was not on administrative matters which has resulted in a ruling. At no point have the opposition raised issues other than administrative matters during questions to the Speaker. I hope that what has happened now is not repeated, because you have asked us not to and we have abided by that—



The SPEAKER:  The member will resume his seat. The reason I have chosen to deal with this matter today—and it is an exception that proves the rule—is very simply that members must understand that if someone in the chair—and some of you would do well to listen—asks somebody to withdraw then they are obliged to comply with the ruling of the chair otherwise they are engaging in a reflection on the chair. From that I went on to make a further statement. That will be the end of the matter.

That this House:


(1) recognises that:


(a) the Government will contribute $1.5 billion towards the completion of the western section (Stage Two) of Melbourne's East West Link;


(b) the commitment to Stage Two of the East West Link is in addition to the Commonwealth's $1.5 billion contribution towards the $6 to $8 billion Stage One section of the East West Link; and


(c) together, Stage One and Stage Two will create some 6,200 construction jobs which are so important for Melbourne, Geelong and south-west Victoria; and


(2) notes that the:


(a) East West Link is critical to:


(i) easing congestion on the West Gate Bridge and improving Geelong's transport links to Melbourne;


(ii) easing congestion on the Eastern Freeway and alleviating major traffic bottlenecks at Hoddle Street and Alexandra Parade; and


(iii) improving freight efficiency and connections for major industries in Melbourne's outer east, north and south east to the Port of Melbourne and international airports;


(b) East West Link will never happen under a Labor Government—State Labor opposes the project despite estimates that the cost of Melbourne's road congestion will grow to $5 billion per annum by 2021 and $7.2 billion by 2031, more than double current levels; and


(c) Victorian Leader of the Opposition has described the East West Link as a 'grand hoax' and has threatened to rip up any contracts that are signed with respect to the project and in doing so, has shown contempt for the people of Victoria.

(b) those industries that rely on the health of the Marine Park are able to continue, providing social and economic benefits to local communities and the wider economy;


(c) a diverse range of other benefits and values of the Marine Park, including recreational, cultural, educational and scientific values, are protected;


(d) that future generations are able to continue to use and enjoy the Marine Park;


(e) the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage values are protected; and


(f) the ecologically sustainable use of marine resources by traditional owners consistent with their traditional practices, are provided for;


(2) accepts that Marine National Park (Green) Zones can be beneficial in:


(a) protecting spawning areas and nursery grounds;


(b) minimising damage to important habitats;


(c) providing refuge for protected species, such as turtles and dugongs;


(d) boosting species numbers, which helps the food web as a whole;


(e) increasing the abundance of fish; and


(f) building the resilience of the reef against threats such as climate change and water pollution;


(3) affirms the Native Title Act 1993 which recognises the right of certain traditional owners to hunt and gather in their sea country and that native title holders may undertake traditional use of marine resources;


(4) recognises that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is working with traditional owners for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, by expanding the Traditional Use of the Marine Resources Agreement program and strengthening communications between local communities, managers and reef stakeholders;


(5) acknowledges the value of the Ranger Program in providing job opportunities for Indigenous people to care for their country, take on important skills, develop career pathways, protect dugongs and turtles and manage environmental threats stemming from feral animals, among other benefits;


(6) calls on the:


(a) Australian Labor Party and the Greens to pass the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 which will enable a tripling of penalties for those poaching turtles and/or dugongs; and

(i) where traditional rights under the Native Title Act 1993 apply, seek agreement with traditional owners to prohibit the capture and killing of any species from designated Green Zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area;


(ii) continue to allow certain activities to take place with a permit, such as research and management programs for fauna and flora where they pose a threat to humans or the environment, as per existing regulations; and


(iii) introduce legislation to prohibit the taking of marine species, including seabirds, in designated Green Zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area, where other efforts have proven to be inadequate;


(7) in the interest of supporting the policing of turtle and dugong product that is transported for commercial purposes, prohibit the movement of native species, taken under the Native Title Act 1993 outside the area in which it is caught; and


(8) recognises that these initiatives would complement a range of measures already being implemented under the Government's Turtle and Dugong Protection Plan and Community Management Plans, which will enhance the protection of marine turtles and dugongs in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,13,2,speech
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



The SPEAKER
 (15:17):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for McMahon proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The Prime Minister's petrol tax ambush adding further pressure to the cost of living for Australians.


I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.




More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places—


",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,14,1,speech
"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:18):  There was once a politician who campaigned across the country on cost-of-living issues. He went to every corner of this nation campaigning on cost-of-living issues. He said to the Australian people that they want a grown-up adult government that has thought things through, that has a clear plan to protect people's job security and a clear plan to reduce people's costs of living. We all know who that politician was. He holds high office in Australia now—he is the Prime Minister of Australia. He had a clear plan all right—it just was not clear to the Australian people, because he did not tell the Australian people about it. He had a clear plan—he had planned it all through—but he was not prepared to be clear with the Australian people about his plan. He campaigned right across the country on the costs of living for motorists.


He said that in one of those New-Age moments for housewives doing the ironing across the country, showing he was in touch. He showed the Australian people he cared about the costs of living. He just did not tell them that he planned to increase their costs of living. He planned to increase their costs of living by increasing petrol tax. He planned to increase their costs of living by reducing the age pension. He planned to increase their costs of living by throwing young people off Newstart. He planned to increase their costs of living by increasing debt on tertiary education. 


He planned to increase their costs of living by attacking their costs of living. That is what this Prime Minister planned. He had a clear plan all right; he just was not very clear about it when he was campaigning for high office. He ran the most fundamentally dishonest election campaign in Australian history—an election campaign totally revolving around cost-of-living issues. He promised to reduce the costs of living. All he has done since with every policy he has implemented is increase the costs of living of the Australian people.


He says there is a modest increase in the petrol tax. He says it is small. It raises $2.2 billion. That is not modest. I am the first to acknowledge that that will have a very significant impact on the federal budget but will have a bigger impact on the budget of Australian families. As these Australian motoring groups have pointed out, by 2016-17 the average Australian motorist can expect to pay $142 a year extra because of this government's tax changes.


He campaigned against the carbon price but he did not tell the Australian people he was going to replace it with an increase in the petrol tax. He went off to the United States and told President Obama: 'I'm good on climate change. I've got a carbon tax on steroids.' This is what he was talking about. He was talking about his increase in the petrol tax. He did not say: 'By the way, that carbon price had compensation for low- and middle-income earners. That was a well thought through package.' That said to people on low and middle incomes, 'We are going to help you as we transition to a low-carbon economy.'


Is there a compensation package for the petrol tax increase? I do not think so. There is no compensation package for low- and middle-income earners. It is okay to increase tax without a compensation package but it is a terrible thing to introduce a carbon price with a compensation package! That is the warped and twisted logic we see from this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. This sort of warped and twisted logic saw the Prime Minister last night at a function in Sydney, which I attended together with the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate and the member for Brand, say to the Labor Party: 'Join Team Australia. You have got to be on Team Australia. The way you get on Team Australia is to support our unfair policies.' What sort of warped and twisted logic is that?


It is the same sort of warped and twisted logic that we saw from the Treasurer at the dispatch box when he split the Australian people into 'lifters' and 'leaners'. That is not Team Australia. Team Australia is one team; it is not 'lifters' and 'leaners'. It was an insult to those Australians who commit no crime but to work hard and who need a bit of support.


When the Treasurer said that, I thought it was just showing that he was not in touch with the aspirations and hopes of the Australian people. I thought at least he has come up with an original thought. I have to say, I was wrong because the Treasurer was not even original. He had modified it a little bit but the idea came from elsewhere. There is an organisation in the United States that some members may have heard of; it is called the Tea Party. It has some pretty extreme views and it has adherents to its views who make statements about Americans. There was a high-ranking US politician who categorised the American people. He was a favourite son of the Tea Party and was the Republican candidate in the recent presidential election for Vice President. He said in America there are 'makers' and there are 'takers'. 'Leaners' and 'lifters', 'makers' and 'takers' sounds familiar—it was straight out of the Tea Party copybook.


I gave Mr Ryan credit because he said he made that statement. Admittedly even he was not original. It came from Fox News originally in the United States. But somebody came up to Mr Ryan and said: 'I do not like that ""makers-and-takers"" categorisation. I think that is pretty offensive to Americans who need a bit of a hand. Are you saying my mother, who is a pensioner, is a ""taker"" not a ""maker"" after she has worked hard all her life?' Do you know what Mr Ryan said? Mr Ryan said: 'You are right. I should not have said that. I was wrong. It was insulting and it was offensive. I was wrong to categorise Americans like that. I withdraw those comments.'


Mr Ryan got the insult that he had applied to the American people. Do we see any such grace from this government? Do we see any such acknowledgement from this Treasurer? This Treasurer insulted the Australian people by categorising them into lifters and leaners. He insulted the Australian people when delivering the federal budget. Does he acknowledge his error? No. He says to the Australian people, 'If you are poor, do not worry; you do not have a car. You did not drive so do not worry about the increase in the petrol tax.' He withdrew that for a couple of days and then withdrew the withdrawal, so out of touch is he with the aspirations of the Australian people.


But the most insulting thing of all is not the Treasurer's words but his deeds and his actions. His words are insulting enough but his deeds and his actions are the most insulting. This Treasurer, who was the sidekick of the now Prime Minister, went around Australia campaigning against the carbon price on his deep principles which had been informed by a Twitter question some time before—when he had asked Twitter for advice on what to do about carbon pricing. As the Treasurer has famously been known to say, 'I have got principles and if you do not like them, I have got plenty of others as well.' He is good at plagiarism is our Treasurer. He went around the country campaigning against the carbon price and cost-of-living issues.


The Treasurer is the same Treasurer who came into this parliament and stood at the dispatch box and brought down a divisive budget, an unfair budget and budget fundamentally bad for our economy because he is fundamentally out of touch with the Australian people. We have had a few Treasurers out of touch in this nation and this Treasurer takes the cake. He makes Peter Costello look like he was a touchy-feely in-touch type of guy. This Treasurer has such arrogance that he lectures the Australian people on how they should work longer than anybody else in the world, until they are 70.



Mr Joyce interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  I will check Hansard and see what you said later, Barnaby; you just be quiet. He tells the Australian people that they have to work longer than anybody else in the entire world as he sits in his office bringing down this budget, which has fundamentally divided the Australian people and insulted those Australian people who work hard but who are not of means.


This is a Treasurer who is fundamentally driven by prejudice in a government fundamentally driven by prejudice. As I said before, if this was a budget and a government driven by ideology, I would fundamentally disagree with them. If it was a coherent well-thought-out ideology, I would have my problems with it. I would disagree with it but I would have some respect for it. I have no respect for prejudice. No member on this side has any respect for prejudice. Whether it be racial prejudice or whether it be prejudice against ordinary working people, we will not abide prejudice. We will not abide a Treasurer who divides his country into lifters and leaners. We will not abide a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who say one thing before an election campaign, who run a fundamentally dishonest and deceitful election campaign and who then come into office and say, 'Let's have a mature conversation.'


I will tell you what are mature conversation is code for: a mature conversation is code for 'ignore my deceit'. With this Prime Minister a mature conversation is code for: 'Ignore my deception of the Australian people. I know I deceived do you, I know I have engaged in a fundamentally misleading election campaign but now I want to have a mature conversation.' I will tell you how to start a mature conversation: you start by admitting that you lied to the Australian people in the election.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (15:28):  What I would say to the shadow Treasurer is he has not even attempted to address the substance of the argument that he put forward in this MPI. The member for McMahon has come in here and tried to deliver a lecture about the cost of living. But not once did I hear him raise the carbon tax nor apologise for a carbon tax that delivered a cost impost of $550. The increase to fuel excise needs to be taken into a level of understanding and reality.


In 2001, the level of excise was capped at 38.14c, which was 42 per cent of the price of fuel. Today in 2014, the excise is 25 per cent. The cost increase that will come in on 10 November is 0.0046c. What people are telling me they are more concerned with is the fluctuation in fuel prices at the bowser. And a report that I have pulled down shows a weekly fluctuation in fuel prices across capital cities of 6.4c in one week. In Brisbane it was 11.3c; in Sydney it was 12.2c; in Melbourne, 11.5c; in Adelaide, 10.9c; in Perth, 8.7c, in Hobart, 3c; on the Gold Coast, 16c; on the Sunshine Coast, 7.7c; in Darwin, 17.2c; and in Canberra, 3c. That is just one week's fuel price fluctuation. And we are talking about less than half a cent per litre.


The reality is that this increase will be hypothecated so that all of the money raised will actually go into road infrastructure. It is not like taxes that the former government introduced that were just consumed into consolidated revenue. Being lectured on the cost-of-living increases by the member for McMahon is dishonest in itself. He uses the word 'dishonest' regularly, but it is dishonest in itself. No. 1, he has not apologised for the carbon tax that he voted to support and which he is lining up to reintroduce into the cost-of-living standard for each and every person. The reality is that we will spend every cent of this $2.2 billion on road infrastructure, plus more. In fact, in 2016-17 our spend on infrastructure will be around $8.7 billion in one year alone—$8.7 billion!


Such is the dishonesty of the campaign from the Labor opposition that it has actually flowed through to people in the community. I will quote from an article by Steven Scott in The Courier-Mail today where it says:


Carseldine resident Sonia Sahota, 22, says the price of fuel is ""high enough as it is"".


Well, I can understand that. The article continues:


The plan will see the fuel excise rise by half a cent—


That is correct—


to 38.6c per litre on November 10.


Then she goes on in the article:


… the current cost of petrol already placed pressure on her weekly budget.


Well, nothing like the carbon tax. The article continued:


The student estimated it cost her $50 to fill up and said she wouldn't support paying an extra two dollars in tax to fill up.


Well, $50 worth of fuel is around 33—let's say 35—litres, which will cost 26c extra to fill up, not $2.


So the carry-on by the Labor opposition about the massive cost increases needs to be brought into perspective. As I said, in 2001, when excise was capped, it was 42 per cent of the price of fuel. Today, because there have been no CPI increases, it sits at a margin of 25 per cent. That is because the price of fuel has increased—massively increased. But as I said, what we need to do is make sure that this measure, which will in part go down to helping pay for the road infrastructure, is committed to do that. And it will be done if the opposition supports it. By bringing this into a tariff measure it has 12 months to be put to the chamber to be voted upon.


This is not without precedent. I sat in this chamber and watch the alcopops debate. That money was not hypothecated for all of it the to go into health—most of it went into consolidated revenue.




Mr Conroy:
  That wasn't a revenue-raising measure! It was to reduce drinking rates!




Mr BALDWIN:
  Consolidated revenue! So here we have an honest government introducing a half-a-cent increase in the cost of fuel, hypothecated into road infrastructure spending, and there we had a Labor government increasing alcopops tax and putting it into consolidated revenue. And even though they raised so much tax they still managed to spend more than they could ever raise.


In fact, this is the opposition which, while in government, inherited a $20 billion surplus, no net debt and $45 billion in the bank—$45 billion in the bank! They left a debt for every Australian of around $13½ thousand. So being lectured on cost-of-living pressures by a Labor opposition is kind of like being lectured by Lucifer on fire safety! That is what it amounts to, because they are not honest in their arguments—




Mr Conroy:
  Or you on probity! It's like being lectured by you on donations!




Mr BALDWIN:
  What was that? Let me tell you, buckwheat, those same people donated to you and your campaign! So don't you lecture me on that! There is nothing wrong with accepting donations as a federal member of parliament, which you know only too well. So, again, you are being dishonest and deceitful, which is your normal pattern of approach, as it is for the whole of the Labor Party as it mounts its arguments—in particular, in relation to the cost of living and the increase in fuel.




Ms Collins:
  You said there would be no increase taxes before the election!




Mr BALDWIN:
  Don't you tell me about no increase in tax! Remember carbon tax? You actually stood up here and argued for it! You argued for the carbon tax! You argued to increase the cost-of-living pressures by $550 for each and every person.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  So don't you come in here and lecture me about broken promises!




Ms Collins:
  You've doubled the deficit!




Mr BALDWIN:
  We've doubled the deficit? I think you will find it was actually your patterns and projections that increased the deficit. What we have been trying to do is to pare them back, and you oppose it in each and every way. So whilst you lecture us about economic modelling, the reality is that you do nothing to support bringing down the debt of this nation—that debt per individual—and the interest bill of $1 billion a month alone puts added increased cost-of-living pressure on each and every person.


What I would say to the opposition is to take a reality check. What we should be doing is looking at what we can do to flatten out fluctuations in the cost of each litre of fuel where, as I said, the variations on a day-by-day basis are way more than the cost of increase of this excise. I could understand their argument if, indeed, this money were going into consolidated revenue, which is what happened with every tax increase by the former Labor government. This money is being hypothecated into roads.


In fact, there is so much money being spent—$8.7 billion, as I said in 2016-17—on roads alone. There are roadworks such as the East West Link, which is a $3 billion commitment; Adelaide's North-South Corridor, a $944 million commitment; the Perth Freight Link, now $925 million; the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, now $1.285 million; the Black Spot Program at $564 million; Roads to Recovery at $2.4 billion; the Northern Territory Roads Package at $77 million; the National Highway Upgrade—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  What about Paterson? What about the Hunter?




Mr BALDWIN:
  That is because the roads have already been upgraded. They were done by the Howard government in Paterson. The whole of the Pacific Highway has been upgraded in Paterson by the Howard government.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—



Mr Conroy interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Hunter and the member for Charlton. The member for Paterson has the call.




Mr BALDWIN:
  He's unbelievable! You can tweet that straight away and you can put how you—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Not me.




Mr BALDWIN:
  Sorry—how the member for Hunter did not support money for road works in and around Maitland other than the F3 link which was started and commenced by the Howard government.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  Oh, you live in a life of fantasy, you live in a life of denial and you do not understand. People across Australia will understand that the price fluctuations in fuel on a daily basis will be much greater than what they will be contributing in a small increase in excise—less than half a cent a litre—on 10 November. I say to people: support this. It will pay for road works, it will make roads much safer and it will provide greater fuel economies as we improve the roads of Australia.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (15:38):  Today, Labor members have been talking about the cost of living and about the pressures that ordinary families face in our electorates and in communities that are represented by people like the member for Paterson. What an extraordinary—indeed surreal—contribution we just heard from that member. I do not think I can say anything more about it, other than to encourage people to check the Hansard. Perhaps Barnaby might help him out on the way through. In that regard he needs some help.


Labor members have been talking about the cost of living pressures. We have been talking about another broken promise in the form of this tax on a tax. We have been talking about this government's contempt not only for the Australian people but also for this parliament. What do we see on the other side? Surrealism, but also a government that is in denial or perhaps simply oblivious to the consequences of its decisions. The Prime Minister said a couple of interesting things in question time today. He said, 'This is a government that understands'—an extraordinary comment in the context of this debate. Then there was a cry for help. He said, 'I think of Labor members. They do not understand the pain it is causing'—relating to tax burdens. I will tell you one thing we understand: we understand this because we are listening to the people we represent. We understand the pain that people are feeling right across Australia in order to maintain decent living standards. We believe that a fundamental responsibility of government is to secure decent living standards today and into the future—and also to maintain a decent environment. I said I was not going to talk about the previous speaker's contribution, but let me just say this. How extraordinary. I think he must have said the words 'carbon tax' 50 times. He did not talk about compensation—funny that.


I also want to talk about something our Prime Minister said before the election. The shadow Treasurer highlighted the gross hypocrisy of government members in saying one thing before the election and doing quite another in government. This is what the Prime Minister said in the Northern Territory as he continued what was his pre-election cost-of-living roadshow:


I am just going to keep doing what I have been doing every day since becoming Leader of the Opposition and certainly every day since this campaign started, focusing on how to reduce the Australian people's cost of living pressures, focusing on how to improve people's job security. I am going to focus on the things that matter to the Australian people … 


He has been focussing on the things that matter to Australian people. He has been focussing on making their lives harder and their working lives less secure. This 'age of entitlement' that he speaks of is an entitlement for people like him at the expense of ordinary Australian families. The NATSEM modelling demonstrates the impact of this cruel budget, particularly on communities like the one I represent. He talked about job security. Well, there is very little job security out there in Melbourne's north. In my  colleague and friend the member for Calwell's electorate, unemployment in some suburbs is reaching 26 per cent and youth unemployment is higher. And what support do these people get? The cutting of important programs. The proposal that young people would be denied access to any social security benefits for six months is this government's attitude to cost-of-living. I am very pleased to stand-up for my constituent's cost-of-living concerns and to support the member for McMahon's motion. This petrol tax ambush is adding further pressure to cost-of-living pressures on Australians.


Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, promised no new or increased taxes before the election. He has no mandate for this. He has thumbed his nose to this parliament as well as showing his contempt for the Australian people. I say to members opposite, and I hope they will rise to this challenge: if you are believers in this policy, why didn't you put it to the people? And why didn't you respect the parliament? The Scullin electorate includes some new outer suburban communities, suburbs like Wollert, which are poorly serviced—if at all—by public transport. These constituents of mine have no alternative but to drive, whether it be to work or to run errands. I will give the Treasurer a newsflash: these people, some whom are not wealthy, drive cars. They drive them for long distances. They have no choice but to pay, from their hip pockets, for this government's petrol tax ambush. This is a government that talks out of one side of its mouth and says that it is not much to pay. On the other side, it advises that it will be raising $19 billion in additional revenue. The Australian Automobile Association estimates that the average motorist will be paying an extra $142 extra for fuel by 2016-17—my constituents will be paying more than this.


This cynical government is an echo of the Howard government when the former Liberal Party president spoke of a government being mean, tricky, out of touch and dysfunctional. There could not be a more apt description for these people, and the only question that I think voters are asking is, 'Do they care, or do they just not understand?'

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (15:43):  I think today reflects just what Labor are about, and that is about leading us into a deep hole of debt and not taking responsibility for their decisions and where they have left this nation.


I am pleased to rise and defend the decision of the government regarding the fuel excise, which was announced in the 2014 budget. Yes, I would highlight to the members opposite that this is not a measure that has ambushed Australian citizens, or blustered into the House as an afterthought. The reindexation of fuel excise is part of our May budget, which contains tough but necessary measures to manage and bring under control the previous Labor government's deficit disaster, which they still fail to acknowledge.


Labor's legacy is well known in this place and throughout the nation. It affects and is felt by all Australians. Let me remind the House: 200,000 unemployed; gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion; $123 billion in cumulative deficits; and, as has been mentioned by members on this side, the world's largest carbon tax. Yet Labor have the audacity to say that the coalition are adding to household pressure. It is a hard to believe, but the reality is that Labor's five record deficits and reckless spending has created an intergenerational debt for many years to come. It is this side of the House that are making the decisions to take responsibility and to reset our future.


We are about fixing the budget. The carbon tax is gone. The mining tax is gone. Now the government continue to enact their economic action strategy to build a strong and prosperous economy and a future that Australians can depend upon. Fuel indexation is a very important structural budget reform that the government do not announce lightly. The coalition government have been up-front about the budget. We announced the measures in the 2014 budget because we wanted to partner with Australia in getting the economy running smoothly. The change in fuel indexation will increase the cost of fuel for a typical household using 50 litres of fuel a week by around 40c per week by the end of 2014-15. This, in my calculation, is roughly around $20 a year. That is 40c per household. The money raised will be diverted directly into building roads and infrastructure, and actually contributing to reducing travel costs for the average Australian.


Now, let us reflect on Labor's legacy in contrast: $1 billion in interest per month contributing to Australia's debt—a debt left to us by the Labor government's mismanagement. Labor's debt did not bring us any investment in future infrastructure. Collectively, 40c per household will generate about $2.2 billion over the forward estimates and around $19 billion over the next decade. It is investment that will go to building our future roads and infrastructure.


We are serious about managing Australia's debt and bringing it under control. Australians know that, although many of Labor's decisions have caused us to arrive in this fiscal situation, responsibility lies with all of us to act sensibly to now bring it under control. The impact on households is modest when we consider the impacts of Labor's deficit. Members opposite have failed to talk about the impact on the carbon tax. As the member for Paterson has already mentioned, there is a vast difference between $20 annually and $550 annually for households. I think Labor need to reflect upon their own policies and their own legacies before they lecture the coalition.


The Hawke government introduced indexation, and it seemed to be a good idea at the time. It is a shame Labor have no good ideas to help manage their debt now. Labor say the fuel excise will add further pressure to Australian households, but what really adds pressure to Australian households is $1 billion of wasted money added to the national debt each month. What would add more pressure to Australian households is the extra $550 of costs to the average household per year that Labor placed on households as a result of the carbon tax.


This is a government that follows through on its promise to build a strong and prosperous nation. It is up-front about that, and about what it is going to do to provide a future for every Australian.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (15:48):  I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance, and it is certainly important to the residents of Lalor. Sixty-six per cent of workers in Lalor use their car to get to work. Like those people who live in the electorate of Scullin, and like the member for Scullin pointed out, my electorate is in the outer suburbs of Melbourne on the opposite side of the city to the electorate of Scullin. In the outer west of Melbourne we have limited public transport. We have incredible high-growth areas where we have affordable housing but limited jobs, which means that we have people travelling a long way to get to work. We have people travelling whilst juggling child care, school drop-offs and the trip to work. They will be hurt by the measures put in place by this government. They will be seriously hurt, and they are feeling ambushed today by this government, because this government promised no new or increased taxes. I ask, as I asked many months ago, was that a solemn promise? Was it as solemn as the no cuts to education promise? Was it as solemn as the no cuts to health promise? It is very difficult these days to tell which promise those opposite meant and which they did not. We hear a lot about the promise they have kept, but the promises they made that they are breaking are mounting up day by day.


The people who live in my electorate are getting more and more cynical about this government. They are very cynical after hearing the campaign the coalition ran on cost-of-living pressures. They are very cynical when they pick up a newspaper to find out that the Treasurer has said that poor people do not drive cars. Sixty-six per cent in my electorate of Lalor, with over 200,000 people, drive cars to work every day. The people of Lalor, of course, are most concerned about the compounding nature of the impacts that they are being hit with in this government's budget, because layer upon layer, each level hurts more and more. This is all in a context where wages growth has been the slowest in 17 years. Yet every day the people are going to be hit harder and harder by the budget that this government is determined to get passed.


I am reminded of the rationale about that budget emergency that the coalition have screamed about in this chamber for months. No-one is swallowing that. The facts have been checked. No matter how many times you try to force feed us we will not swallow it anymore. What is clear, however, are this government's priorities. What is clear from their budget is that the ordinary Australian is not the priority of this government. I go to the Australian Automobile Association which, of course, has had a bit to say today. The Chief Executive, Andrew McKellar, has called the petrol move weak, sneaky and tricky. I think there are many residents of Lalor who would be giving him a 'hear, hear' today, because that is exactly how they feel about this tricky tax on petrol.


Yesterday, the Prime Minister could not even fess up and admit that the effect of the announcement would be that if the government fails to get its fuel tax legislation passed the collected excise would be handed back not to the millions of Australian motorists who paid the tax but to the oil companies. It reminds me of the GST and what is happening to the premiers and to the states with the notion of, 'We'll do this. We'll cut your funding and we'll blackmail you into a conversation about a GST.' This is exactly the same. This parliament is being blackmailed by bringing this in through regulation with absolutely no respect for the parliament.


If that was not bad enough, we discovered today through the Abbott government's own repeal day documents that the petrol tax ambush will be even wider. The Prime Minister who stood here again in question time today asking for a mature debate has demonstrated that his behaviour is more like a child holding their parent to ransom. Only in this case it is this parliament and the families in electorates all over this country being held to ransom. I stand here on this matter of public importance to say that the people of Lalor will treat this with the cynicism it deserves.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (15:53):  Today we are in this position because the Labor Party has essentially put us in this position. The revenue of this country was decimated by the previous government. They talk about ambushes et cetera, but it was actually announced in the 2014 budget that we were seeking to increase the excise revenue. But the Labor Party and the crossbench have sought to deny us this. We are trying to repair a broken economy that was left to us. We gave them an economy that was in pristine condition. It had no government debt. It had money in the bank. It was considered to be 'the wonder Down Under'. We then inherited a debt heading towards half a billion dollars. We want to fix this, and we are headed towards doing that. What is the alternative if you are continually blocked in your attempts to repair the economy? You have to find another way to do it. This is what we are doing.


The Labor Party continues to talk about cost-of-living pressures. I will go to that in a moment. When the Labor Party last had a real leader in Bob Hawke this is what he did, in conjunction with his Treasurer, Paul Keating. It was the Labor government that first introduced fuel indexation in 1983, recognising that:


By adjusting excises for inflation each half year … the real value of the tax does not change.


That is what Paul Keating as Treasurer said in the Hansard of 10 May 1984. The coalition, like the Hawke and Keating government, recognises that by a reintroducing the biennial indexation of fuel excise to the CPI the real value of the excise will not be increased. This is an opposition that do not understand the economy and are doing all they can to wreck it.


Let's talk about honesty and pre-election promises. Do you remember the many occasions we heard, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'? On and on they droned. Then what did they do after the election? They brought in a carbon tax which put up people's power prices by about 10 per cent a year and something like $550 each. Worse than that, as the member for O'Connor reminds me, not only did they increase the price of power and introduce an economy-wide tax through the carbon tax—this is their form—but on 1 July this year that carbon tax, besides going up, was going to hit the diesel fuel of those driving vehicles over 4.5 tonnes. It was going to increase by 6.5c a litre. They were going to increase the price of fuel this year if they were the government. The price of diesel would have gone up by 6.5c a litre if they had have been the government in July 2014.


This is canned hypocrisy at its worst. These are people who said they wanted to increase the cost of alcopops because they wanted to improve the health of young people. Trying to improve the health of young people by putting up the price of alcopop drinks did just the opposite, because they went off and bought bottles of vodka and drank them almost straight. Those opposite got a diminished revenue from alcopops. It was not about health; it was about revenue. They had to get that legislation through this place furtively.


On cost-of-living pressures, it was the opposition Treasury spokesman who brought in Fuelwatch. Then he had Grocery Watch, but let's take a look at Fuelwatch. It was going to cost over $20 million a year to administer it just to watch the price of fuel go up. What sort of exercise is that? They were bringing in an institution that was going to cost millions of dollars to watch the price of fuel go up.


We have a solution with these funds of, as has been said in this place, less than 40c per week. It will be dedicated to road infrastructure. We are desperate in this country for real road infrastructure. We have an infrastructure Prime Minister who is committed to spending, as we heard from the member for Paterson, $8 billion a year on real roads and infrastructure. This is where the money is going to go. We want to repair the budget; they want to wreck the budget. We are not going to let them. We are going to make sure that we can deliver for the Australian people on this issue.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (15:58):  I am really happy to follow the member for Canning. He wanted to take us down memory lane. I ask all here in the House: do you remember that before the last election people went out and campaigned for truth in politics? Do you remember that? What about, 'You need a government you can trust'? I think I heard that one, too. What about the mantra, 'No tax on education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions and no changes to the GST'? That was their mantra. Time and time again, they rattled that off. Who can forget a very sincere-looking Tony Abbott staring down the barrel of some television camera, probably with a new blue tie on, saying, 'I promise no new taxes and no increase to taxes.' That was not all that long ago— only a bit over 12 months ago. The member for Canning wants to take us down memory lane, but I have just rattled off a number of promises already broken by this government's budget. No blue tie can cover up what is being done to the Australian people.




Mr Randall:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: my tie is orange!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  There is no point of order.




Mr HAYES:
  This government lied its way into office. Now it expects families and pensioners to pay for their broken promises. That is truth in politics for you! When the next election comes around, ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, do not believe these people here—12 months ago they promised not to increase taxes, but look at what they are doing now. If it were not for the consequences for the mums and dads out there, this would just be a black joke. This government has targeted those least able to afford it to pay for their broken promises.


Today we have seen another ambush. This is a petrol tax. It is a $2.2 billion increase. Without any mandate, without bringing any legislation before this parliament, they are just introducing this petrol tax. I am very proud of my electorate of Fowler. It is a very diverse, very colourful area, but it is an area of great disadvantage as well. People in Fowler will be five times worse off as a result of the government's budget than people in the Treasurer's electorate of North Sydney, the Prime Minister's electorate of Warringah, or the electorate of Wentworth—I note that the member for Wentworth is at the table at the moment. Yet they want to impose more taxes on people from electorates like mine—on the people who can least afford it.


When there was discussion of the impact of fuel taxes on the poor, the Treasurer summarised it for us. He made it very clear. He said that poor people do not have cars and that, if they do, they do not drive too far. I know he got slapped down by the Prime Minister for saying that, but that is what the coalition believe. They believe that people in Western Sydney do not have cars and that, if they do, they do not drive them too far because they do not have much money. This budget slugs the people of Western Sydney more than anybody else. They rely on cars. There is a high unemployment rate in Western Sydney and the people there need cars to get to work because of the lack of public transport infrastructure. That infrastructure needs to be developed. Western Sydney is the fastest growing area in the nation—and the people there need their vehicles. But the government decided to rationalise their decision by saying, 'They do not need their cars because they cannot afford them.'


You only have to look at what the Australian Automobile Association had to say today. I do not know this mob, but they have come out and said that this tax is not only mean and tricky but that, on average, it is going to cost motorists $146 a year. For the people who live in my electorate, where the average household income is $55,000, that is pretty significant. It is a lot for pensioners and for families on tax benefit B. NATSEM has already reported—and I think all members have accepted this—that families with two kids on $65,000 are already $6,000 worse off as a result of this government's budget. Now this petrol tax is being added to that.

Mr HAYES:
  Do not shake your ahead at that! That is an independent finding by NATSEM. You guys know it—and it applies to your electorates as well!

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:03):  In listening to this MPI debate, I could not help but notice the word 'ambush' being used a lot. I thought perhaps that a definition might be of benefit to members of the opposition. It is hardly an ambush when you come into government and are faced with what you lot left us with. It is our job and our duty as members of parliament to sort that out. What we do to sort that out is hardly an ambush.


I would have thought an ambush was, say, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd lecturing the Chinese people in Mandarin. That was probably an ambush, especially considering that it really did annoy them. Probably we could say that Julia Gillard ambushed Kevin Rudd. I think we could say that Julia Gillard ambushed business. We could definitely say that Julia Gillard ambushed the Australian people with 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That was definitely an ambush.




Mr Wilson:
  What about Swannie?




Mr JOHN COBB:
  I think it is fair to say that Wayne Swan, our previous Treasurer—I was going to say that he ambushed the miners, but the way it turned out it would probably be more accurate to say that the miners ambushed him. I think deposit holders, though, could say they were ambushed by Wayne Swan. To have your money taken because you haven't used it for a year or two is a little strong—I call that an ambush. I think people with superannuation could say they were ambushed as well.


I will come to the matter at hand. I just thought that needed straightening out first, because the word seems to be getting thrown around a bit at the moment. I am a member of the Australian government and my first duty is to my country. I also have a huge duty to my electorate. I am embarrassed that we have had to implement this measure—and I am sure every member of the government is embarrassed. But I can only guess how embarrassed Labor must be to have inherited the situation they did and to have then left us in the position of paying a billion dollars a month as a result of their idiocy—behaving like kids in a lolly shop. They were totally uncommitted to Australia. The worst of it is that they threw away $200 billion on things that gave no return to the Australian taxpayer, no return to the Australian people. That is why we have to borrow a billion dollars a month just to pay the interest on what they did.


I want to talk a little bit about the fact that—yes, I think it is true; I know it is true—this measure will cost those of us in regional Australia slightly more. It will cost us more than it will cost city people. Regional Australia is about a third of the population and we will definitely pay more. Someone travelling 400 to 500 kilometres a week to work and back will pay an extra 50c or maybe a dollar in a bad week. Even though we are talking about regional Australians, and I personally represent them in a regional electorate, we have a duty to the country as well. This is a cost we have to bear, and 50c or so a week, despite what the Chief Opposition Whip just said, is as much as it is going to be.


Remember that getting rid of the carbon tax saved regional Australians one heck of a lot more than $550 a year—we get far hotter and far colder so we use far more fuel and electricity than the two thirds of people who live in the major cities. And do not forget that the carbon tax would have been adding 6½c to the cost of every litre if we had been paying that now. So we have 6½c as against half a cent. That was just another one of those ambushes we have been talking about. Yes, I am embarrassed that we have to do this but, by heavens, those opposite must be embarrassed for causing the problem in the first place.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (16:08):  I am not embarrassed at all about letting the member for Calare and others know that this budget and the government's broken promises are a recurring nightmare for my constituents. Just when they thought they had heard it all, they now learn that this government's budget of broken promises and its unfair cuts continue without shame the repeated theme of hurting Australians who can least afford it. Yesterday the Prime Minister's cowardly ambush of the Australian people saw his government bypassing the parliament in order to force onto them this unfair and unwanted petrol tax. It beggars belief that this government continues to push forward with its petrol tax, despite public outrage and despite even the Australian Automobile Association's chief executive, Andrew McKellar—I know he has been quoted by colleagues—




Ms Ryan:
  It's gold.




Ms VAMVAKINOU:
  It is gold—the member for Lalor is absolutely right—because Mr McKellar calls this hike a weak and sneaky and tricky action. That reflects exactly what this is—it is weak, sneaky and tricky and it rubs salt into my constituents' wounds because it adds to the growing list of financial pressures and the burden of living costs in what is one of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged electorates in Australia. People living in my electorate drive cars—we are outer-metro and we drive cars. We need to drive cars. A lot of my constituents may not be very wealthy but they need to drive their car. As if the cost of petrol is not already steep enough, my constituents are now going to be slugged with this unfair petrol tax which the Prime Minister does not have a mandate for. The Prime Minister sought no mandate from the electorate to slug them with this increase in petrol prices. 


Since this budget was announced my electorate has faced a continuous onslaught of proposed budget measures that have hurt them and will continue to hurt them significantly. I have spoken about these measures many times before. There is the GP tax, pension cuts, the abolition of Family Tax Benefit B, forcing young job seekers to go without income support for six months at a time, moving young people onto lower income support payments and cutting payments to war veterans—and now we have the fuel tax. My constituents cannot take much more of this. The situation for their family budgets and overall prospects is dire enough without these additional taxes. This is not good news for my electorate, and unfortunately the news keeps on getting worse. 


The NATSEM analysis is important in demonstrating exactly what is happening to the people who live in my electorate. According to NATSEM, the average family in Calwell will lose about $783 a year as a result of this unfair budget. I want to go through the budget's average impact in dollar terms in the suburbs and neighbourhoods of my electorate. That is what matters—what matters is how the budget will impact on the people who live in the neighbourhoods of my electorate. Families are looking at a loss of $355 in Tullamarine, $805 in Keilor East, $532 in Keilor, $524 in Taylors Lakes, $571 in Sydenham, where there are lots of young families, $1,226 in Meadow Heights, $544 in Gladstone Park and Westmeadows, $1,364 in Broadmeadows, $1,327 in Campbellfield and Coolaroo, $1,032 in Roxburgh Park and Somerton, and $478 in Greenvale and Bulla. These are costs that the people who live in my electorate cannot shoulder—they cannot afford to be hit with these costs. How much more is this government intending to bleed my constituents? How much more are they going to tax my constituents in order to fill their coffers? It is a legitimate question and I am not ashamed to ask it. (Time expired)

Mr LAUNDY

 (
Reid
) (
16:14
):

I spoke on a matter of public importance earlier in the year and I mentioned at the time that I was only new to this place and that MPIs reminded me a little bit of my days at kindergarten. After lunch you would lie down and the teacher would read you a fairytale. Every afternoon I was hearing history rewritten; I was hearing stories—




Mr Pasin:
 We've got 'once upon a time' over there.




Mr LAUNDY:
  You are stealing my thunder! Lo and behold, today the shadow Treasurer stood up and opened up the MPI with the words—I kid you not; you could not make this up—'once upon a time'.


The member for Hinkler and I have just been chatting. I know that in question time the member for Wentworth, who is sitting at the table, loves to use a song reference or a literary reference or a movie reference. We were just conferring about whether or not this was a Paul Hogan moment in parliament. 'That's not a knife; this is a knife.' This is not an ambush. This is not a new tax. The carbon tax—that was a new tax. The mining tax—that was a new tax. Fuel tax has been around since Federation. Its structure has changed with time. When you look back at the issue we are confronting now, you see that it was indeed Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke who finalised indexation in 1983. Why?  It was because he acknowledged that, Australia being a vast country, fuel taxes needed to be spent on roads and they needed to maintain pace in real terms. That is the key here. This is not an increase. It is maintaining real terms. That is the highlight. 


There is also a precedent with the mechanism we are using—that being alcopops, of course. As a publican at the time, I did have some sensible and mature debates with customers in trying to sell that puppy. What you cannot walk away from and what the Labor Party failed to get is that the situation we confront as a nation is dire. And it happened on their watch. Every time you raise this, you get the GFC thrown at you. By the end of this financial year we will have $226 billion in net government debt. Tranche 1 of the GFC was $10.4 billion and tranche 2 was $47 million. That is $57.4 billion of $226.4 billion that is directly accountable. And it is non-recurrent expenditure. It was needed at the time, but it does not keep appearing in the forward estimates. The problem we have is a structural budget deficit, not the GFC. That is why we are doing what we are doing. It is still the problem, whether those opposite want to bury their heads in the sand today the same as they did in the last six years. 


Last week's fertility rates were scary. The ABS announced a birth rate of 1.88. For those of you mathematically inclined, we need a birth rate in women under 49 of 2.1 to replace ourselves. We are growing the wrong way—we are growing by ageing. There are two categories that give us big trouble—and this happened in six years and unless we do something about it now it will continue to happen and get worse. In 2007, health—actual figures, not budget estimates—was $43 billion. At 2013 actual, it was $64.5 billion. That is a 50 per cent increase in six years under the watch of those opposite. In 2007, welfare was $96.5 billion. In 2013 it was $140.6 billion. That is a 46 per cent increase on their watch. The real problem we have—and this is why fertility is important—is that we have 23.5 million people today and 11.6 million in work. We have 11.6 million people carrying 12 million people. The rate of growth of those in the population aged 65 plus is twice the rate of growth of those in the 15 to 64 bracket. It is going to get worse. When those opposite were in government they missed it and tried to continue to blame—and do today—the GFC. They want to spend $80 billion more than us in the next 10 years on health and education. They want to spend $16 billion more than us in the next 10 years on foreign aid. They want to spend, if you will believe what we are debating today—unless they come to their senses—$19 billion more on roads and not have it funded by this measure. That is a total of $115 billion more that they want to spend. They still have their heads in the sand. The obvious question is: when will you stop playing populist politics, acknowledge there is a problem and either work with us to fix it or come up with some suggestions on how you might fund the extravagant lifestyle you plan to continue post the six years you have just had?

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (16:19):  The Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014 is the second introduced by the government this year. The parliament has introduced such bills with regularity since 1934. They are, as the Bills Digest notes, a matter of 'housekeeping'. These bills correct drafting errors, update cross-references and remove spent or obsolete provisions. These bills serve a worthy purpose—they maintain the tidiness of the statute book. This is an ongoing task for this and other parliaments.


But this is not bold deregulatory reform; it is routine work undertaken by all modern governments. Among other things, this bill fixes an incorrect cross-reference in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994; closes a bracket in 474.258(2) of the Criminal Code; corrects the spelling of 'laminated' in a schedule to the Customs Tariffs Act 1995, which presently reads 'laminiated'; and removes a comma from the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, but adds a full stop to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.


The bill inserts gender-neutral language into two acts. I certainly thank the government for this. It has quite rightly been the policy of Commonwealth drafters to use gender-neutral language since 1984. I am genuinely very pleased to see that the Attorney-General has not taken the lead of his LNP counterpart in Queensland, who has recently and controversially returned to gender-specific language in legislation, restructuring the Crime and Misconduct Commission. The use of 'chairman' over 'chairperson' is probably the least of the problems of Queenslanders under Attorney-General Bleijie, but I agree with the many lawyers and citizens in Queensland who have objected to this retrograde step. I thank the Commonwealth Attorney-General for sticking to proper modern drafting practice in this regard.


This bill makes other sundry changes. In a number of acts it replaces the antiquated legal term 'servant' with its modern equivalent 'employee'. Again, this is an uncontroversial drafting point, which the Acts Interpretation Act makes clear is of no substantive legal effect. The bill restructures the Veterans' Entitlements Act for better readability. Again, all of this is worthy. None of it is groundbreaking. This bill is not in any sense 'deregulation'. The inclusion of this routine piece of housekeeping in the government's repeal day stunt beggars belief. It is routine housekeeping which has been the practice of the Australian parliament since the first Statute Law Revision Act in 1934. It has been the practice of the United Kingdom parliament since 1861. It is not novel and certainly not some grand act of deregulation. This bill will not reduce in any measurable way the regulatory burden on any Australian business. It will not remove or streamline any operative regulation. That the government would try to dress this bill up into a grand political gesture shows this government's lack of substance.


The Amending Act Repeal Bill, which is also before the House, follows on from the Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Act introduced in the government's last 'repeal day' stunt in March. This bill repeals around 650 amending or repeal acts passed between 1970 and 1979. As the amendments or repeals have already taken place, the effect of these acts is spent. Section 7 of the Acts Interpretation Act makes clear that the repeal of an amending or repeal act does not undo its operation. This bill therefore has no effect on the operation of any law.


The explanatory memorandum to the bill claims the repeal of these acts is desirable in order to reduce the regulatory burden and make accessing the law simpler for both businesses and individuals. However, the explanatory memorandum also states that 'the repeal of these acts will not substantially alter existing arrangements or make any change to the substance of the law' and that there is 'no financial impact'. We do not argue with getting rid of regulations that are redundant, no longer enforced and not relevant. It is the same attitude we had while we were in government. We repealed over 16,000 acts, regulations and legislative instruments when we were in office.


Let us not pretend, however, that the removal of these 650 acts that is proposed in this bill does anything to 'reduce the regulatory burden' when the explanatory memorandum to the bill itself says 'the repeal of these acts will not substantially alter existing arrangements or make any change to the substance of the law'. Not a single piece of legislation repealed by this bill has any operation. All of the acts to be repealed have been inoperative for at least 35 years. They do not and cannot have any bearing on the needs of Australian businesses and individuals in 2014. 


We will not hear from anyone on the government side in this debate say how the repeal of the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Act 1977 or the repeal of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Amendment Act 1979 or the repeal of the National Fitness Amendment Act 1979 will affect businesses or individuals because the repeal makes no change at all to the substance of Australian law. This bill is nothing more than a stunt to allow the government to claim that it is cutting regulation while not saving any money or removing any operative regulation.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (16:25):  The Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 represents an unprecedented initiative of the government to cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year. This coalition government has gone further and more than doubled the target by announcing a net reduction of over $2.1 billion in compliance costs as a result of the 400 proposed measures. This repeal day is part of the coalition's plan to improve and strengthen our economy. 


The economic action strategy of this government is indeed making progress. The mining tax has gone and the carbon tax has gone. The government's repeal of the carbon tax and the mining tax has not only reduced cost-of-living pressures and helped create jobs but also saved families and businesses in reduced compliance costs. The budget is bringing expenditure down and restoring the economy after the debt and deficit disaster of the previous Labor government. And continuing on from the autumn repeal day 2014, we are taking scissors to inefficiency and dissolving impediments to thriving business and beneficial reform.


Today, I am pleased to join with the coalition government to introduce legislation to repeal nearly 1,000 pieces of unnecessary legislation and regulations. We are talking about considerably reducing regulatory impediments that are harmful to productivity, deter investment and cost jobs. The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index ranked Australia 124th out of 148 countries for 'burden of government regulation' for 2014. That simply is not good enough. The government is doing something about this.


The business and wider community have communicated for some time and it is very clear in the economy that there needs to be a significant reduction in regulation to improve Australia's productivity and competitiveness. Many of these cuts will benefit the electorate of Macquarie, which is a major region for infrastructure investment, emerging small business, the stunning environment and tourism. 


By creating public access to the centralised, online point of access for government services with the myGov account, we make possible a projected saving of $88 million per year. Five million Australians have so far created their myGov account. Similarly, the Australian Taxation Office's new online tax return service, myTax, will save over 1.4 million taxpayers $160 million a year in compliance costs by pre-populating tax returns. A one-stop shop for environmental approvals will save the community $426 million each year and provide an estimated economic gain of $120 billion over the next 12 years. An estimated 447,000 small businesses will benefit from a reduced tax compliance burden with administrative changes to GST and PAYG reporting. That is going to directly benefit small businesses in the electorate of Macquarie. Further, businesses with no GST payable will no longer be required to lodge a business activity statement, saving small businesses more than $67 million each year in compliance costs.


We are creating the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, a national advocate which will also assist in the development of small-business friendly laws and regulations. Small business people around Macquarie, particularly family based businesses, have told me their stories of attempting to make ends meet while struggling with red and green tape. This is why the Commonwealth government is working each day to remove the red tape burdens for small business. 


Following the autumn repeal day earlier this year, Jo Bromilow, President of the Blaxland and Districts Chamber of Commerce in my electorate of Macquarie, spoke positively about the optimism returning to small businesses as a result of removing the burden of unnecessary regulations. The chamber president highlighted how reducing the constant usage of paperwork allows small businesses to get on with the job of growing their business. 


Small businesses play a significant role in our local regional and national economies. Ms Bromilow said, 'It is already apparent that the optimism is returning to small businesses, which will lead on to employment growth and investment in this crucial area of the economy'. Jo Bromilow, as a distinguished and experienced small business manager in my electorate, understands the positive impacts of reducing the constant usage of paperwork and red tape. Ms Bromilow said it allows small businesses to move forward. We are committed to ensuring small businesses can do more to benefit consumers, their businesses and our economy.


The NBN rollout is moving into full swing within the electorate of Macquarie, and currently many residents in South Windsor and Bligh Park localities are making the transition, with Richmond soon to follow. NBN customers can opt not to have a battery backup installed in their home or business, as many customers can use their mobile phone or generator during a power blackout, saving $21.1 million in compliance costs. 


Local clubs and organisations registered as a company limited by guarantee in my electorate of Macquarie—who do so much for the community—and make less than $1 million in revenue, will no longer require an auditor. This was previously required even though audited financial reports were not. 


There simply is not the time to list all that is being done with this bill today or all of the direct benefits for business, local organisations and the community at large. Continuing on from the repeal of over 9,500 regulations and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation on the 2014 autumn repeal day—the largest bulk repeal in Australia's history—the government is repealing a further 256 regulations. This will do away with over $700 million of compliance costs. That is $700 million of taxpayers' money that can be reallocated elsewhere: to assist and grow small businesses, to grow tourism in the region, to invest in greater and increased infrastructure, and to help local organisations and communities to prosper. I am pleased to commend the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 to the House.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (16:33):  I rise to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. Australia has been blessed. We have achieved an economic position in the world, built on good fortune, hard effort and a good economic platform built by successive good governments—the Hawke-Keating years and the Howard government. It was supported, at least in the Hawke-Keating years, by a reformist opposition with an eye to the future and what was in Australia's best interest. That is in contrast to where we sit today. The Rudd-Gillard years by comparison not only lacked any agenda to increase productivity; it unwound many of the reforms of the previous 20 years.


Disturbingly, the World Economic Forum tells us that Australia has slipped to 124 out of 148 countries on the burden of regulation table. That is a disgrace. It is a clear illustration of why Australia is losing the manufacturing industry out of Australia today. We are losing projects on a world-wide scale because we have lost our competitive edge. The previous government, the Labor government, in just three years—2010 to 2013—introduced 21,000 new regulations. I am not sure if this is a new record but I certainly hope so and I hope it is not one that is repeated soon. 


Last year we had our first repeal day; 10,000 acts and regulations gone—that was 50,000 pages. What an achievement. This time it is 1,000 acts and regulations abolished—7,200 pages and, in total, more than $2 billion worth of compliance burden. For me—one who has railed against stifling regulations—it is an exciting time. It is almost an 'Empire strikes back' moment. It is great to see the little guy get a chance to breathe. 


Almost instantly when I walk in the door of a small business, the first thing they tell me—after we say, 'How are you going?' and 'Good morning'—is: 'You have to get the red-tape monkey off our back. We are being strangled by red tape, paperwork, workforce compliance, workforce policies—for almost every conceivable occurrence, no matter how remote the possibility—tax compliance, industry compliance.' I have met truckies who are dazed and confused by loading regulations, driver management rules—sometimes policed by zealots who think the country can run without trucks. I have heard from television aerial installers—this is a good one—who are now no longer able to use a ladder to climb on to a roof unless it is tied at the top. Don't ask me how they are supposed to tie a ladder at the top without climbing the ladder in the first instance. The list goes on and on and, depressingly, on.


So today is instalment 2 of a government finally having a red-hot go at trying to get the red-tape monkey off the back of the citizens of Australia. Huge numbers of useless acts and regulations will be going out the door today, delivering $1.2 billion worth of savings. For instance, the one-stop shop for environmental controls will save $426 million upfront. Even more importantly, it is expected that over the next 12 years we will deliver $120 billion worth of benefit to Australia. 


For agriculture—an industry I am vitally interested in—improvements to the farm management deposits, implementing the mandatory port access code, and getting rid of a duplicated cattle-tagging system are just a start, but they will all help.


With simplified documents, there is a huge range of issues covered: simplified documents for marriage certificates, a choice as to whether a consumer has a battery back-up on the premises for a fibre-to-the-node connection to the National Broadband Network, e-tendering for defence supply contracts and simplified paperwork for Job Service Providers all provide savings and efficiencies to individuals, business and government, as will speeding up Export Finance Insurance Corporation approvals and PBS medication charts for public hospitals will save $40 million. These are big figures. 


The myGov site will make life easier for welfare recipients and save $88 million, and people will be able to lodge their tax returns on this site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Simplified import permits for defence procurement will save $27 million. Getting rid of the red tape in the VET sector will save $30 million. The government will be reforming the apprenticeship support schemes, aligning state and federal gambling regulation and PAYG thresholds will be adjusted. Better cooperation with the US on tax arrangements will yield $58 million. Duplication for reporting of charities will be reduced. Efic will be simplified and be able to underwrite all supplies and not just capital equipment.


The list goes on but I will hone in on one issue that is of particular interest to me, and that is the move to harmonise Australian design rules with other developed nations' procedures. Last year, I sat on the agriculture committee inquiry into the legislation to amend the Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals Act. The bill—in the previous government's eyes at least—was aimed to improve efficiency but in fact added considerable cost and regulatory burden to the sector. This government, since that time, has unwound that legislation. But, during the debate, it was made clear to me that Australia faces all kinds of issues in the registration of chemicals for agricultural use in Australia. We think of ourselves as big food producers when in fact we are medium to small food producers. We are big exporters of certain products like wheat, barley, sugar and cotton—even though you do not eat that of course. You may, but it may not be very good for you!


We are big exporters, but we are not a significant market for many other commodities. So when you get a chemical that is registered internationally it costs a lot of money to get it registered in Australia for relatively small markets. As a result of this, Australian farmers are not always accessing the best chemicals on the market. This move that starts to recognise other countries' assurance systems, their registration systems, is a great move for us. It is not in this agvet area yet, but this is one of the things that I will be pursuing, because I believe it is in our benefit. The world is a place that seems to be decreasing in size. We are increasingly linked to our trading partners. We should be recognising each other's standards in the way we do business and in the way we register products. With that, I will commend the bill. I will just point out that this government has commenced this tough job. In contrast to the last six years, where Labor gave us more regulation, more government, more red tape and more strangulation of the economy, it is a breath of fresh air.

This is another example of this government following up on its election commitments and it follows on our efforts on the autumn repeal day back in March. Fittingly, this spring omnibus repeal day gives us the opportunity to continue the job of the spring-clean of red tape and regulation in our economy. We made a commitment at the last election to cut over $1 billion in red and green tape and with this bill we are continuing to deliver on that commitment. In fact, the reality is that we are more than doubling our commitment by a reduction of over $2.1 billion in red and green tape costs to our economy. With our March repeal bill we repealed some 10,000 pieces of regulation and some 50,000 pages of legislation, removing some $700 million of compliance costs.


This is the first time ever that we have had the two repeal days in the one year. You might ask why this is important. It is important because we need to deregulate to free up the productive sectors of our economy to achieve and grow for the future benefit of this country. This is important because the previous government left us a legacy of red tape and regulation by introducing more than 21,000 additional regulations. In addition to that, there were over 80 examples of noncompliance or exemption from regulatory impact statements in those legislative processes. As a result of the inaction towards reduction of red tape and green tape by the previous government in the years from 2007, multifactor productivity declined by some three per cent.


It is worth noting that in the Financial Review today there was an article about a report that has been released by Deloitte Access Economics, and I will quote from that. It is titled 'Red-tape staff cost $250 billion' and it reads:


A growing thicket of business red tape is creating a new class of workers devoted solely to complying with rules and regulations, potentially costing the economy more than $250 billion a year.


Deloitte Access Economics reveals more than one in    11 Australians are now employed in compliance jobs such as office managers, inspectors, public relations and occupational health jobs.


So it is no wonder we have seen that decline in productivity. This is despite the promise by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, in 2007 of a one regulation in, one regulation out policy and the then small business minister, Mr Emerson, saying in 2008 that Labor would 'take a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small business'. I would suggest you, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, that those scissors went well and truly missing during their term in office and it has taken a coalition government to pull them out of the cupboard, dust them off, sharpen them up and get stuck into the job of reducing red tape and regulation in our economy. 


A number of speakers have already focused on the important needs of small business. Why is that? It is because 94 per cent of all businesses in Australia based on turnover, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, are small businesses. They also make up 99 per cent of the some 816,000 employing businesses in Australia. They employ approximately 4.5 million Australians, or 43 per cent of the private sector workforce. Interestingly, this is down seven per cent on what it was prior to the election of the previous Labor government. This government has made it well and truly clear over the past 12 months or so, and even prior to that, the importance of small business to our economy and to employment, growth and innovation. Part of the process of this repeal of red tape and regulation is to ensure that we free up that productive and innovative capacity in our economy.


The Productivity Commission has also estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP, further identifying importance of going ahead with our deregulation agenda. What is interesting is that if you take the figures from this Deloitte Access Economics report, the reality is that red tape and regulation, both the government level and in the corporate sector, could amount to as high as 15 per cent of gross domestic product. What an enormous drag on our economy.


As with other activities already undertaken by this government, including getting rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax, we are continuing well down the road on our deregulatory agenda. Just briefly in summary, some of the things we have looked at is minimising and simplifying the interaction with government; reducing regulatory obligations and reporting requirements; fuelling economic growth by a one stop shop for environmental approvals based on agreements with every state and territory that alone is estimated to save some $426 million; and making it easier to provide direct finance to our exporters, where we generate an enormous amount of our national wealth.


There are also a number of common sense reforms: Australia were now accept products, systems and services that have been approved overseas under trusted international standards or risk assessments; NBN customers will be able to opt out of having a battery backup installed in their home; the extension of the Do Not Call Register is now indefinite—people will not have to renew at every eight years; beef producers exporting to the European Union will no longer have to tag their cattle with additional tags; for those who love to ride motorcycles—not that I am one of those—they will no longer require a modification to be fitted with an Australia-specific rear mudguard, bringing Australia into line with United Kingdom, France and Germany. That alone is estimated to save the motorcycle industry some $14.4 million in compliance on manufacturing costs. Local clubs and organisations registered as a company limited by guarantee with revenue of less than $1 million will no longer require an auditor where that has been previously required, even though audited financial reports were not.


This omnibus bill I highly commend to the House, as it continues to pursue the deregulatory agenda that this government has set out to free our economy up to be productive, innovative and grow for the future benefit of all Australians.

Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (16:49):  It is great pleasure that I rise to speak on these repeal provisions. Upon reading them a phrase sprung to mind, which is one of those few lovely phrases from Latin at creeps into the law and that you actually remember. The phrase is: 'de minimis non curat lex', which means, in effect, that the law does not concern itself with trifles. In legal principle it essentially means that the law will not usually remedy the injury of an immensely minor type, nor will it make continuous judgements in respect of what are contextually very minor issues. That is a particularly helpful principle to govern the conduct of the law, but it is a terrible principle to govern the conduct of economies.


Having watched this debate occur twice now on two separate repeal days, I must say I have been somewhat surprised by the very strident negative approach taken by members opposite.




Ms MacTiernan:
  No, it is that you are dressing it up!




Mr PORTER:
  It is something that most people seem to agree is a very good thing, so we have a range of very strong endorsements outside of this place for the agenda. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australia's largest and most representative business organisation, strongly supports the government's initiative to cut red tape and undertake legislative repeal days. Repeal days just like this one. The basis—as the member for Perth in her very casual and low-key way noted by interjection!—of Labor's surprisingly strident opposition is essentially twofold. The first is that what is contained in this swathe of repeal legislation is just too minor to be bothered with. The Manager of Opposition Business said things such as 'so much hype over so little'. He described it as 'vacuuming the spare room that nobody walks into anyway'. Of course, this was a theme continued by the member for Isaacs, to the effect that all this does is do things that governments usually do, which is to repeal, remove or fix very, very minor problems in legislative instruments. Of course, that is part but only part of what is being done. The only other argument being offered by Labor is, to the extent that there is anything important in this, they did it anyway and did it as a matter of routine. I will address that second argument in a moment.


With regard to this notion that all that is being done is minor, it simply does not bear proper scrutiny when you actually look at what is happening here. The fact is that, yes, there are some matters which would be described as de minimis, and you have got regulatory wolves in this menagerie. You have rats and mice and you even have a few fleas. The member for Isaacs spent many minutes concentrating on the fleas, but the fact is that there are some very significant savings and changes which will help business across Australia. In the first tranche of reforms we had the incredibly substantive removal of a singularly damaging piece of duplication in the environmental sphere. Having a situation where you can have the regulatory assessment of environmental matters according to state legislation and the federal version of that legislation done at one time by one organisation will save $426.3 million a year. That falls certainly into the category of a regulatory wolf or maybe even a tiger: something that is terribly damaging and dangerous to the economy. Then in this tranche of repeals we have other very important matters. The idea now that Australian business will be able to accept products, systems and services that are approved overseas under a trusted international standard or risk assessment is going to be a very significant plus for business.


But, yes, in amongst all of this there are many other smaller, more modest changes, but the point about regulation is that it is the cumulative effect of the regulation that has to be constantly and continually tackled. We are tackling here both the big-ticket items and the composite and cumulative effects of all the minutia which in its cumulation causes immense difficulties. Labor's position seems to be this: there is no point, and we should roundly criticise the person who removes the barnacles from the hull because the things are just so small. But the point is the cumulative effect of all the things that are being done here has a reverberatory effect throughout the economy. There is also the fact that there are some very major and big-ticket items that are being removed.


I will address the second point of Labor's argument—which is completely inconsistent with their first—which is that none of this is really worth doing to any extent but, to the extent that it is, Labor did it anyway. The fact remains that there is probably one genuinely bipartisan measure that both parties have said is a good measure of the regulatory burden, and that is provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It looks at regulatory and economic burdens and failures across a range of categories in 144 countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit said that, looking at 144 countries across the world, when you look at the burden for government regulation, when the Howard government finished its term in office Australia was 60th out of 144 on the burden of government regulation. After Labor's time in office we had sunk to 96th out of 144 on the burden of government regulation.


The question begs: if Labor did all this and their deregulatory agenda was so fine, so good and achieved so much with so little fanfare, why was their performance on the best possible measure so terrible? Why did we slip from 60th in the world on the regulatory burden of government to 96th over their period in government? The answer must surely be that they simply did not do enough and that their attitude and culture around these things was not strong enough. That has been very significantly repaired by this government and by the parliamentary secretary, who is doing a very fine job.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (16:56):  I am very pleased to rise today to speak on this bill, which I and I think many others in this House today believe is important to constituents Australia-wide who seek to reduce the burden and cost of regulation—and that is all of us, including those opposite, I am sure. The Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 is a whole-of-government initiative to amend and repeal legislation in a number of areas.


Today we have heard the other side say there is no value in this bill. I say they have not looked very hard to find that value. If they had done so, they would have noticed a whole raft of amendments. The bill deals with generally benign measures—yes, we agree with that—in order to reduce the regulatory imposition on business, individuals and the community sector, but there are many other, more substantive matters as well. The repeal will make regulation easily accessible, meaning business, individuals and community organisations can spend more time doing what is important for them and less time trawling through regulation and some of its more ridiculous demands.


The omnibus bill deals with a wide range of legislation, in many cases repealing legislation which is no longer relevant, in approximately nine areas. We have seen amendments in the areas of agriculture, immigration and border protection, industry, Treasury, veterans' affairs—even the Prime Minister and Cabinet area gets a haircut. I have a particular focus and objective in recognising and assisting small business to reduce costs and the regulatory burden and to increase efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. We all know that, when small business is not focused on regulation, it can spend more time on business itself.


This government is determined to be a smaller, less interfering government, and this latest reduction in red tape is moving us all in the right direction, especially for the business community. The government does not run small businesses. It has a responsibility to provide the right legislative environment to help improve the business community, not be a hindrance, not be a blocker but be an enabler.


I would like to focus a little on some of the improvements for the small business sector, and it is pleasing to see the Minister for Communications sitting in the House today, because communications is one area I would like to focus on. Schedule 2 will amend legislation in the communications portfolio to streamline statutory consultation and publication requirements and repeal spent provisions. Part 1 deals with the provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that are redundant now and say that the SBS undertakes television production and supply previously undertaken by the National Indigenous Television Ltd Part 2 will deal with provisions in the communications portfolio requiring rule makers to consult before making certain legislative instruments. This is all very sensible and noncontroversial. Simply, there is a reduced requirement to consult, impacting small business in the communications sector and removing a requirement for ACMA to publish notices in the Gazette; rather, they may use their website, making notification quicker for entities and speeding things up, thereby creating efficiencies and reducing costs.


Now let us have a quick look at the environment. The schedule will repeal and amend provisions in the acts administered in the environment portfolio, making technical amendments to streamline regulatory arrangements. Two items which will reduce the burden for small business are as follows: removing the requirement for duplicate approvals when moving hazardous waste through Australia—hardly rats and mice, I would say—and enabling information relating to the export of hazardous waste to be published on a website rather than the onerous, old-fashioned paper publication requirement. This will remove a compliance burden for hazardous waste exporters. Other items will ensure hazardous waste permit processing can be done more efficiently, reducing the cost to business. With respect to social services, a notable change is the lower reporting requirements for aged-care providers. This will be extremely well received and is welcome.


A little bit about Durack: we all know that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy, and I am committed to reducing red tape in the sector. The Productivity Commission released in its report in 2013 some commentary on small business that is worth repeating here today:


Small businesses feel the burden of regulation more strongly than other businesses. Almost universally, their lack of staff, time and resources present challenges in understanding and fulfilling compliance obligations.


… … …


Australian studies have found that small businesses spend, on average, up to 5 hours per week on compliance with government regulatory requirements and deal with an average of six regulators per year.


The omnibus bill will have a positive impact on more than 13,500 small businesses in my electorate of Durack which includes the Kimberley, the Pilbara, Gascoyne, the Midwest and the northern wheat belt. Do not forget, many businesses in remote and regional areas of Durack are owner operated, one-person shows. Most of the towns in Durack have commerce or small business organisations and wherever I go in my massive electorate the message is always the same: 'Get rid of the compliance; get rid of the impediments. Help us make ends meet and get customers coming through the doors.' I met with small business organisations recently in Moora and Merredin; and also with John Lally, CEO of Karratha District Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Rob Jefferies, CEO of the Mid West Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Geoff Herbert, President of the Onslow Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They are all concerned with the current requirements on small business and look forward to a reduction of unnecessary red tape.


It is absolutely essential to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia; we have heard that a lot. It is essential to strengthen our rural and regional communities, which of course is our policy. Today we are working at removing nearly 1,000 pieces of legislation and regulation as part of this spring repeal day. 


To finish off, here are a couple of quotes from people who have an interest in this matter. The CEO of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, Deidre Willmott, who is well known in government circles and well informed on the burden on business of overregulation, says:


Western Australian business owners are amongst the cleverest people going around, with a track record of world leading innovation. However, their ability to compete and succeed on a global scale is being hampered by the amount of time and energy they need to spend navigating convoluted, time consuming regulatory processes across multiple layers of government.


And one last quote from Reg Howard-Smith, who is the Chief Executive of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, who agrees:


The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia welcomes the Federal Government's attempts to repeal unnecessary red-tape and duplication.


In particular the resources sector urges all parliamentarians to support the one-stop-shop proposal for environmental approvals.


Despite concerns raised by environmental lobby groups, the one-stop-shop will not see a 'watering down' of environmental standards.


As someone who has worked in the mining industry for many years and has firsthand experience in navigating the torturous environmental approvals battlefield, I believe anything we as a government can do to reduce time frames and get projects off the ground is good for us all. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (17:04):  It gives me real pleasure to rise and speak on this bill, the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, and associated bills. I would like to associate my comments with all of those made on this side of the House today. The very varied contributions made by so many people illustrate the work that has gone into discovering those little things that are, as Christian Porter mentioned, the barnacles on the hull.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lyons knows to address members by their proper title.




Mr HUTCHINSON:
  I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker. They are indeed the barnacles on the hull of small business and of families. I do my best when I am travelling around an electorate that is not as big as the member for Durack's electorate but one which is, in the Tasmanian context, a large electorate; I try to listen to the small businesses and families that make up that electorate. The small businesses owners, and the employees within those small businesses, are not usually members of unions. That is perhaps one of the reasons why those opposite take so little interest in genuine attempts by this side of government to improve and remove the red tape that is literally suffocating small businesses all around Australia. The contribution from six years of Labor was 21,000 new regulations. It was going to be one in, one out; but 21,000 new pieces of red tape and regulation were introduced during the six years of the previous government.


Small business is indeed in our DNA. A local businessman said to me recently he is not sure that the community fundraising event he has been involved with for nearly 20 years will continue any longer. The event's organisers, all volunteers, have been struggling for several years with the increasing burden of red tape and mountains of applications and forms they now face to get this community event off the ground. Committee members have just about run out of time and energy for the paperwork. It will be red tape that sees many successful community events shut down.


One of my staffers was telling me recently about her 91-year-old father who happily and healthily lives on his own—except for the growing mountain of paperwork that faces him every time he attempts to seek out services to make his life a little easier. It is government getting involved with people's lives. On this side of the House, we want to get out of government; we want to be a small government. A hospital visit, for example, for a minor procedure required 20 or 30 pages of forms to fill out. A change to his Veterans' Affairs pension required 20 or 30 pages of questions to be answered, even though he had answered the questions before on a number of occasions.


We have all heard stories of regulations gone crazy so that we sometimes feel that we are being strangled by paperwork. That is why it is a wonderful thing that the government is doing for Australians with the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. This is the second such day, which we have promised will be twice-yearly events in parliament focused solely on reducing the compliance burden on individuals, businesses and the not-for-profit sector. I want to acknowledge the work done by all the federal government ministers in bringing to fruition this bill, which will amend and repeal legislation across nine portfolio areas, and the work done by parliamentary secretary Frydenberg to bring this all together. It is a work in progress, because we will not stop until duplication and unnecessary legislation is minimised. 


The government has announced more than 400 new measures to cut red tape across the board, from environment to education, health to human services, and Treasury to trade. We are honouring a promise to the Australian people made at the time of last year's election when we said we would cut red tape costs by $1 billion. I am pleased to stand here today and say that the repeal measures thus far will total over $2.1 billion net in compliance costs.


Today, in the second repeal day so far, the government introduces legislation to repeal nearly 1,000 pieces of legislation and regulations and 7,210 pages on the statute books. That is on top of the nearly 10,000 unnecessary or counterproductive regulations and 1,000 redundant acts of parliament that were removed on the government's first red tape repeal day in March this year. 


Some of the key reforms from this bill, which will directly benefit the constituents of my electorate of Lyons in Tasmania, include those to do with small business and also the aged-care sector. An estimated 447,000 small businesses nationally will benefit from a reduced tax compliance burden with administrative changes to GST and PAYG reporting. Businesses with no GST payable will no longer be required to lodge a BAS statement. These measures will save small business an estimated $67 million in red tape, which small business operators in Lyons will applaud. I look forward to hosting the Minister for Small Business Mr Billson in a few weeks on the east coast of Tasmania. I know the small business people in that part of my electorate are indeed looking forward to the minister's visit.


Aged-care providers will no longer be required to notify the Department of Social Services—and I note the minister is in the chamber—of key personnel changes unless changes materially affect the provider's suitability to provide care. 


Close to my heart are reforms to both the higher education sector and the agricultural sector. Universities are being saved $2.1 million in compliance costs by not being required to complete the Sustainable Research Excellence—SRE—staff hours survey to measure how university researchers balance their time between research and other activities over a two-week period; just pure bloody-mindedness. This was a ridiculous form of regulation, and its scrapping will be applauded by the University of Tasmania's staff, who are looking for ways to save costs. Instead, they can spend money on expanding student services.


Australian beef exporters exporting to the European Union, of whom there are many in my electorate, will no longer have to tag their cattle with lime green tail tags for the European Union Cattle Accreditation Scheme. The reason for this is that we have electronic tags now, and they have been in operation for many years. This will save beef farmers about half a million dollars a year—barnacles on the hull, indeed.


I congratulate my parliamentary colleagues, all of whom worked so hard to produce this common-sense round of reforms, and I commend the bill to the house. I would encourage those opposite, and I would be very interested to see whether the member for Indi and the member for Kennedy, who are most interested in agriculture, support this deregulation measures. The member for Denison must hear from the many small businesses in his electorate in my home state about the burdens that are imposed on small business. I encourage him to support these changes. The member for Fairfax is a businessman in his own right—we all know that—and I encourage him to support these measures as well. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (17:11):  I am pleased to rise on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and other associated bills. About a fortnight ago I attended the southern Sydney volunteer awards, where I was very proud to hand out the major prize on that day. Amongst the audience were many wonderful volunteers in our society. There were people who volunteered in lifesaving; in the Rural Fire Service; in aged care; and helping our kids with disabilities. On that day the overall prize winner for the best team of volunteers was a group called the form fillers. Their job, their volunteer service to our community, was to help people to fill out government forms. Out of all the valuable efforts of volunteers in our society that was considered the most important service that could be done in our local area. It was a team of 14 people. It is not to question or belittle the great work that they have done in any way but to raise the issue, the problem that we have in this nation—overburdensome government regulations and red tape.


To see the serious problem we have in this nation, we need look no further than the recent study on global competitiveness by the World Economic Forum. Out of 148 nations surveyed on the burden of government regulation, unbelievably, Australia was ranked 124th. So there are 123 other nations that have less burdensome government regulations than we have. The few nations that we were in front of included the Islamic Republic of Iran, which we tied with.


This is not something we should be laughing about, because this government regulation directly affects our economic prosperity and our wealth creation. During the recent MPI, we had members from the opposition coming in here and whinging about how there had been very low real wages growth. The reason for that is that we have not had the productivity increases. While we continue to burden our businesses, especially our small businesses, with more and more red tape, we prevent them from getting on with the job of creating wealth and creating those new businesses that drive our prosperity.


During this debate, I think we have seen perhaps the greatest evidence of the difference between our side and those opposite. The opposition have come in here and ridiculed this legislation. We know the record of the previous government. They used to boast about the number of regulations they had brought in. They actually thought it was a good thing that they brought in 21,000 new regulations. They thought this was wonderful. The simple difference is that the opposition, the modern day Labor Party, believe in central planning. If only they could get another team of government bureaucrats to go into that business to sort them out, to give them more red tape, things would be so much better! After six years of that, what have we seen? As this has always done throughout history, it has ended in tears. The unemployment queues in this nation are 200,000 people longer than when the previous Labor came to office. 


Thomas Jefferson perhaps said it best when he said: 'That government is best which governs least'—and that I agree with. Just look at the disaster we have had as a result of previous government intervention. There is a thing called Maudlin's law, which says that for every leftist piece of government law introduced in a hurry to try and address some perceived crisis or remedy there will be at least one or more unintended consequence that has an equal or greater negative effect. This is what we saw during the previous six years. We saw the mining tax, which was supposed to create this wonderful revenue, cost our ATO $50 million in just establishing the compliance requirements—and it hardly collected more than that. We saw the carbon tax, which was designed to lower pollution. But after the carbon tax was implemented, it actually increased air pollution in Western Sydney, my area, to above World Health Organisation standards. 


This is a very important piece of legislation before us. We must wind back the ever-growing burdensome obligations upon our business community, especially our small business community. We must have faith in them. We must free their hands to let them get on with the wealth creation that will drive the prosperity of this nation into the future. After all, as a nation, we now have to find $1 billion every single month, $33 million a day, just to pay the interest on the previous government's debt—and most of that goes overseas. We have to start clawing that back. The only way we can do it is by increasing the productivity of this nation, and that starts by this government reducing the burden of red tape that has been placed on our business community. I proudly commend the bill to the House.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (17:17):  I am pleased to add my voice to the many in support of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills and to indicate my very strong backing for the government's commitment to cutting red tape. This package of Spring Repeal Day bills builds on the Autumn Repeal Day legislation and brings the total in red tape savings to $2.1 billion. This is more than double our election commitment to slash red tape by $1 billion.


Earlier this month, I hosted a number of listening posts throughout my electorate to talk with local residents directly about the things that matter most to them. Overwhelmingly, the underlying message is that they want the government to make things simpler, rather than more complicated. They want to be able to get on with their working lives, they want to run their business or they want to volunteer at the local charity or sporting club, without having to wade through paperwork and without having the burden of regulation to make simple tasks difficult.


During the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, members opposite used to brag about the amount of legislation that was passed through the House. Indeed, in just over five years, Labor managed to introduce around 21,000 new regulations—but so much of it was unnecessary. I am a firm believer in smaller government. There isn't time in today's debate to go into a philosophical debate about the role of government, but the notion of smaller government is at the heart of the coalition's policy approach. And I think everyone on this side of the House is excited about the fact that, while we are in office, there will be two sitting days every year dedicated to repealing the legislation and regulations that do not serve a positive purpose and that only add to the red tape which individuals, businesses and community groups have to deal with. This legislation will help ensure that, over time, the burden continues to be lifted and that we streamline the work of government into the future. What's more, the coalition is committed to a new approach with every piece of legislation or proposed regulation that we put forward. We must first ask: what is the purpose, cost, and impact on productivity of proposed initiatives before regulating? Only after these questions are answered and only when it is absolutely necessary will we proceed to regulate.


I did want to speak very briefly about the nature of the changes today. The Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 implements 38 measures across nine portfolios. The changes are diverse and give effect to a range of deregulation measures announced since the Autumn Repeal Day. Just one example is the implementation of the government's response to the Review of the Australian Government Building and Construction OHS Accreditation Scheme. The changes to the scheme include removing the costly and time-consuming requirement for builders to be certified to Australian Standard AS4801, or equivalent, prior to applying for scheme accreditation. Unaccredited builders will now have the opportunity to undertake Commonwealth funded building work where they are in a joint venture with an accredited company and operate under the partner's scheme accredited systems. As well as reducing barriers to entry, this change will assist builders to experience best practice safety approaches. A new risk based compliance model will be introduced to better target audit resources at companies requiring support, while reducing the compliance burden for high-performing companies. These measures are expected to lead to savings of $9.7 million in the first year in compliance costs. 


One other example—and this one is somewhat reminiscent of an episode of Yes, Minister—is that these bills will also abolish the Fishing Industry Policy Council, which, astonishingly, has never met since being established in 1991. After 23 years of inactivity, largely because successive governments have had a policy of direct industry consultation, it is definitely time to disband this body. Similarly, the Product Stewardship Advisory Group and the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council will both be replaced by direct industry consultation. These are just a few examples; other speakers in this debate have outlined some of the many others.


The bottom line is that our government will continue to work its way through the tangle of red tape and regulation in order to deliver cost savings, which ultimately result in more efficient government and more productive business and not-for-profit sectors. This will improve competitiveness, help create more jobs and also lower household costs—which is great news for my constituents on the southern Gold Coast, as it is for all Australians. I commend these bills to the House.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:22):  As long as night follows day there will always be regulations in our society. Whether you work for the public sector, the private sector or for a not-for-profit organisation, you will not escape bureaucracy and you will not escape regulation. That is the reality of business and it is the reality of government. I see the parliamentary secretary in here and I know it is his mission to make it less of a reality and to provide the necessary avenues to enable business to get on with business.


I do not make this statement as a means to criticise either concept, because each has its place and plays an important role in reviewing the work of individual employees and businesses or government markets as a whole, while holding those who do not meet the required standards to account. But while some regulation and bureaucracy is essential for best practice, this government has found thousands of pieces of unnecessary regulation across all government portfolios, and they are strangling the ability of both government and business to work effectively and efficiently. For every piece of unnecessary legislation, hundreds of valuable hours, depending on the size of the business or the department, are wasted every year in employees' time filling in unnecessary and often duplicative administrative paperwork, costing productivity and therefore profit margins much more.


Of course, members in this place know and businesses know that when you hear the word 'regulation' the first word that comes to mind is 'Labor'. As a businessman of 25 years in industry, one of the things I knew, and all businesses knew, was that when the Liberals got in, business was enabled; and when Labor got in, business was disabled. We just had to live in that cycle. That is what the parliamentary secretary has recognised and he has made it his mission to make sure that small business, particularly in Australia, is enabled.


Throughout history, every time the Labor Party has formed government it has systematically destroyed our economy by cash-splashing on ill-informed policies—policies that I can simply highlight: the mining tax, which those opposite could not manage to raise any revenue from, and the carbon tax, which increased costs for every business and household across Australia. These two taxes alone constituted 29 different acts and 1,625 pages of additional burdensome regulation and legislation. They are both gone now: gone from this place and gone from the Australian economy.


This government has promised to cut $1 billion in red tape each year, and the only thing those opposite spent their time doing was imposing onerous red and green tape on businesses who had much better things to do than waste their time and their money filling in duplicative administrative paperwork that benefited no-one. Members in this place know that while Labor has been incapable of supporting business productivity throughout history, no Labor government had ever before reached the level of incessant failure that was seen under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Twenty-one thousand pieces of additional regulation: that is the only legacy those opposite can claim. I remember back in 2007 when I ran in that campaign, it was one in, one out and it certainly did not happen once those 21,000 regulations came in from the Labor government during that period of time. I think it was about one to 104—104 in and one out. That is a legacy that I would be embarrassed about, and I would not be standing in this place trying to justify it—as we have seen from every Labor speaker who has spoken on these bills.


On this side of the chamber there are former business operators, fine men and women who understand business. They understand the economy and they understand that where money and time is wasted, it costs Australia's economy as a whole.


I know that the member for Robertson is dying to speak on this bill. I congratulate the parliamentary secretary on the great job he is doing in repealing legislation and regulation in Australia to enable business. I commend these bills to the House and welcome the next speaker.

Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (17:26):  I rise to support this very important second red-tape repeal day and, in doing so, commend these bills to the House, because lifting the burden of red tape and regulation will make life easier for residents and businesses on the Central Coast. 


Let me give you some examples in the time remaining. For individuals in my electorate of Robertson, we have made it easier for them to get in touch with government services by simply creating a myGov account. With the click of a button there is a centralised online point of access. I understand that more than five million people have already registered. In fact, one of the people to sign up recently was Nicholas Staniford from Killcare, who has told me how much easier it is to have everything in the one place and how he does not need to have several different websites with different passwords. We are also enabling people to complete their tax returns faster. The online myTax system will save over 1.4 million taxpayers nearly $160 million a year in compliance costs by pre-populating their tax returns. Another local resident, Leon Manuela, who is 22 years of age and lives in Tascott, said that for many young people on the Central Coast it has made doing their tax a lot less stressful.


The electorate of Robertson is home to many high quality and innovative aged-care providers. With nearly 20 per cent of my electorate in the over-65 age cohort—the seventh-highest in the country—aged-care care providers are an integral part of our community. So, on this important red-tape repeal day, I am pleased to say that we have removed the requirement to notify the department of any changes in key personnel within 28 days of the change. Instead, providers will only need to tell the department about a change of circumstances that materially affects the provider's suitability to provide care. Jennifer Eddy, the Chief Executive Officer of Woy Woy Community Aged Care, advised me that far too much time has been spent with excessive and inconsistent reporting and duplication of information to government departments and this is taking time away from the key role of delivering care to residents. Jennifer said that people looking at aged-care services are becoming more discerning because of the cost, which makes it even more important that aged-care services have the time to provide quality care.


It is a similar situation for small businesses, which are the engine room of our economy, particularly on the Central Coast. So to help businesses focus on what they do best, we have removed the requirement to lodge a business activity statement for 32,000 businesses where no GST is payable. A further 447,000 businesses with minimal income are now exempt from pay-as-you-go requirements. Many people living on the peninsula will know Bremen Patisserie at Umina Beach. I dare say many from around Australia will know of Ron and the family business, because last year they were the national award winner for gourmet pies in the Great Aussie Pie Competition. Ron's success as a small-business owner speaks for itself. Still, because of the need to stay on top of the red tape and regulation, his wife Helga stays up from 9 pm to l am to complete book work and paperwork. It is not an easy job for anyone, but especially not for a business that starts baking at the crack of dawn. That is why this government is working to lift this burden by having two repeal days every year to tear up unnecessary regulation. We have heard the voice of the community and they agree with us too. Many of these repeals were actually suggested by people, and also business and community groups, and I commend the bills to the House.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:30):  It is a great privilege to provide the summing up to these repeal day bills that we have been debating today: the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 and the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014. I thank members on this side of the House who contributed to the debate—the member for Robertson, the member for Swan, the member for Grey, the member for Forde, the member for Bradfield, the member for Dobell, the member for McPherson, the member for Mitchell, the member for Macquarie, the member for Durack, the member for Hughes and the member for Lyons—and members on the deregulation committee on the coalition side: the members for Reid, Bass, Ryan, Deakin, Hindmarsh and Pearce. In every case members on this side of the House gave constructive, concise and comprehensive speeches about why deregulation is important for the future of this country and the health of our economy. We on this side of the House know that cutting red tape matters. It matters to the lives of individuals, the lives of families, the lives and work of small businesses and of course the lives and operation of the not-for-profit sector.


The Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill will make accessing our law easier. The statute law revision bill will improve the usability and accessibility of our legislation. The omnibus repeal day bill will see, just like the Commission of Audit tasked us to do, the abolition of bodies that are no longer required. The Fishing Industry Policy Council, the Product Stewardship Advisory Group and the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council will all now be abolished. We will also allow ACMA to publish their changes using online services by making amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. Fuel suppliers and producers around this country will now no longer have to go through the additional requirement of submitting an extra annual report to the Department of the Environment, given that they are already putting in monthly reports.


As we heard from the member for Robertson, aged-care sector processes will be streamlined, thanks to the great work of the member for Menzies, the Minister for Social Services, who is sitting at the dispatch box here. He has ensured that key personnel are not required to phone when there is a change among the many aged-care providers of this country. They are not required to make a phone call to the federal department to say that a nurse has been hired or fired. Last year there were 10,000 such calls. We now will no longer need that red-tape requirement.


There are significant changes in these three bills that we have brought on for debate and will vote on now, but they are just a small part of the more than 400 individual measures that we have outlined as part of our repeal day process, with the first repeal day in March and the second now on 29 October. Let me give the headline number—the achievement that the member for Watson hates to hear. We have been responsible for $2.1 billion worth of compliance savings. From agriculture to education, from health to human services and from trade to Treasury we have been responsible for significant red tape cuts right across the economy.


And it matters. That is why groups like ACCI, the Business Council of Australia, Universities Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Minerals Council of Australia have applauded the coalition for taking deregulation seriously. Those opposite did nothing, despite the pious words from the then member for Griffith, who told us that red tape was out of control. They did nothing but twiddle their thumbs and give us 21,000 additional regulations, tying up the small business people of Australia in red and green tape. Now they have the hide to come into this place and criticise us for making important reforms. On the one hand they say that these are trivial changes and are part of the normal course of business—we are fixing punctuation: full stops and commas—but on the other hand the member for Fraser goes out in print in The Australian saying, 'You are taking away important protections in the financial services sector and you are making some important changes that we do not like in the charities and not-for-profit sector,' when we are getting rid of duplication. You cannot have it both ways.


Why didn't you come up with a proposal to streamline the Comcare scheme and allow companies around Australia who operate in multiple jurisdictions to self-insure under the Comcare scheme? Why didn't you come up with the one-stop shop approval process? Labor states have joined with coalition states in signing onto our one-stop shop, worth $426 million a year in savings. Why didn't you come up with the changes to the Do Not Call Register, which will see more than nine million Australians no longer having to renew their membership of the Do Not Call Register? Why didn't you come up with the changes to the NBN? We are no longer mandating Australian homes have a big, bulky, expensive battery backup because we know that most Australian homes now have a mobile phone. Why don't you accept that we came up with this first and that we have the stomach and the fortitude to make changes in deregulation where you guys patently failed?


When Craig Emerson was the Minister for Small Business he said, 'We are taking giant scissors to red tape' and those giant scissors led to an additional 21,000 regulations.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  A giant printing press.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  There was a giant printing press, thank you very much, Minister. We have actually made significant changes. The competitiveness paper which was released just a couple of weeks ago had a landmark change. That landmark change was that we will now accept into Australia product systems and services where they have been approved already by trusted international jurisdictions. And the regulators in this country, whether it is the APVMA, whether it is NICNAS or whether it is the TGA, will only add an extra layer of regulation when there is a proven need to do so.


We had the CEO of Cochlear, Chris Roberts, come out publicly and say this will make a major difference to the operation of his business. The member for Longman, from his own electorate, brought the wonderful example of a company that produces cricket balls and footballs made out of leather. They need to bring in a leather measuring and cutting machine from Italy but then they have to pay $3,000 for that machine to be accredited. Why is that the case? If it has been approved in Italy and Europe is a trusted international jurisdiction, there has to be a very good reason why it cannot automatically be brought into the Australian system. Why does an importer from Europe of commercial cooking equipment that goes to the hospitality and tourism sectors and to the aged care sector have to pay $12,000 per machine to get it accredited in Australia? It is just an extra layer of cost which is then passed on to the consumer.


We have come up with a system and with new processes to bed down this new deregulation agenda. Ministers now have established deregulation units. Ministers have now appointed ministerial advisory committees to advise them on the key areas to cut regulation. We have changed the KPIs for senior public servants to align their best interests with our best interests and the public's best interests—namely, cutting red tape. We have assigned two days of the parliamentary timetable to just cutting red tape. We have set ourselves a target of a billion dollars a year as a net target. It is a big target. We are now $2.1 billion—a number that the member for Watson hates to hear.




Mr McCormack:
  How much?




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  It is $2.1 billion. We tasked the Productivity Commission to come up with a framework for auditing the performance of the regulators, which is now finalised and was released earlier today. It is very significant when we have 150 regulators at the Commonwealth level including major ones like the ATO, ASIC, APRA, ACMA and others much smaller like the Office of Gene Technology or the Passports Office or the like. These are all extremely significant changes and they are changes that are making people's interaction with government that much easier through the myGov and the MyTax site and they are reducing the overall compliance base.


It will be interesting to see whether the member for Watson and those opposite support changes to the corporations law, which will no longer allow 100 shareholders to call a special general meeting of a company like Woolworths, which has over 400,000 shareholders. One hundred shareholders can still put an issue on the agenda at a major special general meeting but they should not be allowed to call a special general meeting in itself. It is a measure which has been warmly received by the business community and will be a test for those opposite to see how job friendly and business friendly they really are.


I could go on. We have made extremely good progress in just the year we have been at the helm. We have got legislation through the Senate and we have banked reforms. Our first omnibus bill went through the Senate, our changes to the agricultural chemicals went through the Senate, our changes around classification went through the Senate, our changes around the future of financial advice went through the Senate and we are hopeful to get our one-stop shops through the Senate shortly. We have banked a lot of reforms that we have already announced but we still have a long way to go.


I want to thank the minister, for example, in job services, who made a very significant reform to ensure that there is less paperwork for job service providers—an incredible reform. To all the cabinet ministers, all the junior ministers and all the parliamentary secretaries who have made extremely significant reforms, we are very grateful. Most of all, can I think the Prime Minister because the Prime Minister has led this agenda. The Prime Minister himself has taken responsibility for the deregulation agenda by making it a standing item at COAG meetings, by driving change with his fellow premiers and chief ministers and by ensuring that his ministers and his Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet maintain the momentum that we currently have to cut red tape.


I also thank the senior members of the public service in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all the deregulation units in the other portfolios and officers of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel who were responsible for drafting this legislation. This has been a team effort from start to finish.


I must tell you, the finish line is a long way away because the Productivity Commission has estimated that four per cent of GDP at least is tied up in red tape and compliance. Deloittes put out a report saying one million Australians are involved in the compliance sector. Clearly, this is too much. This has to change and, on this side of the House, we are determined to do it. These bills today are extremely important and are just one step along the way to cutting 1,000 pieces of regulation legislation and removing over 7,200 pages from the statute books, giving us a headline figure of $2.1 billion if we combine repeal day 1 and repeal day 2.


This is an important day for the parliament. This is an important day for the families, the businesses and the not-for-profits of the country and for the farmers of this country, who tell us that one dollar in every six dollars that they take at the farm gate is taken up in compliance. This is an important step in freeing up our economy ensuring we have higher productivity, growth, innovation, entrepreneurship and, most importantly of all, that we have more jobs for Australians today and into the future. I commend these bills to the House.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (16:19):  The Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014 is the second introduced by the government this year. The parliament has introduced such bills with regularity since 1934. They are, as the Bills Digest notes, a matter of 'housekeeping'. These bills correct drafting errors, update cross-references and remove spent or obsolete provisions. These bills serve a worthy purpose—they maintain the tidiness of the statute book. This is an ongoing task for this and other parliaments.


But this is not bold deregulatory reform; it is routine work undertaken by all modern governments. Among other things, this bill fixes an incorrect cross-reference in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994; closes a bracket in 474.258(2) of the Criminal Code; corrects the spelling of 'laminated' in a schedule to the Customs Tariffs Act 1995, which presently reads 'laminiated'; and removes a comma from the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, but adds a full stop to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.


The bill inserts gender-neutral language into two acts. I certainly thank the government for this. It has quite rightly been the policy of Commonwealth drafters to use gender-neutral language since 1984. I am genuinely very pleased to see that the Attorney-General has not taken the lead of his LNP counterpart in Queensland, who has recently and controversially returned to gender-specific language in legislation, restructuring the Crime and Misconduct Commission. The use of 'chairman' over 'chairperson' is probably the least of the problems of Queenslanders under Attorney-General Bleijie, but I agree with the many lawyers and citizens in Queensland who have objected to this retrograde step. I thank the Commonwealth Attorney-General for sticking to proper modern drafting practice in this regard.


This bill makes other sundry changes. In a number of acts it replaces the antiquated legal term 'servant' with its modern equivalent 'employee'. Again, this is an uncontroversial drafting point, which the Acts Interpretation Act makes clear is of no substantive legal effect. The bill restructures the Veterans' Entitlements Act for better readability. Again, all of this is worthy. None of it is groundbreaking. This bill is not in any sense 'deregulation'. The inclusion of this routine piece of housekeeping in the government's repeal day stunt beggars belief. It is routine housekeeping which has been the practice of the Australian parliament since the first Statute Law Revision Act in 1934. It has been the practice of the United Kingdom parliament since 1861. It is not novel and certainly not some grand act of deregulation. This bill will not reduce in any measurable way the regulatory burden on any Australian business. It will not remove or streamline any operative regulation. That the government would try to dress this bill up into a grand political gesture shows this government's lack of substance.


The Amending Act Repeal Bill, which is also before the House, follows on from the Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Act introduced in the government's last 'repeal day' stunt in March. This bill repeals around 650 amending or repeal acts passed between 1970 and 1979. As the amendments or repeals have already taken place, the effect of these acts is spent. Section 7 of the Acts Interpretation Act makes clear that the repeal of an amending or repeal act does not undo its operation. This bill therefore has no effect on the operation of any law.


The explanatory memorandum to the bill claims the repeal of these acts is desirable in order to reduce the regulatory burden and make accessing the law simpler for both businesses and individuals. However, the explanatory memorandum also states that 'the repeal of these acts will not substantially alter existing arrangements or make any change to the substance of the law' and that there is 'no financial impact'. We do not argue with getting rid of regulations that are redundant, no longer enforced and not relevant. It is the same attitude we had while we were in government. We repealed over 16,000 acts, regulations and legislative instruments when we were in office.


Let us not pretend, however, that the removal of these 650 acts that is proposed in this bill does anything to 'reduce the regulatory burden' when the explanatory memorandum to the bill itself says 'the repeal of these acts will not substantially alter existing arrangements or make any change to the substance of the law'. Not a single piece of legislation repealed by this bill has any operation. All of the acts to be repealed have been inoperative for at least 35 years. They do not and cannot have any bearing on the needs of Australian businesses and individuals in 2014. 


We will not hear from anyone on the government side in this debate say how the repeal of the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Act 1977 or the repeal of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Amendment Act 1979 or the repeal of the National Fitness Amendment Act 1979 will affect businesses or individuals because the repeal makes no change at all to the substance of Australian law. This bill is nothing more than a stunt to allow the government to claim that it is cutting regulation while not saving any money or removing any operative regulation.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (16:25):  The Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 represents an unprecedented initiative of the government to cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year. This coalition government has gone further and more than doubled the target by announcing a net reduction of over $2.1 billion in compliance costs as a result of the 400 proposed measures. This repeal day is part of the coalition's plan to improve and strengthen our economy. 


The economic action strategy of this government is indeed making progress. The mining tax has gone and the carbon tax has gone. The government's repeal of the carbon tax and the mining tax has not only reduced cost-of-living pressures and helped create jobs but also saved families and businesses in reduced compliance costs. The budget is bringing expenditure down and restoring the economy after the debt and deficit disaster of the previous Labor government. And continuing on from the autumn repeal day 2014, we are taking scissors to inefficiency and dissolving impediments to thriving business and beneficial reform.


Today, I am pleased to join with the coalition government to introduce legislation to repeal nearly 1,000 pieces of unnecessary legislation and regulations. We are talking about considerably reducing regulatory impediments that are harmful to productivity, deter investment and cost jobs. The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index ranked Australia 124th out of 148 countries for 'burden of government regulation' for 2014. That simply is not good enough. The government is doing something about this.


The business and wider community have communicated for some time and it is very clear in the economy that there needs to be a significant reduction in regulation to improve Australia's productivity and competitiveness. Many of these cuts will benefit the electorate of Macquarie, which is a major region for infrastructure investment, emerging small business, the stunning environment and tourism. 


By creating public access to the centralised, online point of access for government services with the myGov account, we make possible a projected saving of $88 million per year. Five million Australians have so far created their myGov account. Similarly, the Australian Taxation Office's new online tax return service, myTax, will save over 1.4 million taxpayers $160 million a year in compliance costs by pre-populating tax returns. A one-stop shop for environmental approvals will save the community $426 million each year and provide an estimated economic gain of $120 billion over the next 12 years. An estimated 447,000 small businesses will benefit from a reduced tax compliance burden with administrative changes to GST and PAYG reporting. That is going to directly benefit small businesses in the electorate of Macquarie. Further, businesses with no GST payable will no longer be required to lodge a business activity statement, saving small businesses more than $67 million each year in compliance costs.


We are creating the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, a national advocate which will also assist in the development of small-business friendly laws and regulations. Small business people around Macquarie, particularly family based businesses, have told me their stories of attempting to make ends meet while struggling with red and green tape. This is why the Commonwealth government is working each day to remove the red tape burdens for small business. 


Following the autumn repeal day earlier this year, Jo Bromilow, President of the Blaxland and Districts Chamber of Commerce in my electorate of Macquarie, spoke positively about the optimism returning to small businesses as a result of removing the burden of unnecessary regulations. The chamber president highlighted how reducing the constant usage of paperwork allows small businesses to get on with the job of growing their business. 


Small businesses play a significant role in our local regional and national economies. Ms Bromilow said, 'It is already apparent that the optimism is returning to small businesses, which will lead on to employment growth and investment in this crucial area of the economy'. Jo Bromilow, as a distinguished and experienced small business manager in my electorate, understands the positive impacts of reducing the constant usage of paperwork and red tape. Ms Bromilow said it allows small businesses to move forward. We are committed to ensuring small businesses can do more to benefit consumers, their businesses and our economy.


The NBN rollout is moving into full swing within the electorate of Macquarie, and currently many residents in South Windsor and Bligh Park localities are making the transition, with Richmond soon to follow. NBN customers can opt not to have a battery backup installed in their home or business, as many customers can use their mobile phone or generator during a power blackout, saving $21.1 million in compliance costs. 


Local clubs and organisations registered as a company limited by guarantee in my electorate of Macquarie—who do so much for the community—and make less than $1 million in revenue, will no longer require an auditor. This was previously required even though audited financial reports were not. 


There simply is not the time to list all that is being done with this bill today or all of the direct benefits for business, local organisations and the community at large. Continuing on from the repeal of over 9,500 regulations and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation on the 2014 autumn repeal day—the largest bulk repeal in Australia's history—the government is repealing a further 256 regulations. This will do away with over $700 million of compliance costs. That is $700 million of taxpayers' money that can be reallocated elsewhere: to assist and grow small businesses, to grow tourism in the region, to invest in greater and increased infrastructure, and to help local organisations and communities to prosper. I am pleased to commend the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 to the House.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (16:33):  I rise to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. Australia has been blessed. We have achieved an economic position in the world, built on good fortune, hard effort and a good economic platform built by successive good governments—the Hawke-Keating years and the Howard government. It was supported, at least in the Hawke-Keating years, by a reformist opposition with an eye to the future and what was in Australia's best interest. That is in contrast to where we sit today. The Rudd-Gillard years by comparison not only lacked any agenda to increase productivity; it unwound many of the reforms of the previous 20 years.


Disturbingly, the World Economic Forum tells us that Australia has slipped to 124 out of 148 countries on the burden of regulation table. That is a disgrace. It is a clear illustration of why Australia is losing the manufacturing industry out of Australia today. We are losing projects on a world-wide scale because we have lost our competitive edge. The previous government, the Labor government, in just three years—2010 to 2013—introduced 21,000 new regulations. I am not sure if this is a new record but I certainly hope so and I hope it is not one that is repeated soon. 


Last year we had our first repeal day; 10,000 acts and regulations gone—that was 50,000 pages. What an achievement. This time it is 1,000 acts and regulations abolished—7,200 pages and, in total, more than $2 billion worth of compliance burden. For me—one who has railed against stifling regulations—it is an exciting time. It is almost an 'Empire strikes back' moment. It is great to see the little guy get a chance to breathe. 


Almost instantly when I walk in the door of a small business, the first thing they tell me—after we say, 'How are you going?' and 'Good morning'—is: 'You have to get the red-tape monkey off our back. We are being strangled by red tape, paperwork, workforce compliance, workforce policies—for almost every conceivable occurrence, no matter how remote the possibility—tax compliance, industry compliance.' I have met truckies who are dazed and confused by loading regulations, driver management rules—sometimes policed by zealots who think the country can run without trucks. I have heard from television aerial installers—this is a good one—who are now no longer able to use a ladder to climb on to a roof unless it is tied at the top. Don't ask me how they are supposed to tie a ladder at the top without climbing the ladder in the first instance. The list goes on and on and, depressingly, on.


So today is instalment 2 of a government finally having a red-hot go at trying to get the red-tape monkey off the back of the citizens of Australia. Huge numbers of useless acts and regulations will be going out the door today, delivering $1.2 billion worth of savings. For instance, the one-stop shop for environmental controls will save $426 million upfront. Even more importantly, it is expected that over the next 12 years we will deliver $120 billion worth of benefit to Australia. 


For agriculture—an industry I am vitally interested in—improvements to the farm management deposits, implementing the mandatory port access code, and getting rid of a duplicated cattle-tagging system are just a start, but they will all help.


With simplified documents, there is a huge range of issues covered: simplified documents for marriage certificates, a choice as to whether a consumer has a battery back-up on the premises for a fibre-to-the-node connection to the National Broadband Network, e-tendering for defence supply contracts and simplified paperwork for Job Service Providers all provide savings and efficiencies to individuals, business and government, as will speeding up Export Finance Insurance Corporation approvals and PBS medication charts for public hospitals will save $40 million. These are big figures. 


The myGov site will make life easier for welfare recipients and save $88 million, and people will be able to lodge their tax returns on this site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Simplified import permits for defence procurement will save $27 million. Getting rid of the red tape in the VET sector will save $30 million. The government will be reforming the apprenticeship support schemes, aligning state and federal gambling regulation and PAYG thresholds will be adjusted. Better cooperation with the US on tax arrangements will yield $58 million. Duplication for reporting of charities will be reduced. Efic will be simplified and be able to underwrite all supplies and not just capital equipment.


The list goes on but I will hone in on one issue that is of particular interest to me, and that is the move to harmonise Australian design rules with other developed nations' procedures. Last year, I sat on the agriculture committee inquiry into the legislation to amend the Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals Act. The bill—in the previous government's eyes at least—was aimed to improve efficiency but in fact added considerable cost and regulatory burden to the sector. This government, since that time, has unwound that legislation. But, during the debate, it was made clear to me that Australia faces all kinds of issues in the registration of chemicals for agricultural use in Australia. We think of ourselves as big food producers when in fact we are medium to small food producers. We are big exporters of certain products like wheat, barley, sugar and cotton—even though you do not eat that of course. You may, but it may not be very good for you!


We are big exporters, but we are not a significant market for many other commodities. So when you get a chemical that is registered internationally it costs a lot of money to get it registered in Australia for relatively small markets. As a result of this, Australian farmers are not always accessing the best chemicals on the market. This move that starts to recognise other countries' assurance systems, their registration systems, is a great move for us. It is not in this agvet area yet, but this is one of the things that I will be pursuing, because I believe it is in our benefit. The world is a place that seems to be decreasing in size. We are increasingly linked to our trading partners. We should be recognising each other's standards in the way we do business and in the way we register products. With that, I will commend the bill. I will just point out that this government has commenced this tough job. In contrast to the last six years, where Labor gave us more regulation, more government, more red tape and more strangulation of the economy, it is a breath of fresh air.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (16:40):  It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. This is another example of this government following up on its election commitments and it follows on our efforts on the autumn repeal day back in March. Fittingly, this spring omnibus repeal day gives us the opportunity to continue the job of the spring-clean of red tape and regulation in our economy. We made a commitment at the last election to cut over $1 billion in red and green tape and with this bill we are continuing to deliver on that commitment. In fact, the reality is that we are more than doubling our commitment by a reduction of over $2.1 billion in red and green tape costs to our economy. With our March repeal bill we repealed some 10,000 pieces of regulation and some 50,000 pages of legislation, removing some $700 million of compliance costs.


This is the first time ever that we have had the two repeal days in the one year. You might ask why this is important. It is important because we need to deregulate to free up the productive sectors of our economy to achieve and grow for the future benefit of this country. This is important because the previous government left us a legacy of red tape and regulation by introducing more than 21,000 additional regulations. In addition to that, there were over 80 examples of noncompliance or exemption from regulatory impact statements in those legislative processes. As a result of the inaction towards reduction of red tape and green tape by the previous government in the years from 2007, multifactor productivity declined by some three per cent.


It is worth noting that in the Financial Review today there was an article about a report that has been released by Deloitte Access Economics, and I will quote from that. It is titled 'Red-tape staff cost $250 billion' and it reads:


A growing thicket of business red tape is creating a new class of workers devoted solely to complying with rules and regulations, potentially costing the economy more than $250 billion a year.


Deloitte Access Economics reveals more than one in    11 Australians are now employed in compliance jobs such as office managers, inspectors, public relations and occupational health jobs.


So it is no wonder we have seen that decline in productivity. This is despite the promise by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, in 2007 of a one regulation in, one regulation out policy and the then small business minister, Mr Emerson, saying in 2008 that Labor would 'take a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small business'. I would suggest you, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, that those scissors went well and truly missing during their term in office and it has taken a coalition government to pull them out of the cupboard, dust them off, sharpen them up and get stuck into the job of reducing red tape and regulation in our economy. 


A number of speakers have already focused on the important needs of small business. Why is that? It is because 94 per cent of all businesses in Australia based on turnover, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, are small businesses. They also make up 99 per cent of the some 816,000 employing businesses in Australia. They employ approximately 4.5 million Australians, or 43 per cent of the private sector workforce. Interestingly, this is down seven per cent on what it was prior to the election of the previous Labor government. This government has made it well and truly clear over the past 12 months or so, and even prior to that, the importance of small business to our economy and to employment, growth and innovation. Part of the process of this repeal of red tape and regulation is to ensure that we free up that productive and innovative capacity in our economy.


The Productivity Commission has also estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP, further identifying importance of going ahead with our deregulation agenda. What is interesting is that if you take the figures from this Deloitte Access Economics report, the reality is that red tape and regulation, both the government level and in the corporate sector, could amount to as high as 15 per cent of gross domestic product. What an enormous drag on our economy.


As with other activities already undertaken by this government, including getting rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax, we are continuing well down the road on our deregulatory agenda. Just briefly in summary, some of the things we have looked at is minimising and simplifying the interaction with government; reducing regulatory obligations and reporting requirements; fuelling economic growth by a one stop shop for environmental approvals based on agreements with every state and territory that alone is estimated to save some $426 million; and making it easier to provide direct finance to our exporters, where we generate an enormous amount of our national wealth.


There are also a number of common sense reforms: Australia were now accept products, systems and services that have been approved overseas under trusted international standards or risk assessments; NBN customers will be able to opt out of having a battery backup installed in their home; the extension of the Do Not Call Register is now indefinite—people will not have to renew at every eight years; beef producers exporting to the European Union will no longer have to tag their cattle with additional tags; for those who love to ride motorcycles—not that I am one of those—they will no longer require a modification to be fitted with an Australia-specific rear mudguard, bringing Australia into line with United Kingdom, France and Germany. That alone is estimated to save the motorcycle industry some $14.4 million in compliance on manufacturing costs. Local clubs and organisations registered as a company limited by guarantee with revenue of less than $1 million will no longer require an auditor where that has been previously required, even though audited financial reports were not.


This omnibus bill I highly commend to the House, as it continues to pursue the deregulatory agenda that this government has set out to free our economy up to be productive, innovative and grow for the future benefit of all Australians.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (16:49):  It is great pleasure that I rise to speak on these repeal provisions. Upon reading them a phrase sprung to mind, which is one of those few lovely phrases from Latin at creeps into the law and that you actually remember. The phrase is: 'de minimis non curat lex', which means, in effect, that the law does not concern itself with trifles. In legal principle it essentially means that the law will not usually remedy the injury of an immensely minor type, nor will it make continuous judgements in respect of what are contextually very minor issues. That is a particularly helpful principle to govern the conduct of the law, but it is a terrible principle to govern the conduct of economies.


Having watched this debate occur twice now on two separate repeal days, I must say I have been somewhat surprised by the very strident negative approach taken by members opposite.




Ms MacTiernan:
  No, it is that you are dressing it up!




Mr PORTER:
  It is something that most people seem to agree is a very good thing, so we have a range of very strong endorsements outside of this place for the agenda. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australia's largest and most representative business organisation, strongly supports the government's initiative to cut red tape and undertake legislative repeal days. Repeal days just like this one. The basis—as the member for Perth in her very casual and low-key way noted by interjection!—of Labor's surprisingly strident opposition is essentially twofold. The first is that what is contained in this swathe of repeal legislation is just too minor to be bothered with. The Manager of Opposition Business said things such as 'so much hype over so little'. He described it as 'vacuuming the spare room that nobody walks into anyway'. Of course, this was a theme continued by the member for Isaacs, to the effect that all this does is do things that governments usually do, which is to repeal, remove or fix very, very minor problems in legislative instruments. Of course, that is part but only part of what is being done. The only other argument being offered by Labor is, to the extent that there is anything important in this, they did it anyway and did it as a matter of routine. I will address that second argument in a moment.


With regard to this notion that all that is being done is minor, it simply does not bear proper scrutiny when you actually look at what is happening here. The fact is that, yes, there are some matters which would be described as de minimis, and you have got regulatory wolves in this menagerie. You have rats and mice and you even have a few fleas. The member for Isaacs spent many minutes concentrating on the fleas, but the fact is that there are some very significant savings and changes which will help business across Australia. In the first tranche of reforms we had the incredibly substantive removal of a singularly damaging piece of duplication in the environmental sphere. Having a situation where you can have the regulatory assessment of environmental matters according to state legislation and the federal version of that legislation done at one time by one organisation will save $426.3 million a year. That falls certainly into the category of a regulatory wolf or maybe even a tiger: something that is terribly damaging and dangerous to the economy. Then in this tranche of repeals we have other very important matters. The idea now that Australian business will be able to accept products, systems and services that are approved overseas under a trusted international standard or risk assessment is going to be a very significant plus for business.


But, yes, in amongst all of this there are many other smaller, more modest changes, but the point about regulation is that it is the cumulative effect of the regulation that has to be constantly and continually tackled. We are tackling here both the big-ticket items and the composite and cumulative effects of all the minutia which in its cumulation causes immense difficulties. Labor's position seems to be this: there is no point, and we should roundly criticise the person who removes the barnacles from the hull because the things are just so small. But the point is the cumulative effect of all the things that are being done here has a reverberatory effect throughout the economy. There is also the fact that there are some very major and big-ticket items that are being removed.


I will address the second point of Labor's argument—which is completely inconsistent with their first—which is that none of this is really worth doing to any extent but, to the extent that it is, Labor did it anyway. The fact remains that there is probably one genuinely bipartisan measure that both parties have said is a good measure of the regulatory burden, and that is provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It looks at regulatory and economic burdens and failures across a range of categories in 144 countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit said that, looking at 144 countries across the world, when you look at the burden for government regulation, when the Howard government finished its term in office Australia was 60th out of 144 on the burden of government regulation. After Labor's time in office we had sunk to 96th out of 144 on the burden of government regulation.


The question begs: if Labor did all this and their deregulatory agenda was so fine, so good and achieved so much with so little fanfare, why was their performance on the best possible measure so terrible? Why did we slip from 60th in the world on the regulatory burden of government to 96th over their period in government? The answer must surely be that they simply did not do enough and that their attitude and culture around these things was not strong enough. That has been very significantly repaired by this government and by the parliamentary secretary, who is doing a very fine job.

"Price, Melissa, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (16:56):  I am very pleased to rise today to speak on this bill, which I and I think many others in this House today believe is important to constituents Australia-wide who seek to reduce the burden and cost of regulation—and that is all of us, including those opposite, I am sure. The Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 is a whole-of-government initiative to amend and repeal legislation in a number of areas.


Today we have heard the other side say there is no value in this bill. I say they have not looked very hard to find that value. If they had done so, they would have noticed a whole raft of amendments. The bill deals with generally benign measures—yes, we agree with that—in order to reduce the regulatory imposition on business, individuals and the community sector, but there are many other, more substantive matters as well. The repeal will make regulation easily accessible, meaning business, individuals and community organisations can spend more time doing what is important for them and less time trawling through regulation and some of its more ridiculous demands.


The omnibus bill deals with a wide range of legislation, in many cases repealing legislation which is no longer relevant, in approximately nine areas. We have seen amendments in the areas of agriculture, immigration and border protection, industry, Treasury, veterans' affairs—even the Prime Minister and Cabinet area gets a haircut. I have a particular focus and objective in recognising and assisting small business to reduce costs and the regulatory burden and to increase efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. We all know that, when small business is not focused on regulation, it can spend more time on business itself.


This government is determined to be a smaller, less interfering government, and this latest reduction in red tape is moving us all in the right direction, especially for the business community. The government does not run small businesses. It has a responsibility to provide the right legislative environment to help improve the business community, not be a hindrance, not be a blocker but be an enabler.


I would like to focus a little on some of the improvements for the small business sector, and it is pleasing to see the Minister for Communications sitting in the House today, because communications is one area I would like to focus on. Schedule 2 will amend legislation in the communications portfolio to streamline statutory consultation and publication requirements and repeal spent provisions. Part 1 deals with the provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that are redundant now and say that the SBS undertakes television production and supply previously undertaken by the National Indigenous Television Ltd Part 2 will deal with provisions in the communications portfolio requiring rule makers to consult before making certain legislative instruments. This is all very sensible and noncontroversial. Simply, there is a reduced requirement to consult, impacting small business in the communications sector and removing a requirement for ACMA to publish notices in the Gazette; rather, they may use their website, making notification quicker for entities and speeding things up, thereby creating efficiencies and reducing costs.


Now let us have a quick look at the environment. The schedule will repeal and amend provisions in the acts administered in the environment portfolio, making technical amendments to streamline regulatory arrangements. Two items which will reduce the burden for small business are as follows: removing the requirement for duplicate approvals when moving hazardous waste through Australia—hardly rats and mice, I would say—and enabling information relating to the export of hazardous waste to be published on a website rather than the onerous, old-fashioned paper publication requirement. This will remove a compliance burden for hazardous waste exporters. Other items will ensure hazardous waste permit processing can be done more efficiently, reducing the cost to business. With respect to social services, a notable change is the lower reporting requirements for aged-care providers. This will be extremely well received and is welcome.


A little bit about Durack: we all know that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy, and I am committed to reducing red tape in the sector. The Productivity Commission released in its report in 2013 some commentary on small business that is worth repeating here today:


Small businesses feel the burden of regulation more strongly than other businesses. Almost universally, their lack of staff, time and resources present challenges in understanding and fulfilling compliance obligations.


… … …


Australian studies have found that small businesses spend, on average, up to 5 hours per week on compliance with government regulatory requirements and deal with an average of six regulators per year.


The omnibus bill will have a positive impact on more than 13,500 small businesses in my electorate of Durack which includes the Kimberley, the Pilbara, Gascoyne, the Midwest and the northern wheat belt. Do not forget, many businesses in remote and regional areas of Durack are owner operated, one-person shows. Most of the towns in Durack have commerce or small business organisations and wherever I go in my massive electorate the message is always the same: 'Get rid of the compliance; get rid of the impediments. Help us make ends meet and get customers coming through the doors.' I met with small business organisations recently in Moora and Merredin; and also with John Lally, CEO of Karratha District Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Rob Jefferies, CEO of the Mid West Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Geoff Herbert, President of the Onslow Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They are all concerned with the current requirements on small business and look forward to a reduction of unnecessary red tape.


It is absolutely essential to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia; we have heard that a lot. It is essential to strengthen our rural and regional communities, which of course is our policy. Today we are working at removing nearly 1,000 pieces of legislation and regulation as part of this spring repeal day. 


To finish off, here are a couple of quotes from people who have an interest in this matter. The CEO of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, Deidre Willmott, who is well known in government circles and well informed on the burden on business of overregulation, says:


Western Australian business owners are amongst the cleverest people going around, with a track record of world leading innovation. However, their ability to compete and succeed on a global scale is being hampered by the amount of time and energy they need to spend navigating convoluted, time consuming regulatory processes across multiple layers of government.


And one last quote from Reg Howard-Smith, who is the Chief Executive of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, who agrees:


The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia welcomes the Federal Government's attempts to repeal unnecessary red-tape and duplication.


In particular the resources sector urges all parliamentarians to support the one-stop-shop proposal for environmental approvals.


Despite concerns raised by environmental lobby groups, the one-stop-shop will not see a 'watering down' of environmental standards.


As someone who has worked in the mining industry for many years and has firsthand experience in navigating the torturous environmental approvals battlefield, I believe anything we as a government can do to reduce time frames and get projects off the ground is good for us all. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (17:04):  It gives me real pleasure to rise and speak on this bill, the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, and associated bills. I would like to associate my comments with all of those made on this side of the House today. The very varied contributions made by so many people illustrate the work that has gone into discovering those little things that are, as Christian Porter mentioned, the barnacles on the hull.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lyons knows to address members by their proper title.




Mr HUTCHINSON:
  I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker. They are indeed the barnacles on the hull of small business and of families. I do my best when I am travelling around an electorate that is not as big as the member for Durack's electorate but one which is, in the Tasmanian context, a large electorate; I try to listen to the small businesses and families that make up that electorate. The small businesses owners, and the employees within those small businesses, are not usually members of unions. That is perhaps one of the reasons why those opposite take so little interest in genuine attempts by this side of government to improve and remove the red tape that is literally suffocating small businesses all around Australia. The contribution from six years of Labor was 21,000 new regulations. It was going to be one in, one out; but 21,000 new pieces of red tape and regulation were introduced during the six years of the previous government.


Small business is indeed in our DNA. A local businessman said to me recently he is not sure that the community fundraising event he has been involved with for nearly 20 years will continue any longer. The event's organisers, all volunteers, have been struggling for several years with the increasing burden of red tape and mountains of applications and forms they now face to get this community event off the ground. Committee members have just about run out of time and energy for the paperwork. It will be red tape that sees many successful community events shut down.


One of my staffers was telling me recently about her 91-year-old father who happily and healthily lives on his own—except for the growing mountain of paperwork that faces him every time he attempts to seek out services to make his life a little easier. It is government getting involved with people's lives. On this side of the House, we want to get out of government; we want to be a small government. A hospital visit, for example, for a minor procedure required 20 or 30 pages of forms to fill out. A change to his Veterans' Affairs pension required 20 or 30 pages of questions to be answered, even though he had answered the questions before on a number of occasions.


We have all heard stories of regulations gone crazy so that we sometimes feel that we are being strangled by paperwork. That is why it is a wonderful thing that the government is doing for Australians with the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. This is the second such day, which we have promised will be twice-yearly events in parliament focused solely on reducing the compliance burden on individuals, businesses and the not-for-profit sector. I want to acknowledge the work done by all the federal government ministers in bringing to fruition this bill, which will amend and repeal legislation across nine portfolio areas, and the work done by parliamentary secretary Frydenberg to bring this all together. It is a work in progress, because we will not stop until duplication and unnecessary legislation is minimised. 


The government has announced more than 400 new measures to cut red tape across the board, from environment to education, health to human services, and Treasury to trade. We are honouring a promise to the Australian people made at the time of last year's election when we said we would cut red tape costs by $1 billion. I am pleased to stand here today and say that the repeal measures thus far will total over $2.1 billion net in compliance costs.


Today, in the second repeal day so far, the government introduces legislation to repeal nearly 1,000 pieces of legislation and regulations and 7,210 pages on the statute books. That is on top of the nearly 10,000 unnecessary or counterproductive regulations and 1,000 redundant acts of parliament that were removed on the government's first red tape repeal day in March this year. 


Some of the key reforms from this bill, which will directly benefit the constituents of my electorate of Lyons in Tasmania, include those to do with small business and also the aged-care sector. An estimated 447,000 small businesses nationally will benefit from a reduced tax compliance burden with administrative changes to GST and PAYG reporting. Businesses with no GST payable will no longer be required to lodge a BAS statement. These measures will save small business an estimated $67 million in red tape, which small business operators in Lyons will applaud. I look forward to hosting the Minister for Small Business Mr Billson in a few weeks on the east coast of Tasmania. I know the small business people in that part of my electorate are indeed looking forward to the minister's visit.


Aged-care providers will no longer be required to notify the Department of Social Services—and I note the minister is in the chamber—of key personnel changes unless changes materially affect the provider's suitability to provide care. 


Close to my heart are reforms to both the higher education sector and the agricultural sector. Universities are being saved $2.1 million in compliance costs by not being required to complete the Sustainable Research Excellence—SRE—staff hours survey to measure how university researchers balance their time between research and other activities over a two-week period; just pure bloody-mindedness. This was a ridiculous form of regulation, and its scrapping will be applauded by the University of Tasmania's staff, who are looking for ways to save costs. Instead, they can spend money on expanding student services.


Australian beef exporters exporting to the European Union, of whom there are many in my electorate, will no longer have to tag their cattle with lime green tail tags for the European Union Cattle Accreditation Scheme. The reason for this is that we have electronic tags now, and they have been in operation for many years. This will save beef farmers about half a million dollars a year—barnacles on the hull, indeed.


I congratulate my parliamentary colleagues, all of whom worked so hard to produce this common-sense round of reforms, and I commend the bill to the house. I would encourage those opposite, and I would be very interested to see whether the member for Indi and the member for Kennedy, who are most interested in agriculture, support this deregulation measures. The member for Denison must hear from the many small businesses in his electorate in my home state about the burdens that are imposed on small business. I encourage him to support these changes. The member for Fairfax is a businessman in his own right—we all know that—and I encourage him to support these measures as well. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (17:11):  I am pleased to rise on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and other associated bills. About a fortnight ago I attended the southern Sydney volunteer awards, where I was very proud to hand out the major prize on that day. Amongst the audience were many wonderful volunteers in our society. There were people who volunteered in lifesaving; in the Rural Fire Service; in aged care; and helping our kids with disabilities. On that day the overall prize winner for the best team of volunteers was a group called the form fillers. Their job, their volunteer service to our community, was to help people to fill out government forms. Out of all the valuable efforts of volunteers in our society that was considered the most important service that could be done in our local area. It was a team of 14 people. It is not to question or belittle the great work that they have done in any way but to raise the issue, the problem that we have in this nation—overburdensome government regulations and red tape.


To see the serious problem we have in this nation, we need look no further than the recent study on global competitiveness by the World Economic Forum. Out of 148 nations surveyed on the burden of government regulation, unbelievably, Australia was ranked 124th. So there are 123 other nations that have less burdensome government regulations than we have. The few nations that we were in front of included the Islamic Republic of Iran, which we tied with.


This is not something we should be laughing about, because this government regulation directly affects our economic prosperity and our wealth creation. During the recent MPI, we had members from the opposition coming in here and whinging about how there had been very low real wages growth. The reason for that is that we have not had the productivity increases. While we continue to burden our businesses, especially our small businesses, with more and more red tape, we prevent them from getting on with the job of creating wealth and creating those new businesses that drive our prosperity.


During this debate, I think we have seen perhaps the greatest evidence of the difference between our side and those opposite. The opposition have come in here and ridiculed this legislation. We know the record of the previous government. They used to boast about the number of regulations they had brought in. They actually thought it was a good thing that they brought in 21,000 new regulations. They thought this was wonderful. The simple difference is that the opposition, the modern day Labor Party, believe in central planning. If only they could get another team of government bureaucrats to go into that business to sort them out, to give them more red tape, things would be so much better! After six years of that, what have we seen? As this has always done throughout history, it has ended in tears. The unemployment queues in this nation are 200,000 people longer than when the previous Labor came to office. 


Thomas Jefferson perhaps said it best when he said: 'That government is best which governs least'—and that I agree with. Just look at the disaster we have had as a result of previous government intervention. There is a thing called Maudlin's law, which says that for every leftist piece of government law introduced in a hurry to try and address some perceived crisis or remedy there will be at least one or more unintended consequence that has an equal or greater negative effect. This is what we saw during the previous six years. We saw the mining tax, which was supposed to create this wonderful revenue, cost our ATO $50 million in just establishing the compliance requirements—and it hardly collected more than that. We saw the carbon tax, which was designed to lower pollution. But after the carbon tax was implemented, it actually increased air pollution in Western Sydney, my area, to above World Health Organisation standards. 


This is a very important piece of legislation before us. We must wind back the ever-growing burdensome obligations upon our business community, especially our small business community. We must have faith in them. We must free their hands to let them get on with the wealth creation that will drive the prosperity of this nation into the future. After all, as a nation, we now have to find $1 billion every single month, $33 million a day, just to pay the interest on the previous government's debt—and most of that goes overseas. We have to start clawing that back. The only way we can do it is by increasing the productivity of this nation, and that starts by this government reducing the burden of red tape that has been placed on our business community. I proudly commend the bill to the House.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (17:17):  I am pleased to add my voice to the many in support of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and related bills and to indicate my very strong backing for the government's commitment to cutting red tape. This package of Spring Repeal Day bills builds on the Autumn Repeal Day legislation and brings the total in red tape savings to $2.1 billion. This is more than double our election commitment to slash red tape by $1 billion.


Earlier this month, I hosted a number of listening posts throughout my electorate to talk with local residents directly about the things that matter most to them. Overwhelmingly, the underlying message is that they want the government to make things simpler, rather than more complicated. They want to be able to get on with their working lives, they want to run their business or they want to volunteer at the local charity or sporting club, without having to wade through paperwork and without having the burden of regulation to make simple tasks difficult.


During the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, members opposite used to brag about the amount of legislation that was passed through the House. Indeed, in just over five years, Labor managed to introduce around 21,000 new regulations—but so much of it was unnecessary. I am a firm believer in smaller government. There isn't time in today's debate to go into a philosophical debate about the role of government, but the notion of smaller government is at the heart of the coalition's policy approach. And I think everyone on this side of the House is excited about the fact that, while we are in office, there will be two sitting days every year dedicated to repealing the legislation and regulations that do not serve a positive purpose and that only add to the red tape which individuals, businesses and community groups have to deal with. This legislation will help ensure that, over time, the burden continues to be lifted and that we streamline the work of government into the future. What's more, the coalition is committed to a new approach with every piece of legislation or proposed regulation that we put forward. We must first ask: what is the purpose, cost, and impact on productivity of proposed initiatives before regulating? Only after these questions are answered and only when it is absolutely necessary will we proceed to regulate.


I did want to speak very briefly about the nature of the changes today. The Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 implements 38 measures across nine portfolios. The changes are diverse and give effect to a range of deregulation measures announced since the Autumn Repeal Day. Just one example is the implementation of the government's response to the Review of the Australian Government Building and Construction OHS Accreditation Scheme. The changes to the scheme include removing the costly and time-consuming requirement for builders to be certified to Australian Standard AS4801, or equivalent, prior to applying for scheme accreditation. Unaccredited builders will now have the opportunity to undertake Commonwealth funded building work where they are in a joint venture with an accredited company and operate under the partner's scheme accredited systems. As well as reducing barriers to entry, this change will assist builders to experience best practice safety approaches. A new risk based compliance model will be introduced to better target audit resources at companies requiring support, while reducing the compliance burden for high-performing companies. These measures are expected to lead to savings of $9.7 million in the first year in compliance costs. 


One other example—and this one is somewhat reminiscent of an episode of Yes, Minister—is that these bills will also abolish the Fishing Industry Policy Council, which, astonishingly, has never met since being established in 1991. After 23 years of inactivity, largely because successive governments have had a policy of direct industry consultation, it is definitely time to disband this body. Similarly, the Product Stewardship Advisory Group and the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council will both be replaced by direct industry consultation. These are just a few examples; other speakers in this debate have outlined some of the many others.


The bottom line is that our government will continue to work its way through the tangle of red tape and regulation in order to deliver cost savings, which ultimately result in more efficient government and more productive business and not-for-profit sectors. This will improve competitiveness, help create more jobs and also lower household costs—which is great news for my constituents on the southern Gold Coast, as it is for all Australians. I commend these bills to the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:22):  As long as night follows day there will always be regulations in our society. Whether you work for the public sector, the private sector or for a not-for-profit organisation, you will not escape bureaucracy and you will not escape regulation. That is the reality of business and it is the reality of government. I see the parliamentary secretary in here and I know it is his mission to make it less of a reality and to provide the necessary avenues to enable business to get on with business.


I do not make this statement as a means to criticise either concept, because each has its place and plays an important role in reviewing the work of individual employees and businesses or government markets as a whole, while holding those who do not meet the required standards to account. But while some regulation and bureaucracy is essential for best practice, this government has found thousands of pieces of unnecessary regulation across all government portfolios, and they are strangling the ability of both government and business to work effectively and efficiently. For every piece of unnecessary legislation, hundreds of valuable hours, depending on the size of the business or the department, are wasted every year in employees' time filling in unnecessary and often duplicative administrative paperwork, costing productivity and therefore profit margins much more.


Of course, members in this place know and businesses know that when you hear the word 'regulation' the first word that comes to mind is 'Labor'. As a businessman of 25 years in industry, one of the things I knew, and all businesses knew, was that when the Liberals got in, business was enabled; and when Labor got in, business was disabled. We just had to live in that cycle. That is what the parliamentary secretary has recognised and he has made it his mission to make sure that small business, particularly in Australia, is enabled.


Throughout history, every time the Labor Party has formed government it has systematically destroyed our economy by cash-splashing on ill-informed policies—policies that I can simply highlight: the mining tax, which those opposite could not manage to raise any revenue from, and the carbon tax, which increased costs for every business and household across Australia. These two taxes alone constituted 29 different acts and 1,625 pages of additional burdensome regulation and legislation. They are both gone now: gone from this place and gone from the Australian economy.


This government has promised to cut $1 billion in red tape each year, and the only thing those opposite spent their time doing was imposing onerous red and green tape on businesses who had much better things to do than waste their time and their money filling in duplicative administrative paperwork that benefited no-one. Members in this place know that while Labor has been incapable of supporting business productivity throughout history, no Labor government had ever before reached the level of incessant failure that was seen under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Twenty-one thousand pieces of additional regulation: that is the only legacy those opposite can claim. I remember back in 2007 when I ran in that campaign, it was one in, one out and it certainly did not happen once those 21,000 regulations came in from the Labor government during that period of time. I think it was about one to 104—104 in and one out. That is a legacy that I would be embarrassed about, and I would not be standing in this place trying to justify it—as we have seen from every Labor speaker who has spoken on these bills.


On this side of the chamber there are former business operators, fine men and women who understand business. They understand the economy and they understand that where money and time is wasted, it costs Australia's economy as a whole.


I know that the member for Robertson is dying to speak on this bill. I congratulate the parliamentary secretary on the great job he is doing in repealing legislation and regulation in Australia to enable business. I commend these bills to the House and welcome the next speaker.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (17:26):  I rise to support this very important second red-tape repeal day and, in doing so, commend these bills to the House, because lifting the burden of red tape and regulation will make life easier for residents and businesses on the Central Coast. 


Let me give you some examples in the time remaining. For individuals in my electorate of Robertson, we have made it easier for them to get in touch with government services by simply creating a myGov account. With the click of a button there is a centralised online point of access. I understand that more than five million people have already registered. In fact, one of the people to sign up recently was Nicholas Staniford from Killcare, who has told me how much easier it is to have everything in the one place and how he does not need to have several different websites with different passwords. We are also enabling people to complete their tax returns faster. The online myTax system will save over 1.4 million taxpayers nearly $160 million a year in compliance costs by pre-populating their tax returns. Another local resident, Leon Manuela, who is 22 years of age and lives in Tascott, said that for many young people on the Central Coast it has made doing their tax a lot less stressful.


The electorate of Robertson is home to many high quality and innovative aged-care providers. With nearly 20 per cent of my electorate in the over-65 age cohort—the seventh-highest in the country—aged-care care providers are an integral part of our community. So, on this important red-tape repeal day, I am pleased to say that we have removed the requirement to notify the department of any changes in key personnel within 28 days of the change. Instead, providers will only need to tell the department about a change of circumstances that materially affects the provider's suitability to provide care. Jennifer Eddy, the Chief Executive Officer of Woy Woy Community Aged Care, advised me that far too much time has been spent with excessive and inconsistent reporting and duplication of information to government departments and this is taking time away from the key role of delivering care to residents. Jennifer said that people looking at aged-care services are becoming more discerning because of the cost, which makes it even more important that aged-care services have the time to provide quality care.


It is a similar situation for small businesses, which are the engine room of our economy, particularly on the Central Coast. So to help businesses focus on what they do best, we have removed the requirement to lodge a business activity statement for 32,000 businesses where no GST is payable. A further 447,000 businesses with minimal income are now exempt from pay-as-you-go requirements. Many people living on the peninsula will know Bremen Patisserie at Umina Beach. I dare say many from around Australia will know of Ron and the family business, because last year they were the national award winner for gourmet pies in the Great Aussie Pie Competition. Ron's success as a small-business owner speaks for itself. Still, because of the need to stay on top of the red tape and regulation, his wife Helga stays up from 9 pm to l am to complete book work and paperwork. It is not an easy job for anyone, but especially not for a business that starts baking at the crack of dawn. That is why this government is working to lift this burden by having two repeal days every year to tear up unnecessary regulation. We have heard the voice of the community and they agree with us too. Many of these repeals were actually suggested by people, and also business and community groups, and I commend the bills to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-10-29,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:30):  It is a great privilege to provide the summing up to these repeal day bills that we have been debating today: the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014 and the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014. I thank members on this side of the House who contributed to the debate—the member for Robertson, the member for Swan, the member for Grey, the member for Forde, the member for Bradfield, the member for Dobell, the member for McPherson, the member for Mitchell, the member for Macquarie, the member for Durack, the member for Hughes and the member for Lyons—and members on the deregulation committee on the coalition side: the members for Reid, Bass, Ryan, Deakin, Hindmarsh and Pearce. In every case members on this side of the House gave constructive, concise and comprehensive speeches about why deregulation is important for the future of this country and the health of our economy. We on this side of the House know that cutting red tape matters. It matters to the lives of individuals, the lives of families, the lives and work of small businesses and of course the lives and operation of the not-for-profit sector.


The Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill will make accessing our law easier. The statute law revision bill will improve the usability and accessibility of our legislation. The omnibus repeal day bill will see, just like the Commission of Audit tasked us to do, the abolition of bodies that are no longer required. The Fishing Industry Policy Council, the Product Stewardship Advisory Group and the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council will all now be abolished. We will also allow ACMA to publish their changes using online services by making amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. Fuel suppliers and producers around this country will now no longer have to go through the additional requirement of submitting an extra annual report to the Department of the Environment, given that they are already putting in monthly reports.


As we heard from the member for Robertson, aged-care sector processes will be streamlined, thanks to the great work of the member for Menzies, the Minister for Social Services, who is sitting at the dispatch box here. He has ensured that key personnel are not required to phone when there is a change among the many aged-care providers of this country. They are not required to make a phone call to the federal department to say that a nurse has been hired or fired. Last year there were 10,000 such calls. We now will no longer need that red-tape requirement.


There are significant changes in these three bills that we have brought on for debate and will vote on now, but they are just a small part of the more than 400 individual measures that we have outlined as part of our repeal day process, with the first repeal day in March and the second now on 29 October. Let me give the headline number—the achievement that the member for Watson hates to hear. We have been responsible for $2.1 billion worth of compliance savings. From agriculture to education, from health to human services and from trade to Treasury we have been responsible for significant red tape cuts right across the economy.


And it matters. That is why groups like ACCI, the Business Council of Australia, Universities Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Minerals Council of Australia have applauded the coalition for taking deregulation seriously. Those opposite did nothing, despite the pious words from the then member for Griffith, who told us that red tape was out of control. They did nothing but twiddle their thumbs and give us 21,000 additional regulations, tying up the small business people of Australia in red and green tape. Now they have the hide to come into this place and criticise us for making important reforms. On the one hand they say that these are trivial changes and are part of the normal course of business—we are fixing punctuation: full stops and commas—but on the other hand the member for Fraser goes out in print in The Australian saying, 'You are taking away important protections in the financial services sector and you are making some important changes that we do not like in the charities and not-for-profit sector,' when we are getting rid of duplication. You cannot have it both ways.


Why didn't you come up with a proposal to streamline the Comcare scheme and allow companies around Australia who operate in multiple jurisdictions to self-insure under the Comcare scheme? Why didn't you come up with the one-stop shop approval process? Labor states have joined with coalition states in signing onto our one-stop shop, worth $426 million a year in savings. Why didn't you come up with the changes to the Do Not Call Register, which will see more than nine million Australians no longer having to renew their membership of the Do Not Call Register? Why didn't you come up with the changes to the NBN? We are no longer mandating Australian homes have a big, bulky, expensive battery backup because we know that most Australian homes now have a mobile phone. Why don't you accept that we came up with this first and that we have the stomach and the fortitude to make changes in deregulation where you guys patently failed?


When Craig Emerson was the Minister for Small Business he said, 'We are taking giant scissors to red tape' and those giant scissors led to an additional 21,000 regulations.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  A giant printing press.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  There was a giant printing press, thank you very much, Minister. We have actually made significant changes. The competitiveness paper which was released just a couple of weeks ago had a landmark change. That landmark change was that we will now accept into Australia product systems and services where they have been approved already by trusted international jurisdictions. And the regulators in this country, whether it is the APVMA, whether it is NICNAS or whether it is the TGA, will only add an extra layer of regulation when there is a proven need to do so.


We had the CEO of Cochlear, Chris Roberts, come out publicly and say this will make a major difference to the operation of his business. The member for Longman, from his own electorate, brought the wonderful example of a company that produces cricket balls and footballs made out of leather. They need to bring in a leather measuring and cutting machine from Italy but then they have to pay $3,000 for that machine to be accredited. Why is that the case? If it has been approved in Italy and Europe is a trusted international jurisdiction, there has to be a very good reason why it cannot automatically be brought into the Australian system. Why does an importer from Europe of commercial cooking equipment that goes to the hospitality and tourism sectors and to the aged care sector have to pay $12,000 per machine to get it accredited in Australia? It is just an extra layer of cost which is then passed on to the consumer.


We have come up with a system and with new processes to bed down this new deregulation agenda. Ministers now have established deregulation units. Ministers have now appointed ministerial advisory committees to advise them on the key areas to cut regulation. We have changed the KPIs for senior public servants to align their best interests with our best interests and the public's best interests—namely, cutting red tape. We have assigned two days of the parliamentary timetable to just cutting red tape. We have set ourselves a target of a billion dollars a year as a net target. It is a big target. We are now $2.1 billion—a number that the member for Watson hates to hear.




Mr McCormack:
  How much?




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  It is $2.1 billion. We tasked the Productivity Commission to come up with a framework for auditing the performance of the regulators, which is now finalised and was released earlier today. It is very significant when we have 150 regulators at the Commonwealth level including major ones like the ATO, ASIC, APRA, ACMA and others much smaller like the Office of Gene Technology or the Passports Office or the like. These are all extremely significant changes and they are changes that are making people's interaction with government that much easier through the myGov and the MyTax site and they are reducing the overall compliance base.


It will be interesting to see whether the member for Watson and those opposite support changes to the corporations law, which will no longer allow 100 shareholders to call a special general meeting of a company like Woolworths, which has over 400,000 shareholders. One hundred shareholders can still put an issue on the agenda at a major special general meeting but they should not be allowed to call a special general meeting in itself. It is a measure which has been warmly received by the business community and will be a test for those opposite to see how job friendly and business friendly they really are.


I could go on. We have made extremely good progress in just the year we have been at the helm. We have got legislation through the Senate and we have banked reforms. Our first omnibus bill went through the Senate, our changes to the agricultural chemicals went through the Senate, our changes around classification went through the Senate, our changes around the future of financial advice went through the Senate and we are hopeful to get our one-stop shops through the Senate shortly. We have banked a lot of reforms that we have already announced but we still have a long way to go.


I want to thank the minister, for example, in job services, who made a very significant reform to ensure that there is less paperwork for job service providers—an incredible reform. To all the cabinet ministers, all the junior ministers and all the parliamentary secretaries who have made extremely significant reforms, we are very grateful. Most of all, can I think the Prime Minister because the Prime Minister has led this agenda. The Prime Minister himself has taken responsibility for the deregulation agenda by making it a standing item at COAG meetings, by driving change with his fellow premiers and chief ministers and by ensuring that his ministers and his Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet maintain the momentum that we currently have to cut red tape.


I also thank the senior members of the public service in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all the deregulation units in the other portfolios and officers of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel who were responsible for drafting this legislation. This has been a team effort from start to finish.


I must tell you, the finish line is a long way away because the Productivity Commission has estimated that four per cent of GDP at least is tied up in red tape and compliance. Deloittes put out a report saying one million Australians are involved in the compliance sector. Clearly, this is too much. This has to change and, on this side of the House, we are determined to do it. These bills today are extremely important and are just one step along the way to cutting 1,000 pieces of regulation legislation and removing over 7,200 pages from the statute books, giving us a headline figure of $2.1 billion if we combine repeal day 1 and repeal day 2.


This is an important day for the parliament. This is an important day for the families, the businesses and the not-for-profits of the country and for the farmers of this country, who tell us that one dollar in every six dollars that they take at the farm gate is taken up in compliance. This is an important step in freeing up our economy ensuring we have higher productivity, growth, innovation, entrepreneurship and, most importantly of all, that we have more jobs for Australians today and into the future. I commend these bills to the House.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (19:30):  In the great arguments and debates of this chamber, we too easily forget just how much we share in common as members, and as Australians; not least of which is the good fortune to be citizens of a nation that draws tremendous strength from its diversity.


For me, the outstanding group of students, teachers and parents who formed a unity council at John Paul College in my electorate, and who I acknowledge here in the public galleries today, serve as a reminder of that fundamental truth. They have asked me to stand and share their message of unity and understanding with the people's house of the Australian parliament. I thank them for that privilege.


My colleagues here know that I often speak in this place of my pride in representing one of the most diverse communities in Australia; with people from 189 different homelands living in our electorate alone. Thirteen of these backgrounds are represented on the unity council that I met with at JPC in Daisy Hill a few weeks ago, and again today. 


The unity council sprang from the initiative taken by two fine young men—Faruk Bilgin and Raghe Abdi—who were concerned about the impact of events overseas on the way we treat each other here at home. It is a tribute to them and to the student body at JPC that they were soon joined by Gareth Clark, Rohan Daniel, Stephanie Hoang, Chloe Mo, Himanthi Mendis, Harris Nikwan, Jack Smith, Luke Van Wijk, Shannon Widrose, and Nereadine Wolmby. And it is a tribute to the school's leadership that they were immediately supported by their dedicated principal, Peter Foster, who is here; as is Julia Martinez Garcia, a teacher; Jessica Fern, a kindy parent, who also formed a unity club with other mums and dads; Helen Weissenberger the chair of the board; Allan Dennis, the head of the senior school; and other parents. They are all in on the secret, that achieving unity and understanding between people of different faiths, cultures and backgrounds is critical to unlocking the full value of Australia's multiculturalism.


I cannot share all of their stories in the time I have tonight, but let me share a few, because their experiences are pivotal to their understanding and compassion. Nereadine, a member of the Wik people from Far North Queensland, was brought up on teachings that pre-date European settlement, 'that every person is valuable' and should 'live together in harmony'. Stephanie, a Vietnamese-Australian, is from the first generation in her family not to have grown up experiencing conflict in her home country. Himanthi, a Sri Lankan-Australian, grew up in a country stricken with civil war and unrest. Gareth left South Africa two and a half years ago, a country still scarred by years of apartheid and segregation. All the students have their own stories. They are here in Canberra to share them with honourable members and senators. 


Tomorrow they will host a roundtable with members from both sides of the House, to deliver and discuss these main points: that we must embrace multiculturalism; that knowledge is the key to understanding and respecting differences; and that the media needs to play a more positive role in getting this message out there. I am proud to see local students leading the charge to promote unity and understanding, not just in my community—as important as that is—but here in the parliament as well; the meeting place of our nation. 


If we are serious about building a country which looks out for each other and looks after each other, we should follow their lead and example; because, as Rohan wrote, 'when we alienate our own people, we move the world from beneath their feet'. Or as Chloe reminds us: 'conflict is not caused by the fact that there is more than one religion, but by the spirit of ignorance and fear, the spread of which can only be regarded as the total eclipse of reason and justice.' And Shannon is right to say that, though our efforts may seem 'only a small step in advancing our world, it is a start, and why not start right now'.


Thank you again to the unity council from John Paul College for your passion and your commitment and for the honour of representing you in this place.
