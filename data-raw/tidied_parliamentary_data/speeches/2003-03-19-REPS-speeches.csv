"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—National Seniors Week is being held this week, 16 to 22 March. It is our opportunity to celebrate our 2.4 million older Australians, who are more active and contribute more to our communities than ever before. National Seniors Week is an annual community event that celebrates the valuable contribution of older people to community life in Australia. National Seniors Week also challenges society's stereotypes around ageing and invites us all to consider our relationships with and attitudes towards the older people that we know. It is important we acknowledge that Australians aged 65 years and over lead very active lives and contribute a great deal to their communities through their volunteer work, assistance to their families and participation in their communities.
Unfortunately, this government constantly portrays our increasing ageing population as a looming crisis. One of the key triggers for the ageing panic was the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report, which was released along with last year's budget. According to the report:
... a steadily ageing population is likely to continue to place significant pressure on Commonwealth government finances.
Labor will not allow ageing to become a negative force in policy making in this country. Unlike the Howard government's Intergenerational Report, Labor does not see ageing Australians through a purely financial framework that turns them into an impost on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, on the age and services pensions and on younger generations in general. The Labor Party sees our ageing population as providing a wonderful opportunity for us to reap the benefits of having an older population with experience and much to offer.
Our community benefits greatly from the experience and contribution made by older Australians. Approximately one-quarter of older Australians participate in voluntary work, and this proportion is on the rise. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Older Australia at a glance, found that the primary reason older people undertake voluntary work is in fact to help others in the community. More older Australians in our community are interested in lifelong learning, and as a result we all benefit. For example, there are at least 46,000 older people participating in courses provided by the University of the Third Age. In 2001, there were 866 people aged 60 and over commencing university courses.
Businesses and organisations in our community should ensure that they give older Australians opportunities to participate as much as possible. I urge older Australians who are interested to contact their local businesses and organisations and discuss opportunities for more interaction. Labor will continue to pressure the Howard government to take a more positive view of our ageing population. Labor sees healthy ageing as a positive part of our society, and I call on everyone to join in the celebrations for this year's National Seniors Week being held this week.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Seniors Week</title>,Statements by Members,6,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, I would like to make some comments regarding Iraq, particularly given that we have only 10 minutes in the House to comment on that issue. Last Thursday, 13 March, was an important day for the Australian people. That was the day when the Prime Minister was supposed to make the case for war and failed. That was the day when he would not tell the truth to the Australian public about what our commitment to war was.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The honourable member for Swan should be very careful with the word `truth'. He knows what the Deputy Speaker thinks of it. If he could use other words, it would be helpful.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I actually tempered the language of my speech, compared to what it was like before. Prior to his address to the nation, the Prime Minister promised to produce evidence that would establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. He gave no such evidence. Then, to make matters worse, the Prime Minister refused to answer the question of whether Australia would go to war together with the US without UN authority. The question, of course, has now been answered with a clear `yes'. In his eagerness to join George Bush in a war with Iraq, John Howard is pre-empting the UN process that is attempting to disarm Iraq without a conflict. It is my belief that recourse to war can never be justified before all nonviolent solutions have been pursued. Instead of listening to the people of Australia, who, in the majority, do not want to engage in conflict with Iraq and would prefer to follow the direction of the United Nations and try to find a nonviolent solution to the situation in Iraq, the Prime Minister is determined to follow the President of the United States into conflict with Iraq, with or without the backing of the UN. Obviously, we now know it will be without UN backing.
New details from UK intelligence reports which say there are no links between the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, and the al-Qaeda terrorist leader, Osama bin Laden, are being ignored by the British Prime Minister, our Prime Minister and the US President, as is the information from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, who has now demonstrated conclusively that UK and US intelligence authorities relied on forged documents to support their assertions that Iraq was trying to buy uranium in Africa to restart its nuclear weapons program. Yet these forgeries have been used for months as part of the justification for an invasion.
If that is not enough and does not convince our Prime Minister, I believe it speaks volumes when one of our own senior intelligence analysts feels compelled to resign from our top-secret intelligence assessment agency in protest against Australia's involvement in the looming war with Iraq. My namesake, Andrew Wilkie, is reported by the Australian newspaper to have said he `felt compelled to resign from the Office of National Assessments because he did not believe Iraq posed a serious threat to Australia'. He went on to say:
Their—
that is, Iraq's—
military is very weak ... It's a fraction of the size it was when (Iraq) invaded Kuwait ... Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program is, I believe, genuinely contained. I don't believe I can stand by any longer and take no action.
Mr Wilkie, a lieutenant colonel in the Army prior to his resignation, was, I believe, a middle-ranking bureaucrat who knew enough about US and Australian intelligence on Iraq to know what he was talking about. I believe that his information is credible and therefore should be taken into consideration.
The failure so far to find any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction reinforces Mr Wilkie's comment to the Bulletin that Iraq's biological and chemical program is `limited and disjointed' compared with the bigger national program under way before the 1991 Gulf War. Of course, it is impossible to rule out the Prime Minister's worst nightmare, outlined in his speech to the National Press Club last Thursday, that Iraq will give weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Mr Wilkie's point, however, is that Saddam is far more likely to do so as a last defiant act during an invasion, which is why war should be kept as a last option.
Earlier this month, I brought to the attention of the parliament the fact that there has been an increase in military aircraft using the Perth International Airport. The information I have managed to get is that Perth International Airport is being used to load cargo and take on fuel. I have not been able to establish what the cargo is, but I assume that it is military supplies, especially as the information I have been seeking is restricted to military personnel. My concern has been heightened, as my information is that in the last week the number of military aircraft using the airport has tripled.
The sorts of aircraft that we are talking about are not small cargo aircraft. One is the world's largest aircraft, the Antonov An-124, with a take-off weight of 405,000 kilos and a very poor safety record. Another aircraft is the Russian Ilyushin Il-76. The Il-76 has had some 13 crashes in its history, two of which occurred this year—one in East Timor. It is unacceptable that those aircraft are using Perth airport and flying over our residential areas. Perth International Airport ranks fourth in Australia in passenger traffic volume and it is the principal international, domestic and regional gateway to Western Australia for commercial aircraft and air freight. The airport has facilities for international and domestic air passenger operations and air freight operations and general aviation. It operates year round, curfew free, 24 hours a day. Within the airport alone there is the potential for an unmitigated disaster if one of these large military aircraft has an accident on take-off or landing.
Add to this the location of the airport. It is located close to densely occupied industrial and residential areas, complete with schools, child-care and recreation facilities, hospitals and large shopping centres. I said earlier this month that it was not unreasonable to be nervous about the use of Perth airport by the Australian and US military, given that we have had three military incidents in the Perth region in recent times. I now wish to add to that concern. War with Iraq is imminent and, as a result of our involvement in war with Iraq, there will be an increased threat to Australia from international terrorism.
I have been trying to establish whether security at Perth International Airport has been upgraded. Representatives from both the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Perth International Airport advised that security for military operations was the responsibility of the Department of Defence and therefore they could not offer any information about the current security arrangements. However, it was suggested that some private security might also be contracted to assist the guarding and patrolling of planes and their cargo whilst they were on the ground. Defence officials at the Pearce RAAF Base were reluctant to discuss security arrangements for any of the military flights, which is understandable.
Australian Protective Service patrols have been increased at the airport and a total of 31 new APS staff have been posted to those positions. That is not enough. There has been no significant increase in security. Now that the government has joined the US in its desire to engage in war with Iraq and is increasing its military use of our civilian airports as loading and transit points for military aircraft, what guarantees about their safety and security is the government prepared to give to people living close to, working at or transiting through our civilian airports? This government is prepared to put the general population at risk of accidents or acts of terrorism by the very act of allowing civilian airports to be used by the military to ferry unsafe cargoes on aircraft with dubious safety records.
This is particularly relevant in Perth, where there is an alternative. The reason most of these aircraft use Perth airport is that the runway at Pearce air base is not long enough to allow these aircraft to reach take-off speed with a full payload of cargo and fuel. As a result, the aircraft will often go to Pearce air base, load the military payload and then come down to Perth airport, refuel—remembering that, for example, an Antonov can take some 230,000 litres of fuel—and then use the main international runway in order to take off and reach their destination. However, there is an alternative. In the north of Western Australia we have Learmonth at Exmouth, which has a runway of 3.3 kilometres. That can carry any sized aircraft in the world, and it has the facilities to cater for refuelling. My view is that these aircraft, instead of using Perth airport and putting the population at risk, should be using Learmonth on their way to the gulf.
When considering issues to do with the war other people have talked about legal issues, but I would like to talk about some of the moral issues associated with this war. When asked by Melissa Doyle on the Sunrise program last week about the morality of his stand, this was the Prime Minister's reply: 
Well morally it depends, with great respect it depends on the merits of the issue. It really does. And then morality is something that in the end, each individual person and nation has to take a view on. And my very strong view is that if Iraq is allowed to retain chemical and biological weapons, other rogue states will develop theirs. The more rogue states that have them, the greater the risk that they will get into the hands of terrorists, and if terrorists get them, they'll use them. Now that in essence is my argument, and that is an argument that I hold to very strongly.
If that gobbledegook is the basis for committing to war with Iraq, I am even more concerned about the Prime Minister and his ability to lead this country than I was before. In the Prime Minister's address to the National Press Club on 13 March, he said he was going to present evidence from our intelligence agencies of a link between Iraq and terrorists. Where was that evidence? I have listened to the address and I have read the transcript, but I still cannot see the evidence the Prime Minister promised.
We all know that Saddam Hussein is an evil man capable of evil acts, some of which defy imagination. The depths to which he will stoop and the misery and deprivation he inflicts on his people are well reported. However, that does not give an outside power the right to go to war. Obviously, there are things which the Prime Minister either does not understand or does not want to understand. What I am not clear about is what those things are. Does he not understand that there is no proven connection between either the September 11 attacks or the Bali attack and Iraq, or does he not understand that Iraq poses no threat in relation to its purported weapons of mass destruction to either Australia or Australian allies? Or does he perhaps not understand about the main role of government, which I have already mentioned: to create peace and security for citizens in both domestic and international relations?
The United Nations Security Council plainly does not support the decision to go to war. Labor is opposed to this war. This war is wrong, and clearly not in the national interest. I oppose this war. It does not have the sanction of the United Nations Security Council. It is not an act of self-defence. The commitment by the Prime Minister to join the US in an attack on Iraq is a clear indication that Australia has walked away from the United Nations. Taking an aggressive stand and committing to war when a peaceful solution could probably still be found is at best irresponsible and at worst criminal, according to some. The Prime Minister has blatantly disregarded popular opinion and flown in the face of the United Nations with his decision to follow the call of George Bush.
There is talk of this being a quick clean war which will be over in a couple of days or weeks. It is my opinion that there is no such thing as a quick clean war. History is full of terrible overexpectations of quick clean results, not the least being the siege of Stalingrad in World War II. War inevitably brings casualties, and this war will be no different. There will be many casualties, many of whom will be civilians, including civilian children, who by the Prime Minister's own admission have already suffered more than many of us can even imagine.
No-one would argue that Saddam Hussein is not an evil despot who needs to be disarmed. The question is how we go about achieving that disarmament. As recently as yesterday, Hans Blix and the UN weapons inspectors said that Iraq was still destroying its al-Samoud 2 missiles and that it has destroyed 70 to date. The government is quite right when they say that it has already been 12 years; I say why not allow Dr Blix and the UN another couple of months to try and gain a peaceful solution? I believe it is important to acknowledge the progress that has already been made and to give the weapons inspectors in Iraq a chance for further progress. War must be a last resort, when every other avenue has been tried and found not to work. War should never—I repeat, never—be a starting point. Diplomacy is always a good starting point. In this case, it has been difficult, but it has been getting results.
There are a lot of people around the world who are leading evil regimes and need to be dealt with, not the least of whom, I would argue, is Robert Mugabe from Zimbabwe. But what do we do about him? We suspend him from the councils of the Commonwealth until the issue can be addressed by the heads of government at the Abuja CHOGM meeting in December. Mugabe's is a government that continues to encourage systematic harassment and torture of the opposition and electoral malpractice. It has corrupted legal practices to the point where the rule of law in Zimbabwe no longer exists, I believe, whilst resisting the transparent, equitable and sustainable land reform program its citizens so badly need.
Knowing these terrible things about this regime, the Prime Minister did not decide that we should have a pre-emptive strike. No, Zimbabwe was dealt with in a very severe manner, showing the world what we really thought of the regime—yes, we sent the cricket team to Zimbabwe to play in the World Cup! This, I am sure, sent a severe message to Robert Mugabe in terms of not allowing him to continue with what he is doing in that country. Yes, we committed what I believe to be an outrageous act: we sent a cricket team. One can only wonder what else this Prime Minister has in store for Mugabe. 
My point here is that we must ensure that, when we are dealing with evil regimes, we do it in the right way. Unfortunately, in this instance and in the Iraq instance, the Prime Minister, in his eagerness to join George W. Bush in this war with Iraq, is pre-empting the UN process of attempting to disarm Iraq without a conflict. It is in Australia's interest to abide by the international rule of law. Last time we went into Iraq, it was under the UN banner after the invasion of Kuwait. This time, if they go into Iraq without the sanction of the UN, they will have weakened the United Nations. By this proposed action to go to war without UN sanction, there is a clear signal to rogue states. If we allow countries to act unilaterally, even in a good cause, what message does that give to the regimes that would act unilaterally in a bad cause? 
The argument that this has taken 12 years and Iraq has still not got rid of the weapons of mass destruction is not valid. There have already been 12 years go by; another few months will not make a huge difference—but going to war will. North Korea has had since 1984—by my calculations, 19 years—so, using the arguments put forward by the US President and the Prime Ministers of Britain and Australia, a pre-emptive strike must be about seven years overdue. Of course, that is ludicrous—and that is my point. Does it matter how long it has been? The point should be: what can we do to correct the problem in the safest, most humanitarian way? Causing more misery for civilians who have already suffered too much by the edicts of a dictator is not the solution. To go to war with Iraq will damage relations in our region. This government has an obligation to cultivate and build relationships in the region to fight terrorism. This act will make us a target. This war will spawn more terrorism and more terrorists—not, as the Prime Minister would have us believe, reduce or do away with terrorism. This war is wrong, and the Labor Party will not be part of it. War is unnecessary, and there is an alternative.
As I said before, a recourse to war can never be justified before all nonviolent solutions have been pursued. George W. Bush, unfortunately, appears to be determined to engage in conflict with Iraq with or without the backing of the United Nations, and our Prime Minister seems equally determined to join him in that engagement. The Labor Party has argued since April—that is, almost one year ago—that there should be no military action in Iraq outside the authority of the United Nations. The Prime Minister has argued that there are valid reasons why war with Iraq is now the only option for Australia. He has failed to bring the people of Australia into his confidence as to those valid arguments and he has failed to explain to them why war is right. I commend the leader of the Labor Party's amendment in supporting these appropriations bills and the stand of the Labor Party on the issue of the war with Iraq.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—Although I rise to speak in a debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, people all over Australia will understand when I say it is difficult to concentrate our whole attention on this legislation today as war clouds loom ominously over this parliament, over the nation and over our world. The people of Australia now have their political eyes wide open and are considering closely just what the Howard government stands for in all aspects of Australia's administration. It is a crucial time in the political history of our nation, a time when no action by this government will or should escape close scrutiny by those Australians who think they have a right to have a say in their country's affairs and a right to be listened to. 
The Australian public have heard the Prime Minister state categorically that he knows what is best for this country, regardless of public representations to him or to his government members and regardless of overwhelming public protest against his actions and his decision to commit this country to war. But debate on the appropriations bills affords the opportunity to have a closer look at this government's economic and social agenda as well and to work out just what the Prime Minister and his government actually think is best for us, besides taking our young men and women to war, alienating our regional neighbours and friends and departing recklessly from protocols and precedents that have given at least some semblance of integrity to our past involvement in military conflicts.
But to the legislation at hand: these bills do provide top-up funding to Commonwealth departments and agencies so that they can continue to function and implement programs right up to the new budget allocations. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 appropriates moneys from consolidated revenue for ordinary annual services such as running costs and recurrent expenditure on already established programs. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 seeks additional monies from consolidated revenue for purposes other than ordinary annual services. It covers capital works, payments to the states and other purposes not authorised by special legislation. Through the debate on these bills, each member has the opportunity to comment on the financial management of this country and the outcomes achieved through the allocation and management of Australia's financial resources. 
This legislation is pretty basic to most Australians and to their daily lives. No wealth is created without the contribution of the men and women of Australia. Most Australians want to know what has been in it for them. In this debate I would like to reflect on what benefit the people of Australia, particularly the residents of my electorate of Newcastle, have gained from the Howard government's seven-year reign. I expect even the government must be realising now that, for the electorate, the seven-year itch is setting in, with much irritation getting under the skin of Australians. When considering what bang we get for our bucks, the people of Australia, particularly the people in my electorate in Newcastle, must be seeing that it is not much. 
When the average Australian thinks about the government allocating moneys, they would expect that there should be some economic and social benefit for as many people as possible. Most Australians believe in a fair go and looking after your mate, so they would expect to see some inclusion and some egalitarianism in spreading the wealth around and providing safety nets of some kind for the most disadvantaged among us. And that sounds fair to me. Getting the balance right and creating economic growth—but not at the expense of equity and social harmony—would seem to be goals all governments would want to pursue. If asked, `How would you expect government to do that?' most Australians would say, `By providing decent education and health services, by making sure people can work and raise a family and by providing some security for when we get old.' Keeping the country safe and keeping our environment healthy might also get a mention. 
Let us look at some of those things, starting with employment. In the electorate of Newcastle the proportion of people seeking employment and unable to get a job has hovered around 10 per cent for most of Howard's terms in government, with youth unemployment at 30 per cent. In Australia, one in six children live in a jobless household. That is about 860,000 children, and that figure is steadily rising. Many of these children have never experienced having parents who actually work. When we look at what the federal government has provided in the way of job creation in Newcastle, there does not seem to be much to reflect on at all. The Commonwealth Structural Adjustment Fund has created under 300 jobs, while the state government's similar Hunter Advantage Fund has managed to completely replace the jobs lost by the BHP closure, creating over 2,000 jobs. 
If the government would like some ideas on how to create jobs in the Hunter, we are very happy to remind them of the projects we have been putting forward for some time—projects that Newcastle would like to see assisted and supported in budgets. They include a contribution to a new international standard football stadium. Our state government has put up over $23 million; the federal government have put up nil. Newcastle would like local employment programs, not just Work for the Dole programs, that provide jobs for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged job seekers. We are seeking a multipurpose terminal and would like the federal government to look at—perhaps through its AusLink program—the infrastructure upgrades that are very much needed to support an MPT. We are still hoping to get a new clean steel industry in Newcastle, but financial investment in these times is very difficult to attain; some government assurances and certainty are needed to attract that sort of investment. As for the provision of broadband services to Newcastle, unfortunately we have seen SaskTel, a Canadian firm, now threatening to pull out of a proposal to provide broadband services to Newcastle and the Hunter because of that lack of financial investment. The construction of the Hunter medical research institute has been on the books for a long time. The community has put the money in, the state government has put the money in and, again, we have received nothing from the federal government.
We would also like increased staffing levels in Commonwealth departments. But let us not be too unfair; let us look at the Regional Solutions Program. In my electorate of Newcastle we have received two grants under this program: one for the establishment of a child safety education centre near our John Hunter hospital and one for the Tiligerry Habitat Multifunction Centre. That does not seem very much for a regional capital. In spite of media articles and editorials that suggest you only get what your parliamentarian applies for, that clearly is not the case. We are not allowed to apply for Regional Solutions funds, but we do encourage our communities to seek this support. The Newcastle Wetlands Centre, as the first Ramsar-approved facility in Australia, would welcome some regional assistance. The Ethnic Communities Centre, which employs 70 people and provides services all over the state, is desperate for its own centre, so it would like some assistance too. A regional transport professional association in Newcastle applied to the Regional Solutions Program over 12 months ago for funds to complete a transport study for the region based on real data to project the holistic transport needs of the region into the future. But it seems their application went back to the future, as the last information I have is that the application has been `misplaced'—12 months ago.
What does high employment mean in Newcastle? I think people have to be reminded that what it means is that we are ranked 127th out of 150 Commonwealth electoral divisions in Australia in terms of our median individual income, which is $306 per week. It makes Newcastle the 24th lowest ranked electorate in the country. One would not expect that for a regional capital that has experienced high economic growth. But the jobs do not come with it, unfortunately. That means that 45 per cent of persons aged 15 years and over in my electorate are living on less than $300 per week and that 41 per cent of family households in my electorate are living on less than $800 per week. That means there is not a lot of money to go around and that basically businesses have a limit on how much they can grow. That is unfortunate. So we ask the government to look kindly at Newcastle when Regional Solutions funds come through.
If you have a disability and you would like to work, do not expect any special employment service and certainly do not look to Commonwealth agencies or departments to employ you. In Newcastle, the Commonwealth government departments and agencies employ a grand total of 57 people with disabilities. But Minister Abbott's department cannot even tell me how many people with a disability are employed in my electorate. This is the same minister who tells us we need to get people off disability entitlements and into work. With Newcastle having the second highest take-up of disability benefits in the nation, this situation provides no comfort to them.
Let us also look at the government's track record on higher education. The Howard government has managed to rip out more than $5 billion from Australian universities, leaving those like the University of Newcastle managing significant debt. In 2003, there are 22,000 fewer fully funded places than in 1996. Student fees have jumped 85 per cent since 1996, with students and their families now major contributors to the cost of higher education. For our students, that means living in poverty and choosing to study part time just to subsist. At the University of Newcastle, where 22,000 students are enrolled this year, there is a distinct trend towards part-time study. In 2002, only 55 per cent of students were studying full time: a seven per cent decline in just two years. Public investment in universities must increase, rather than continuing the slide that has been allowed under this government. Our students deserve more than that. Currently they plan when they can begin a family or acquire a home according to when they will have paid back their HECS debt. But the government's only solution is to increase full fee-paying places and to allow universities to increase their charges so that those who can afford to buy their way into a degree can do so, displacing those whose marks are higher but who cannot afford to pay.
In our electorate offices every day, the public tells us that our health system, burdened by an ageing population and the high cost of technological advances, is failing. Medicare does not mean no payment or even just a gap payment to most people now, with bulk-billing being increasingly inaccessible. In Newcastle, bulk-billing of all or most services by local GPs has plummeted to 10 per cent. That is putting pressure on our public hospitals. Private health insurance premiums have gone through the roof and have become unaffordable for all but the wealthy and privileged. Unfortunately, figures confirm that people are abandoning private health insurance, not because they do not want those benefits but because they just cannot afford them. There are real problems in our health system, including the undersupply of doctors and specialists in some fields and a Medicare system that rewards overservicing rather than holistic health care and patient management. The best use of the private health insurance levy has certainly not been achieved, and it should be looked at closely to ensure maximum benefits to Australians. The government wants to increase the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme contribution. In Newcastle, 40,000 people have health care cards, which means they have very low incomes. Every increase to the cost of prescriptions means people on low incomes must make choices about what they can afford.
Let us look at the safety net for those people. We know that many people do receive benefits. In Newcastle, there are 16,000 age pensioners. There are 2,000 people on carers allowance, 10,000 people receiving the family tax benefit—and that is a very long story!—and nearly 11,000 people receiving rent assistance. So my electorate certainly has many people who are within that safety net. Unfortunately for those people and for many others, they would really like to get a job. Employment tax credits have always been supported by Labor as a way of assisting people from welfare into work. Tax credits help families to avoid high tax rates when they move from welfare payments to slightly higher wages, but this government has introduced legislation that gives with one hand and takes with the other. The government will only introduce tax credit changes if the opposition agrees to extend the breaching system to wider target groups. That simply is not fair.
We are struggling to provide accessible aged care. It seems that aged care is no longer a public responsibility, and so it is commercially run. This means that no-one wants to take on the less profitable high-care clients. No new high-care beds were applied for in the electorate of Newcastle because providers just cannot afford them. That has pushed our aged citizens needing care further out from their homes and families.
Our aged population have seen their retirement incomes depleted by a superannuation system that has a built-in gambling element. No longer are their investments for their future assured. Fund managers are poorly regulated and are often poor performers. Income earned from retirement funds is at the whim of the stock exchange and global trends. I am sure that those who invested in Telstra and relied on that for their income were not happy to see $1 billion written off because of a poor investment in Hong Kong. That $1 billion could have been spent on improving telecommunications in Australia. But many of my citizens in Newcastle have part-time jobs. Many of them will never have a superannuation fund. They will be lucky to have any retirement savings by the time they reach an age where they can no longer work. Unfortunately, they will become the poor of the future and will struggle.
For families, declining fertility is a major concern. The fertility rate is now 1.7 and, although 30 per cent of the work force are women, they get little encouragement to have children. Labor would love to see paid maternity leave introduced and increased child-care places made available. In my electorate, 41 child-care providers have significant debts to be paid back to the government because, unfortunately, the government could not get its accounting system right. In Newcastle, the family tax benefit has been a disaster, with over half the people on that benefit accruing debts through it or receiving incorrect allocations. One of the government's answers to all these problems has been the baby bonus. As an election promise, that was not means tested. The baby bonus was made available to anyone—but only for the first child, and I do not think the concept of boutique babies should be introduced into this country. Families need to be treated fairly and to be assisted at a time when raising children is very difficult.
Families have also found housing particularly unaffordable. Mortgage costs have rapidly increased, and we now have record low rates of saving and record high bank fees being paid. In March 1996, the average monthly mortgage repayment took up 38.9 per cent of median monthly family incomes. It now chews up 43 per cent of family incomes, and in Sydney and desired urban areas it can be as high as 54 per cent. But first home owners receive their benefits no matter how wealthy they are.
We also must not forget that this is the highest taxing government we have ever experienced. We now have the GST and, of course, income tax, as well as those hidden taxes called special levies, which I think people overlook. There is the aircraft noise levy, the firearms buyback levy, the stevedoring levy, the dairy industry adjustment levy, the Ansett levy and the sugar industry levy. Collectively, those levies cost us $3 billion. In most cases, they are just extra consumption taxes on top of the GST, which is also a consumption tax. The government is avoiding putting up income tax, and that looks good, but the levies act as taxes on all of us.
Australians are now burdened with record household debt, which has more than doubled in this term, while credit debt has more than tripled and our services have reduced. At the moment in the Newcastle suburb of Stockton we are dealing with a very difficult situation with outsourced mail delivery services. We have had three contractors in 18 months, and medical alert bracelets and wills are going missing and mail is being found on the side of the road. Australia Post tell me that outsourcing has cut their costs by 50 per cent—but the service provided has declined to well below 50 per cent of its former standard. This government has also prevailed over the greatest corporate losses, through HIH and One.Tel and the failure of the insurance industry. It may also face civil action for legal liability because of the lack of sound corporate regulation—and the Australian public will pay for that.
So there is much to say in this debate about a government that is so completely out of touch with the Australian people of this new century. Its erroneous and flawed judgment will now be assessed by the Australian people, as its leader, John Howard, so readily commits our nation to war, prejudicing world peace, prejudicing stability in our region and placing our people at immense risk. That has all been done without even consulting the Australian people or giving them the opportunity to be heard. Support for war on terrorism, unfortunately, has not been quite so rigorous.
This government's judgment on matters of domestic significance will also now be assessed. I hope that, through this debate, people will see that the economic and social management of this nation has been neglectful, reckless and also unfair. I remind this chamber that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. In addition, it has failed to deliver on its basic service responsibilities to the Australian people. But, despite the record tax take and in spite of declining government services, the government has failed to keep its budget in surplus after nearly a decade of strong economic growth. It certainly has not been good enough for Australia, and it has not been good enough for the electorate of Newcastle.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 will allow additional funds to be made available where the initial appropriation for the financial year is insufficient. These additional appropriations, known as additional estimates, are extra spending requirements—for example, for cost overruns in existing programs or for new programs not foreseen when the budget was presented.
While we have had a number of unforeseen events in this country—and ones that really need to be assisted, such as bushfires, droughts, et cetera—it seems to me that this government has not dealt properly with the taxation regime. Funds need to be raised more appropriately and spent more fairly—for instance, topping up so-called benefit schemes, such as Family Tax Benefit. It is a pity that such a mechanism was not used to assist those people who suffered as a result of the changes to the family assistance tax benefits scheme, which was supposed to be of most assistance to low-income families but was changed in July 2002 to send a lot of the most needy into debt.
I want to speak today on the way in which family payments have proved disastrous for families in Tasmania and other parts of Australia. These are not isolated cases, and at times trying to help people deal with the burden can take several days or even a week. As has already been pointed out by previous speakers, the administration of the scheme has turned it into a family debt trap, leading to a situation in which about half the families eligible for family payments in Australia receive incorrect payments. Some 650,000 people have family payments debts, as the shadow minister has already noted by asking questions in the estimates committees. These figures have been confirmed for the year just past: it is anticipated that some 600,000 families will receive a debt in excess of $600. That is a lot of money to pay back when the income was family income supplement in the first place. People are being saddled with debts that they cannot avoid. People who have played by the government rules and have given notice that their income has changed are still receiving debt notices.
The minister has said that, if a family is concerned about how much they might earn in a year, they should overestimate their income. This completely bypasses the whole rationale for having family payments, which is to assist families to feed, clothe, educate and house their children on a weekly and fortnightly basis. Children do not stop growing for a year. They do not stop eating for a year. According to the government, the solution is to take less than you are entitled to or to make nothing during the year. Many who were encouraged to do that and were told by the government that they would receive a top-up payment in return for foregoing their payments have been duped, because the government put in a sneaky clause saying that, unless claimants claimed their top-up payments within 12 months, they would not be eligible to receive them—unlike other aspects of the taxation system where people have four years in which to put in their claims.
So once again people have been hit coming and going. Many people need the money on a fortnightly basis. If their income varied because they worked overtime or because they were casual employees and got more hours, they will now get a debt. Many of those who claimed less than they were entitled to could not access the top-up payment because they were beneath the tax threshold and therefore did not pay any tax from which to get a refund. This proves that this scheme is a shambles, a debt trap and a burden on hundreds of thousands of Australian families. It is a cruel and unnecessary way of making the government's books balance. It is totally unfair.
This situation seems to be typical of this government since they became elected. If people are well educated and in secure jobs, they are more likely to understand the vagaries of the tax system. But even many of those people find it difficult to estimate their incomes for a year. It is not an easy task. For a young couple who have three children and are battling on one income the task becomes almost insurmountable. They are the people who most need some sort of assistance, but they probably gave up trying to gain help because of the complexities of it all.
I can speak of one case, in particular, which is typical of many. The last child of a family with three children turned 16 in December 2000 and they received no further payment from Centrelink. The family then received a bill from Centrelink for overpayment of some $1,800 after apparently not estimating their income properly. The circumstances appear to be that, once the child turned 16, the wife went back to work. She managed to pick up some seasonal work, and the husband had been working part time. Although neither earned a full wage, they apparently earned more than they had estimated for the latter part of the year.
They were totally bewildered at receiving a bill. They had always stated their income during the time they were employed, and they knew they would not receive further benefit after December because their child turned 16. There was no information given to them at the time of estimation as to how the transition might be made, despite both the department and the family knowing what was going to happen halfway through the financial year. They have no money to pay such a bill. The three kids are still at home. One continues school this year, one will start an apprenticeship and the third is starting some other training. They all still need feeding, clothing and medical care. How are these people supposed to find the money? It was suggested by some far-sighted person that perhaps the kids' Austudy money could be accessed to pay this bill. Excuse me!
Another one came to light today. An ex-Ansett employee who has two small children came to me and said that she had received a bill due to a family benefit overpayment. This came about because she had applied for the benefit after she lost her job, when she had no idea of when or if she would get anything from a redundancy package, so she could not accurately state what her income might be for the following year. When she finally received something, which was not completely what she was entitled to but was something, she rang Centrelink and reported same. When the end of the financial year came, she found instead of a refund from the tax department a debt for most of the money she had received while she was waiting for redundancy funds to come through. She is still not working, but she had to survive on a small Centrelink payment until she got some of the money due to her. It still has not been finalised, and now she is stuck with a bill. What sort of assistance is that? The problem with this method of collecting overpayments is that it is unfair and unreasonable.
I have gone into the background of the changes that took place from 1 July 2000. The family tax benefit can now be received in three ways: one, paid fortnightly, as was the previous family allowance; two, claimed as an income tax deduction against the salary earned by the claimant; or, three, claimed as a tax deduction at the end of the financial year. The difference between this and the old scheme is that the new income testing arrangements for family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B now feature the use of the current financial year income. So, when a person is claiming payment for the 2001 calendar year, the income in the 2000-01 financial year is used. This contrasts with the pre-July 2000 arrangements, where the 1999-2000 year would have been used.
For those who elect to have their FTB A and/or FTB B paid at the end of the financial year, like a tax return, this payment methodology requires no estimate of income to be made at claim and there is no potential for overpayment or underpayment. For all those electing to be paid immediately at claim by way of fortnightly instalments or as a tax deduction in their pay before their 2000-01 year income is known, this requires an income estimate and a reconciliation. For those paid on the basis of an estimate, a reconciliation is then conducted once the 2000-01 financial year tax assessment is complete and the exact level of income is then known. Where income estimated at claim is overestimated, an overpayment is made and arrears are paid. This contrasts with the pre-July 2000 arrangements, where no arrears were paid because there was no need as the estimates were more accurately made. When the income estimate at claim underestimated the income earned in 2000-01, an overpayment is made and a debt raised. Before July 2000, debts were raised only where income exceeded the estimation by 10 per cent or more.
This sounds complicated when talking about it here. Can you imagine how complicated it is for a person confronted with this after they have made their estimate, believing that they have taken into account everything they would be earning? Many do not understand that the system works in a financial year, that an income is assessed for the year and that, if the circumstances change during that financial year, they are penalised for using the funds when they most needed them.
We are talking about people who may have only casual employment, who are waiting for a redundancy package, who are seasonal workers or, as in one of the stated cases, whose last child has turned 16. The benefit is not achieving what it originally set out to do—that is, be a supplement to the current wage, which is very low. If, for some reason, there is no need for it on a set date, then that should be taken into account at the time—or, as originally happened, when they work out the estimation on the previous financial year's income. The least able to average an income are the ones who are being penalised. A lot of people who have no real change from year to year do not have a problem; they can choose which way they wish the payments to be delivered. But those who are in real difficulty, who are really cash-strapped, are the ones who do not have a choice. Those are the people who cannot be put in a situation of having debts build up without their knowledge or understanding.
The poor in this country are most definitely getting poorer and the rich are being given an even greater amount of assistance, either through the taxation system or through generous giveaways to company directors whose views differ from those of their board or shareholders and who are therefore asked to retire. It is just not good enough. The system in place before July 2000 worked reasonably well, and there were ways to ensure that overpayments were recovered. They were not huge amounts anyway. The promotional material talks of helping families with the cost of raising children. It is paid for dependent children up to and including the age of 20 years, and for dependent full-time students up to the age of 24 years who are not getting youth allowance or similar payments like Abstudy or the education supplement for veterans' children.
The benefit is payable to those making up to the maximum of $30,806 per year and is reduced by 30 cents for every extra dollar of income. A total family income of $30,806 is not considered a very high wage at all and therefore the benefit will hardly come close to covering the expense of raising a family, as this government likes to project. If you then include this ridiculous clause of averaging over the present year, any gains that may have been made in half a year for a really low-income person are stripped from them if they happen to get a job that pays marginally more than the dole. What is the point of people seeking work? Why should people put themselves through this indignity, only to be hounded for a few measly dollars? The government should amend the current scheme to allow the beneficiaries of the family tax benefit to get some benefit from it. I will be seeking to have the assistance formatted in another way to overcome this ridiculous problem. In conclusion, I think we can do much better in dealing with people on low incomes so that they do not feel like criminals and outcasts when it comes to a few extra dollars being allocated to them to bring up their children over some very difficult times.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—It is a privilege and an honour to follow my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Lyons in his contribution on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. I was hoping that I might be forgiven for complimenting the ABC on their recent TV series about a high school in my electorate, Plumpton High. The third and final series was completed on the television last night. The program was about a school with an inspirational principal who provided the opportunity for those young teenagers who were at school and fell pregnant to return to school and complete their education. I said `inspirational'; I think he is a champion and he came across as very human.
By any account, Glenn Sargeant, the principal, could have said, `This is not my problem. We are in the business of teaching students, not dealing with students who happen to be pregnant.' But what he did was to own the problem. Interestingly, so few of those students were actually pupils of Plumpton High. In other words, Christian schools and public high schools referred these students on to Plumpton High and they found a happy home there to further their education. Glenn would be the first to say, `I didn't do this on my own. It required the cooperation of everyone: my teaching staff, parents and citizens, and not least of all the students themselves at Plumpton High.' He demonstrates a philosophy that schools are about caring for all the students and every student—a philosophy, I might say, not always practised in reality.
I thought there were a couple of interesting things that came out of Plumpton High. Firstly, in all the comprehensive high schools in my electorate, Plumpton High is the one school that had the highest number of students—seven, from memory—who, in completing their HSC, actually got in the highest 10 per cent in one of the subjects that they undertook. So this caring philosophy about all students obviously rubs off on the rest of the school. It is not a welfare philosophy; it is an education philosophy. It is about empowering students. Here, I think there is evidence that this inspirational program has a whole range of benefits for all the students. I also thought the other interesting fact was that so few of the participating students were actually students from Plumpton High. In having this group of young mums at Plumpton High, Glenn and the school really were, if you like, providing some of the best real-life sex education for their students, and the students at Plumpton High actually benefited in that way.
I take great pride in the fact that the Chifley electorate has been a real crucible for education reform in New South Wales public education—and there are many things that I could point to directly. But today I want to celebrate this wonderful success, this wonderful story, and the inspiration that has been provided by Plumpton High, particularly by the principal. Any study that looks at schools will tell you that the principal is the key ingredient, the key success driver, of any school. But, as I have said, Glenn would point to so many others as being equally responsible. He would say, `I can accomplish nothing on my own. I have to bring the whole school with me.' And so he has, and I commend and congratulate him on his outstanding success.
This school has tried so desperately, and generally successfully, to give people who we would otherwise discard and who we would otherwise say are of no value or deserving of no special treatment the opportunity—in his words, `empowered them to succeed'—to make successes of their lives and to provide a great parent model for the children that they have. Congratulations to Glenn Sargeant, congratulations to Plumpton High School and congratulations to all those associated with this program. I do not want to score cheap points, but of course this government always says what it is doing for child care. I say to my friend opposite: wouldn't it be nice if we actually had a child-care centre in the Plumpton High School grounds—readily provided, without the issue of not having enough space? For all that you say you wish to do about child care, why can't we have a child-care centre in the grounds? It would make a huge impact if we did.
I want to say a few things about the budget in the available time I have. Before I go to the generality of how families have been affected in Australia, particularly in my electorate, I will say that I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that both you and I share a concern about defence. I am surprised, at a time when the Prime Minister has said in a melancholy statement to the nation that we will soon be at war with Iraq, that this government has ripped out in this budget $660 million from defence. Over the next couple of years, that figure will grow to nearly $1 billion. At a time when the defence tempo has never been higher, this government is not giving defence extra money but is saying, `We are going to rip off $660 million this year in the budget and a total over the next two years of nearly $1 billion.'
How are they doing it? This is money that the government are recovering from Defence through property sales. There is a general proposition that this is a very worth while and appropriate thing to do. How can it be so today when, in 24 hours, we will be seeing a situation where some 2,000 troops who have been pre-deployed will be at war? I do not think we can pretend that sending 2,000 troops to be pre-deployed is doing anything but straining our defence forces beyond belief, given our other commitments in East Timor and Bougainville. This is the proposition from the coalition benches—that Defence could not usefully use this $660 million. I would be very interested to learn of any coalition member standing up here today debating these appropriation bills and advancing the argument that there are no logistics, no equipment and no additional personnel in terms of recruitment where this $660 million could be usefully deployed.
To finish on this issue, it is a tragedy that, of the top 20 capital items being purchased by Defence, 16 are delayed—16 of them have exceeded the budgeted time. The overexpenditure in terms of these capital equipments is some $5 billion. I am amazed that this does not receive greater attention from the government. At a time when we want to have confidence in what this government is doing in terms of predeploying 2,000 troops, it is amazing that it is ripping out of defence nearly $660 million in this budget and over the next two budgets nearly $1 billion—and not handing it back. At the same time, its capital equipment budget is shot to pieces in performance, both in terms of delivering the equipment and in terms of the cost.
It is true to say that Western Sydney families have never faced a greater tax burden than they are facing at the moment. They are burdened with record levels of debt, they are increasingly living off the credit card and Australia has a mammoth savings problem. Mortgage repayments are taking up more and more of the family budget. Consumer confidence is down and will be affected, no doubt, by this war and the threat of terrorism. Families feel insecure about whether their breadwinners will have jobs and whether their wages and salaries will be able to pay for the things that they need. The Treasurer's own budget papers reveal that he will increase the income tax burden on Australians—it will be even worse than it currently is. This is the highest taxing government since Federation. We recently celebrated the Centenary of Federation. This is the government that takes out the all-time prize. All the tax cuts that were promised as a result of the GST have disappeared in bracket creep—they are gone. This is the highest taxing government that Australian workers and their families have ever seen.
If you are a member of the opposition, you pay a great deal of attention to question time. It is one of the most unfair contests I have ever seen, although I had a different view when we were in government. Time after time the Treasurer says, `Look at what we've done for interest rates. Look at the savings that families are enjoying as a result of the reduction in interest rates on their mortgages.' There is some substance to that claim. I always felt it was a pity that the Treasurer would not explain how renters were also presumably benefiting from this. Of course, they do not. They are the big losers. They have not benefited. Can the coalition mount the argument that people who are paying mortgage payments today are better off because of these lower interest rates when compared to those under Labor? Even though the Treasurer reminds us of what interest rates rose to under Labor, the truth is that a greater percentage of people's earnings is now going into those mortgage payments than it ever did under Labor. Families in Western Sydney, families in the Illawarra, families in Newcastle and families all over Australia are now using a greater proportion of their earnings to repay mortgages than they ever did under Labor, notwithstanding the fact that interest rates are at a record low. Isn't that the real test—not the rate of interest on your home mortgage but the percentage of income you are paying into that mortgage? In 1996, when the coalition took over, these mortgage repayments were on average taking 38.9 per cent of median monthly family income. By 2002, that figure had grown to 43 per cent. If you live in Western Sydney, as I am very proud to do, it is now 54 per cent. For every $1 that a family earns, 54 per cent is going into their mortgage repayments ahead of anything else—ahead of their electricity, ahead of their food and ahead of their car.
Some people in my electorate get upset—and I have been accosted a couple of times—when I talk about struggling families. They say, `We're proud of what we're doing. Don't label us as struggling families.' Well, they are struggling. Those statistics—54 per cent of their income going to repay the mortgage—show what a diabolical state Western Sydney families are in. Who are the most vulnerable? It is not people of my age; it is the new families. Not families that have perhaps just moved into a house but families who have moved in the last few years, have a couple of children and cannot have both parents working—they are doing it absolutely tough. And this government should be doing something to address their needs. What is the government doing? What is the so-called champion of Howard's battlers, Jackie Kelly, my neighbour and the member for Lindsay, doing when she is talking to the people of Glenmore Park or any other new subdivision where families are facing 54 per cent of their income going into their mortgage repayments?
The other side of the story is the Treasurer, who gets up at question time and says how wonderful it is that interest rates are so low and we are saving so much on the average mortgage—and has done so day in and day out since they have been in government. What is happening to the First Home Owners Scheme? It is, at the moment, at the second lowest point it has been at in some time. The first lowest point was, of course, when Mr Costello himself became Treasurer. Now he has hit the double. The First Home Owners Scheme was all about trying to help ordinary people get into a home. And what is happening? Ordinary people are being denied access to the scheme while we are happily funding people into million-dollar homes. Is that what equity means? Is that what helping ordinary families means? Does it mean that we should have a First Home Owners Scheme in which people who go and buy million-dollar properties benefit, but ordinary workers who aspire to having their own home—their first home—are priced out of the market and see the scheme rorted and twisted in such a gross way? We need to have another look at the First Home Owners Scheme. It ought not to be about helping people into million-dollar homes. I do not mind people going into million-dollar homes—good luck and the best of British to them—but are they the most needy in our society? Do they need the Prime Minister's or Mr Costello's help to get into these homes? I say that that is an absolute abomination.
Before my time runs out, I need to say a couple of things to finish up. We have had a terrible current account deficit. The Prime Minister promised us that his first priority would be bringing down foreign debt and bringing down the current account deficit. Foreign debt? It has doubled in the lifetime of this government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you used to have a debt truck running around all sorts of electorates, saying, `We're worried about foreign debt.' The debt has doubled, and I would like to hear from the coalition what they think about that. Should we be relaxed and comfortable about a doubling of foreign debt? You said that this was going to be diabolical for the country. Well, it is double, so is it doubly diabolical? Struggling families in Western Sydney are under a lot of pressure, and a lot of it comes from this government.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—In speaking about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, I take the opportunity to make some general comments about economic mismanagement by the Howard government. I do so on the basis that, as a newly elected member of parliament, the last budget was the first one that I had the opportunity to sit through as an elected member. It came with great surprise, because the government members have always prided themselves on being great economic managers. There I was in the chamber sitting through my first budget as a member of parliament, and, despite years of record economic growth—a lot of it of course bequeathed by the legacy of Labor in power—it ended up being a budget that was in deficit, brought about by people who profess to the Australian community that they are great economic managers. That came as somewhat of a surprise.
The second surprise that has come to me over the past year is the fact that the Howard government is now the highest taxing government in all of Australia's history. The community were told, weren't they, that with the introduction of the GST there would be a rationalisation of the tax system, the burden of taxes would be lifted and a growth tax would be provided that could be relied on to fund essential community services? We have a situation where not only do we have a budget that is in deficit but we have a government which is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. 
Down the line, we are not seeing the benefits in basic services that were supposed to come with this new growth tax. Everywhere you look, basic services are under a great deal of stress, whether it be in the area of health, with significant declines in the rate of bulk-billing; in higher education, where massive cuts to outlays are putting greater pressure on students and their families; or at a local level when you look at child-care provision, as I have recently done in my electorate. There is enormous pressure to cater for the needs of an increasing number of families where both parents are in the work force and are unable to find places to care for their children before and after school hours.
In racing parlance, we could talk about the trifecta; but unlike the racing trifecta, where the punters think it is going to provide some gain and some benefit, the trifecta from this government has produced the exact opposite—the first leg of the trifecta is a budget in deficit; the second leg of the trifecta is the highest taxing government in Australia's history; and the third leg of the trifecta is that basic services everywhere are being cut and families are under pressure. People are seeing through the rhetoric of the government, which professes to pride itself on being a great economic manager. Ordinary families are saying, `Why is it that with all the promises that were made we are finding it harder to make ends meet?'
Tax from income is the highest ever as a percentage of gross domestic product. The irony is that Australians are paying more income tax than they were before the GST. The GST alone will reap the government about $30 billion this year. If that was not bad enough, it seems that the government cannot resist imposing more and more taxes—be it the dairy tax, the sugar tax, the medical indemnity tax or the Ansett ticket tax—which, on top of the income that comes with the GST, are adding further burdens. So life is becoming harder for the average family in this society under this government that professes to care for the plight of families and the battlers in our society. Debt levels are exploding. The average household debt is now about $81,000. And families as consumers are being slugged everywhere with high credit card interest rates and bank fees. With record levels of credit card debt, it is no wonder that Australians are saving less than ever before. More and more families are finding it harder to get ahead.
Many families in my electorate of Throsby fall into the category which we describe as the increasing numbers of working poor. Many are realising that a bit of extra overtime or a hard-won pay rise simply is not worth it after this government takes its unfair share of that extra income by way of the tax system. As my colleague the member for Chifley mentioned in his contribution, we all know that bracket creep is pushing many ordinary struggling families and workers into the very top tax rate for every dollar that is earned over $60,000. Far from the promised review of the tax system easing the burden and eliminating the duplication and multiplicity of taxes in the system, we are finding that the top tax rate is now penalising many workers who are out there struggling to make a living to provide for their families.
I want to quote from a letter which I recently received from one of my constituents. It is easy to fall into the jargon of `effective marginal tax rates' and `looking at the global picture' without appreciating the impact this is having on ordinary people. The letter I received a week or so ago from one of my constituents, Margaret Geeves, says it better than all the figures in the world. She says:
I am writing to you in the hope that something can be done about the taxation system that the Government has in place. It is not a fair and just system for all Australian people. There is no incentive to better oneself as I am about to explain in our situation. I challenge you to find someone in Government to justify and clarify why my husband is only $207 ... better off after receiving a work bonus of $1000. 
We are a single income family of six ... 
...						...					...
I am a stay at home mum by choice, which is my right as a mother and without family nearby for support.  We knew this would be a struggle without two incomes but we thought there would come a day when my husband was on a better wage and all would be worthwhile. We now find this is not the case ...
...					...					...
A friend advised me to phone Centrelink to see if my son, Rodney 18, was eligible for Youth Allowance as he is going to University this year and hasn't been able to get part-time work ... On ringing I discovered that Rodney wasn't eligible unless he left home and also that our Family Allowance would be reduced because my husband received a large bonus last September pushing us over the threshold. 
She goes on to say that her husband, again because of work performance, is expecting another bonus later this year but that, when they did the calculation at home, they found that for each thousand dollars over the threshold they actually lose lots of money. She says that, with $1,000, you take out the tax—minus 47 per cent, so that is $470—and then another 30 per cent, or $300, because the government takes back 30c in every dollar from Family Allowance for being over the threshold. She says that, out of this $1,000, they are left with $230 which, when spent, incurs 10 per cent GST, leaving them just $207 extra coming into their household which is not affected by tax. That is not much of an incentive, she argues, for being a stay-at-home mum and losing Family Allowance, especially with teenage children who cannot get part-time jobs. She continues:
We aren't extravagant. We drive old cars ... We rarely eat out. We don't wear designer or surf brand clothes. We don't have a holiday very often as it is too expensive to accommodate six people as we need to book two rooms. We haven't been away for three years and we were thrilled with the bonus and planned a holiday for July but it looks like we will have to cancel, as there is not much of this money left to use. 
She ends her letter to me as follows:
I hope there is someone in Government who knows what I am talking about when it comes to family matters ... The question I ask is how as a family can we see past today if the Government wants to take most of our well earned money?????? 
As a mother I feel I have contributed to society by being there for my children and am very proud to say that they are genuinely very nice people. I will never regret being there for them but I will always regret that the Government made it so damn hard to survive in a system that takes so much from middle income families on one wage who are unable to claim much tax relief. I know we are not the only ones going through this fate and would like the Government to realise that people like us with large families on single incomes do not fit into the rich category of paying the highest income tax and losing family tax benefits.
I raise that case because I have looked at the raw data. We talk a lot about how people are punished through bracket creep and by the loss of family support and other benefits that government provides. But here is a real case—one of many, I am sure, in my electorate—of a family that is struggling to do the right thing under a system which is penalising low- and middle-income earners.
I want to say something about a government that has little regard for the growing inequalities in our society. It does not appreciate the predicament of middle-income earners on one income, and it does not realise or deal with the growing inequality and injustice that we see everywhere around us. One-tenth of Australians now own 50 per cent of our nation's wealth, yet the poorest 50 per cent control just seven per cent of our nation's wealth. So the rich are getting richer, the middle is being squeezed out and the poor, while nominally making ends meet, are not sharing in the benefits of the kind of economic growth that we are seeing in our country. As a result of this, I think in this country we are losing our notion of a fair go. One thing we have always prided ourselves on is that there are opportunities in this country for families who are at the lowest socioeconomic end; wealth is not the measure of the opportunities open to people. Wealth was never the measure of whether you could access quality education and quality health care or—as is increasingly becoming the case in my electorate—ever see the front door of a tertiary institution.
As these economic disparities grow, they are impacting on our regions. The further away you are from the capital cities, where the big growth has occurred in many of the industries that are part and parcel of an increasingly globalised economy, the harder it is for many families and their communities. I am appalled to think that this government is refusing to support a modest increase in minimum wages in our nation. The ACTU is seeking a $456 minimum wage per week. I know that people say that politicians live in an ivory tower, divorced from the realities of life, but I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are well away from understanding the pressures of raising a family on less than $25,000 a year. While the income of the top 100 CEOs in our country is now in the order of $38,000 a week, this government—which professes to be on the side of the battlers—is denying battlers a wage increase which would bring the minimum annual wage to something like $25,000. The government washes its hands of regulating executive salaries, sits back while the golden handshakes are there in abundance and says very little other than a few tut, tut, tuts. It is denying people at the lowest end of the income scale the opportunity to raise their wages to $12 an hour, or $456 a week before tax.
Again I looked at the data, because I think sometimes simple comparisons prove the point I am making. The minister, the member for Warringah, comes into the chamber beating up on the low paid. Let us look at the comparisons between his electorate and mine. In my seat of Throsby, just under 30 per cent of families survive on an income of below $500 a week. This places Throsby in the bottom third of all electorates. It is a startling figure when you compare it to a number of blue-ribbon Liberal seats. A good example is the seat of the minister for workplace relations, who comes into the House telling us that we should not support a rise in minimum wages, arguing the furphy that somehow it will cost jobs. In the minister's seat of Warringah, only 10 per cent of families have an income of below $500. So the comparison is 30 per cent in Throsby and 10 per cent in the electorate of Warringah. Conversely, 53 per cent of families in the minister's seat of Warringah earn $1,500 or more a week. In Throsby, less than 19 per cent of families can claim that level of income support. The median weekly income in Throsby is $859; in the minister's seat it is almost double that at $1,572. 
That small example proves the point I am making: this government is presiding over an economy that is not delivering benefits to all people. While the government talks a lot about being on the side of battlers, it has no idea what a struggle it is for families in my electorate and in many electorates throughout this nation to make ends meet. Families are finding it harder to make ends meet because of the economic mismanagement of this government. About 70,000 people in my electorate receive some form of Centrelink payment. The example that I cited from one of my constituents, Margaret Geeves, shows that, when the family comes by an unexpected wage bonus because the husband has met performance criteria at work, the family allowance is reduced and the family is pushed into the marginal tax rates which the millionaires in this country never have to face. 
It is a sad indictment of this government's economic policies and its mismanagement of the economy that it produced a trifecta where the budget is in deficit, it is the highest taxing government on record, and the GST is imposing additional burdens because it is a regressive tax. People at the low end of the income scales are hit severely by that. We are also seeing basic services in areas like health, education and child care continue to suffer. In a few weeks time, as a newly elected member I will participate in the second budget brought down by the Treasurer. With the budget last year the government exposed itself as not having the right to claim that its members are great economic managers. They benefited from the legacy of the Keating and Hawke years in opening up the Australian economy. They have traded on the benefits that low inflation and high productivity brought with them. They should stand condemned for their failure to manage economic growth on the basis of delivering fairness and justice across this nation. 
It will not be too long before people understand that the kind of wealth inequalities and regional disparities we are seeing under this government mean that it is not a government that governs in the interests of all. This government has its eye on protecting those with the greatest economic advantage at the expense of all others. A government is elected to govern with the quality of life and living standards of families always at the centre of its concerns. The government over the last seven years has failed in that. More and more families are under pressure as this society becomes increasingly unequal, unfair and unjust.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—All of us will have an opportunity to speak in the House of Representatives on the large international issue that is facing Australia—the looming war—so I will not address that matter today, although plainly it is in the forefront of everyone's mind as they come before whichever chamber of this parliament. Instead I want to talk about some issues that relate specifically to my electorate and to concerns expressed to me by my constituents in areas that I believe warrant the attention of this parliament and the government.
The first issue I want to raise relates to growing concern that we do not have in place proper mechanisms to enable the complaints of those who are disaffected by long delays or difficulties in judicial proceedings to be heard and determined in an effective way. I, first of all those who might rise to speak in this house, regard as the most precious of our constitutional freedoms the fact that we have an independent and respected judiciary. That said, it is important to recognise that no human institution will ever be a perfect one and there will be instances of failure within the courts and tribunals as with all other institutions. Redress is an issue which has concerned many disappointed litigants. I don't mean those litigants disappointed by results; litigation is of its nature a process where one side often is disappointed because they lose. The kinds of matters I am speaking about are instances where there are delays, where there are discourtesies, where situations arise which ought not arise within an effective and fully functional judicial system.
I raise this matter because, over recent months, it has become plain to me that there is substantial concern amongst a large number of practitioners in my own state of Tasmania about delays in the Family Court. By mentioning this fact I certainly do not wish to take the parliament into any of the specifics. It would be unfair to those who have raised these concerns with me and it would also be substantially unfair to the judicial officers who are concerned, because I am not in a position to determine whether or not those complaints are well founded in each particular instance. All I will say, however, is that there is substantial concern and it has been expressed not by a single practitioner but by many and by a large number of constituents. That being the case it raises the issue of how we address such matters.
There is, of course, a constitutional way to address those matters. It is open for this parliament, by an address of both houses, to remove a judge who is unfit to serve. But such matters are exceptional in their nature, they are extremely controversial and they are simply not appropriate for instances where the deficiency might be one of protracted delay in particular matters or a series of matters, or where the matter might be better dealt with by counselling of the judge or finding some other mechanism of addressing a deficiency in conduct which might amount to, for example, rudeness in an instance. I am not making the suggestion that all those instances have been the subject of complaints that have been addressed to me. The complaints that have been addressed to me have related to excessive delay. The question is how do we address these matters?
When the Keating government was in office, former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch and I as justice minister spoke of establishing judicial charters within all courts. That is—recognising that it is not for the parliament or for the executive to step in and decide such matters because it would compromise the independence of courts—it was appropriate, nonetheless, for the executive to work with the courts towards developing appropriate mechanisms that would enable such complaints to be effectively addressed. The idea of a judicial charter is for each court to establish benchmarks for performance standards and to establish within the courts appropriate forums where complaints of breaches in those benchmarks could be made with no prejudice to parties that were advancing them. That is a very important point because, whether fair or otherwise, there is a sense that a complaint made in the course of proceedings to the chief justice or other officers of a court may indeed prejudice the manner in which a proceeding is being determined. That is an unfair view but nonetheless it is held, particularly by litigants, and one can understand that apprehension when there are no transparent complaint procedures in place.
A court charter process would establish within each court a framework where the court would publish performance standards. For example, it would say that after filings of proceedings an initial hearing to work through interlocutory stages would be heard and would be set down within a particular time frame. It would say that within filing of the certificate of readiness, or whatever documentation completes the paperwork in a particular court, hearing time would be provided within a particular framework. It would also indicate that after the conclusion of argument judgment would be handed down within a particular framework. These would only be guidelines, because plainly there are going to be cases where the complexity of those cases and the circumstances warrant greater than normal time being given to consideration of those complexities. But there ought to be an ordinary rule of thumb guideline which anyone can advert to to see the way in which proceedings should be determined. There also ought to be a mechanism for a person who feels that those guidelines are not being complied with to be able to have that matter dealt with in an effective way within the court system, fully respecting the independence of the judiciary.
I say this because I think our confidence in institutions depends on their capacity to accept that not all criticism directed against them is malicious. Indeed, part of their strength is their capacity to respond to proper concerns, which are addressed by the profession and by individuals who come before these institutions for the disposition of their matters. I know that most judges are fully determined to do all they can to deal with proceedings expeditiously and I know that there have been steps taken by the establishment of judicial institutes designed to encourage effective conduct within the courts. Those processes have the support of the chief justices of all the courts, but we have yet to establish effective mechanisms to deal with these instances. There needs to be some intermediate way of dealing with deficiencies that would never warrant an address of both houses of this parliament to remove a judge. Such a method is required which would enable instances to be addressed within the judicial system where a particular judicial officer does not meet those benchmarks. Hopefully they would be addressed as well as counselled and remedied. Also, those processes would need to be available and transparent to our public.
In this regard, the other remedy that currently seems available to those who feel they are suffering unwarranted and unconscionable delays is to take proceedings to the High Court of Australia for mandamus, directing that a decision be made and that judges, who are the officials of the courts, do the duty conferred upon them by the parliament and by their office. Again, that remedy is so exceptional that I am not aware of it having ever been resorted to—it is there as a reserve, but it should not be the kind of mechanism we need when these instances can be better addressed through transparent court charters that the courts themselves work to enforce.
It would obviously need a degree of collegiality within a court. Within each court the judges themselves are, properly, fiercely protective of their own individual independence as well as of the institutional independence of the court. They would not surrender that to any of their fellow judges, and nor should they. However, we are not talking about the decisional elements of a case. We are not talking about how a case is decided, or its outcome. We are talking about process issues, and there I think the courts are as accountable to the communities they serve as anyone else is. The responsibility that courts have to give efficiency and courtesy in the discharge of their functions is no less great than anyone else's. Their independence is conferred to preserve their objectivity so that they will not be influenced in any way by any process that might interfere with the best exercise of their judgment as to the merits or otherwise of any particular case. I have written to the Attorney-General on this subject in somewhat greater detail than I am going into in the House, but I thought I would take this opportunity to reinforce my concern by addressing this matter in the Main Committee today. I do regard it as one of substantial concern in my own jurisdiction of Tasmania.
The second issue I want to raise concerns the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. It is the issue of the licensing of the community radio station Cadence FM. Cadence FM was a small community broadcaster operating out of fairly primitive accommodation—basically, the transmitting facilities were run out of a domestic house. Cadence FM had a small and dedicated niche audience. It particularly served those that most broadcasters, including community broadcasters, do not serve. It served the aged, the handicapped and a number of other community groups, giving them an opportunity to present programming that was not available more broadly and to direct that to that niche audience. It also broadcast a lot of general community information, regularly interviewing aldermen and public officers and, in the lead-up to every election, offering the opportunity for extended interviews with all political candidates from every side. In that way, it played a small but important part in the life of the city of Hobart.
It is a great sadness of mine that Cadence FM has had its license removed recently. That license has now been conferred on a radio station that is being run out of the University of Tasmania. Students undertaking programs on that station become accredited as part of their media studies program. I think that university station is a damn good new radio station, and I have no dispute with its being conferred a licence. The problem is that the lack of intervention by the ABA and the minister has seen this play out as a zero sum game. The licensing of the new broadcaster was by way of competition, and the new winner only gained a licence as a result of the loss of Cadence FM's broadcasting licence. That was unnecessary. It was a stupid, intolerant, bloody-minded and quite unjustifiable outcome.
The university based radio station made submissions that it did not want to see Cadence FM lose its licence. When it was forced into a position where it was in competition with Cadence FM, naturally it went for the throat. The two radio stations argued their cases in the public domain, and now the enmity between people who should be of goodwill is tearing decent Tasmanians apart. I am not suggesting that every Tasmanian is overwhelmed by this debate; it involves only handfuls of Tasmanians, but those handfuls feel passionately. They are entitled to have their views listened to and given greater respect, but the ABA and the minister have chosen not to do that.
There is no technical reason why two licences could not exist. Unlike Sydney or Melbourne where the frequencies may be limited, in Hobart there is no plausible justification for controlling and limiting the number of community broadcasters for reasons of spectrum. There is plenty of spectrum. Having another broadcaster would not interfere with anyone else's broadcasting entitlement. We have now reached what I think is an absurd position, where a small, dedicated, community minded radio station has been driven out of business and is forced to litigate in the courts to test the procedural validity of the licensing program. If it wins that litigation the outcome will be that the university radio station will lose its licence, and the whole process will have to be gone through again.
I have written to the ABA and to the minister saying, in effect, `You are mad. You are ripping people apart unnecessarily. Why don't you do the sensible thing: stop all this defensiveness of past conduct—the court proceedings and the like—and simply get on with the job that you are supposed to do, which is to allow those who are not represented in the commercial domain—who are not able to get licences for commercial broadcasting and do not want to broadcast other than to particular niche markets as non-commercial free-to-air broadcasters—an opportunity to do the task that the licensing system was designed to implement?' Thus far, I have found the responses to be incomprehensibly unhelpful. The minister refers the matter back to the ABA. The ABA says that it will be for the courts to decide. Now their lawyers are seeking costs. Who are they seeking costs against in relation to proceedings that are partly on foot but not fully developed? They are seeking costs against people who run community broadcasting on a shoestring basis!
This is one silly mess. For the life of me, I cannot understand why somebody does not just bring the ABA into a room and say quietly to them, `Can't you fix this up? You've got plenty of spectrum. You've got a small broadcaster, Cadence FM, that had a niche audience.' I have tabled petitions from 2,000 constituents seeking re-establishment of Cadence FM's licence. It probably only had 3,000 or 4,000 listeners, tops. Maybe on an average day it had only 200, 300 or 400 people listening to it, but those are people I have met. I have met the elderly who listened to it. I have talked to them. I have met the people who suffer from disabilities and who used the service. They now do not have the effective resource that they relied on. The university has a good station; let us keep that. Why this had to be resolved in a zero sum game, where one must win and one must lose, is beyond me. Sometimes politics works that way, but good administration need not.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—In my contribution on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, I wish to deal with two matters. The first is the importance of medical research to the future of Australia's economy society. The second involves a matter relating to misuse of taxpayers' money. I will turn to that after I have dealt with the question of medical research.
The medical research community has a very strong presence in my electorate, particularly in the Parkville precinct. There are a substantial number of institutes and organisations there that are involved in medical science and medical research. Many of those have a proud, internationally acclaimed record and have produced enormous breakthroughs on matters that are of great concern to people not only in Australia but also throughout the world. Australia has produced four Nobel Prize winners from the field of medical research—Peter Doherty most recently, of course, but also John Eccles, Howard Florey and Macfarlane Burnet. We have a long and very glorious history in the field of medical research in our country, and I want to put the case today for greater support for, funding of and commitment to medical research from the government and the nation as a whole.
We are up there with the world leaders in many areas of medical research right now, including areas such as mental health, particular childhood diseases, asthma, arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease and various other areas of medical research that are all ultimately connected with improving people's lives, saving lives and ensuring that more people—both in Australia and around the world—can lead better, more productive lives, free of disease and free of the threat of premature death which arises from so many diseases and illnesses. I wish to cite a few contemporary examples of the benefits that are emerging from Australian medical research, to illustrate the point that this sector is critical to our future, economically, and is producing great results and great outcomes for our society.
My first example comes from Western Australia, where the Lions Eye Institute has created an artificial cornea. That is something that scientists have struggled to develop over many years. It gives a better option for people than the previous approach of human donor implants—which has been applied for some people. This has been in the development process for around 12 years, with funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is now approved for use in the United States, in the European Union and in Australia. Argus Biomedical, which is manufacturing the product, has built a production facility in Perth. The product is called AlphaCor. It is a major step forward in the battle against eye disease, and it has the capacity to give new hope to people who are suffering from particular eye problems. We now have the capacity to offer them an artificial cornea—something that has been developed in Australia with the assistance of government financing through the National Health and Medical Research Council.
My next example comes from Adelaide. At Adelaide University, in concert with a biotech company called GroPep, we have seen recent research on infertility that has identified a particular protein called the transforming growth factor beta, or TGFB. It is believed this may hold the key to understanding the problems of recurrent miscarriage and persistent infertility which ensures that women are not susceptible to successful IVF treatment. This research may ultimately lead us to some dramatic changes that will ensure that the curse of infertility is substantially diminished as a result of a greater understanding of the origins of infertility and the precise factors which are involved in causing it.
Another example comes from Monash University, in my home state of Victoria, where they have been doing substantial research on hamstring injuries. This research may sound a little less vitally important than work relating to issues such as infertility and eyesight. Nonetheless, it is very important for many Australians and indeed people in many other parts of the world. These injuries are the bane of many people in sport, particularly elite sportspeople, and this research is about identifying the particular susceptibility factors which tend to cause hamstring strains. Any members who, like me, follow AFL very closely will know that some players have a history of being susceptible to hamstring strains and get them very often, while others, for various reasons, get them much less often. This research is about determining the susceptibility factors—the elements in a person's make-up or muscle structure which mean they are more susceptible to hamstring strains—and developing better training techniques and better approaches to the use of muscles to ensure that the incidence of these kinds of injuries is diminished substantially. Although that is not a life or death benefit, it nonetheless will be of great benefit to many people, as we will see fewer injuries of this kind for people engaged in sport—not only at the elite level but also at the ordinary Saturday afternoon level which so many Australians do participate in. The more we improve that experience so that more people are able to participate, the better our health outcomes will be and the better will be the outcomes for our society as a whole.
The final example I want to cite is from the ophthalmology department at Melbourne University, which is in my electorate. They have made developments with respect to age related macular degeneration, which is a phenomenon that causes significant eyesight problems later in life. Essentially, deposits of fatty material in the retina cut off nutrient supplies, severely damaging people's eyesight. Research at Melbourne University has found that this condition is linked to a gene which governs the amount of cholesterol in the system, and it is possible that the appropriate use of anticholesterol drugs may enable this problem to be solved. Again, through appropriately funded medical and scientific research, a serious problem that does diminish the lives of many Australians is being addressed and a solution is being developed.
Not so long ago, I visited the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in my electorate, which also has a very proud, strong record of innovation and research on a pretty modest budget. It now has a cooperative research centre connected with it, as well as a variety of programs and commercialisation with individual companies. That institute has delivered great returns for our society over the years—in recent times it has done that through developing things like drugs to tackle the widespread problem of influenza and in times gone by it did that through work on a range of other problems. It is an outstanding example of the many medical research organisations in my electorate which deliver great outcomes for our society.
I want to make one final comment on this issue. I want to make a plea that this sector be treated seriously when dealing with government money. In recent times, we have seen a pattern where state governments—and to some extent the federal government—provide one-off subsidisation to a range of economic activities. Sometimes there have been contests between individual state governments to get particular facilities sited in one state rather than in another state. This has gone on over call centres, back of office centres, factories and, in some cases, installations that were always going to occur somewhere in Australia. For example, we had a bidding war between states over the location of Virgin's aviation headquarters, something that was an intrinsically domestic activity that was always going to be located somewhere in Australia. Mostly, these kinds of bidding wars are absurd. Ultimately, they involve a waste and misuse of taxpayers' money. They often involve jobs which will not necessarily last into the longer term—particularly things like call centres—and they do not necessarily involve high-skilled or well-paid jobs. They are a sign of desperation on the part of particular state governments, desperate to be seen to be producing employment outcomes of whatever sort. They are not necessarily the most appropriate way to allocate scarce taxpayers' dollars to produce better economic outcomes.
Medical and scientific research—and, indeed, some related fields such as the manufacture and design of medical instruments—have great prospects as a base for future export activity and the development of skills and knowledge that will drive a first world living standard for our economy into the future. Several years ago in the wake of the Wills review, the government, to its credit, significantly increased the amount of money dedicated to medical research, but that amount of money is going to run out in the next couple of years, and this issue will be back for reconsideration.
It is vital that we now start the debate about our society's commitment to medical research and the national government's commitment to funding it, so that people in the sector know that there will be an ongoing commitment. Aspiring researchers—who are not particularly well paid—need to know that the opportunities will be there to achieve great things for our society and for the health and wellbeing of Australians and people around the world. Ultimately, that is what motivates them. People do not enter these fields for reasons associated with earning high incomes or great money; they enter them predominantly for reasons associated with the idealistic belief that they can improve lives.
It is up to us, as the parliament of Australia, and it is up to the government of Australia—of either political persuasion—to make sure that we have the capacity as a nation to mobilise that idealism and to fund research in a way that ensures that we can maintain and improve our position as one of the world's leading locations for medical and scientific research. That, in turn, will produce an array of very important positive economic spin-offs that will ensure that our nation continues to enjoy a high standard of living and to have a very large number of well-paid skill based and knowledge based jobs, giving Australian kids something to aspire to in the future.
The second matter I wish to turn to is the totally inappropriate use of taxpayers' money to further the influence of a very powerful Liberal Party powerbroker. Several Fridays ago, the Financial Review carried a 16-page colour supplement advertising the Grand Prix in Melbourne. According to sources within the Fairfax organisation, this supplement cost the Grand Prix organisation $120,000. It was negotiated directly with Fairfax by the chairman of the Grand Prix Corporation, Ron Walker, who also just happened to have been appointed to the Fairfax board.
This is a highly peculiar advertising strategy with respect to the Grand Prix. The Financial Review is a national newspaper with a relatively small circulation of, from memory, about 95,000 per day. A large percentage of the Financial Review's readers are not based in Melbourne. A very substantial proportion of those who read the Financial Review, given that it is predominantly consumed by people in the corporate sector on higher incomes, would be people who, if they were going to the Grand Prix, would be attending as guests of their own or other companies, in corporate boxes and corporate entertainment facilities for which they are not actually buying tickets. So why the Grand Prix Corporation would be spending $120,000 to advertise in the Financial Review in this way is very difficult to explain.
It is of great concern that the Victorian government provides significant subsidies to the Grand Prix, and there has been much controversy over the years about the level of transparency and accountability associated with the involvement of taxpayers' money in the Grand Prix. This $120,000 payment to Fairfax is highly questionable, as it has been orchestrated by a member of the Fairfax board who is in complete control of the Grand Prix organisation. Ron Walker has effectively used Grand Prix and taxpayers' money to buy his way onto the Fairfax board. There is an obvious conflict of interest between his role as a Fairfax board member and his role as chairman of the Grand Prix Corporation in this matter.
I put these matters to Fairfax a week or so ago, seeking an explanation and asking whether these facts were correct. The only response I have received has been a stonewall, indicating that Fairfax does not give out information about particular advertisements—how they come about or what amount of money has been paid for them. No attempt was made to provide any kind or justification or explanation for the events that have occurred and no refutation was offered of the facts that I have just outlined.
This kind of corporate misbehaviour is typical of the corporate world, the business world, under the Howard government. If Ron Walker is to continue to run the Grand Prix as a personal fiefdom and to handle advertising matters of this magnitude personally, including the implicit subsidy from taxpayers, he should resign from the Fairfax board. We are again seeing the ugly side of Melbourne Inc.—which was inaugurated under the Kennett government and which is still resonating, in some respects, since the Kennett government's demise—because corporate governance is an issue that is dealt with at a national level and this behaviour is being allowed to continue by the Howard government. Ron Walker should not be allowed to misuse taxpayers' money to further his personal corporate ambitions in this way. There is an obvious conflict of interest, and it should be ensured that he does not participate in these kinds of activities in the future. He should resign from the Fairfax board to ensure that all of these matters are dealt with in an appropriate, transparent and accountable way.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—We have just seen the seventh anniversary of the election of the Howard government. In considering the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, we have a timely opportunity to examine the spending patterns of this government, the areas in which it has chosen to invest and, perhaps more tellingly, the areas that have been neglected and the ramifications of those decisions on ordinary Australians. While indicating that Labor will support these appropriations, my colleague the shadow Treasurer, Bob McMullan, has moved an amendment, which I am pleased to support, condemning the Howard government as the highest taxing government in the nation's history. This government not only sees fit to impose on the Australian people the highest ever level of income tax but also has an insatiable addiction to increasing taxation by stealth, by imposing levies and other special charges. Certainly the people in my electorate of Bowman in Queensland are not fooled by this trickery. They know that a tax by any other name is still a tax that adds to the burden shouldered by local families.
Just last week I was approached by Mr Malcolm Lack, the manager of a small business based in Capalaba in my electorate, with regard to the huge impost that the sugar levy, introduced by this government to recoup the cost of the sugar industry reform measures, has proved to be for his operation. Mr Lack runs the Alchemy Cordial Co. and produces an extensive range of cordials and coffee syrups. It is a great example of a thriving locally based enterprise and has been recognised as such, having been named runner-up in the Telstra Small Business of the Year award for the last four years. Alchemy employs six local residents on a full-time basis, and during peak production periods between 10 and 12 employees will be on board. The company has doubled its trade every year since its doors first opened six years ago and, until recently, had entertained very realistic expectations that this trend would continue and distribution figures would again double within 12 to 15 months.
But, given that at present production levels Alchemy goes through over 150 tonnes of sugar a year, the sugar levy of 3c per kilo is a heavy burden for this small business and, understandably, my constituent has some questions that he wants answered. Most importantly: how long will he be liable to pay the sugar levy, and will there be any support available from the government should his business suffer as a consequence of the sugar levy? Mr Lack says that food and beverage manufacturers are already suffering the effects of the rising cost of sugar, which has gone up $50 a tonne over the last few years. As the levy costs cannot be passed on to the consumer, the additional $30 a tonne charged on all domestic sugar sales comes straight out of Alchemy's bottom line.
So the sugar levy has the very real potential to slow down the growth of the company, limiting the company's capacity to expand operations and offer more employment opportunities in the Redlands area of my electorate. Although a rebate is available when sugar purchased by manufacturers is used in the production of food and beverage items for the export market, my constituent points out that this is of little assistance to local enterprises, which tend to be small to medium sized businesses and have a limited capacity to fund the research and marketing needed to expand into overseas markets. Alchemy does export to the UK and has just dispatched its first order to New Zealand, but the vast majority of its product is sold on the domestic market through department stores and coffee shops.
Mr Lack is not alone in his concerns that the sugar levy is putting Alchemy and other Australian food processors in a vulnerable position. The Australian Food and Grocery Council also contends that the sugar levy puts domestic food manufacturers at a direct disadvantage against all imported and foreign-made food and beverage products. But the levy is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Mr Lack understandably wants to know if something can at least be done to lighten the burden of the compliance and administrative costs associated with the levy.
Currently, Alchemy is being billed for the sugar levy at the end of each quarter, which can be a huge imposition on the cash flow of a small business, especially when the bill falls due at the same time as the BAS statements and payment of the superannuation surcharge for employees. My constituent suggests that many businesses would find the bitter pill of the levy easier to swallow if they were able to pay at the time sugar is purchased. I understand that it is currently projected that the levy will be in place for approximately five years. As such, I am sure that the many small businesses like Alchemy, a sector the government claims as its natural constituency, would appreciate a reassessment of the method of collection to ease the burden on their time and budget incurred under the current system of administration.
The amendment moved by the opposition recognises that, while it has managed to eat away at the budget surplus of which it was so proud, the government has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people. Quite simply, the government's priorities are dramatically out of step with the concerns felt by ordinary people about bread and butter issues—both in my electorate of Bowman and across the country. During the last sitting week, we saw the Prime Minister turning his back on universal health care, articulating his intention to reduce Medicare from a system that provides quality health care for all Australians to a second-class safety net for pensioners and poor people. This is clearly out of kilter with the views of my constituents in the Redlands and Bayside suburbs of Brisbane. Every day, my office receives calls from constituents concerned that they cannot find a doctor who will bulk-bill, that they cannot afford to pay the growing gap between the rebate amount and the fees their doctors charge, much less find the funds to pay $35 up front each time they go to the GP and then wait for a rebate from Medicare.
A recent survey of surgeries in my electorate undertaken by my office found that only 10 practices had at least one GP who would bulk-bill indiscriminately; one clinic would bulk-bill existing customers but not new patients; 13 surgeries offered bulk-billing only to pensioners, veterans and health cardholders, although two of those extended bulk-billing to consultations with children; and 10 practices offered no bulk-billing at all. Health department figures released during Senate estimates reveal that in the last two years there has been a 12 per cent drop in the number of bulk-billing services in my electorate of Bowman. In the Wynnum-Manly area and the Redlands, patients are now being asked to pay an average of $13.48 each time they visit the doctor. That is an increase of 70.5 per cent on the out-of-pocket costs that patients in our community experienced two years ago.
The Prime Minister's plan to dismantle the universal health care system, guaranteeing access to bulk-billing only for those with a health care card, together with his plan to put the price of prescription medicines up 30 per cent, would mean that individuals and families earning over $30,000 could lose access to bulk-billing. If families do not have a health care card, they will need a credit card when they get sick. It is a daunting prospect for families like the Fornos of Cleveland. Glenn and Kate Forno have lived in the Redlands for nearly 20 years. During that time, they have been heavily involved with the Redlands Swimming Club, the Thornlands primary school and the Cleveland District State High School, where their children were educated.
They are also mainstays of the local asthma awareness group; it is something they know a lot about, as Kate is a chronic asthmatic. Both of the Forno children suffered from severe asthma and during their childhood required constant care and supervision because of their condition. Upon hearing of the government's proposal to downgrade Medicare into a second-class safety net for pensioners and health care cardholders, leaving everyone earning more than the modest income of about $30,000 a year paying more for the health care on which they depend, Kate Forno wrote to me seeking my assistance to ensure that this government is aware of the impact such a move would have on families like hers living with chronic illness. Kate writes:
I am now a severe asthmatic, requiring nebulization at least four times a day. I also have diabetes from the asthma medication and I have just had a Fundoplication to repair the damage caused by constant coughing. I have been hospitalised 3 times in the last 6 months.
I am very concerned about the proposed changes to Medicare. I visit my doctor once every fortnight as part of a Government initiative to control asthma and prevent complications from the disease, I see an asthma specialist as required, an endocrinologist bi annually, a gastrologist as required etc.
The drain that my medical and pharmaceutical costs place on our family income are enormous and the fact that my GP bulkbills me for visits helps greatly. If this small concession is removed we will cope, but when the time comes for my husband to retire it is going to be nearly impossible for us to maintain our current level of health funding.
Kate goes on to say that the chronically ill should be able to access quality health care without the worry of how the cost of treatment will impact upon their family. She concludes by saying:
I do not feel that the chronically ill should have their peace of mind constantly undermined by a Government seeking to justify its spending in other areas. Stress plays a major part in my illness and this is one stress I don't need.
Another area in which my constituents are really feeling the ill effects of cuts to government support for basic services is child care. Child care not only assists parents to balance their family and work commitments but provides our children with a vital opportunity to develop social skills and begin a lifelong path of learning. Accordingly, ensuring families have appropriate access to child care should be amongst the government's top priorities. Sadly, under the current government this is not the case.
I regularly receive phone calls and letters from parents in our community who are unable to find suitable child care. In particular, parents are unable to access services for children up to 15 months old. I understand that each child-care centre is limited to offering eight places for this age group. In areas like the Redlands that are experiencing an influx of young families, demand for infant care far exceeds the number of places available. The situation is becoming so dire that many centres have unborn babies on their waiting lists, while one service has reported being contacted by parents seeking advice on the best time to have their baby in order to secure care.
While family day care centres will provide care for infants, they are unable to offer parents a place for their child, having had no increases in the number of places available in the last two budgets. I noticed that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was recently on Channel Seven's Sunrise trying to allay parents' concerns about the shortage of places and reminding them that long day care places are not capped. This is great news if your children are aged between two and five and you will only ever require assistance with care between six and six from Monday to Friday. But it offers little solace to the growing number of families who work long or irregular hours, whose child-care needs cannot be met by long day care centres and who rely on the flexibility that family day care can provide to balance their work and family commitments. It also fails to address the concerns of parents of many school-age children who are unable to secure a place in outside school hours care. During a recent meeting with service providers in my electorate, which was also attended by my friend and colleague Nicola Roxon, the shadow minister for children and youth, a community based OSHC service told us that, although they have 150 places, they have 60 children on their waiting list. Some parents have resorted to giving eight-year-olds house keys because they cannot find a place for them in supervised care.
While the government is to be commended for introducing quality assurance, QA, in recognition of the importance of ensuring that children are being provided with the best possible care, the distribution of QA information by the National Childcare Accreditation Council appears to have been badly botched due to budget restrictions. During our meetings recently, care providers explained that, although they had received copies of a workbook aimed at providing parents with an overall explanation of the QA system translated into a variety of languages, the quality practices guide which provides care providers with information about the standards they are required to meet has only been produced in English. The National Childcare Accreditation Council advised centres that there was no money to produce translations, which puts carers who have English as a second language in a difficult position in their attempt to get up to speed with QA.
At the Bayside Family Day Centre alone, carers come from five different language backgrounds. In other centres around Brisbane, I am aware that as many as 24 of 28 carers come from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Yet, even if centres are prepared to foot the cost of having guides translated to assist carers, they have been issued with a warning that translating the guide will amount to a breach of copyright. This leaves centres between a rock and a hard place. They are required to meet the government's standards and are committed to providing quality care to children in their charge, but to do so they need to be able to provide carers with every assistance to become familiar with the six quality elements and 32 principles that summarise and define quality in family day care. They are not being offered the support they need with regard to carers from a non-English-speaking background. Broadband funding—which covers the administration of quality assurance and accreditation, the operation of subsidy family day care services, Aboriginal services, training money, the disadvantaged areas subsidy, the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme and much more—is currently under review by this government. Parents and carers alike have told me that each one of these areas is in desperate need of increased funds.
The situation confronting the Rogers family in Capalaba is a compelling example of why this review should not be limited to an examination of the current division of resources amongst the competing interests that I have just mentioned; it should extend to a careful re-examination of the amount of funds provided to these important programs—which is currently a measly $174 million and is set to increase to only $180 million in the next financial year. 
Kevin and Yuki Rogers have just had their second child. Their eldest son, Mark, is three years old. He suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, which prevents him from walking, crawling or sitting up without support. He is totally reliant on an electric wheelchair. If Mark were a healthy three-year-old, he would be able to take advantage of the fact that long day care places are not capped and would be able to secure a place in a child-care centre without too much difficulty. But because he requires special care and needs one-on-one attention, his ability to access child care is reliant upon the availability of funding under the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. 
During the last few months of 2002, Mark was able to attend Redlands Child Care Centre at Alexandra Hills but, without renewed SNSS funding, they were unable to offer Mark a place for 2003. Community based service programs Access and Play Care had been able to offer some assistance in caring for Mark, but this support has also been discontinued due to budgetary constraints. Having a child-care place for Mark is an invaluable resource for the Rogers family. The time that Mark is in care allows Mrs Rogers not only to have a break from the pressure of the constant and careful care she provides to her son but also to have time to attend English literacy classes at TAFE. As a relatively new migrant to Australia from Japan, these classes not only help her to develop her language skills but also offer her a valuable social outlet.
Mr and Mrs Rogers have no family in Brisbane whom they can call on to assist in caring for Mark, and Mr Rogers is often away from home with work commitments. Therefore, access to a child-care place is essential if Mrs Rogers is to continue to attend her classes and have the opportunity to meet new people, thus breaking the cycle of isolation that might easily set in if she had no support to care for Mark. Nationwide, there are more than 600 children on the waiting list for SNSS funding, children who, like Mark, have severe medical conditions or disabilities and have ongoing high support needs and are seeking to be included in the programs of eligible child-care services. I was disappointed that, when I wrote to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about the Rogers' situation and their increasing anxiety about being able to access care for Mark, he offered not even a glimmer of hope that the subsidy would be extended to meet the needs of the hundreds of families affected. He advised:
I am unable to give you an indication as to when funding will become available, as this is dependent on funds being released by children leaving the scheme. 
That is just another example of the government's disregard for the basic services families need. The government knows that there is an unmet need—it acknowledges that openly—but it is not prepared to do anything about it. To my way of thinking, this government is sadly out of touch with community values. It is happy to subsidise private health insurance subscriptions across the board regardless of income levels, but it will not even contemplate investing money to assist the families of children with disabilities to access child care and thus give those children a valuable opportunity to mix with their peers.
It is fair to say that generally people do not mind paying their fair share of tax, but they do like to see that they are getting something in return in the way of government services. With the highest ever level of income tax and a raft of levies and special charges in place, the Howard government is the highest taxing government in Australian history. What does the average man or woman on the street have to show for it? The basic needs of families in our local communities are being neglected: the burden of basic education costs is increasingly being shifted onto parents; entry-level housing is becoming less affordable; waiting lists for public housing continue to blow out; the government is withdrawing support for the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement; Medicare is under unilateral attack; having already been hit with the responsibility for administering the government's GST, small businesses involved in food and beverage production have now been stuck with the sugar levy; and, across the country, 50,000 children are waiting to access appropriate child care, while children with special needs are excluded from the mainstream system. It is time for the government to reassess its priorities, to respond to the concerns of its constituents and to deliver on its basic responsibility to ensure that access to housing, health care, education and support for families is a right for all Australians and not just a privilege for those fortunate enough to be able to afford it.
Finally, I refer to comments made this morning by my colleague the shadow minister for families, Wayne Swan. He was talking about the fact that this government at the present time is only concerned, naturally, with the most pressing issue of the day—which is, of course, the impending war on Iraq and Australia's association with it as part of the coalition of the willing. I make the point that, yes, it is a very serious issue for Australia, and it is one that is being debated in the House at the moment. But what this government is doing, quite wrongly, is taking its eye away from the ball. Wayne Swan made that clear this morning when he said:
There are many other pressing issues in this country regarding basic services and what government's responsibilities are to the people of Australia that are being disregarded.
People may be coaxed away from thinking about these issues while we have the big issue of the war, but sooner or later—and it will not be too long—people will be asking this government to be held to account. Services are sadly lacking in many areas and services need to be improved, and this government should know what it is doing in this area.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 serve to remind us that the budget is in very difficult circumstances, notwithstanding the Treasurer's aura of self-satisfied conceit. The government has resorted to an ever increasing number of special levies and charges—in addition to the GST—record income tax collections and skyrocketing HECS charges. At the same time it has failed to respond to pressing community needs. Nothing has been done to reverse the collapse of bulk-billing throughout vast areas of Australia or to respond to the growing demands of the public hospital system. The government has failed to invest in our public schools, TAFEs, colleges and universities, and is set to demand that students pay more. It continues to stall on paid maternity leave and ignores the declining affordability of entry level housing for struggling young families in regions such as Western Sydney.
Today also serves as an opportunity to canvass a number of budget related issues that face our migrant communities. The additional estimates statement for the immigration portfolio details some minor adjustments to the budget provision for migrant settlement services. These are, as I say, quite modest in nature. However, the big issue facing migrant welfare agencies at present is Minister Hardgrave's review of migrant settlement services announced out of the blue in August last year. It is being conducted entirely by DIMIA and the minister's office and it is supposed to be looking at client access to services, integration of services, funding, accountability and innovation, and flexibility in service delivery and funding models. From the outset there has been an understandable suspicion concerning this review because of the manner in which it is being conducted. Previous reviews of migrant settlement services involved committees of independent outside experts and extensive community consultation. That was certainly the case with the Galbally review, which reported to the Fraser government in 1980, and the Jupp review, which reported to the Hawke government in 1986. Both of those reviews contributed significantly to the development of an excellent migrant settlement system that was inherited by the current government and is constantly promoted by them overseas.
The latest review is notable for the complete lack of any real involvement by groups or experts outside the department. Rightly or wrongly, this has created the suspicion that the current review is designed to deliver a predetermined outcome. According to DIMIA, over 140 written submissions were received in relation to the review. In addition, over 1,000 people attended the 13 consultations chaired by Minister Hardgrave or the further 26 consultation meetings conducted by the department. Since then there has been absolutely no feedback to those who made the effort to convey their concerns, experience and suggestions to the review. All we are told is:
... the results of the consultations, together with analysis of submissions, will be incorporated into a final report which will be presented to the Government in early to mid-2003.
There is no firm timetable for the presentation of the final report and, as yet, no guarantee that the public will ever see the release of this document. There is a particular concern that the review may result in a reduction or complete withdrawal of DIMIA funding to longstanding, established ethnic communities. Currently, a number of these communities—such as the Italians, Greeks, Poles, Ukrainians and Turks—receive CSSS grants in individual states and territories, often for projects that focus on the elderly or on young people. These are under threat.
There is a feeling afoot that some in the government believe that DIMIA settlement services should be restricted to a narrowly defined category of new arrivals. They argue that after some arbitrary initial settlement period, such as five years, the welfare of migrants should be the responsibility of mainstream welfare services. This thinking seems to presuppose that migrants do not face ongoing settlement issues. It also simply assumes that mainstream services have the resources, language and other skills and staff to provide the community development, information, advocacy and casework services that established migrant welfare agencies obviously provide. To a significant extent, both these assumptions are based on a purely theoretical view of the world that does not accurately reflect the realities of life in multicultural electorates such as my own.
The government has issued two recent signals about this direction in the review. Firstly, in the recent DIMIA portfolio additional estimates statement, it revealed that an extra $575,000 had been allocated to the CSSS in 2002-03 to continue funding to established community groups. It said it was doing so because all the budgeted CSSS funding had been diverted to new and emerging ethnic communities. Interestingly, the extra allocation is for 2002-03 and 2003-04 only, with the allocation for next year reducing to only $192,000. We have not yet been told the identities of the established ethnic communities who are affected by this move or what the future holds for them once this one-off funding ceases. From my travels around this country I can assure the minister that significant concern is felt by established communities, in particular by those from Eastern and Southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.
The second signal that significant changes are afoot came when funding applications were called for in early February for the 2003 program. Minister Hardgrave's media release of 3 February included two paragraphs that are worth quoting in full. It said:
Outcomes from the Settlement Services Review, which will more effectively target and maximise migrant services across agencies, will be announced later this year. Until then, the national funding priorities remain the same.
In 2003, funding is available for periods of nine or 21 months from 1 October 2003 in order to align the scheme with the next financial year. The sector was advised of these arrangements at the time of the 2002 grants announcement. To allow outcomes of the Settlement Services Review to be advised to the sector in 2003, a third year of funding is not available.
Taken together, these statements leave the government room to make substantial changes in the months ahead. The published national priorities for the scheme only remain in place until the review is finalised, and all CSSS grants will expire in either June next year or June 2005. The 2003 funding round will be the first in many years in which funding of three years duration will not be available in any circumstances whatsoever.
I will now turn to the issue of translation services. One of the longest established services is the Translating and Interpreting Service, or TIS, which was established by the Whitlam government 30 years ago. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It employs around 2,000 contractors and covers more than 100 community languages. Anyone familiar with the settlement service would realise that governments of all persuasions have traditionally been forced to set strict priorities for TIS. Access to fee-free interpreting is limited to doctors in private practices, unfunded community organisations, emergency services, councils and trade unions—excluding compensation or litigation cases. That provides settlement assistance to permanent residents. Other Commonwealth or state agencies, private businesses and those helping temporary residents must pay to use TIS's telephone or on-site interpreting service.
The document translating service provided by TIS is even more restrictive. Basically, it only provides fee-free translations of approved documents such as birth and marriage certificates, statements of educational attainment and employment references for newly arrived permanent settlers within their first two years in Australia. On its web site, DIMIA states:
DIMIA does not provide translations to other individuals or clients such as provisional and temporary visa holders or government agencies. A commercial provider will need to be sought for such cases.
Knowing this, I was very surprised to discover that Minister Hardgrave conducted a mass mail-out on 3 March, forwarding an Arabic translation of Mr Howard's 4 February speech on Iraq. He said he was doing so `so that all members of the Arabic-speaking community can have access to it'. As we now know, the translation turned out to be in back-to-front Arabic that was totally unreadable.
While the mistranslation is extremely embarrassing for the government, that is not the limit of our interest in this matter. The broader questions involve the extent to which DIMIA and its resources should be used to disseminate partisan propaganda about the foreign policy of the coalition government. In this debate about appropriations, we are entitled to ask the following questions. Who authorised the use of DIMIA resources for this exercise and on what basis? On what basis was it determined that the Arabic community was not fully aware of Mr Howard's position on Iraq? What liaison occurred through Mr Howard's office in deciding to conduct the mail-out at taxpayers' expense? Was a TIS contractor used to prepare the translation? If so, was this not in contravention of the TIS business rules that indicate that they do not prepare translations for other government agencies? If the translation was prepared by a private firm or contractor, what was the firm and how was it selected? Who was responsible for checking a translation that was totally unreadable?
How many organisations and individuals were sent the document, and how and by whom were they selected? I understand there have been figures of about 150 recipients tossed around. To how many organisations that are not Arabic, do not use Arabic script and do not speak Arabic was this Arabic text to the Prime Minister's speech sent? For what value it would have been sent to them, I cannot work out. What was the total cost of the exercise, including the translation costs, printing costs, staff time for its dispatch and postal costs? Who met these costs? Under what appropriation item were these costs incurred? Who decided to authorise a further mail-out last week, enclosing a second, corrected and, pleasingly, readable translation of Mr Howard's speech?
This farcical episode has blown up in Minister Hardgrave's face. It is high time he had a good look at the way he relates to Australians of Arabic background. He seems to apply double standards to them and imply that they will be treated as second-class citizens if they raise public debate about legitimate domestic and foreign policy issues. His original appointment was to try and give a nice face to government, given the erosion of support in some ethnic communities in this country. He was to be the backslapper, the friendly face to counter the concerns about refugee policy. To some extent he has succeeded in that. With regard to the Arabic community, I think we have had a few worrying developments in how he seems to think he should fulfil his role.
We had him sending out a special warning to the ethnic media in this country that they should be careful about how they increase tensions in this country with regard to foreign policy issues. He did not send it to the Daily Telegraph; he did not send it to the Herald Sun; he did not send it to a number of other groups which inflame tensions in this country and stereotype people. Politicians on his side of politics should perhaps have been good recipients. He did not do any of that. He gave a special warning to the ethnic media: be quiet, be careful and do not increase tensions, because we have you in our gun sights. Similarly, when in Sydney there was an attempt by the Arabic-speaking community to raise questions about the suitability of suggested ASIO and terrorism legislation proposals, he once again went into the public saying that Arabic speakers should not raise their heads too high and should not put their views too clearly, because this would increase tensions in our country. As I said earlier, there is a clear pattern of trying to force the community to be quiet and to acquiesce in government policy. To my mind, there is a degree of intimidation in the way he is performing in this portfolio.
I recently met with representatives of the Community Broadcasting Foundation and the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters Council to discuss their budget proposals for the community broadcasting sector. It is not well understood that the community broadcasting sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, with the freeing up of the issue of broadcast licences. In fact, over a five-year period, the number of licensed stations has more than doubled—to 420 long-term community radio and television stations. These include 260 community radio stations, 104 ethnic community radio stations, and smaller numbers of religious and Indigenous stations and stations for the print handicapped.
Unfortunately, the expansion in licensed stations has not been accompanied by a parallel increase in federal government funding. As a result, the average amount of core funding per station has actually fallen by 46 per cent, forcing stations to resort to greater voluntary fundraising efforts and levies on user groups. This process cannot be allowed to continue because, quite clearly, it is extremely difficult for these stations, which are performing a very important public role, to raise this kind of money in a very competitive market.
I am especially appreciative of the efforts of our diverse and internationally respected 104 ethnic community broadcasting stations. They perform a vital but often unrecognised service for established communities and new arrivals. In fact, the sector now broadcasts in some 97 languages each week, vastly exceeding the reach of other media sectors. Volunteers are the lifeblood of the community broadcasting sector: 25,000 of them assist at present, including 4,000 volunteer ethnic broadcasters.
For some years the Australian Ethnic Radio Training Project has provided skills training for new ethnic broadcasters. I have seen the work of the project at first-hand. I have seen young people who have been involved in conducting programs, running interviews and learning the technology later on going out into the broader broadcasting sector in public roles and becoming recognised in important jobs in this country. I have had nothing but positive feedback about the project, which has operated for several years with minimal government funding. Unfortunately, the initial funding provided to the project will be exhausted by the end of this financial year. Further funding is needed for the project to continue and be extended to the rest of the community broadcasting sector. I strongly support the project's continuation and emphasise the need for the government to allocate the necessary ongoing funding.
I referred earlier to the correspondence the minister directed specifically to the ethnic broadcasting sector in which he tried to say that it should be careful about arousing tensions in this country by being too controversial in regard to Middle East foreign policy positions. I have said it before and I will say it again: the community broadcasting sector in this country is vital to us, because the reality is that a number of foreign stations are now able to broadcast into this country and into homes in our electorates and make available broadcasting from overseas. I have to say that not all of this material is attuned to the multicultural tolerance of this country and not all of it goes towards harmony and understanding. Some of the material broadcast is of a very extreme nature, pushing hard agendas of intolerance and the stereotyping of other groups. We have to be aware that this is a new difficulty with globalisation and with the expanding penetration by foreign media of various countries. This is another reason why I say that it might be preferable if the government, rather than attacking Australia's national community broadcasting sector and trying to intimidate it and push it around, put greater emphasis on supporting it, because this sector often is a bulwark, a hurdle for these overseas stations to defeat in the marketplace. This sector includes people who have migrated to this country and become citizens and permanent residents. They understand the culture of the country, they understand what is expected of them and they are very much attuned to the needs of the country. Regardless of the fact that people occasionally get upset about comments or political statements by the sector that are not in tune with the views of official political parties, it is a very worthwhile sector.
I return to the question of the migrant resource centres. Once again, the opposition puts on the record its strong support for community involvement in this field. I have had the opportunity to visit the vast majority of the MRCs around the country. They involve large numbers of residents; people who have many skills and a commitment to the community and who provide their time to help new arrivals and established communities. There is a danger that this government will move towards erosion of community control and be more inclined to bring in—as it has in the welfare and the labour market employment sectors—charitable and religious organisations which, although they are not per se groups that we attack, may not have the experience or the life-knowledge of these MRCs.
On occasion it has been necessary for Labor and coalition governments to take funding away from some MRCs because of a variety of problems. We have been supportive of some closures in the last year or two when it was clear that there were indefensible practices in some centres. We are not saying that we support mismanagement, theft et cetera. We are saying that, as a broad concept, community control is desirable and it should be supported rather than undermined by the coalition. MRCs want real support in this review, not backslapping and various polka dances around the room from the minister. They want long-term community support. As I indicated earlier on the question of funding, the more established communities—whether they are Croatian, Portuguese, Italian or Greek—still have problems. Their funding should not be reduced in any fashion with the excuse that they can now be dealt with fully by mainstream services.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—In speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, I thought it would be appropriate to look at the total gamut of the government's actions, where they have taken us to today and what this means in terms of the budget, the economy and where Australia is heading in future. In this time of war I am sure there are many issues that are weighing very heavily on the minds of ordinary Australians as they sit around their kitchen tables and ask where the government has taken them, the country and our troops.
Yesterday I spoke on the declaration of war by the Prime Minister. I put on the record my opposition to war without the sanction of the United Nations, the international community and the Australian people. I believe it is very important for all members of parliament to take the opportunity available to us to put on the record where we stand personally, not just as party members, on these issues. Yesterday I also listened intently to a number of speeches made by government members of parliament, and I was very disappointed because I found that government MPs were struggling to articulate a clear message as to why their government had decided to send this country to war. They could not quite come to grips with the reasoning; they could not articulate any sound reasons. They went backwards and forwards in their speeches about how we actually came to this point. The majority spoke of their views on countries like France, Germany and others, and they spent most of their time attacking these other countries—much as will happen in this war. I thought it would have been more important for government members to outline the process the government used to make the decision. The reason they did not is quite obvious: it is that it was a very poor decision making process. I was also extremely disappointed with the gutless silence of government backbenchers—I am not going to mention ministers. I hardly heard a peep from any backbenchers. On the crucial matter of this country going to war, there was not a word. The silence was deafening, as they say.
Further, the government have silenced this parliament by cancelling question time today. There is a real scrutiny available through question time that is not available in any other forum, but the government have decided that there will be no question time today. Just like their decision about the war, it is not acceptable. Question time should go ahead today. There is ample time to have both the question time forum to scrutinise the government and the debate for government and opposition members to speak on the issue of war. As it stands already, the opposition have agreed to cut the speaking time on this issue from 20 minutes to 10 minutes so we can accommodate all members, but this is no excuse to now turn around and say that question time should not go ahead. The government really are turning their backs on the Australian people by not allowing question time—that very important debate—to take place today. This also reflects on the way the government manage business in the House and the way we have to deal with matters in here. For quite some time, there has been a lack of management, a lack of professionalism, in this House with respect to how time is actually allocated to make sure we get our full opportunity to speak and put on the record the views of our constituents. The Howard government were first elected on this platform of reform and they talked very much about the Howard battlers. What I want to do today is talk about the Howard battlers.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 12.56 p.m. to 1.15 p.m.
—As I was saying before the suspension, I want to turn my attention to the so-called `Howard battlers' who were so prominent in speeches by John Howard during the 1998 election campaign. It is quite obvious now that the Howard battlers are all but gone from government focus. This government has completely forgotten all the battlers out there—all the workers, all the ordinary people—that it said it would govern for. In fact, I remember the Prime Minister making a promise that he would govern for all Australians. Instead, over the past seven years we have seen a government that governs only for those who are well-to-do—for those who can afford things and for those who can fend for themselves—rather than for those who need assistance from the government.
This came to me very clearly over the weekend. I held a community forum in my electorate on families and I invited the local community and some guest speakers. One of the guest speakers at the forum pointed out a range of issues that I think are really important about the inequality and the great divide now being created in the community by this government's policies. This speaker was Morrie O'Connor, President of QCOSS, the Queensland Council of Social Services. He spoke on a range of issues, but most importantly he drew people's attention to the inequality created when some families can afford two new cars, or two very good quality cars, whilst other families struggle to get by with one old vehicle. A family with two vehicles can afford to do a variety of things and go to work, but a family struggling with one vehicle cannot. They have to run the kids to school and then go to work. It is much harder when they have to share a vehicle. In the same vein, some families out there not only own their own homes but are purchasing other homes and properties for investment. At the same time as this is occurring, more and more Australians are finding it difficult to purchase their first home and more and more Australians are actually homeless or struggling with higher rents as rental property values increase. Morrie O'Connor also pointed out the issue of shares. There are many families out there now buying shares to create more wealth, but unfortunately there are even more families—more than ever—who cannot share in any of the wealth that is being created in this country.
If you look at the issue of jobs and training, some people in the community have better access to jobs. They have better access to highly paid, full-time jobs with bonuses that carry an amount of security. Unfortunately, many people in the community do not share that luxury because, under this government's policies, they are getting part-time work, casual work, work that is not secure and work that does not deliver bonuses—work that makes life very difficult for them. These are the differences. It is good that people can better themselves. I am not talking about people not bettering themselves; I am talking about the growing gap, the great divide in this community, being created by this government. When we look at work, that is of particular importance.
When we look at tax, we can see that a greater number of earners at the high-end can minimise their tax. Proportionately, they can reduce the amount of tax that they pay to government. Another great advantage they have is that, because they are higher wage earners—much higher than previously—they can use all sorts of advantages to make life easier. At the lower end of the scale are the majority of Australians—the growing majority of Australians that the Howard government said that it would govern for—and they are missing out. They have no access to tax minimisation. They have no means by which they can improve their lot. They pay their PAYE tax—they pay all of their taxes—and then they are slugged even further with other taxes, the taxes that are hidden through the GST and so forth. When we look critically at the proportion of a person's income that goes out in tax, it is those at the lower income end who pay by far the most tax in total—not only the total of all of their income and earnings but the most in the whole scheme of tax that the government collects as revenue. When we examine who has the greatest burden of tax on their shoulders, we see that it is not those who earn the most—it is not proportionate; it is in no way fair and equitable—it is those who have the least capacity who pay the greatest proportion.
If we look at the area of education, again there is a growing gap between the elite—those who can afford access to the best schools and the best facilities—and everybody else struggling on tighter and tighter budgets to even afford a state education. These people struggle to afford books and uniforms and to give kids a little bit extra and get them to the school camp once a year or on an excursion or a field trip. There is a growing inequality between those who have access at the higher end and those who do not. These are things that we have seen distinctly over the past seven years through appropriations, through budgets, through what this government has squandered in spite of the great advantage it has had: the great advantage of a strong economy. The government always talks about a strong economy. Great! What are you doing with that strong economy? What are you delivering for people who need to have something delivered from a strong economy? It is being wasted; it is being squandered. At the educational level we will miss out in the future. The people who will miss out are the young kids who do not have the sort of access and resources they need, the young kids going from school to TAFE, university or vocational training programs.
If we look at the area of health, what have the big differences been? What really marks the seven years that the Howard government has been in office? For most people, the area of health is probably the most critical and the most crucial. We have seen a dismantling, a pulling apart, a running down and a denigration of our health system in this country. It has been run down to the point where very shortly—and this is happening at an incredible pace—the credit card will be mightier than the Medicare card and access to health care will be based only on what you earn, not on what you need. This will be a great tragedy in this country, more than any other issue, and it will be the hardest one to fix. Again, the government talks about its great low interest rates, the strength of the economy, how it managed to survive the Asian financial crisis and all of these things. But what has it done with it? Where is the delivery of services? Where are the things that people need on the ground? Where are the health care services that this government has a responsibility to provide? They are not there.
In terms of universal health care, we are seeing the Prime Minister's aim over the last 20 years finally coming to fruition: the dismantling of the health system. It is a two-tiered system. You have one system for those who can afford it; they pay and they get health care. Then there is a minimal, bottom of the line safety net for those who do not have any other choice; they pick up the scraps. The scraps of health care are what they will be left with. It is a two-tiered health system which we see in countries like the United States of America, and it is criticised by many countries. Under the United States system of health care, when you come into the hospital emergency ward, whether you are bleeding to death or not, they ask you: `What sort of health insurance have you got? How are you covered? How are you going to pay us for saving your life?' The care you get is based on that ability to pay. This is something I never want to see in Australia. This is something that all Australians should rise up against. Health care will be the biggest issue—bigger than war, bigger than any other issue in this country. Ordinary people—the families, the mums and dads, the aged and those struggling—understand that when they have to take their family down to the local GP, who has been the mainstay of the health system in this country, they will now be forced to pay up-front fees. There are fewer and fewer doctors bulk-billing. Families with two or three kids often ring my office and say: `I've just gone down to my local GP and they're no longer bulk-billing or taking new patients on their books. They want us to pay up front.'
Quickly do the sums: if it costs $45 to see the GP and you have three kids, that is a big whack out of your already minimal income for the week. Most people use 50 per cent or more of their total net income to pay for just housing. If you start taking anywhere up to $150 out of their weekly income, they are really struggling and probably cannot afford to put food on the table. This is something that is being completely ignored by the government, and it is something they should be absolutely condemned for. They should be condemned for what they have achieved in their seven years in areas like health care, health access, housing and a whole range of others. 
The picture that I have painted for people listening today or reading these words is a picture of reality; it is a picture of what the government have strived very diligently to do. They have not been slack in moving forward in their campaign to ensure that the best services go only to the wealthy and everybody else has to pick up the scraps. It does not matter where you turn; I have talked about health, education and tax, and I want to also talk about housing. Housing has become very unaffordable under this government. The government have driven the market to a position where people have been priced out of it. Ordinary people can no longer afford a home. The First Home Owners Scheme is a good scheme; it has flaws in it, but it is a good scheme. It has flaws in it because, under this scheme, millionaires buying their first home—a million dollar home—are being subsidised by this government with taxpayers' money, while many other people out there are struggling to buy their first home because they get very little assistance from this scheme. They cannot even get into the market because the prices of many homes throughout Sydney, Melbourne and most capital cities around this country have been driven up in a false market, I believe, with low interest rates. While low interest rates are obviously good for people, it also means that many people miss out. They have also driven up rents. For people who cannot afford to buy a home and who are renting, rents are now becoming out of reach as well. As I said earlier, for many people, more than 50 per cent of their income is spent on their housing. Do your sums on that. If you are a member of parliament, if you are a high wage earner, and 50 per cent of your total income is going towards just providing a roof over the heads of your family, it does not leave a lot for education, health and many other things.
This government has forced people into a system called Lifetime Health Cover with the threat that, if they do not pay up, they will miss out. Many people jumped on board out of fear. What we are now seeing is that many people are hopping off that truck because they know they have been conned—and they also know that they just cannot afford it. The Prime Minister made very loud promises about the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover and said that forcing people to pay private health insurance would force down premiums. I can remember him saying over and over and over: `This will be good for the economy, good for people, good for families. It will force down premiums.' But what have we seen in reality? What is the fact today? Premiums are going up consistently and constantly. The government has just approved the increase in premiums by another seven-plus per cent. This is a system that does not work. It is costing the taxpayer a recurring debt, every single year, of between $2½ billion and $3 billion—and that will only get worse. These are the sorts of debts that this government places on the heads of ordinary taxpayers with the little they can afford.
This is also the highest taxing government in history—not only in direct taxes but also in indirect taxes through the GST and other taxes. There has been the sugar levy, the airline ticket levy, the milk levy, gun levies and the East Timor levies, and I will make a wager with people here that there will have to be a war levy of some kind. This government is prepared to commit our troops to war, but it does not know how it will pay for it. It is prepared to introduce more taxes and more levies and rip money out of the pockets of ordinary families, but it does not know how to spend it properly. This is a government that is out of control, that has lost its way, that has forgotten the battlers it talked about when it first came to office—the Howard battlers. Never forget the Howard battlers. Where are they today? They are struggling. They are often homeless. They are the ones who need better health care. They are the ones who need entry level access to housing. They are the ones who need their kids to be better educated so that they can have more opportunities to get the higher paying jobs that those in the top five per cent of this country now get. It is a disproportionate redistribution of the wealth in this country, and it is a sad, sad indictment of the government. This week was a black week, as the Leader of the Opposition said, in terms of the war, but it has also been a black seven years—black on the economy because, while it does well, only the top five per cent get to share in it. The government should be condemned for its views, its actions and its policies. (Time expired)
Sitting suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 4.01 p.m.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. I particularly want to talk this afternoon about our present direction on Australia's environmental policies and to map out a future course. Let me make two opening remarks before I get into a more conceptual piece. If you looked at the House of Representatives Notice Paper, you would think that Australia was an industrial relations basket case. I admit that the agenda for this week has been somewhat altered, but the Notice Paper lists five workplace relations bills for debate next week: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002, Workplace Relations Amendment (Simplifying Agreement-making) Bill 2002, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002. On this week's paper, there is also the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 and Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002.
The situation is pretty similar on the Senate's order of business. There is the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. If you looked at the Notice Paper and the order of business, you really would think, from that focus on the part of the government, that we are living in a workplace relations nightmare—an industrial relations basket case—whereas the government frequently informs us that there is very little going on in the way of industrial action.
By comparison, the agenda for many other policy areas—including the environment, my own area of portfolio responsibility—is threadbare. Next to nothing in the way of legislation in that area is coming forward. Compared with our industrial relations situation and with many other portfolios, the environment is an area of real stress and difficulty. That has been pointed out by independent reports such as the State of the environment report, which was released last year; the land and water audit; and information put forward by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the CSIRO and a host of other independent and authoritative sources. All those independent assessments said that there are real problems. I intend to turn to them in more detail shortly. It really is astonishing to see this government's legislative priorities according to the Notice Paper.
The other introductory comment I want to make concerns the issue of ethanol. Since ethanol levels in motor vehicle and other engines have been noted at levels of up to 20 per cent, motorists and consumers generally have been concerned about this issue. Motor vehicle manufacturers have said that ethanol at levels in excess of 10 per cent could damage motor vehicle engines and that use at this level would void manufacturers warranties. Major motoring organisations around the country—the NRMA et cetera—have called for a 10 per cent cap on ethanol levels to protect motorists.
In September last year, Labor acted on those legitimate concerns by announcing a clear policy on ethanol content in petrol. We would cap the ethanol content at 10 per cent and we would require labelling where ethanol levels exceeded five per cent—a clear policy to protect motorists and consumers. Did the Liberal government adopt this policy? No. Did it take any action at all? No. Treasurer Costello said that motorists should be careful, that they should not buy petrol with too much ethanol in it. How are they expected to know, when the federal government has failed to use its powers to require labelling? The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, said that action was a matter for the states—a classic piece of buck-passing.
The Howard government commenced a fuel sampling program in April 2002. It tested 520 fuel samples from service stations across Australia. Of those, 42 samples—or eight per cent—contained ethanol. Most of those had ethanol contents of between 15 and 20 per cent, while several had ethanol contents of more than 20 per cent. Most of the results above 10 per cent were from New South Wales. This information was released to the opposition in answer to questions we asked at Senate estimates hearings. The Howard government, having done this testing, has been in the unique position of knowing that petrol with ethanol content in excess of 10 per cent was out there in the marketplace, but it has refused to tell anybody about it or to do anything about it. The way the government has sat on its hands over the ethanol issue is improper and inappropriate.
Why hasn't the government been prepared to take action on ethanol? Why hasn't it been acting in the best interests of motorists and consumers? Perhaps the answer lies in the AEC return from Manildra Flour Mills for 2001-02, which shows that since the 2001 federal election Manildra has donated over $70,000 to the Liberal Party and $52,000 to the National Party—and, in case anyone is interested, nothing to the Labor Party. Manildra, run by Dick Honan, a good friend of the Prime Minister's, is Australia's largest ethanol producer. Australia needs a Prime Minister, a Treasurer and an environment minister who will make decisions based on the best interests of motorists and consumers, not on political donations received.
I said that I wanted to make some remarks about environmental issues in Australia more broadly. I first became interested in environmental issues as a boy. I got interested in Australian birds, plants and animals, and I became involved in efforts to protect them through protecting Australian bushland. When I was a teenager, I got involved in the conservation issues of 1969 and 1970 in Victoria—the protection of the Little Desert and the Lower Glenelg. It was indeed these interests which led me into politics, and many years later I was delighted to be given the opportunity to serve as shadow minister for sustainability and the environment in Simon Crean's shadow cabinet.
Australia is unique. It is one of a handful of countries with mega-diverse flora and fauna. For example, it has over 700 different species of birds. It is particularly unusual in being a politically stable country with mega-diverse flora and fauna—for example, the northern part of our country has tropical rainforests and Cape York Peninsula has tropical savanna. Other areas of the world with similar botanical regions, such as the Amazon Basin, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, simply do not have a similar level of political stability. This is, by any yardstick, a ripper country. Anyone who is born in Australia or who comes to live here has pretty much won Tatts Lotto.
When we ask ourselves what it is that is so special about Australia or when we ask migrants and tourists what it is that they love about Australia or, for those of us who have had the opportunity to travel overseas, when we ask what it is that is different about Australia compared with other countries, one of the first things that comes to mind is the quality of our environment—the quality of our air, the quality of our drinking water, our unspoilt beaches and our unique and diverse wildlife. All these things make Australia a special place, and having these things imposes on us a special obligation to protect them and to hand them on to our children in as good a state as we found them. We have an obligation to protect our environment for our children and, indeed, to protect it on behalf of the rest of the world.
Australia can and should be an environmental showcase. We have a wonderfully diverse array of habitats. We have ancient and beautiful flora and fauna. We have breathtaking scenery—mountains and beaches which stir and invigorate the soul and deserts and plains which calm and repair it. Notwithstanding European settlement, we are still in the position of having cleaner air, purer water and more unspoilt beaches than any other country on earth. But we will not keep these things just by sitting on our hands. They are threatened by climate change, by indiscriminate land clearing, by profligate use of water, by erosion and by salinity. I believe that the biggest environmental issues confronting Australia are climate change, land clearing and our use of water.
I mentioned earlier the State of the environment report released last year. It must serve as an urgent wake-up call for all of us. The report details a litany of failures. Increasing areas are affected by salinity and land degradation—dryland salinity is predicted to affect two million hectares of native vegetation by 2050 and 5.7 million hectares are now affected by or at risk of salinity. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing—in 1998 they were 16.9 per cent higher than in 1990. With regard to land clearing, only four other countries exceeded our rate of clearance of native vegetation in 1999. Around 400,000 hectares of native vegetation are cleared in Australia every year, which in turn kills up to 10 million birds, including threatened species. We have unsustainable levels of fishing in some fisheries, and sediment and nutrients from land based activities are placing pressure on coral reefs. The rate of production of non-renewable energy is growing faster than the rate of production of renewable energy, and we have the highest per capita level of hay fever sufferers in the world. We have significant increases in the extraction of surface water for irrigation, and we have declining surface water quality.
In launching the report, Professor Bruce Thom said that its primary finding was that Australia is still not sustainable in environmental terms. There is little evidence to suggest that we have made any headway since the last State of the environment report in 1996. For every step forward, we appear to have taken many more backwards. I believe we have to tackle these problems, but I believe that the task need not be to our economic detriment. In the words of former US President Bill Clinton, `If we do it right, protecting the climate will yield not costs, but profits; not burdens, but benefits; not sacrifice, but a higher standard of living'. There is a huge body of business evidence now showing that energy savings give better service at lower cost with higher profit.
One of the critical issues confronting Australia today is water. This year, 2003, is the International Year of Fresh Water. We have just been experiencing one of the worst droughts on record, and many of Australia's river systems are in poor and declining health. We need to use 2003 to devote much more attention to the health of our river systems. A key new year's resolution, if you like, for 2003 must be to secure more water for the Murray-Darling Basin. The mouth of the Murray River would now be closed if it were not for dredging. We have scientists estimating that, unless we do something urgently, Adelaide water will be undrinkable two days out of five within 20 years.
Scientists tell us that the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin have a moderate chance of survival if we deliver an additional 1,500 gigalitres of water and even less chance if we do not. The federal government, in consultation and partnership with the states, must deliver a long-term plan which will support the provision of 1,500 gigalitres of extra water for the Murray-Darling Basin over the next 10 years. We need to act to secure and restore the health of our river systems, by guaranteeing water flows to ensure basic river health, providing flexibility of water allocation that recognises that natural flows vary seasonally and over time and clarifying water access entitlements and the responsibilities that go with those entitlements.
Governments can find solutions. The once mighty Snowy River had become a trickle but the New South Wales and Victorian governments together have started putting water back into the Snowy to ensure that it will flow again. In the International Year of Fresh Water, we need a national water policy. Our task is to find water for our farmers and irrigators, environmental flows for our stressed rivers and sustainable supplies for our cities and urban industries. Last year's national land and water resources audit found that 84 of Australia's surface water management areas are either close to or overused compared with their sustainable flow regimes. Many river basins in New South Wales have a greater than 100 per cent water diversion as a percentage of sustainable flow regime. There are too many nutrients in 43 river basins, water is excessively turbid in parts of 41 basins and water is too saline in 24 basins. In much of the state of Victoria, water combines all three of these problems. I believe the Year of the Outback was a disaster for the outback. We need to make sure that the International Year of Fresh Water is a year of progress for our stressed river systems.
I want to talk next about the related issues of salinity and land clearing. If we are serious about salinity, we must tackle its principal cause, which is land clearing. The best way to prevent salinity is to control land clearing. Unregulated land clearing is the principal cause of rising salt levels in our soils and rivers. It also destroys the habitats of birds and animals and degrades the land, and cleared and rotting vegetation contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Unless we are able to control land clearing, we will face even greater devastation and loss of productive land, continuing greenhouse gas emissions and the extinction of a range of native birds, plants and animals. Since European settlement, Australia has cleared 90 per cent of native vegetation in the eastern temperate zone, 50 per cent of rainforests and one-third of forest or woodland.
Back in August last year, the actor Jack Thompson spoke stirringly at the National Press Club, calling on the government to control land clearing. Some of the disturbing statistics on land clearing that he highlighted included the following: a piece of land the size of a football field is lost to salinity every day, 60 per cent of coastal wetlands in southern Australia have been lost and 20 billion trees have been cleared since 1788, with over 70 per cent of Australia's native vegetation cleared or substantially modified. Thousands of volunteers plant hundreds of thousands of trees each year on days like National Tree Day. They know that we have a problem. But, because the laws preventing indiscriminate land clearing are inadequate, for every tree planted by volunteers, 100 are cut down. We need to stop the year in, year out decline in our native vegetation cover.
I want to turn now to the critical global issue of climate change. The CSIRO has reported that New South Wales will be 2.7 degrees Celsius warmer by 2050, with double the number of droughts. The number of Sydney days over 35 degrees Celsius will rise by 50 per cent. Insurance and reinsurance companies the world over are already taking a bath as a result of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events—
—Was that a pun?
—Indeed. We have had cyclones, storms, floods, bushfires and the like. A document was released by the environment minister at the end of last year entitled Living with climate change: an overview of potential climate change impacts on Australia. The following were some of its findings. Firstly, Australia's water supply and hydrological systems are likely to become increasingly vulnerable to climate change due to projected drying trends over much of the continent, with stream flows in parts of the Murray-Darling Basin decreasing by as much as 45 per cent by 2070 and increased river salinity and saltwater intrusions to ground water from rising sea levels. Secondly, natural ecosystems may undergo significant and irreversible damage, with the World Heritage listed wet tropics of Queensland potentially reduced by as much as 50 per cent and endemic species decreasing their current range size by 63 per cent. Thirdly, the RAMSAR-listed Macquarie Marshes, semipermanent and ephemeral wetland vegetation, may reduce by up to 40 per cent of their original area by 2030, resulting in less frequent breeding events and local extinctions.
The report recognised that we will get natural adaptation, but that will probably be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of our coral reefs, with increased incidence of coral bleaching, damage from cyclones and reduced growth rates from higher CO2 levels. At the other end of the spectrum, the report indicated that the alpine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change, predicting that a 1.8 degree Celsius temperature increase will cause snow areas to decline by two-thirds by 2030, significantly reducing alpine habitats. This finding was reinforced by the Victorian government's Alpine resorts 2020 report, which shows that climate change is soon to have a significant effect on Victoria's snowfields, with a reduction in snow cover at alpine resorts predicted within 20 years.
In south-west Western Australian, a study on climate variability and change found that there has been a decrease of up to 20 per cent in winter rainfall over the past 30 years. It has been predicted that a long-term decline in rain in the south-west will occur between now and 2070. An increase in temperature since 1960 has already occurred and a further increase of up to three degrees in the average maximum is predicted over the next 68 years. The conditions for drought are going to worsen over the next half a century, and climate change is resulting in conditions that are more variable and less predictable than they have been previously. South-west Western Australia has, in effect, suffered 25 years of drought conditions—that is climate change, clear and simple.
The work by the CSIRO makes it clear that, if we do not do something to curb it, climate change will make our future droughts more frequent and more severe. Australia can and should be an environmental showcase. If we take action to halt land clearing, if we take action to contain greenhouse gas emissions and to curb climate change and if we use our water more wisely, we will become an environmental showcase. We need to resolve to do everything we can to see that we do become an environmental showcase and to ensure that we can pass this beautiful country on to our children in at least as good a condition as we found it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I rise in this cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 to highlight some of the important issues affecting my region of central Victoria. I have raised the Calder Highway funding issue many times in this House. I again demand that the Howard government fund the Calder Highway in the forthcoming budget, and I demand that it commit itself to the Bracks state government's completion date of 2006. The betrayal by the Howard government on the issue of the Calder Highway is a matter of major political concern in the Bendigo and central Victoria region. Bendigo is the only major provincial centre in Victoria that does not have a fully duplicated highway to Melbourne, and that means that both Geelong and Ballarat have a big and unfair advantage over Bendigo. That rankles with central Victorians, who pay big fuel taxes and see them siphoned off by the Howard government to fund big city freeways like the Scoresby Freeway.
I now want to place on the public record some of the history surrounding the Calder Highway funding project. The Howard government declared the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo a road of national importance in November 1996. The Commonwealth has the primary responsibility to declare Australian roads roads of national importance. The states put forward proposals, but ultimately the Commonwealth decides if it will or will not declare a particular road a RONI. The Calder had been funded previously using federal government funds from the national arterial road program. The Hawke Labor government funded the duplicated section from Big Hill to Ravenswood from this program. The highway received its road of national importance status because of its role as a strategic road link from Melbourne to north-west Victoria.
On 3 June 1997, the then transport minister, John Sharp, declared the Calder Highway, from its intersection with the Tullamarine Freeway at Essendon to the city of Mildura and any deviations between these locations, to be a national arterial road. Only that section of the Calder between Melbourne and Bendigo has the RONI classification. The full highway between Melbourne and Mildura is classified as a national arterial road. This enables the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo to be upgraded under the RONI classification, 50 per cent of which is funded by the Commonwealth from the national arterial road program, while the remaining 50 per cent is funded by the state government. Treasurer Costello was very careful in his response to the Bendigo media during the 2001 election campaign when he said, in Bendigo, on 31 October 2001:
“The government is committed to fund it [the Calder Highway] in partnership with the State Government, so as the State Government commits to construction, the Commonwealth will match the funding under the program of Road of National Importance”.
The position is straightforward, as set out by the federal Treasurer. The Calder upgrade to Bendigo is funded fifty-fifty, with the Commonwealth matching the state funds when the state makes them available.
I also recall the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, when he was in Bendigo only weeks before the budget of May last year—and I am holding up a copy of a picture that was in the press at the time—making the same pledge to match state funding for the Calder when it was allocated. The pledge was promptly forgotten. When Mr Anderson released his transport budget in May, there was nothing to match the $70 million allocated by the Bracks government for the next stage of the duplication from Kyneton to Faraday. In fact, when Mr Anderson brought down his transport budget, he protested that he had been ambushed by the Victorian government, which had allocated funds for the next stage. Having committed himself some weeks earlier to matching the state government's funding, Mr Anderson then claimed he was ambushed. This alleged ambush came after he had already promised federal funds.
On the federal department's web site under the heading `Transport Programmes—Roads of National Importance' the last sentence states: 
The Government's election commitments will have priority. 
We can see how much notice they take of that. In spite of this, the federal government have not matched the state government's May 2002 commitment of $70 million. After all, that is the very reason that sparked the Bendigo Plus petition being taken to the federal parliament. The department's webpage dealing with Victorian projects, under the heading `Calder Highway', states in the fourth paragragph: 
... the highway is principally a state arterial road and the responsibility for meeting Victoria's strategy rests with the Victorian Government. 
That is correct. It is the responsibility of the state government to arrange planning studies and routes and to tender for construction, but the decision as to whether the federal government will fund a highway as a RONI is a decision that only the federal government can make. The Bracks government has determined that the Calder duplication to Bendigo could be completed by 2006 and has set out a strategy to achieve this in partnership with the Commonwealth's RONI program. It allocated $25 million—50 per cent of the total cost—for the Carlsruhe section in its first budget. The federal government refused to commit its share of the funding and in fact stalled the project for another 12 months. 
After a concerted campaign involving several speeches in federal parliament and intense media coverage of the issue, the Howard government finally allocated its share of the costs and the Carlsruhe project was commenced and is currently still under construction. The Bracks government allocated a further $70 million in its last budget for the Faraday section, which is the next stage of the project. The Commonwealth has so far refused to commit to this stage, in spite of Treasurer Costello's pre-election 2001 commitment. The Commonwealth has also refused to commit to the completion date. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, in reply to a question on notice, stated that the Calder duplication to Bendigo was originally scheduled to be completed by 2002-03. This has been conveniently ignored by the media, the coalition spokesperson and the Bendigo Plus spokesperson. The Deputy Prime Minister actually said some years ago that the whole project should be completed by 2003, and it is not even half finished. We should note that, if the original completion date of 2002-03 set by the conservatives had been honoured, the Calder Highway upgrade would now be complete. Instead, the Howard government has starved the Calder since 1999, diverted Calder funds to other highway projects and left a big stretch of the Calder unfinished, with no finishing date in sight. I notice that paragraph 6 of the Bendigo Plus media release of Wednesday, 27 November states:
Since the petition had been launched, Mr Poyser—
their spokesman—
said that the State Government had pledged to complete the Calder upgrade rather than wait for their Federal counterparts. 
National Party MP Mr Damian Drum has also been issuing similar statements. This is blatantly wrong. At no stage has the Bracks government said that it would complete the Calder by going it alone. The Bendigo Advertiser, accurately reporting Mr Bachelor's comments on 8 November 2002, said:
The Bracks Government will make a start on two remaining sections of the Calder utilising the $70 million allocated in its last budget. The completion of these stages will depend on the Commonwealth allocating its $70 million as part of the RONI and election campaign commitments. 
The then chairman of the Calder Improvement Group, Mr Geoff Neil, stated on ABC Radio on 16 December that the rules had changed and that the states had to nominate major roads for federal funds. That is no different from the RONI classification. He further stated that there were no national classifications. Mr Neil referred to AusLink, the Howard government's new integrated transport funding proposal, which was announced by Minister Anderson on 7 November 2002. The AusLink fact sheet on the department's web site states:
AusLink will not involve a reduction in the Commonwealth Government's transport expenditure. It will not affect any of the current projects funded by the Commonwealth Government, or any projects where there has been a firm Government funding commitment. 
They are the key words: `a firm government funding commitment'. The last paragraph in the minister's 7 November press release states: 
The AusLink green paper is open for comment until 7 February 2003 and will be supported by a series of consultation meetings in metropolitan and regional Australia. The Government will release a formal policy statement or white paper next year. AusLink will commence from July 2004. 
The current road funding arrangements remain in place and will not change until at least July 2004. The Howard government is currently preparing its next budget, scheduled for May 2003. Unless considerable pressure is brought to bear, there is little chance that the Commonwealth will allocate any funds for the Calder until well beyond 2004. Labor—state and federal—have been and remain totally committed to the Calder duplication. The conservative parties—state and federal—together with their spokespeople have deliberately set out to obstruct and distort Labor's position because of the federal government's bloody-minded refusal to honour its previous federal election commitments.
I would now like to talk about another issue which is equally important to my area of Bendigo. I refer to the need for an MRI facility to be established at the Bendigo Health Care Group to service the surrounding region. I request the government to urgently approve a licence for a proposed MRI machine to be developed at the Bendigo Health Care Group. I first raised the lack of MRI services in June 2001 and, unfortunately, the Howard government has still so far refused to allow a licence for this facility in Bendigo. This is in spite of over 7,000 people from central Victoria having signed a petition calling on the Howard government to approve a licence for an MRI service for the Bendigo Health Care Group. The petition was presented to this parliament in February this year. 
I am delighted that the Bracks government, during the recent state elections, committed $3 million for the building and equipment to establish an MRI service, provided that the Howard government allocate a licence. It is vital that the federal government provide the licence to enable those using the service to claim most of the costs on Medicare. Without the licence, the majority of central Victorians would be prevented from accessing the service because of the huge costs involved—around $600 for an average consultation.
Bendigo is one of the largest health service regions in Australia, but it is one of a few regions that do not have MRI services. Labor believes that the service should be available to all those who need it, not just those who can afford it. Currently, people have to travel to Melbourne or Ballarat to access the service, which is becoming increasingly vital. Unless the Howard government issues a licence, central Victorians will go on suffering this major disadvantage. I see the Howard government's refusal to approve a licence for an MRI machine for Bendigo as further discrimination against the Bendigo electorate. The Howard government approved a licence for Ballarat's MRI service over two years ago. It is hard to understand why it has been so unwilling to provide a licence for Bendigo, but the end result is that it treats the people of the Bendigo electorate as second-class citizens and denies them facilities that exist in Melbourne and Ballarat. It is a repeat of the unequal treatment the Howard government is meting out to the Bendigo region over the Calder Highway. Ballarat has a modern, upgraded highway to Melbourne; Bendigo does not—and the federal government is the reason.
It is gratifying that so many people expressed their wish for the MRI by signing the petition that my office initiated last year. I am angry that the health minister, recently in Bendigo, refused to make any commitment to approve the licence. She claimed that the matter would be handled by an independent committee. This is just a cop-out. It is an excuse for doing nothing for Bendigo. We have been waiting for two years for that committee to make a decision.
I would like to refer now to the need for renewed energy from the government to get more doctors into regional and country areas and stop its destruction of bulk-billing. The Bendigo electorate is among the hardest-hit victims of the government's strangling of bulk-billing. Recent health department figures reveal that the seat of Bendigo has the fourth lowest level of bulk-billing of all the federal seats in Victoria. The same figures also reveal that the Bendigo electorate has had the third highest percentage increase in the out-of-pocket expenses faced by patients for seeing a doctor. Of the 38 federal seats in Victoria, Bendigo had the fourth lowest level of services bulk-billed by doctors last year, at only 48 per cent of services. In the whole of Victoria, there are only three other country federal seats with lower levels of bulk-billing. This includes the neighbouring electorate of Murray, which is second from the bottom, with 32.4 per cent. At the same time, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by seeing a doctor rose from $8.08 to $10.16 in the last two years. This is an increase of 25.7 per cent. Only one city electorate and one country electorate in Victoria experienced a higher percentage of increased cost. 
What we are seeing is the destruction of bulk-billing and the sabotage of Medicare by the Howard government. We in central Victoria are among the prime victims of the coalition's dislike of Medicare. Prime Minister Howard said in the 1980s that he wanted to tear Medicare apart and put an end to bulk-billing. Now we are seeing the mischief of the real John Howard and of the coalition parties. What they have achieved is to make it harder for country people to get a doctor and harder for them to get a doctor who bulk-bills. People on low incomes feel the cost very heavily. Many go to public hospitals to get medical services that should be available in the community through their GPs. At the same time, as more country GPs withdraw from bulk-billing, greater pressure is being placed on other GPs who continue to provide it. The winding down of bulk-billing is a major regional and country disadvantage inflicted by the coalition parties. Even with the rapid decline of bulk-billing under the Howard government, there are still federal seats in Melbourne where it is comparatively easy to get a doctor who bulk-bills. Last year, for example, in the metropolitan seat of Maribyrnong, 90.4 per cent of services were bulk-billed and 88.2 per cent of services in Gellibrand were bulk-billed. This is nearly twice the level of bulk-billing experienced in Bendigo.
In Bendigo, we have a new dimension to the government's mishandling of health care. This is the charade that has developed over services to veterans who have a gold card and should be receiving free medical services but are not. Recently I attended a function where there were many veterans. A number of them came to me and told me of their anxiety over the fact that doctors were not treating them under the gold card scheme. They specifically asked me to publicise their plight. In a number of cases, doctors are not accepting patients who have a gold card and the patients therefore have to find another doctor—or the doctors are seeing them, but only if the patients make an additional payment of between $10 and $20. This can mean that some veterans will have to travel a considerable distance to find doctors who will accept the gold card.
Medical services are essential to everybody, and they should be available and affordable. I believe it is essential that the Howard government act in the forthcoming budget to bring forth genuine solutions that will end and repair the damage that this government has been doing to Medicare, bulk-billing and the gold card.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I would like to take this opportunity to join my colleagues and add my voice to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 currently before us. I would like to take this opportunity to examine them in close detail and to look at the effects and the impact of these budgetary measures on the constituents in my electorate of Calwell. The electorate of Calwell is an electorate which has many families that are currently feeling financial pressure. For the last seven years, that pressure has increased under the regime of one of the highest taxing governments in our nation's history. This will be the legacy of the Howard-Costello budgets for the people of Calwell.
I note with interest that more than $406 million, as I understand it, is being allocated to the foreign affairs and trade portfolio. I can assure you that we all will be looking forward to counting the cost of our current military commitment to Iraq and the effect that it will have on current, pending and future programs and services. The government's `alert but not alarmed' campaign has been shown to be a complete fiasco and an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money because, far from providing assistance to the so-called campaign against terror, it has done nothing but make a mockery of our national senses and increase division in our community. But of more immediate concern to me is the impact that this campaign is having on our social cohesion and, in particular, the impact it is having on Australian Muslims, with particular reference to the large Muslim community in my electorate of Calwell—a community whose sense of security and safety, as with the Gulf War and immediately after the events of September 11, has been compromised once again. The Muslim community in the electorate of Calwell has had to cope with increased vilification, particularly those women who choose to be veiled and, of course, children, as they face increased suspicion and fear from their neighbours. Paradoxically, many Australians are experiencing increased insecurity as a result of the tax dollars being spent to supposedly protect us from this government-created fear.
The financial cost of Australia's military involvement in Iraq is estimated by Access Economics to be at least $700 million for pre-deployment and military action, and this for a short conflict. Imagine the cost in the event of a long conflict! I understand that there will also be additional costs to our economy, somewhere in the billions, as a flow-on from our involvement. After truth, the next casualty of this war will be, of course, welfare and services for Australians. I have already been approached by several program providers in my electorate who have been told by various government departments that they are not to expect any further funding for next year in preparation for what we expect to be a very tight budget—a war budget. Yet there are areas that are in urgent need of government funding, and they continue to suffer. 
One such area suffering as a result of the government's neglect and failure to uphold responsibility is that of health—in particular, bulk-billing. The Prime Minister seeks to rewrite history, and has done so for some time now, with semantic arguments over the meaning of universal provision of health services. Australians are beginning to realise that this government has no plans to restore bulk-billing to respectable levels. The Treasurer has already said that there will be no new funding for health, indicating that we can do nothing but expect to see the continuing free fall in bulk-billing.
While state governments throughout Australia have continued to warn the Commonwealth about the additional pressure being placed on the emergency departments of our public hospitals, rather than responding with a solution this government responds with rhetoric and blame shifting. Ultimately, the states have nothing to look forward to other than a cut in real terms in public hospital funding, a continuing decline in bulk-billing, and a comparable rise in private health insurance premiums and the associated costs of the private health insurance subsidy through the 30 per cent health insurance rebate.
Bulk-billing levels in my electorate of Calwell are still relatively high compared with those in other regions—and I noted that the member for Bendigo referred to the decline of bulk-billing in his electorate—because we have a large number of low-income, working families living in the area who have been serviced traditionally through the Medicare bulk-billing system. To these working families, universal access to Medicare means exactly that—access to bulk-billing whenever they need it. Recent figures—also, paradoxically, for my electorate of Calwell—indicate that in the last quarter we have had one of the highest increases in out-of-pocket expenses in the country. On the ground, the effect of the free fall in bulk-billing levels is illustrated best by the experience of the Dianella Community Health Service. For years, that service has provided for those who cannot afford non-bulk-billing practices. Dianella has always been committed to providing a range of services, including aged care programs, a dental and general practice, and school based health. It has ensured that its services are provided on the basis of being culturally, geographically and socioeconomically accessible to patients.
Dianella's after-hours bulk-billing is now under threat because of rising costs, and it has for some time contemplated terminating the service. Should this happen, there would be no other after-hours bulk-billing service anywhere in the outer north-western suburbs of Melbourne. The effects of this would be far-reaching because, in addition to the people in my electorate, other people who live in the north-western region would have to face the possibility of attending hospital casualty wards in order to get some medical attention in the event that they or their children get sick. That would have the effect of further clogging up the hospital emergency wards. Their other option would be to wait for hours on end for a locum doctor, as I and others have on many occasions. In addition to waiting for hours on end, that usually means that you have to pay about $100 up front, on the spot, at any time—at one, two or three o'clock in the morning. That is a further strain on sick families, because many of my constituents, especially in the Broadmeadows area, cannot afford this fee. Not too many of them have that kind of cash on hand at home, so often they may be forced to choose between tending to their children's health or letting it go for yet another day or so before getting medical attention. Sometimes that can cause distress, especially to kids.
Further to this, the government has shown a great reluctance to deliver on the promise it made of $100 million in funding to provide outer metropolitan areas with increased access to GPs. The unfulfilled promise of increasing access to specialists is also a problem in my electorate of Calwell. We do not have very many specialists. As is probably known to everyone, specialists have a tendency to concentrate their practices on one side of a particular city at the expense of the other side. The north-western side of the city is not attractive to specialists, so we have a great problem in getting access to specialist services. The incentives that the government certainly indicated it would like to implement to deal with these sorts of problems in the outer metro areas do not seem to be coming to fruition at this time.
My concern is that the government, rather than confronting the fact that the bulk-billing system is indeed in crisis, has refused to acknowledge it. On the contrary, the Prime Minister, in order to defend himself, attempts to rewrite history. Since the Howard government came to office seven years ago, bulk-billing has fallen by an astonishing 11 per cent, with more than half of that decline being in the period since December 2001. Nevertheless, the government has sat on its collective hands hoping that, if it cannot kill Medicare up front, it will just wait for it to die off.
The Howard government also continues unabated in slugging families that can least afford additional expenses. Another area that families can expect to be hit hard in is pharmaceuticals. Rather than trying to reduce the struggle that many Australian families face on a daily basis, in the 2002-03 budget this government chose to increase the cost of prescriptions for families, pensioners and cardholders. When Labor left office, cardholders paid $2.70 for each prescription and non-cardholders paid a total of $16.80. In its seven years in office, the Howard government has increased both amounts by 70 per cent. No-one can deny that there has been a blow-out in pharmaceutical use, but that blow-out should be addressed in a manner which is equitable and with minimum financial hardship, rather than additional burdens, for people. We should do this by perhaps reviewing the pharmaceutical schedule rather than increasing the cost of basic medicines.
It is also indicative of a government that has simply failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people, typified by the imminent collapse of bulk-billing and by other measures that are generally making it harder for families to struggle with balancing work and family life, increased costs and so on. At the same time as the government imposes greater conditions and hardships on Australian people, it targets the ones who can least afford it—and I have an electorate where there are lots of people who can least afford it. We continue to hear of inadequate nursing home care, for example, and extended waiting times for elderly people to be placed in nursing homes. In a recent report, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency initially found one particular nursing home in my electorate to be noncompliant in providing a safe and comfortable environment consistent with residents' needs, with reports of strong odours, urine in hallways and one room in particular with faeces smeared on curtains and walls. Another nursing home has been found to have a long history of significant noncompliance with quality standards, including complaints of inadequate physiotherapy for residents, who are now unable to walk. But it still received its accreditation and it still receives taxpayers' money. The issue of nursing homes and the fact that some nursing homes are substandard—although this issue did blow up some time ago and was discussed—continues to be a problem for many residents who have the fortune or misfortune to be placed in a nursing home.
Working families in Melbourne's north-western suburbs have also been hit hard by the government's family tax benefit debts, and that is well known, is well publicised and has been spoken of at considerable length both here and elsewhere. In my electorate of Calwell, there are some 7,000 local families who have been caught in this monumental stuff-up. Families trying to obtain child care or after-hours care find it increasingly difficult to access these support structures. The waiting lists are very long and often they can only, at best, hope for inadequate places. The government, of course, is responsible for bringing about this unacceptable situation in child care, and it is spending $800 less per child-care place than it was seven years ago. Local families are working longer hours, seeing less of their children and paying more for their education, health and child care.
Another area which is of concern in my electorate of Calwell is the area of disability. Calwell has a very high number of people who are on the disability support pension. The changes proposed recently to disability support pension recipients will have a devastating effect in my electorate, where some 8,000 residents rely on that pension. Put aside for a moment the confidence-shattering effect that such changes to eligibility conditions will create in the lives of these people, the changes that were introduced in the May budget threaten to have a sizeable impact not only on disability support pension recipients but also on the group known as supported workers. They are the people who work in supported workplace environments. I have a very large such community in my electorate—BRITE Industries—that I often visit. I have had the opportunity to witness what these people are doing and to speak to them, to their carers and to their families. I can tell you that they are desperate and they are anguished. They do not know what these changes mean for them personally. Many of them anticipate losing, as a result of working more than 15 hours per week, anything up to $54 a fortnight from their pension. These people do not necessarily work to earn a living; they work because it gives meaning to their lives. If they lose this opportunity to remain in the work force because their pension would suffer, I am certain that there will be other issues that they will have to confront. They are in a happy environment—I know that one of my colleagues here has been to visit them—and I would hate to see any changes brought to bear that will affect the tranquillity and the happiness of their current working regime.
This government also continues to underinvest in our public school system, in our TAFE colleges and in our universities. My electorate is one that has, unfortunately, tended to receive the rough end of the stick when it comes to tertiary education funding. Recent figures show that entry to university and year 12 retention rates in our region are among the worst in the state. That is traditionally the case, particularly in the northern areas of Calwell. One of the greatest impediments to people from low-income backgrounds participating in higher education is the fear of debt. At a time of speculation about the introduction of more full fee paying places in Australian higher education, the government is happy to leave struggling local students to their own resources. The government is happy for good Samaritans such as the Smith Family to pick up the pieces. The Smith Family do this admirably, I must say. For example, in my area they run a local welfare program which subsidises the education costs of disadvantaged families, thus doing their bit to ensure that the local kids have the same opportunities as the kids from the more privileged postcodes.
I have a particular beef, as I guess many do, with the current Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I believe that he is engaging in a disgraceful campaign, as he is telling young people—certainly those in my electorate—that they should know their place. His message is this: `Unless your parents can pay for your education and can get you into the elite private schools, and unless they have the social standing needed, you can forget about going to the top universities. You need to keep your hopes low and not expect too much from us,'—meaning the government. The minister for education is also saying: `We will not be wasting government funds on providing those of you who cannot afford it with resources and an education of a high standard. In other words, we will not be giving you a leg-up. That is reserved for the privileged on the other side of town.' Brendan Nelson is telling my youth that they are to look forward to being low-skilled fodder, that they should be proud of it and that no-one should try to make them feel inadequate because they do not have aspirations to go to university, because, as he says, not everyone can go to university.
This government should stand condemned for the fact that it is the highest taxing government in Australian history. It is responsible for the introduction of the biggest new tax in our history in a long time—the GST. It appears obsessed with imposing more taxes and levies at every opportunity. It raises revenue at every opportunity but fails to concern itself with families put under increasing financial pressure as a result of its policies. Such insensitivity is best typified by its decision to sell the historic Maygar Barracks, situated in my electorate of Calwell. It is a historic piece of land comprising buildings and facilities, some of which were refurbished less than 20 years ago. My local community and sporting groups would love to be given the opportunity to make good use of it. But, unfortunately, there is no such luck. The government's interest in Maygar Barracks is driven purely by financial motives. It has shown no interest in the palpable community value that will be put to waste if the decision to sell off then demolish the facility proceeds.
The community of Calwell would benefit from the opportunity to use the Maygar Barracks as a community resource. We have written to the Minister for Defence asking that a portion of the land be allotted to the community for use but the response has been, `Sorry, but we can't help you.' We intend to pursue a campaign to convince the federal government and the Minister for Defence that, rather than pursue the sale of the Maygar Barracks, it would be better if it were gifted to the community. My community, which is a relatively poor community, could make use of the very good facilities which would be demolished if the site were sold to developers or to industry. Not only would the facilities go to waste but a very important part of our military history would go to waste with them.
In closing, I want to make the point that it appears that the government can save millions. Recently we saw the government bow to pressure and gift parts of Point Nepean to the community. We hope that we can apply the same pressure to it to gift the Maygar Barracks to the community of Calwell. It is a campaign that the community will undertake with much fervour and I look forward to participating in it with them. I look forward to convincing the defence minister to show some compassion to the community of Calwell and at least gift part, if not all, of the Maygar Barracks to our community for much needed use as community and recreation facilities.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. I would like to use this debate to highlight two important issues which fall within government appropriations: funding for unmet need in disability services and ageing. Under disability services, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 seeks an additional $15 million `as a result of the supplementation offer made to the states and territories as part of the third Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement'. I am very pleased about this appropriation. However, I am appalled at the way in which the Howard government has handled negotiations with the states and territories in relation to the third Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement. The number of people with disabilities and their families who need but do not have access to accommodation, respite and day care services is reaching crisis proportions.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that there are 12,500 people with disabilities who cannot get any accommodation or respite places across Australia. Tragically, many young people with disabilities—including brain injury, MS and other neurological conditions—are currently living in aged care nursing homes. The decision to place a young person in a facility for the care of the frail elderly can be devastating for all involved. According to the Young People in Nursing Homes advocacy group, there are 6,000 people under the age of 65 who are permanent residents in nursing homes across Australia. Of these, 1,100 are under 50 years of age and 30 are under 25 years of age. In the meantime, the Howard government has not been able or willing to sign the next Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, which should have commenced in July 2002. Consequently, the Howard government has withheld the $15 million in additional funding for unmet need during this financial year.
To make matters worse, in the February Senate estimates Senator Vanstone threatened to withhold funding by not back paying the additional funding when the agreement is eventually signed. Senator Vanstone's threat to reduce the Commonwealth's already inadequate offer by failing to pay the full $15 million promised for the 2002-03 financial year is offensive to the thousands of people with disabilities and their families who are currently missing out on services. I hope this appropriation is a sign that that back payment, which the states and territories desperately need, will be made in the near future.
I also have major concerns about the way in which the Howard government is treating the disability employment sector—something which my colleague the member for Calwell made reference to in her contribution just before my speech. Major reforms, which I support in principle, have been forced upon the sector within a very short timeframe. These reforms include quality assurance reforms and the introduction of case based funding to business services. Employers, employees and their families have all raised their concerns with me about how these reforms will result in the closure of some business services and the loss of employment for some people with disabilities. I have heard little from the Howard government about what it will do to ensure minimal closures and to protect the working rights of people with disabilities. In my view, it is extremely important that people currently employed in those business services within the disability sector have every protection possible to allow them to continue their employment into the future.
I will now move to the policy area of ageing. The second issue of importance is National Seniors Week. This is our opportunity to celebrate our 2.4 million older Australians, who are more active and contribute more to our communities than ever before. National Seniors Week is an annual community event that celebrates the valuable contribution of older people to community life in Australia. National Seniors Week also challenges society's stereotypes around ageing and invites us all to consider our relationships with and attitudes towards the older people whom we know. It is important that we acknowledge that Australians aged 65 years and over lead very active lives and contribute a great deal to our communities through their volunteer work, their assistance to their families and their participation within their communities. Unfortunately the Howard government constantly portrays our increasing aged population as a looming crisis.
I am sure the figures are very familiar to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay. The number of people in Australia aged over 65 is likely to grow over the next 20 years from 2.4 million to around 4.2 million. This aspect of Australia's demography is being presented, in lock-step with figures on the declining birthrate, to produce what I call a panic scenario. But there should be no need to panic. It is certainly not the role of government to induce panic; rather, we need to distinguish clearly between the issues that are cause for concern and need policy changes to address them and the issues that are merely aimed at softening up the electorate for spending cuts in other areas of social policy. Blaming elderly Australians for a budget shortfall of your own making seems to me to be a rather cheap trick.
One of the key triggers for ageing panic has been the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report, released with last year's budget. According to that report:
... a steadily ageing population is likely to continue to place significant pressure on Commonwealth budget finances.
Labor will not allow ageing to become a negative force in policy making in this country. Unlike the Howard government's Intergenerational Report, Labor do not see ageing Australians through a purely financial framework that turns them into an impost on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, on the age and service pensions and on younger generations in general. The Labor Party see our ageing population as an opportunity to yield the benefits of an older population that has experience and much to offer. Our community benefits greatly from the experience and contribution made by older Australians. Approximately one-quarter of older Australians participate in voluntary work, and this proportion is on the rise. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Older Australia at a glance, found that the primary reason older people undertake voluntary work is to help others in the community.
More older Australians in our community are interested in lifelong learning and, as a result, we all benefit. There are at least 46,000 older people participating in courses provided by the University of the Third Age. In 2001, 866 people aged 60 and over commenced university courses. I hope that businesses and organisations in our communities give older Australians opportunities to participate as much as possible. I urge older Australians who are interested to contact their local businesses and organisations to discuss opportunities for more interaction. Labor will continue to pressure the Howard government to take a more positive view of our ageing population.
Another priority for Labor in the ageing portfolio is to pressure the Howard government to take action rather than conduct numerous reviews of the ageing sector. As I understand it, the government is running quite a number of reviews of the aged care sector. For example, the pricing review, the internal community care review, the national model care documentation system review and the recently completed resident classification scale, or RCS, review. Firstly, I would like to outline my concerns in relation to the RCS review. It clearly demonstrates the Howard government's lack of commitment to any real reform in this sector. The Minister for Ageing announced the RCS review in May 2002. In a media release, he said:
It is clear a model is needed for the resident classification scale and I have asked my department to investigate alternative options as a priority. It is an unfair burden on nurses.
The minister was referring to the paperwork burden faced by nurses in residential aged care facilities. According to the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, it is estimated that nurses spend in excess of four million hours per year filling in paperwork. The RCS review report was published last month and made 20 recommendations which, if acted upon, would reduce the paperwork burden for nurses considerably. But what was the government's response to the review? Over one-quarter of the RCS review recommendations have been referred to the pricing review, which will not report back to the government until at least the end of this year, although, conservatively, I believe it will probably be early next year. This means that any reforms arising from the recommendations are unlikely to occur until at least 2004 or even 2005.
Another quarter of the recommendations will lead to pilot programs and trials. Rather than take immediate action to alleviate the burden on nurses, the Howard government is going to spend more time and more money. The Aged and Community Services Association—ACSA—a peak body representing residential aged care facilities, had this to say in its national report about the minister's response to the review:
DHA's response effectively delays any wholesale or even remedial action in the near future.
It goes on to say:
It—
that is, ACSA—
will tell the Minister that the DHA response falls far short of industry expectations, and will continue to press for real reform.
I am, sadly, appalled that the minister is deferring any real action and is doing nothing to reduce the paperwork burden on nurses in residential aged care facilities. Another concern I have relates to the pricing review, which has a whopping budget of $7.2 million. The issues under examination in the pricing review are very important, and they deserve serious attention. But we should be very clear about one thing: it must be the needs and the capacities of older Australians—especially those who are disadvantaged—which drive the policy resulting from this review. And that includes the need for adequate infrastructure, which has suffered from a now chronic lack of capital funding under the Howard government. The minister's pricing review into the aged care sector cannot be allowed to be a recipe for winding back the Commonwealth's responsibilities to older Australians.
I now turn to the government's internal community care review, which should really be called, I think, the mystery review, considering the way in which it is being kept under wraps. Very little is known about this review, which is being undertaken within the Department of Health and Ageing. Key stakeholders have outlined to me their concerns about how little they know about the review. Through Senate estimates, I now know the terms of reference and the time frame. At a Senate estimates hearing in November 2002 this was said:
It is expected that the major stakeholders in the community care system will be consulted in early 2003.
I have been travelling around the country meeting many key stakeholders and none of them has been involved in any consultations relating to this review. Apparently, a report has been written but it is not a public document. So I ask the question: why the secrecy and why the mystery?
The last issue that I want to bring to the attention of the House is an issue of great concern to me, and it will be to the community. The Howard government appears to have played favourites by offering support to a nursing home in one of its electorates while allowing a similar nursing home in a Labor held electorate to close down. Two small Victorian nursing homes run by Baptist Community Care were planning to close down. Both have 30 beds, and both offer high-care services to the frail and elderly. One is in Morwell, which at the next federal election will be within the Gippsland electorate held by the Minister for Science, Mr McGauran. This is a marginal seat, I believe. The other is in Brunswick, in the Wills electorate held by Labor MP and shadow minister for sustainability and environment, Kelvin Thomson. As I understand it, Minister McGauran is credited with intervening to save the Morwell nursing home, and the Howard government will now provide capital assistance to prevent its closure. Meanwhile, the Brunswick nursing home is closing down, and residents and their families are desperately searching for places in homes across Victoria—and I understand that quite a number of them have already moved out of that facility.
The member for Wills has been vigorously pursuing the Minister for Ageing, asking that he visit the Brunswick nursing home and seriously consider providing capital assistance to ensure its financial viability. In a letter to the member for Wills, Minister Andrews admitted:
... members of my staff have recently met with Baptist Community Care.
The minister then declined the invitation to visit the Brunswick nursing home. If the Howard government is making decisions about nursing home facilities based on political judgments, the community has the right to be outraged. I have written to Minister Andrews asking him to explain how and why this decision was made; how much additional funding was or will be provided to the Morwell nursing home, and from which budget; and why the plight of the Brunswick nursing home appears to have been ignored. I am yet to receive a reply to that letter. The point is that, as was said in this very chamber earlier today by the member for Wills, the facility in Brunswick was only opened in 1995. It may only have 30 beds but it is an extremely up-to-date facility. It is not being closed down because of some decrepit capital infrastructure; I am sure that it is actually an acceptable building under the accreditation system.
I believe that there are extremely important questions that need to be answered on this issue, and I am looking forward to receiving the minister's reply. I would like to think that the reply I get will debunk what I have been told and will say that the government is not acting in that way. I would like to receive that assurance. Nursing home beds in this country should be allocated according to the needs of the population on a basis of proper planning and not a government's need to win votes in a marginal electorate at the next federal election. Unless I hear otherwise, one could not be blamed for believing that that is the point.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 to paint a picture of how Australia has changed since the Howard Liberal government was elected in 1996. It was recently the seventh anniversary of that election, and I read articles in some of the major national newspapers that examined this event. When I look back at the changes in our society since 1996, I often get a queasy feeling in my stomach. What has this government done over the past seven years? I could be here for the rest of the week if I chose to focus on the irreparable damage that this government has done to the fabric of Australian society. Gone is tolerance, gone is harmony and gone is the Australian belief in a fair go. Today's debate will focus on some of the major economic problems that this government has given birth to in its time in office.
Firstly, we have all been burdened with the GST—the tax that the Prime Minister would `never, ever' introduce. It is a tax that has contributed significantly to the taxation burden of the Australian public. The amendment to this bill proposed by my colleague the member for Fraser contains the following statement:
Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure in economic management, and in particular its failings in relation to both income and expenditure policies because:
(1)	It is the highest taxing Government in Australian history, and:
	(a)	has imposed the highest level ever of income tax;
	(b)	is responsible for introducing the biggest new tax in our history; and
	(c)	is addicted to imposing ever more taxes and special levies ...
Looking at this statement in the amendment, I thought I would reflect on the three points contained in it. The first point is that this government is the highest taxing government in Australian history. This was highlighted in the Daily Telegraph on 4 November 2002 in an article by Fleur Anderson entitled `At $187bn, we are now paying more tax than ever'. In that article, Ms Anderson stated:
The total amount of tax, including GST, paid to the Federal Government has soared to $187 billion, or 24.9 per cent of GDP.
In addition, the introduction of four new levies is expected to collect as much as $365 million this year.
The amount of tax collected is more than 1 per cent higher than the level when the Howard Government won power and announced there would be “no increase in the overall tax burden from 1996/97 levels”.
In this statement, Ms Anderson has completely encapsulated the first part of the amendment proposed by my colleague the member for Fraser. What this government has done is effectively shift the tax burden onto Australian families as well as increase it. When faced with questions by this journalist, the Treasurer released a statement that said, `The new tax system has not failed and has in fact achieved each one of its stated aims.' So are we to gather that the increase in this burden on the average Australian taxpayer was predetermined and an integral part of this government's aim in the first place?
I remember quite vividly the debate in this House when many of the members opposite argued that the introduction of a GST—or, in politically correct terms, the Treasurer's A New Tax System—would lower the tax burden. It would not make people worse off; in fact, they claimed it would make us all better off. The members opposite said that no-one would be out of pocket and if, by some strange fluke, they were disadvantaged then they would be compensated handsomely. The Treasurer and members opposite also said that it would make the tax system fairer and simpler. If I wanted to score political points, I could trawl through the Hansard speeches of those opposite in the GST debate and spend the rest of my time reading out the rhetoric and their false claims to embarrass them. But I will not do this, as I wish to talk about other, related issues that are hurting my constituents in the electorate of Stirling.
Remember those advertisements on television that told us that the GST would rip away the chains that shackled us? In the article that I quoted earlier in this speech, Mr Peter McDonald, the National Director of Taxpayers Australia, who accused the Howard government of a rip-off which lowered disposable income and standards of living, presents a most damning view in support of my argument today. He goes on to state that 2.8 million taxpayers are worse off because of bracket creep. He also says that, by not indexing the income thresholds, the government effectively raises taxes without having to raise the rates. Bracket creep and the GST have combined to make the lives of many Stirling electors and their families that little bit harder. The tax cuts that were supposed to compensate us for the introduction of a GST have been eroded away by bracket creep.
So who now shoulders the burden of tax in this country? It is simple—the average working family. The super-rich do not pay any more tax; they can afford to pay someone to help them avoid paying their fair share. Corporate Australia had its tax reduced on the recommendations of the Ralph report, so it is okay. The normal everyday family carries the burden. So where does the money come from? It comes from the pockets and household budgets of my constituents, amongst others. I have not spoken to one person since the introduction of the GST who can tell me that they are paying less for everyday goods. I really feel for those Australians who are on fixed incomes or low incomes. They bear the brunt of this insidious tax—a tax that invades every facet of our lives.
I, together with the shadow minister for retirement incomes and savings, recently held a meeting for superannuants and retirees at the Nookenburra tavern function room in Innaloo. At this meeting, there were still levels of anger towards the government about how the GST and associated taxes had eaten into the retirement savings of these people, who felt that it took a real bite out of their nest egg—for which they were never fully compensated—and put them on the back foot. Many of the people the shadow minister and I spoke to were worried about how they would be able to afford to remain independent during their retirement and not have to end up on the age pension as their only source of income. It is in our interests to ensure that we develop policies that allow these people to remain independent. The Treasurer talks about his Intergenerational Report and its findings, but he needs to do more than just recognise the problem. He should start developing policies that will have an immediate, practical effect.
Apart from bracket creep and the introduction of a GST, this government should take a leaf out of its drug strategy and say no. In this case, I am talking about saying no to new taxes and levies. As my colleague the member for Fraser points out, this government is addicted to imposing even more taxes and special levies. I think most Australians have forgotten or simply just do not know how many levies and taxes this government has introduced. I will take the time to list these taxes so that my constituents in Stirling and other interested people can get some concept of the enormity of this tax grab. Special levies are a favourite tool of this government. I will not talk about the aircraft noise levy in detail as it is not particularly applicable to Western Australians, but this levy, originally meant for Sydney, was applied to Adelaide Airport as well. At the end of the last financial year, it had raised about $395 million. One levy applying to all Australians that was introduced by this government was the increase in the Medicare levy in 1996-97 to fund the firearms buyback. This levy raised about $500 million. I supported the implementation of this levy as it funded the reduction of firearms in our community—a noble cause.
The next levy introduced was the stevedoring levy. This was introduced to pay for the redundancies caused by Peter Reith's ideological war on the waterfront. This government is happy to slug the taxpayer to fund its political agenda. Not content with using thugs wearing balaclavas and using guard dogs to win its war with the Maritime Union of Australia, it made us pay for it as well. This government also uses special taxes and levies to prop up industry sectors that it has hurt with its so-called reforms. People might think that this is not such a bad thing. However, when we examine the motives behind these moves, we find that they are done to prop up sectors that have been destroyed by the economic rationalist agenda of this Liberal government. Reform without benefits is not reform; it is vandalism.
The two levies that come under the umbrella of this category are the dairy industry adjustment levy and the recent sugar industry levy. I do not want to attack these industries for any perceived inefficiencies, but I will share the following comment with the chamber. I find it quite ironic that the National Party—a once great party that produced such prominent agrarian socialists as Earle Page, Blackjack McEwen and Doug Anthony—has resorted to slugging the taxpayer to aid in the destruction of the once proud industries it used to promote and protect. The sad thing about Australian politics has been the transformation of the National Party from a powerful force—a party that on a number of occasions determined who became prime minister—to what it is today. It is now nothing more than a pale, senseless imitation of an economic rationalist Liberal Party. I am sure that all the residents of the Stirling electorate will reflect on what happened to the National Party's commitment to rural industries when they put a spoonful of sugar into their morning tea or coffee. Each spoonful of sugar will be more expensive, as this government's levy is passed directly on to the consumer. My constituents are paying for the National Party's surrender of rural Australia to be sacrificed on the altar of free market forces by the high priest of economic rationalism, the Treasurer.
Before we look at what has happened to all this extra revenue that has been raised, I would like to draw the chamber's attention to a taxation arrangement that will net the government substantial revenue now that we are going to war. During the petrol price hike after the introduction of the GST, when fuel went over $1 per litre for an extended period of time, I released a fuel tax calculator, which I supplied to all households in Stirling. What this calculator showed was that, every time the price of petrol went up, the amount of revenue received in the form of fuel excise and the GST increased also. If my memory serves me well, I remember that the government was forced to make an embarrassing backflip on fuel excise due to the Australian public's backlash to its policy. I do not think it will come as a surprise to anyone in this place that war will cause a significant increase in fuel prices. I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to an article in the Herald Sun on Tuesday, 4 March 2003. The article is entitled `Call to cut fuel tax'. I will quote some of the article:
Drivers hurting from soaring petrol prices have united to plead for fuel tax cuts.
Victoria's peak motoring group, the RACV, claims rocketing fuel costs could pump up to $750 million a year extra into Federal Government coffers.
...					...						...
RACV government relations spokesman David Cumming said constantly high fuel prices could grab up to $250 million extra a year in GST, and up to $500 million more from a resource rent tax levied on oil producers.
The motorists of Australia will pay for this immoral war. I find it somewhat ironic and a little bit sad that the public are paying for a war that they do not support.
Even though this government is the highest taxing in Australian history, it has failed dismally on some of the fundamental and most basic responsibilities to the Australian people. The first of these is bulk-billing. The media has only just cottoned on to the fact that the public health system in this country is under threat. Medicare, which has been the linchpin of the health system for almost 20 years, is being systematically dismantled by this government. Bulk-billing, which is relied upon by many in our community, is becoming rarer. Doctors, who are so often maligned in our community, are now finding it more and more difficult to bulk-bill their patients.
Why are they finding this more difficult? Last Friday, I attended a public meeting held by my state colleague and Western Australian health minister, Bob Kucera, at the Osborne Park RSL sub-branch. At this meeting, which dealt with health issues, one of the guest speakers was Dr Moira Sim, who is the President of the Osborne Division of General Practice. What Dr Sim told the meeting is that hardworking doctors such as her are being forced to stop bulk-billing for two reasons: the first reason is that the cost of running a practice has increased significantly over the past 10 years while the Medicare rebate has remained pretty static, and the second reason is that many doctors who bulk-bill are seeing their patients for shorter periods of time due to financial constraints. This has caused a crisis of care, where the GPs have chosen to abandon bulk-billing as they feel it is affecting the quality of care that they can give their patients.
There are a number of perspectives in the bulk-billing debate. State governments blame the crisis in accident and emergency wards on many different people seeking treatment there instead of seeing their GPs, due to the decline in bulk-billing. Statistics are beginning to show that low-income earners are no longer able to access health care through their GP and are waiting until they are quite sick before going to their hospital. What can we do about this? The obvious answer is to increase the Medicare rebate. The problem is lack of money. The Liberal government has tied up a lot of taxpayers' money in the ineffectual 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. Maybe one option would be to redirect some of the funding from that rebate to increasing the Medicare rebate. The problem with this idea is that the AMA refuses to have any conditions tied to an increase in the Medicare rebate. There are real fears that doctors will do as they did when the complex birth rebate was increased. Data from the health department showed there was only a small reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for patients. The Australian Consumers Association in an article entitled `Bulk billing unravels' is sceptical of the AMA position. The ACA states:
An increase in the rebate with no conditions would simply be a licence for doctors to increase their incomes without providing any guarantee of better access to bulk billing.
The ACA provide a pretty good summary of the problem facing our health care system. Their assessment of the problem reads:
While we have a system of primary care that is based on fee for service medicine—and it seems this will be the case for some time—bulk billing remains the best chance consumers have of getting access to affordable GP consultations. Bulk billing is an integral part of Medicare, and if the Commonwealth Government is serious about maintaining Medicare, then it has to be serious about maintaining bulk billing as well.
The last comment in that quote is the crux of the problem we are facing. I will repeat it:
... if the Commonwealth Government is serious about maintaining Medicare, then it has to be serious about maintaining bulk billing as well.
At the end of last year, I surveyed the people of Stirling about health. About 80 per cent of respondents identified bulk-billing as one of their top two issues. As a result I produced a bulk-billing guide, which I sent out to respondents and advertised in my electorate newsletter, Jann's Journal. This is a little thing I can do to help the constituents of the Stirling electorate. If Labor were in government, I could do a lot more to help them.
The last point I am going to talk about in this debate is one that is beginning to severely affect more and more of my constituents. This is the issue of the Howard government's fundamentally flawed family tax benefit payments system. In the last three editions of Jann's Journal, I have highlighted the inequities of this system. I asked questions last year about how many families had been affected. Last year when I asked the question, I discovered that almost 3,000 Stirling families had received a debt letter in the previous year. But what hit the families hard late last year was the government taking this debt out of their tax returns. I had hundreds of calls from mothers who had received a bill from the tax department instead of a cheque. Not only are those on low incomes being affected by this problem; due to the casual and contract nature of today's workplace, many middle-class families are also being hurt.
The problem with this debt is twofold: not only does the payment create a debt trap but also, if you use the government's stated solution of overstating your income, it can make your family ineligible for payments for services such as child care. What a great idea from the Howard government! They are saying, `To avoid a debt from our unworkable payments system, why don't you just overstate your income so that (a) if you really need the payments you won't get them and (b) you will make yourself ineligible for a whole range of payments and services?' This is the sort of narrow thinking that we are seeing from this government. They need to urgently review the family payments system. It is unworkable and it is causing stress that is not needed by Stirling families, who are already struggling to balance work and family commitments.
What can I do? I can continue to highlight this injustice in parliament, and I can continue to pressure this government to act responsibly. I will be asking the Minister for Family and Community Services further questions about the number of local Stirling families who have received more than one debt since the payment was introduced. It is time for the minister to look at the hard numbers and have a complete rethink of his failed policy. Please remember this point, Minister: reform without positive changes is simply vandalism. 
Time has defeated my efforts to highlight further problems caused by the Howard government's programs. There are so many other issues that I did not have time to deal with here today. These include the crisis in aged care, the chronic underinvestment in public schools, TAFEs and universities and the fact that housing is becoming more and more expensive for young families. All of these are problems that, in some degree, require the use of public funds in an attempt to achieve a positive outcome. Money is tight; going to war, losing billions in foreign exchange gambles by Treasury and cost blow-outs in defence procurement do not help the situation. This government needs to focus on the things that are important: our people and their lives.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I am happy to follow my colleagues in this debate. I have listened to a number of the contributions today, both here and in the House. In particular, I have taken note of not only the previous contribution but also a number of others, because they go to the question of bringing the government to account for what it has either done or not done since the first budgetary appropriations were undertaken. What we are dealing with here today in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 is the catch-up phase of the budgetary process—the period in which the government asks for more money and gives some accounting of not only what it has spent but also what it may have saved so far in the budgetary process. `Saved' means that, even though it promised to spend a certain amount of money, the government did not actually get around to it. That is taken as a saving. We have seen time and time again in this place examples of the government promising a certain amount of money to be spent in particular program areas, only to find that that is rejigged as the time comes for additional estimates and that moneys that were promised were not spent. It has been a tactic the government has used to seem to be far more generous than it is.
The member for Stirling indicated—quite reasonably, I think—that, if you look at a broad range of areas where the government has been entirely deficient, the things you need to look at are the impact of the government's taxing policies on a wide range of service delivery areas and the impact of the government's taking extra amounts of money opportunistically. We know that, so far, there is no indication at all that the government will entertain properly the idea of giving back the extra amounts of money that have been kept as a result of bracket creep. All governments in the past, willingly or unwillingly, have been forced into a situation where the amount of bracket creep is so great that they have to give that back; this government has been extraordinarily reluctant to do so. But why is that so? Contextually, if you cast your mind back to February-March of 2001, the government was in deep, deep trouble. Its electoral prospects were very poor but, in the six months after that, it spent in the order of $20 billion to buy its way back into the graces of various interest groups within the community. That is a significant amount of money, considering the fact that you have got about a $50 billion total expenditure in the normal budget appropriations. It helped to lay the basis for the government to use the Tampa situation to launch itself back into power.
In the last budget and in what we are facing now, we are seeing the excesses of the past coming home to be accounted for. But, of course, the accounting standard the government has adopted has made that much more difficult to do than it was in the past. The government has taken to its heart the accrual accounting process it introduced. In the old days, through most of the period of this Commonwealth, there was a cash accounting framework. What that meant was that, when you got to the budget and also when you got to this process—the additional estimates—you could actually see, line by line, what was supposed to be bought and the amount that was supposed to be paid out in cash for those things. You would get a broad list, and then each department would lay out in detail what it intended to spend its money on in that year.
What we have faced since 1999-2000 is an increasingly obscure process—effectively, it has been a process of obfuscation. A whitened glass has been put up in front of the budget processes to make sure that as little information as possible is actually presented to help people make an assessment of what the government is really up to and what it is doing. I have commented on this before. I comment on it here again, because it means that the question of accountability—the accountability of the government to the parliament, including its own members as well as the members of the opposition and the community at large—has been foreshortened.
To give an example of that, if you take any of the series of measures outlined in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 and attempt to track it back down to what has actually been spent, by and large you are faced with the problem that accrual accounting is like American behaviourist theory: that is, you make a broad statement—that is what it is based on—of what your goal or outcome is expected to be and then you make another statement of what the behaviour of the department is supposed to be in order to achieve that outcome. What you are left with is flummery—broad statements with virtually no meaning in them whatsoever. For instance, the defence department states that its key aim is to look after Australia's defences; to do that, they will have inputs and outputs and they will have a series of new jargon to work with, not just new weaponry. It is very hard to track anything down.
If you look at the second reading speeches on these appropriation bills you may get some indication of what they are about. If you go to the Parliamentary Library and look at the Bills Digest, you get a bit of an indication. But the library has almost given up trying to be specific about this as well. In Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003, the sum of $108,065,000—a significant amount of money—is appropriated for the Defence portfolio. Of that, $80.4 million has been classified as `indexation adjustments'. That does not tell us a great deal. What are those indexation adjustments for? I thought that the CPI was pretty low—that it was not running up too high. But `indexation adjustments' is all we get to explain that $80.4 million.
It is suggested in the footnotes to the Bills Digest that you can go to the defence department's web site and look at their index in relation to these budget estimates in order to get more information. I did that. I wasted about an hour this afternoon trying to trawl through the defence department's web site to look at the very thing that was suggested by the Bills Digest.I was trying to pin down exactly what was spent here. You will not find the information I was looking for. What you will find is another set of behavioural statements about what the good outcomes and goals and challenges are for the defence department. You will actually find some information about what they have spent their money on—particular weapon systems and changes, but for the life of me I could not find the information I wanted. Nor could I, in dealing with the much more extensive footnoting relating to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, pin down how they spent the $124,768,000 allocated to so-called `equity injections' for the Defence portfolio. What are equity injections? What does that mean?
This government has taken up corporate accounting models, which I think are quite inappropriate. You need a translation for the community at large, as well as for parliamentarians. What you are talking about is money being put into the defence department to enable them to do things. The notion of putting equity in suggests that they have more cash to go and buy more defence equipment. What specifically are they buying? I could not track that down. I could only find a general view of the things that have been approved and the things that have been looked at.
There are certain hints of what the core of this budget is about. It ranges over further appropriation. As was pointed out by the member for Stirling and other colleagues of mine who have spoken in this debate, there are a range of areas—health, ageing, education, foreign affairs and trade—where particular appropriations were sought and given but where bringing the government to account was extremely difficult. For instance, we are told that Treasury want almost $30 million extra from Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 for effective government spending in taxation arrangements. That will tell the Australian public at large a great deal about what that is supposed to be for. With respect to the parliament, the government, by simply saying, `That's the outcome we're looking for, that's the general view, that's the aim and that's what we're going to do', is treating it with absolute disdain.
I can guess at some of the other expenditure, because some directly impacts on my electorate. In his second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary was able to say that $5.5 million more is being given to support the national aerial firefighting strategy. I know that is money well spent because the helicopters are based at Bankstown Airport in my electorate. I have attended functions at the airport, including functions with the young people who train in air squadrons. They have also been involved in finding out about the aerial firefighting strategy, because the people involved in the strategy have been very good and have allowed these young people to look over the aircraft. The job they are doing, based in Bankstown in the middle of Sydney, is extraordinarily good. The federal government, after great pressure from the state governments, has taken the proper initiative to support the cost of providing that infrastructure, meaning that it has been possible to combat the extraordinary fires that we have had in a better way. You can support that allocation. You can say, `Yes, it is good,' because it is actually put up front.
At a time like this, when we are involved in a war against terror, you can also say that committing $7 million to enhance Australia's travel document screening system is a reasonable and sensible commitment of moneys. If you want further examples, there are not many more that give you a practical indication, but I want to take up two. They give indications of the times in which we live, particularly given yesterday's occurrence and what will occur after 12 o'clock on Thursday when President Bush's 48-hour deadline has been reached.
There is a $10.2 million payment to enhance physical security at Australia's overseas posts. That is utterly necessary, not just because of the attack on our civil population in Bali but because of the apprehended attack—the one that could have taken place but was stopped—at the Singapore High Commission. It is very necessary that we have a higher level of physical security at our posts overseas. That money is well spent, because we have entered entirely different times since the outbreak of the war on terror. For the United States, terror had manifestations in the decade before this one. There was the attack on the USS Cole and there were attacks on US embassies. Now, as a result of the actions of al-Qaeda and other groups who have directly attacked us, we also directly face that kind of threat.
So you can rightly say to the Australian people, including the people in my electorate of Blaxland, that, if you know the details of this and the government actually provides you with the information and you can work out the context, it is a good and appropriate expenditure of extra funds—or you can condemn it as being inadequate or inappropriate. But these figures also tell you more about the underlying pressures on governments, and they also tell you more of the story about what is hidden away.
In Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003, the government has appropriated, over $406 million all up for a range of things, including commitments to the International Development Association and to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. The government has also done something else that is necessary due to the times. I quote from the library's publication:
The Schedule lists an additional $1 984 000 for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to `enhance Government understanding of the overseas environment affecting Australia's vital interests and take appropriate action, consistent with applicable legislation, to protect particular identified interests'.
The figure specified there was $1,984,000, and that extra money is to be expended on ASIS. You would think ASIS would need a substantial amount of money, given the task it has been charged with. ASIS is to `enhance government understanding of the overseas environment affecting Australia's vital interests and take appropriate action.' I actually think they would need a lot more money to achieve that aim with this government, which is so blind, so myopic and so challenged when it comes to understanding our region, the world in which we live and the fact that our vital interests are utterly affected by what happens in the overseas environment that it yesterday lined up with the United States to take what is effectively a unilateral approach—although, because the Prime Minister is one who is given to semantics, you can call it a trilateral approach—to an attack on Iraq.
This is the new holy trinity: three driven Christian fundamentalists, President Bush, Prime Minister Blair and Prime Minister Howard, who have determined to go down a road on their own, putting aside the UN and its Security Council, putting aside the possibility of a vote on the second resolution that they tried so desperately to get. Prime Minister Blair tried in order to save his government from falling to pieces, and Prime Minister Howard tried in order to save his political bacon in Australia. Nearly $2 million will not be enough to do the job of educating this government about the nature of our region. It will not be enough to do the job of educating this government about the direct threat from overseas terrorists—al-Qaeda and others of their ilk—that they have brought to these shores by the actions they undertook yesterday.
After more than six months of total subterfuge on the Prime Minister's part, the real decision that he took in October-November last year was finally brought to book at cabinet in the half hour after 8.30 yesterday morning. We finally had the weasel words put aside; we finally had the decision, which had always already been made by the Prime Minister, to follow George Bush wherever he might go with respect to this. We need a greater commitment for ASIS and our other operatives in the region, because the danger is now so much greater.
After Bali, it was evident that terrorists, if they could, would continue to operate not just in Bali but also in Australia. I do not think the majority of terrorists worldwide would care too much about the demise of Saddam Hussein. They know that his regime, the Ba'athist regime, is a socialist and nationalist government that is based not on fundamentalism of a religious kind but on a secular fundamentalism particular to the area. What they will do is use the situation of those three Western powers going in alone without UN sanctions to run a harder terrorist campaign against them. That campaign will be more difficult to stop than earlier campaigns.
In the final analysis, that is not really a problem for the United States of America. The reason for that is that the United States is now a superpower, if not an absolute world hyperpower. With the money and the capacity it has, it can defend itself. We are different. In his resignation speech before the British parliament, Mr Cook, a former British foreign secretary and until yesterday the Leader of the House of Commons, indicated very powerfully what should have been motivating this government in all its considerations of Australia's position in the region and the world. His words were powerful, and well directed and they went to the core of the problem for Australia. He said:
The US can afford to go it alone but Britain is not a superpower. Our interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreements and a world order governed by rules.
No stronger nor more apt words could have been spoken in Britain and no stronger nor more apt words could be spoken in Australia. If that is the case for Britain as a former world superpower, then a middle-ranking power like Australia could heed those words very strongly. Multilateral agreements and a world order governed by rules are what can protect Australia. Operating within the aegis of the UN is in Australia's interests and in Australians' interests. These bills have extra expenditure in the security and defence areas. It is small compared to what will be demanded in the budget coming up and in additional estimates in the future because this Prime Minister, acting unilaterally, has not taken the advice of the former British foreign secretary.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, against the backdrop of war. Yesterday, upon receiving a call from the United States President, as we all know now, the Prime Minister committed us to military action. It is therefore a sad day and a sad week for this country and, in particular, for its ADF personnel, because of the imminent danger that they are now placed in, and for their families. When I was looking at these bills some weeks ago, I was looking specifically at those things that went in the budget and at the way in which, in particular, the domestic matters of this nation would be affected. The views I had on the parlous state of the budget have now been compounded by this reckless and aggressive act by the government of the day.
My first concern is the likelihood of the needless deaths of potentially thousands of innocent civilians and military personnel that are sure to occur as a result of the decision made by the government to declare war upon the Iraqi regime. My second, but also important, concern is the adverse impact this decision will have on our economy and the high price that Australians will pay as a result. You only have to look at petrol prices in the states—other than in Queensland, which has a rebate—to see that the prices at the pump are now exceeding $1 in every state, and even Queensland is not far behind the rest of the country. I think this is just one manifestation of the effects that decisions like these have on the economy. That is not to say that there is not a multitude of reasons for these things occurring—high prices in oil can occur for a variety of reasons. However, it is fair to say that there is a causal link between the decision that has been made by a very few nation states to go to war and the effect that has on a number of things. I suppose it is going to be very difficult for us to calculate with any certainty what the economic impacts will be, but they are something this government has to start having regard to. This government has entered the war for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that the Prime Minister felt, having made a secret and premature commitment, that he could not get out of the arrangements he found himself in. As a result of that, we find ourselves in a situation where, from the Prime Minister's point of view, he was not able to reverse that decision. That is an unfortunate thing. It is a result of him not wanting to lose face personally as much as anything, and it is a tragedy that he would actually place his own personal pride above the lives of our defence personnel.
The other thing that the government has to have regard to is the economic dimension. In many respects, it is clearly failing to deliver dividends to the Australian community and the services the community expects in the areas of health and education, which are really lacking at the present time. In having regard to those things, the government has to factor in and extrapolate from the evidence it has—and I do not think it has done this in any professional or concerted way—the adverse effects that this war will have on our economy and as a result our community at large. The government has decided to place us at the heart of this conflict, and it is accountable for that. It is therefore accountable for the economic consequences of that.
These appropriation bills alone provide a compelling reason why ordinary Australians believe that the Howard government has stopped caring about and listening to the bulk of the population. These bills highlight the disregard this government exhibits towards families doing it tough, families in need of decent social services, families expecting the provision of decent health care throughout the community. The government has presided over the ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots in this country, and there has been no effort to arrest that trend. In my own electorate, I am constantly confronted by locals who raise concerns about the inequity of the current application of the family tax benefit and the way in which people are expected to pay inordinate amounts of tax if they are to secure any income by their own earnings. Not only is the family tax benefit acting in an adverse way for those receiving the lowest incomes in this country but it is clearly acting as a disincentive for those who are in receipt of it to go out and work.
We know the majority of Australians, where they are physically and mentally able, would prefer to work than receive benefits if given the option. Therefore, I do not think it is right that this government fails to have an adequate social policy to provide an incentive for people in receipt of social welfare to work with dignity. That is something that this government seems to have completely disregarded. I have noticed that, in an attempt to reinvent himself, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has started to show some ostensible regard for this problem amongst recipients of the family tax benefit, but I do not expect him to do anything in reality. I hope that his government does something, but I would suggest that his comments are more about his efforts to refashion himself so that he can suggest that he has some heart ticking away in his chest that cares for Australians. Other than those meek efforts by the minister for employment, who by the way does not have responsibility for this particular area of policy, the government has made no effort to have regard to that very important area. I think it is an area which shows a failure by this government and which the government has to have regard to. I hope it will do something about it.
One area that has been focused upon now for some time is the decline in bulk-billing—the slow killing of bulk-billing—that seems to be occurring throughout this nation. This government has said in recent times that it is all for Medicare, but it acts in a way that belies its words. It tries to have one believe that it is interested in maintaining a decent, accessible Medicare system, but its actions prove that the contrary is true. I find it quite disturbing that many of those electorates which have the lowest access to bulk-billing are held by coalition members but you will not find many government backbenchers raising—certainly in any public way—the issue about the decline in, and lack of access to, bulk-billing. They follow blindly their Prime Minister and this government in allowing its decline, while many of their communities are worse off.
The people in the electorate of Burke can be assured that I will not stop raising this matter. The electorate of Burke has historically had a reasonably decent level of access to bulk-billing, but it too has declined in recent times. That decline has occurred, not surprisingly, since this government was first elected, and in the last year or so the decline has been very rapid. In certain areas of my electorate—particularly in Melton, which is the largest community in the electorate of Burke, and in Sunbury, which is where I live—there have been major problems about ensuring that there is access for those people who require bulk-billing. Again, we should not be surprised, because we know that the Prime Minister is on the record as saying that he would like to do some grievous bodily harm to bulk-billing—`stab it in the stomach' I think were his words. He certainly wants to do that, and he is achieving his objective in ensuring the decline.
The decline in bulk-billing is also happening at a time when we have had a 7.5 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums, which occurred only last week. So we have a number of problems in this area. Firstly, people are having difficulties accessing bulk-billing. Concurrently, those who are able to afford private health insurance are paying premiums which are increasing at a rate which is in excess of inflation. So people are paying in real terms a greater cost for their health, but I have to say that there has been no real return. The services have not improved or broadened; in fact, the services provided by private health insurers have narrowed. So a multitude of factors are really bringing the health area under question. In particular, the public health system is under enormous strain, and this government has failed to respond to those things.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, would have you believe that no-one out there who is truly in need is unable to actually access bulk-billing, but that is not the case. I would ask the minister for health and the Prime Minister to tell that to Cathy, who resides in Melton in my electorate. Cathy has three kids at school. She has a kidney condition which requires medication which costs $100 a month. She pays the Medicare levy, but her doctor no longer bulk-bills. She has indicated to my office that she would even be in support of an increase to the levy if it meant a better Medicare system.
I do not think that looking at increases to levies is an area to which any government would prefer to go, although this current government is becoming a master of increasing and introducing levies. However, the reason why Kathy made that point to me, I think, was to say, `The main problem for me is not being able to access the health services I require.' It was only in that context that she raised the issue of being willing to pay an increase in the levy. The fact is that this woman and her children are not on social welfare—she is not a pensioner and she does not have a concession card. Despite her condition, she is gainfully employed. She is not able to receive bulk-billing, and it is really hurting her and, most importantly, hurting her family. These are things that the government should be attending to, but they are failing to.
Another local constituent, Joan, also of Melton, has increased difficulties in making ends meet. A mother of five, Joan—who, by the way, is also privately insured—has told me that she needs bulk-billing, particularly to cover the health care of her children. Hers is a one-income family. She has no health care card but is in need and finds doctors' services and the application of Medicare insufficient to provide her with the medical assistance that her family needs. She also is at a loss to know what she should do. She said that she did not know what she would do if all her children were ill concurrently; she did not know how she could pay the bills. Kathy and Joan are income earners but are finding affordable services very difficult.
Along with a number of my Labor colleagues, I would also like to touch upon this government's record on taxation. It has now been established and universally accepted that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. The shadow Treasurer has provided this House with the remarkable statistic that our current Treasurer is responsible for the five highest tax to GDP ratios, and that includes the only occasion that the Commonwealth government has taken more than 17 per cent of our national tax in income tax. Above and beyond this outrageous and unforgivable financial impost, we have been hit with the highest and broadest indirect tax, the GST. Not only has there been an unprecedented level of tax; it has also been a regressive impost, with the burden impinging harshly and inequitably upon those who can least afford it.
This government has collected more taxes, and increasingly those taxes have been recovered from lower income earners, given the reliance of this government on the goods and services tax. But the government's expenditure for those in need—expenditure for much needed health and educational services—has fallen away. To me, that is particularly indefensible, and I think this government stands condemned for its failure to deliver those things. The effects of an unprecedented level of income tax would have been mitigated if services had been provided to those in the community who need them to live their ordinary lives well and to have a decent quality of life. The community could then understand the tax increases under this Treasurer and government. What is not explicable is that the tax has risen at a dramatic rate but the services have declined in many areas—although not in all areas—of health and education.
I now have a particular local problem in Sunbury. The hospital, which has been under the operation of Mayne Health, has decided to close its doors. I have been attempting to have discussions with Mayne Health. They have decided to sell their business, and I wanted to act in a very proactive and positive way with Mayne Health to see whether we could maintain the same services—the staff and the expertise of the staff—for the community in order to ensure that potential patients within the region have nothing to fear.
As Mayne have refused to meet with me, I am becoming less surprised about Mayne Health's reputation as a provider of health services. Because of all the calls I have received from the community, from Sunbury in particular, about this issue, I would have thought it incumbent upon Kaye Rollinson, the CEO of Sunbury Private Hospital, to meet with me when I had made two requests to meet with her. She did schedule meetings, but ultimately she deferred two of them and eventually said, in effect, that she did not want to meet with the federal representative of her patients. I found that to be really indefensible.
Mayne have now sold their business to Primelife, and I will be looking to engage in discussions with this new company. However, there is some speculation that this company is only going to enter into the business of aged care services. I welcome the increased provision of aged care services, but I am very concerned that this is going to adversely affect the services that we already have in Sunbury and in the region. If this hospital closes down and all we receive in its place are aged care services, we have a major problem. Therefore, I think we have to start to rethink how much of the health budget we would like to see going into the hands of private operators who cannot seem to look after health in the long term and to look after patients before profits.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—The last few days have been quite momentous for this parliament. We have debated various important issues relating to the conflict with Iraq—weapons of mass destruction, post-conflict rebuilding in Iraq—and this afternoon we heard about musicians. That is right: musicians. I was listening closely to some of the contributors to the debate, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Hughes, talked about musicians. Given her position, I expected a very deep and insightful contribution on defence matters relating to the deployment in Iraq. Instead, while listing Iraq's weapons, she included `12,000 musicians'. I am sure she meant 12,000 unexploded chemical or biological warfare munitions—either that, or Iraq has some truly dreadful musicians.
However, I rise to speak about a matter that is affecting tens of thousands of Australians, including thousands of my own constituents, and that is the bungling and maladministration of Centrelink, particularly in the areas of the family tax payment and the child-care benefit. I want to outline a number of my constituents' cases and then look at what action I have taken on their behalf and what the minister and the government need to do. Firstly, Steven and Louise—not their real names—were receiving the child-care benefit, which they received through a reduction in their child-care fees. I would like to say that the opposition supports measures to assist working parents. Balancing family and work is increasingly difficult, and it is made all the more difficult by the way this government has treated child care, but that is a debate for another time.
This couple received the child-care benefit for a number of years and at all times informed Centrelink what income they were receiving. They had no problems until they received a notice of debt for around $2,500. There was no allegation of fraud or mistake on behalf of Steven or Louise. In fact, Centrelink admitted that both Steven and Louise had provided Centrelink with the correct information. Naturally, these two constituents appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The SSAT is an independent review tribunal which has the power to amend, overturn and make new decisions. The SSAT said that the authorised review officer at Centrelink:
... concluded that the over-payment was solely caused by computer error of the Family Assistance Office—
the office at Centrelink that deals with these matters—
but that the debts could not be waived.
The SSAT continued:
... there is no dispute that there were errors and that the errors continued despite [Steven's and Louise's] best efforts to provide accurate information to Centrelink.
Yet still they refused to waive the recovery of the debt. The matter is continuing. My constituents put a carefully reasoned settlement offer to Centrelink. They wrote:
The FACS web site referred to Beadle and D-GSS (1984) 1AAR 362. The AAT held that, in order for “special circumstances” to exist, it must be possible to say that the circumstances in the case in question are “markedly different from the usual run of cases”. The circumstances must have “a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special”.
There have been a series of compounding errors committed by Centrelink—
which makes them special, in my view—
which have been acknowledged in previous correspondence. In addition, it has been recognised that my wife and I notified Centrelink of the errors and kept Centrelink updated of our income in a timely fashion et cetera. These facts are contained in the various documents of the SSAT and AAT. Surely the Respondent is not trying to submit that the litany of errors in this case (which have been admitted to by Centrelink) are “usual business practice for Centrelink” and thus can avoid the waiving provisions of section 101.
The content of the offer made by my constituents to Centrelink was that they would repay all moneys `owing' prior to 25 February 2002, when they renotified Centrelink of their income. After that point, it was Centrelink that failed to fix the error. Steve and Louise said that Centrelink should waive the debts accrued after that date. Given the monumental stuff-up by Centrelink, I wrote to the Centrelink officer handling the case and to the parliamentary secretary to the minister who had previously dealt with this case. Despite the fact that I am yet to receive a response from the parliamentary secretary, and there does not appear to have been any correspondence between Centrelink and the parliamentary secretary, Centrelink knocked back the offer last week. My constituents have not been informed, nor have I been informed directly. This is a serious issue that I will return to. That is the first case that I want to cite.
Secondly, the case of Rebecca—again, not her real name—arrived in my office yesterday. She is a student who is receiving a RAMUS scholarship, administered by the Department of Health and Ageing, to encourage rural and regional students to enter medicine. Once again, it is a worthy goal that has been bungled under the administration of this government. I suppose this is another case of the ends not justifying the means, which is being debated in the main chamber in relation to Iraq. The `ends' here is very worthy, as is the child-care benefit, but this government simply cannot seem to operate this scheme.
Rebecca received a $10,000 RAMUS scholarship for 2002, but the scholarship did not start until 29 May, when she received $4,000 as a back-payment for January, February, March, April and most of May. Once again, it is a gem of good administration—you can imagine a student having to live, having come from the bush and trying to study medicine for all of those months, without the support of the scholarship. As soon as she received notification that she would receive the scholarship, which was even before payments started, she told Centrelink. Centrelink said that she did not need to inform them until the payments had started. It seems that Rebecca is being penalised for being too organised and for telling Centrelink too much. She continued to provide Centrelink with all relevant information, including bank statements and letters about the scholarship payments, but she was still overpaid.
This year she received another debt notice. However, the notice did not detail when or how the overpayments had occurred. On 17 February, Rebecca wrote to Centrelink requesting a review of its decision, reasons for the decision, access to her file and suspension of the debt pending a review. To date, she has not received the information requested, despite Centrelink being under a legal obligation to provide such information under the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. This government seems rarely concerned with legal niceties, such as the legislation passed by this parliament.
It would seem that Centrelink programmed into Rebecca's file that she had received both the $10,000 scholarship and the $4,000 lump sum, despite Rebecca providing Centrelink with all the paperwork showing the $4,000 was a back-payment. Rebecca has written to the Minister for Family and Community Services, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs as well as to various secretaries to the departments and to the CEO of Centrelink. Although I cannot identify Rebecca, I urge these recipients to carefully consider the letter and to provide her with a thoughtful and timely response.
The third case I want to raise involves Peter—again, not his real name—who is receiving family tax benefit and child-care benefit. There is a letter from him where he says:
The series of events that have occurred between the family office—
the part of Centrelink that deals with these payments—
and us since this point could almost be comical if not for the serious discomfort it has caused and the financial implications it is likely to cause later. It involves an overpayment of $5,827 and a federal government waiver of $2,000 of our outstanding debt, which then stood at $3,827. It became apparent to us through a series of inquiries that our figure was inflated due to the fact that we claimed a loss of rental property, which is classified as income by the family office. I beg to understand how anybody, and especially ourselves, are expected to make such assumptions that this definition of taxable income, first of all, differs from that of the ATO's. On top of that, as the rule was introduced for the first time that financial year and a decision was not made to rent out our residence until my wife moved to Melbourne in late July/early August ...
All these cases are current and I am just one of 150 members of this House of Representatives. Imagine how many other cases there are.
We have asked the Minister for Family and Community Services questions, the answers to which would, I think, be of interest to all members of this House. These questions include the following:
(1) What is the procedure for raising and recovering a debt against Centrelink clients.
(2) What is stated in any letter informing clients of the debt.
(3) At what stage do payments start to be reduced in order to repay the debt.
(4) What happens to repayments or reduced payments when appeals to an Authorised Review Officer, Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts are pending.
(5) What happens to repayments or reduced payments in the time allowed for an appeal following an adverse decision.
These questions—No. 1540 on the Notice Paper—and those I asked on 16 October last year, remain unanswered. Question 1000 asks:
(1) Has the Government placed advertisements in newspapers Australia-wide advising recipients of payments like Newstart allowance or Parenting Payment to let Centrelink know when their circumstances change in order to not only keep the social security system fair, but also so that they will not have to pay back any overpayments.
(2) Were all individuals who provided Centrelink with up-to-date information on their personal details not asked to pay back any overpayments.
(3) In 2001-2002 how many recipients of the Child Care Benefit were overpaid despite providing Centrelink with up-to-date and accurate information on their income.
(4) In 2001-2002 how many recipients of the Child Care Benefit were overpaid but later received a waiver for the overpayment.
I have placed a number of other questions on the Notice Paper on this matter, and they all relate to the incredible bungling of this payment. In my view, they relate to a fundamental fault in the government's legislation in the area of family tax payments. I think that was best explained by the shadow minister for family and community services and the Manager of Opposition Business, when he said that two-thirds of all family couples have more than one income. One in three of all families in this country who are receiving this benefit—some 600,000—got into debt.
It is not simply the view of Mr Swan that these families, who are attempting to notify the government of changes to income, are ending up with enormous debts; it is also the view of the Ombudsman. The opposition has a basic attitude to this that I think would solve all the problems we have got ourselves into since the current government brought in this change. Our suggestion is that we go back to the system where people claim these benefits on the basis of previous income. Let me read a summary of some of the views of the Ombudsman with regard to how this matter has been handled by the Howard government.
The credibility of the government on its family policies has been stripped away by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's special report on family and child-care benefits. The Ombudsman's investigation attacked the government's family payments system and admits that, without fundamental policy changes, it will continue to trap families in debt. The report attacks the estimation rules at the heart of the family payments system, arguing that they `inherently result in a large number of debts and that many debts are significantly high' and that they `are affecting many lower income families'. It also says that `debts may be unavoidable'. The Ombudsman concedes that, even if his recommendations were implemented in full, the scheme is likely to continue to result in significant numbers of unavoidable debts for families. The government's refusal to correct the design of the system shows how completely disconnected it is from the daily struggles of Australian families. The Prime Minister's concern for family assistance reform should now be clearly seen for what it is: a belated admission that his system punishes Australian families. 
The Ombudsman's report should be seen by all members of this House. It is highly critical of many elements of the current system, which the government has refused to address. Some of the recommendations he makes include that the government abandon its controversial up-front stripping of tax returns, that it extend the current provisions relating to the waiving of debts that arise from administrative error and that the current limitations relating to top-up payments, which saw 25,000 families denied nearly $30 million in payments last year, be abandoned.
I conclude by saying that I will continue to pursue the various ministers who may be able to assist my constituents with the outrageous injustices that have been done to them in these particular cases, but the problem is systemic. Unless the family tax benefit system is altered and based on previous income, these kinds of debts incurred by low- and middle-income families are going to occur in everyone's electorate. We ought to go back to the previous system; the current one has failed.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I intend to take the opportunity tonight in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 to expand further on the issue of the coming war with Iraq, to take up some time of the chamber to go into a bit more detail on some of the issues that we face as a nation and to expand on comments I have made previously in two other earlier debates on this issue, including last night. I thought I would, as a starting point, go step by step through the motion moved by the Prime Minister yesterday on this issue and make a range of comments about aspects of that motion. In some cases I agree with what the Prime Minister has said but, in many cases, I disagree with what has been moved. The motion said:
That this House:
(1) condemns Iraq's refusal, over more than 12 years, to abide by 17 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council regarding the threat it poses to international peace and security;
I would like to make it very clear to the House that I totally agree with that condemnation. There is no doubt that Iraq's behaviour over the last 12 years—and, frankly, for a long time before that—has been that of a barbaric regime. I am on the record as stating quite clearly that I agree with the terminology that describes Saddam Hussein as the `Butcher of Baghdad'. I believe that his treatment of minority groups and dissidents within his own country is abhorrent, disgusting and disgraceful and that he certainly has no credit as an international leader. In fact, he is someone who deserves to be removed—there is absolutely no doubt about that. I would also make the point, though, that I think he shares that with a number of leaders on the international scene. There are other countries that we do not seem to hear as much about these days which have leaders who also behave in a dictatorial and disgraceful manner towards their own people and towards other peoples. 
I think you also have to look at just what the situation has been with Iraq and Saddam Hussein and what support his regime has received from various sources over that period of time. In the last 24 hours, we have seen comments from Robin Cook, a recently resigned member of Tony Blair's cabinet, which go through a range of very serious points on this issue. In particular, he has made points about the question of the support that the Hussein regime received from the Americans and from the British for the development of some WMD—weapons of mass destruction—capacity and also about the question of arming the Iraqi army for the war which took place some years ago with Iran. Can we say that Saddam Hussein is evil? Yes. Can we say that he and the country that he leads ought to be condemned for their activities over that 12-year period and for their refusal to accept and abide by those 17 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council? Absolutely. But I still ask the question at the end of those points: does that lead us to the conclusion that is now facing this country and the world?
Part 2 of the motion asks the House to recognise:
(a) that Iraq's continued possession and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, in defiance of its mandatory obligations under numerous resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, represents a real and unacceptable threat to international peace and security;
(b) that Iraq's behaviour weakens the global prohibitions on the spread of weapons of mass-destruction, with the potential to damage Australia's security; and
(c) that, as more rogue states acquire them, the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists multiplies, thereby presenting a real and direct threat to the security of Australia and the entire international community ...
I will address those points in order. Firstly:
(a) that Iraq's continued possession and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, in defiance of its mandatory obligations under numerous resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, represents a real and unacceptable threat to international peace and security ...
I think it does. The question is: to what degree are we seeing that continuing? That is why we have had weapons inspectors in Iraq doing their job. That is why those weapons inspectors have asked for more time. That is why those weapons inspectors have been making progress. That is why those weapons inspectors are saying that that time could be used usefully to try to get to the bottom of the question of what Hussein and his government are up to. Why not allow a few more weeks? If, as the motion states, we are talking about a situation that has developed over 12 years, then why not allow another 12 weeks? What in particular is likely to happen over that 12-week period? If that period were to allow us to get to the stage of having a far greater international consensus if action were required, or if circumstances were shown to be such that the Iraqi capacity for dealing in these weapons was not as great as feared, then why would we want to try to fix that by a massive conflagration? 
Point (b) asks the House to recognise:
... that Iraq's behaviour weakens the global prohibitions on the spread of weapons of mass-destruction, with the potential to damage Australia's security ...
I accept that in a general sense. I accept that any nation or any group that acts in a manner that can lead to the spread of weapons of mass destruction has the potential to damage international security—and, from that, Australia's security. Again, I question whether Iraq is the major threat that we face today that we must act upon. I strongly believe that there are other threats—for example, North Korea and al-Qaeda—that pose a more direct, clear and present threat to Australia's security and to international security than that posed by Iraq at this time. 
Point (c) of the motion asks the House to recognise:
... that, as more rogue states acquire them, the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists multiplies, thereby presenting a real and direct threat to the security of Australia and the entire international community ...
I agree with that point. However, I raise the question again of whether taking action now of a military nature, as is clearly proposed by the US and the British, with our support, is the best way to address this issue at this time. I do not believe that we cannot allow a little bit more time to try to give peace a chance in these circumstances.
Point 3 of the motion calls on the House to abhor:
(a) Iraq's continued support for international terrorism; and
(b) the institutionalised widespread and grave abuse of the human rights of the Iraqi people over many years ...
I absolutely agree with that point. The problem I have is that Iraq's support for international terrorism in the context of al-Qaeda is largely unproven at this stage. Obviously its support for international terrorism in a general sense is abhorrent, but again I come to the question: is that a reason at this time to act in this manner in a situation which is going to lead to enormous acts of violence and, I believe, enormous loss of life for the Iraqi people in particular? As for (b), frankly I am really pleased to see the government recognise `the institutionalised widespread and grave abuse of the human rights of the Iraqi people over many years'. I am really pleased to see that the government has recognised now and over the last few months the enormous pain and suffering of the Iraqi people and the grave abuses of human rights that they have suffered over many years. It was only a few months ago that Iraqi people were trying to escape Saddam Hussein's regime and endeavouring to go elsewhere in the world as refugees—and to come to this country in particular—in order to try and establish new lives. It was only a matter of months ago that these people were being rejected. It was only a matter of months ago that this government did not really see a problem or an issue with respect to large parts of the Iraqi population or those who were trying to escape from Saddam Hussein's regime. I guess it is a good thing that the government has belatedly come to this conclusion, because until recently the actions of the government have not shown this at all in relation to refugees from that part of the world and from Iraq in particular.
Point 4 of the motion notes:
... that United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations charter, in particular resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, provide clear authority for the use of force against Iraq for the purposes of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and restoring international peace and security to the region ...
I do not agree with that notation. I am not a lawyer. There is certainly a great deal of speculation internationally and within this country about the legality of this action as it is now proposed. I do not propose to get into that debate in any great detail because it is not a debate that I am qualified for. But what I would say is that, if it were so clear cut and so certain that this was a reasonable action, I do not believe the US, the UK and Spain would have so desperately sought a further resolution from the United Nations. If it were so clear cut that the capacity was there under those resolutions for this action to be taken, I do not think so many other nations would have taken the view that this was an unreasonable action to take under the circumstances. In my view, it has only been in the context of this particular resolution that we have had a concentrated debate about the fact that the end result will be military action on a massive scale. We have seen threats made in relation to Iraq's behaviour plenty of times. There have been plenty of times when actions have been taken along those lines, and those resolutions are examples of that. But, in terms of the explicit statement of fact around time lines and interventions of a massive military nature, I do not believe that we have seen that occurring previously.
When we come to the question of the legality of it, my point is that only a matter of days ago this resolution was seen as something that had to be pursued in order to gain international support. It was seen as a resolution which there was significant opposition to, but the British and US governments were putting enormous diplomatic efforts into it to try and get support from a range of countries. It is a situation which has seen significant international criticism of the French, the Germans, the Russians and the Chinese on the question of vetoing or otherwise opposing the resolution.
When you look at that, you have to say that there was a reason for those diplomatic moves and a reason for that debate. Although, technically, there may be an argument on a legality, the fact is that it was clearly understood and seen to be a situation where that resolution was required to gain international support. In my view, from a legal and moral perspective, that resolution was required to be passed, and it was not. Some of the arguments that have gone on since then such as, `We really didn't need it,' or, `It wasn't really that necessary,' or, `We've got what we need anyway,' point to that fact. It also reminds me of the words of a former US President, Harry Truman, who said something along the lines of: `If you can't convince them, confuse them.' Certainly, I think that we have seen a situation in that debate where, when there was no ability to convince those nations to take that action, more efforts were made to confuse the international community as a result. 
Point 5 of the motion says that the House:
... endorses the government's decision to commit Australian Defence Force elements in the region to the international coalition of military forces prepared to enforce Iraq's compliance with its international obligations under successive resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, with a view to restoring international peace and security in the Middle East region ...
I do not endorse that decision, and I think I have made that pretty clear in my contribution so far. I do not believe that it is the right decision to make under the circumstances. I want to make a couple of points following on from that. These forces were put there some time ago, with the intention of clearly heading down this path and being in the situation that we now face today. In those circumstances, I believe that you have to question when this decision was taken, when the Prime Minister came to the conclusion that he announced publicly only yesterday after a call from the US President. I firmly believe that this was a decision that was made some time ago and that, once we put ourselves as a nation on the slide down into this abyss, it was always going to be difficult for this government to pull back. Frankly, I do not believe there was ever an intention to pull back. 
Point 6 of the motion states that the House:
... expresses its unequivocal support for the Australian service men and women, and other personnel serving with the international coalition, our full confidence in them and the hope that all will return safely to their homes ... 
I absolutely, totally agree with that. The Australian service men and women who are involved in this activity are there at the behest of this government. Although I vehemently disagree with what the government has done in terms of its commitment, I believe that these men and women are following its orders. Those orders, from the government's point of view, are orders that they have to follow and they have every right to expect and get our support. They certainly have my support, and I join with the opposition leader and so many other members of the Labor Party across this country and in this parliament in saying that we completely support our forces in their activities. I certainly pray—and I do not pray very often—that they will all come back in one piece as soon as possible. 
Point 7 states that the House: 
... extends to the innocent people of Iraq its support and sympathy during the military action to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and the reconstruction period that will follow ...
On that point, I certainly have a great deal of support and sympathy for the innocent people of Iraq, of which there are many; many of them are about to die, I suspect, as a result of this action. I certainly believe that the situation they face is that of non-combatants in so many wars: that they will be the large part of the true tragedy of what is about to unfold. I certainly hope and pray on their behalf that the disaster that I think is about to unfold is nowhere near as bad as I suspect it may be. I certainly hope that this is, as it now appears to be, a war that will be quick and that casualties will be low, because the alternatives for that community and for the world as a whole are too depressing to consider otherwise. 
Point 8 states that the House:
... notes that the government is committed to helping the Iraqi people, including through humanitarian assistance, to build a new Iraq at peace with itself and its neighbours.
Given that that appears to be the situation we are going to face as a result of this military action, I certainly endorse that. I certainly believe that support will be needed in Iraq after the events of the coming weeks, because I believe that the level of force that is about to be unleashed and the circumstances facing the Iraqi people will be quite horrific. They will require our support after the event to try and rebuild the country. I am certainly hopeful that that can occur at that time, although it pains me greatly to be in a situation where that is what we face.
I do not believe the case has been made clearly by this government—or by anyone, for that matter—about why we cannot wait just a few more weeks. I do not believe that a convincing case has been made—by this government, by this Prime Minister or by anyone else—to show that a few more weeks to allow the weapons inspectors to do their job would not stop this action being required. I believe that with a bit more time that opportunity could be taken up, and I am hopeful that that might lead to a good result. But let us say it does not lead to a good result, to a peaceful result. That would mean that in a few weeks time we would probably be here again debating the same issue. But if we were to be here in a few weeks time debating the same issue, I think we would find a great deal of increased international support for the action that is about to be taken, on the basis that we had exhausted the opportunities that were there to try and sort this issue out relatively peacefully. That is not what has been allowed to occur.
Again to paraphrase Robin Cook's comments: to see how the international support for a war against terrorism that was there post September 11 has been squandered diplomatically over the last few months by the United States—and, to a degree, by Britain—has been, I think, breathtaking. The fact is that the opportunity to have a united front and to actually move forward and address some of the real problems has been severely curtailed by these actions of the US administration and by the way they have handled this whole issue over several months. We can see that President George Bush has been bent on this activity for quite some time now. I think we are now about to see just how horrible that will be.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"—It is important to be able to participate in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 in such a considered manner. The question of how we shape Australia's future rests on how we shape our long-term national security policy, our long-term foreign policy and our long-term defence policy. We on our side of politics have had a view for the better part of half a century that the way in which we shape that future rests on three fundamental pillars. Those pillars are our alliance with the United States, our policy of engagement with the United Nations' system of collective security, and comprehensive engagement with Asia. For Labor, these have always been the underpinnings of a balanced national security policy for Australia, given the unique geostrategic circumstances in which the nation finds itself. Our nation lies adjacent to the largest Islamic country in the world, the Republic of Indonesia, a country of 230 million people. Our nation lies adjacent to a region of half a billion people, the majority of whom are also Muslim.
Comprehensive engagement—this third pillar of Labor's approach to national security policy—is, for us, fundamental. The question which we deal with as we look to the country's future is: where are we, after seven years of the Howard government, on the security of this country in Asia? The proposition I wish to submit to the parliament is that after seven years this country is less secure in Asia than it has ever been. This country has fewer friends in Asia than it had seven years ago and this country now has more enemies in Asia than it had seven years ago. This is not an impressive report card. It is report card which, in terms of its conclusions, goes to the core of our security in our region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard.
When it comes to the South Pacific, the report card is much the same. After seven years of the Howard government, are we more secure in the South Pacific or less secure? Do we have more friends in the South Pacific than we did seven years ago? Do we have more enemies in the South Pacific than we had seven years ago? The report card and the conclusions contained in it are remarkably the same. If we go beyond our immediate region of South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific—the two great strategic corridors which shape Australia's security circumstances—and look further afield, we could ask the same questions about the Middle East. 
Does Australia, seven years into the Howard government, have more friends in the Middle East than we had seven years ago? Do we have more enemies in the Middle East than we had seven years ago? Do we have more friends in the Islamic world than we had seven years ago? Do we have more enemies in the Islamic world than we had seven years ago? When we put the questions as starkly as that in relation to these great regions which shape so much of our country's future, I fear for our country's future. I fear in a way in which I have never feared before, because we now face a more unpredictable set of national security circumstances than we have faced at any time in my living memory. 
Australia, in shaping its future in Asia, has had a difficult past to overcome. Viewed through the eyes of the region, what was this thing called Australia? It was seen as a white colonial outpost of a European empire which itself had been hostile to many, if not all, countries within the region. Prior to the beginning of the 20th century, Australians had seen Asia, by and large, as a place for foreign missionary endeavour, a region ripe for the harvest of souls. After the earliest part of the 20th century, this sense of missionary endeavour was replaced by a sense of strategic paranoia as we saw the rise of Japan, the rise of China and the beginning of the emergence of what American strategic analysts described at the time as the domino theory. From 1905 to 1975, Australia perceived Asia as a neighbourhood of increasing strategic concern to us. Of course, those concerns came to fruition at the time of the Second World War.
Australian perceptions changed with the fall of Saigon. In the quarter of a century following the fall of Saigon, Australia's view of the region became one less of strategic paranoia and more one shaped by economic opportunity. Until the Asian economic collapse of 1997, effectively that paradigm prevailed. 
We come to the present period—that of the Howard government—which is not simply the product of the events of the last year or two but which is the product of the last century or two in terms of the region's perceptions of us and our perceptions of our region. The importance of that background, given Labor's policy and then the nation's policy of comprehensive engagement of Asia, therefore becomes transparently obvious: Whitlam's recognition of China; Hawke's establishment of APEC; Gareth Evans's establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum; and Keating's continuation and expansion of both institutions, which enhanced this region's sense of multilateralism both in an economic sense and in a strategic sense through the ARF, and also his development of strong bilateral relationships with the countries of greatest importance to us. When you travel in the region today, it is impossible to go past a single capital and not have Whitlam's name, Hawke's name or Keating's name presented to you as names of great men in this country's foreign policy history—men who carved out Australia's new image in our own region, an image of engagement as opposed to an image of hostility or an image of disinterest.
Regrettably, in the last seven years we have seen so much of that legacy unravel before us. The unravelling began back in 1996-97 with the Prime Minister's temporary embrace of Hansonism. We saw the Prime Minister engaged in the most obscene of Voltairean embraces of Pauline Hanson, saying on the one hand that he did not necessarily agree with everything that Mrs Hanson had to say but on the other hand that he defended passionately her right to say it. We all know, in the politics of this country, what that was code language for. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister and unfortunately for the Australian national interest, this double message was read equally clearly across the countries of our region. In newspaper after newspaper, radio outlet after radio outlet and television station after television station, month in and month out, year in and year out, we had reports of this Prime Minister's partial embrace of the policies espoused by Pauline Hanson.
From that time on—that is, from 1996-97 on—slowly the pillar which had been established over a quarter of a century, a pillar of comprehensive engagement with our region, began to crack. It cracked further following our engagement in East Timor, when the Prime Minister again announced to the region in a monumental feat of foreign policy insensitivity that Australia was now the deputy sheriff of the United States in Asia. That was the deputy sheriff doctrine. Australia had had enormous success in what turned out to be the independence of East Timor. The enormous failure lay in the way in which the Prime Minister `celebrated'—and I say that in inverted commas—that success in an interview with the Bulletin magazine. He described himself as the deputy sheriff of the United States. He said that Australia's future strategic role in South-East Asia was to act as the surrogate of US foreign policy interests. In Australia, the debate about the deputy sheriff was dropped within a week. In Asia, the debate was kept up for not just a year; it continues to the present. Once again in newspaper outlets, on radio and television, at academic seminars and in government statements, the good name of this country as a country engaged intimately in the economic and social development of our region came undone.
But it did not stop there. Once again, in December last year, we had the Prime Minister announce to the world and the region that Australia reserved for itself the right to engage in a doctrine of regional military pre-emption against the sovereign territory of our neighbours in Asia. Personally, in terms of the interests of Australians in South-East Asia, I can think of no more irresponsible statement that this Prime Minister has ever made. In making that statement, he sent a signal not just to governments across the region but, much more importantly, to disaffected groups within the countries of the region that Australia represented an external and potentially hostile force. How on earth the Prime Minister could conclude that the announcement of this second Howard doctrine, the doctrine of regional military pre-emption, would in any way enhance this country's national security defies my imagination and understanding. How it could possibly enhance the Prime Minister's ability to work cooperatively with governments within the region on counter-terrorism defies my understanding. How it could have assisted Australians in securing a better outcome for their own personal physical security in South-East Asia defies my understanding.
But the deterioration in our national security circumstances that has occurred over the last several years did not simply stop there. Not just statements of diplomacy, not just statements of foreign policy and not just statements of national security policy but also so-called soft statements and actions on the part of the Howard government have unravelled much of the fabric of our engagement with the region over not just the last quarter-century but the last half-century as well. Here I speak of the demise of Radio Australia. Nothing could have been more retrograde in terms of this country's standing in Asia and South-East Asia than the wilful decision of this government to emasculate Radio Australia's capacity to broadcast its message to South-East Asia and beyond.
Prior to this government being elected, Radio Australia was one of the strongest broadcasters in Asia. We had the capacity through the Cox Peninsula transmitters to send an Australian message not only across all of South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific but across the bulk of Asia itself, to northern China and to the border between India and Pakistan. We had the capacity to send an Australian message about what kind of nation Australia is in the 21st century and about what kind of nation we see ourselves as being in our dealings with our neighbours in Asia. Yet what happened? The Howard government sold the Cox Peninsula transmitters. The Howard government sacked 130-odd foreign language translators working for Radio Australia. This great institution, set up by Menzies—not by us—was brought to its knees, and it has not effectively recovered. When Radio Australia wishes to broadcast an effective message to the world and to the region, it must buy space back from the time available from the Cox Peninsula transmitters, which are now in the ownership of an organisation called Christian Vision, to which the Howard government sold it. It must buy space back from various other commercial transmitters around the world, owned variously by the Taiwanese and by others. Is this the mark of an independent country seeking to carve out its future in the region? I would think not. If you look around the rest of the world, Deutsche Welle, Radio Netherlands, the Voice of America and the BBC are all adding to their own nationally owned transmission capacity in a region which is not even theirs—namely, Asia. At the same time, what has this government done to our national broadcaster? It has emasculated their capacity—step by step, employee by employee, transmitter by transmitter.
I cannot possibly explain to the House how deeply I feel about this act of wanton vandalism. But it is bettered by one other: the wanton vandalism we have seen by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in the recent decision not to fund the National Asian Languages and Studies Strategy for Australian schools. This project was embarked upon by governments, both Labor and Liberal, across this country over the better part of a decade. I had something to do with this project. In 1994, Prime Minister Keating, together with the six premiers of Australia and two chief ministers, Labor and Liberal, commissioned me to draft a report for the Council of Australian Governments on Australia implementing a national Asian languages and studies strategy for Australian schools. Why did that become necessary? Apart from the obvious—which is that Australia had to create for itself a generation of Asia-literate Australians, comfortable and familiar with the languages and cultures of our region—we had for the previous 25 years fiddled around the edges of this great national need. Sixteen reports had been commissioned by the governments from Gorton to Keating on the importance of achieving the creation, through our school system, of a generation of Australians comfortable in the languages of our region. They were not all simultaneous interpreters, not all fluent in one, two or three languages, but a solid and emerging cohort of young Australians comfortable in the principal languages of our neighbourhood: Mandarin, Japanese, bahasa Indonesia, bahasa Malay and Korean.
We managed to achieve consensus on this. In 1994, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to the report and, most critically, to the funding recommendations underpinning the report that were designed to be implemented from 1995 on—and they were. It allocated funding from the Commonwealth and the states in a joint funding partnership to ensure that these languages critical to Australia's economic future and our strategic future would be taught comprehensively across our school system. The consequence, up to the year 2002, was that nearly 5,000 schools across the Commonwealth of Australia—schools in each of the electorates represented by the members of this House in this chamber now—were teaching Chinese, Japanese, bahasa Indonesia, bahasa Malay or in some cases Korean. How many students did we have learning these languages in Australian schools at the end of last year? We had 750,000 young Australians studying these languages, the languages of our future.
This was a tribute to all governments concerned—Labor and Liberal, federal and state. It was a tribute also to former minister David Kemp that he sustained funding for this program during the initial years of the Howard government. I cannot express my outrage more deeply at the fact that his successor, Brendan Nelson, has not continued the funding for this program. He said it was because the financial resources of the Commonwealth did not permit it for the year ahead. In one fell swoop he has torn up a contract between the Commonwealth and the states going back the better part of a decade. In one fell swoop he has torn up an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which, up until now, has resulted in the exepnditure of some half a billion dollars on creating this generation of Asia-literate young Australians. What was his reason? It was that the responsibility now lies with the states.
I have some familiarity with the agreement that underpinned this great program, NALSAS, because I drafted it. It was a fifty-fifty joint funding agreement made between the Commonwealth and the states for 12 years. It was not supposed to terminate until 2006, by which stage we would have had an entire generation of children having gone through the program in the school system. This man, this would-be minister, this would-be leader of the Liberal Party, has taken this great national initiative and ripped it up in one single action. What he has done is unspeakable in terms of the long-term damage it does to the nation—not to mention the damage it does to those schoolchildren across Australia today, in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and every state of the Commonwealth, who now face the fact that their studies are under question and challenge. Some of the teachers can no longer be afforded and the curriculum work has begun to be wound back, as well as actual classrooms no longer being resourced to do their jobs.
Regrettably, what has happened on Asian languages fits the pattern of what has happened elsewhere. Radio Australia, the Howard doctrine of regional military pre-emption, the first Howard doctrine of Australia as a deputy sheriff of the United States in Asia and this Prime Minister's embrace of Hansonism are all part of a sickening pattern of comprehensive disengagement from our own region. Who will pay the price for this? It will be the Australian people of the next generation. We tried to carve out a future for that generation. This government has caused that future to be fundamentally undermined.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-03-19,"— I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. These bills give us the opportunity to talk about a fairly wide range of matters. In particular, I want to discuss a matter that deeply impacts on my electorate and seems to be wantonly and brazenly disregarded by both the Howard government and the Health Insurance Commission—and I will touch on both those bodies later on in my speech. First, I want to give a snapshot of my electorate and paint a picture of a problem that has arisen as a consequence of the demographics of my electorate. This is a problem that is not being addressed by the federal government. Its ramifications are dire. They range from people not being able to access medical services to people not being able to access psychiatric services.
I understand that the federal government is currently considering a report by a non-government organisation that looks at the issue of mental health. When we look at national priorities, mental health is a consistently overlooked priority. As a consequence, there are people literally dying in our streets and our suburbs. Because it is not a `sexy' subject, and because models and athletes et cetera are not running around talking about it, the issue of mental health is ignored. But it is a massive social problem, and it is one that will continue to exist until both state and, in particular, federal governments actually solve the issue and commit appropriate funds to it, particularly given the costs involved.
I worked as a chief executive officer of a non-government mental health organisation, and I was involved in the National Mental Health Strategy that was brought in by the Keating government in the early and mid-nineties. It was recognised then that, unless the issue of psychiatric and mental health was addressed, there were going to be continuing deleterious effects on the community. Unfortunately, this issue has not been addressed properly, as I said, by either state or federal governments. Until it is, we are going to have people dying in our suburbs, literally.
The problem is that psychiatric services are stigmatised. Mental health is an issue that governments do not want to address because there are no quick fixes to it. When you have people experiencing schizophrenia or chronic depression, those are not things that will suddenly go away, even with pills. Those conditions exist, but their net effect includes the disruption of families, the destruction of lives and jobs and the destruction of opportunities for our young. The effect of governments not addressing mental illness can be seen in the increase in suicide, particularly youth suicide. It can be seen in the increase in the rates of depression. The rate of uptake of antidepressants in this country is skyrocketing. That affects the health budget. Not only does depression affect the health budget; by 2020, it is going to be the leading cause of disease in this country and, in fact, the world. It is a significant issue, and it must be addressed. I understand that there will be a report tabled by, I think, the Mental Health Council of Australia, and tonight I call on the House to ensure that this issue is taken seriously by the electorate. If we are looking for areas that need to be addressed in future, mental health funding is one key area.
I would also like to touch on the provision of health services to the community and to people in my electorate. We have a lot of young families in my electorate. In fact, in a particular belt within the City of Casey we have 20,000 children aged between one and four years. Many young families have shifted into the area. It has a very high mortgage rate. These young families are doing it very tough at the present time. They have come in in a period of low interest rates. In my view, in many cases they have overborrowed, and they are funding their dreams and opportunities by debt. They have to. A number of families in my electorate are paying for their food bills and school fees by credit card. These people are groaning under excessive debt. This issue has also not been addressed by government, and it must be, because if interest rates rise—and that is a possibility, particularly with the imminent war—a number of these families are going to go bankrupt. They are just holding on. My question is: at this time, in this day, why is it that many young families, in many cases with dual incomes, are struggling financially? That is an issue that needs to be addressed.
As a consequence of the large numbers of families that are struggling, the attack on the health system—on bulk-billing and on Medicare—is very keenly felt. It is much more keenly felt in my area than it is in, say, High Street, Armadale, which happens to be in the Treasurer's electorate, or in the inner suburbs of Melbourne. This is an area I want to touch on. The destruction of Medicare is a key concern. We do not just pay this lip-service; it is a key concern for many young families in my area. It is an issue that they discuss quite openly. We receive many representations about this. People are very concerned that this universal health care system is going to be destroyed. We recall particularly that the bulk-billing rate in Holt was 91 per cent in the year 2000. It has actually dropped by 14 points to 77 per cent since then. That is a massive drop in two years. The GP bulk-billing rate has declined by 11 per cent since the Howard government came to power. Australians, particularly those in my region and in my electorate, are being forced to go without. In 2002, Australians visited their GPs 1.75 million fewer times than in 2001. The New South Wales government released a report showing that by the end of the year only 22 per cent of New South Wales GPs are expected to continue to bulk-bill; 40 per cent currently bulk-bill.
From 1983, every year that the Labor Party was in government the rate of bulk-billing increased; every year since John Howard has been elected as Prime Minister the rate of bulk-billing has decreased. Not only has the rate of bulk-billing decreased, but the out-of-pocket cost of seeing a GP has increased by 54 per cent since the Howard government was elected. The cost of seeing a GP who does not bulk-bill has gone up by over 50 per cent. The average out-of-pocket cost of visiting a GP who does not bulk-bill has gone up to $12.57. It has risen substantially in Holt. That is an outrageous increase for families in Holt. Doctors in my region, when asked, maintain that they are not receiving an adequate rebate. They currently receive $25.05, while the AMA believe that, in accordance with the relative value study, the rebate should be between $40 and $50. I think that is an issue that should be looked at—not necessarily universally, but perhaps selectively—particularly in areas and regions like mine, and in rural areas where we are struggling to attract doctors.
That touches on another point I want to make, and that relates to the chronic shortage of doctors in the outer suburbs. The destruction of Medicare has only increased the problem. It is difficult to get doctors into our region. It is not financially viable now for them to set up practices in the area. When people cannot go to a doctor—particularly in our area, where they cannot reach a doctor at night even with a locum service—they go to a hospital. The major regional hospital in my electorate is the Dandenong Hospital. Anne Peek, the Chief Executive Officer of the Dandenong District Division of General Practice, which represents about 260 doctors in the region, has envisaged a situation where not one doctor will be bulk-billing in the electorate of Holt within the next five years—not one doctor! The government has to consider redirecting funding from the outer metropolitan doctors initiative—taking the $80 million that is being talked about there and reallocating it to potentially high Medicare rebates or some other scheme that attracts and keeps doctors in the region.
The strain on bulk-billing doctors has been brought to my attention by the specific example of Dr Zorika Bogetic, a sole practitioner with over 4,000 patients, of whom the majority do not speak English. There is a very high concentration of people from non-English speaking backgrounds in the Dandenong area. People from 142 nationalities reside around the city of greater Dandenong. Many of those people are suffering trauma as a consequence of their past experiences. We have the highest uptake of refugees in the state of Victoria. These are people with special needs, yet they cannot find doctors, particularly ethno-specific doctors, who can cater for them. In Dr Bogetic's case, we are talking about a Serbian doctor with over 4,000 patients. She is suffering from overload. She cannot obtain another Serbian trained doctor to work in her clinic. Two have applied for work, but they have been refused.
Dr Bogetic has approached the Minister for Health and Ageing for help, but she has been turned away. Her workload is so extreme in catering for these communities—and they are not only Serbs but also Bosnians and Croats—that she has not been able to complete things like basic legal reports. In one case, this has led to a threat of prosecution. She received a letter from a legal firm that had requested a report, and the letter said that if she did not submit the report she would be taken to court or to the medical board. In response, Dr Bogetic stated:
I would be happy for you to report me to the Medical Board, as it would be my final chance to be able to secure another doctor for my surgery.
...					...					...
I understand that the Medical Board is present to uphold the high health standards that are expected in Australia, but as you are aware the health system is in crisis in Victoria with a chronic shortage of General Practitioners. My first priority is proper care for my 4,000 patients who can't speak English and came to this country as refugees, with reports for solicitors being a secondary priority in terms of urgency. I am a solo practitioner with ... 4,000 patients.
There is a classic example of a specific area of need that is not being addressed. This person has approached the Minister for Health and Ageing. Further, when the lawyers were talking about prosecuting her, Dr Bogetic said:
In addition, it would be of benefit to me if the Commonwealth Minister for Health, Kaye Patterson and Federal MP for Dandenong, Mr Anthony Byrne were present for my case.
She would like us to testify on her behalf. I would certainly be prepared to, particularly given that she has something like 27 reports outstanding to legal firms. These reports are late because her case load is so great and she is not able to attract a doctor to assist her who is compatible with the clientele that she services. It is just ridiculous.
As a consequence of doctors being unable to bulk-bill, people are forced to visit the emergency room of the Dandenong Hospital. There has been an 11.3 per cent increase in the number of people going to the emergency department of Dandenong Hospital since March 2001. It is quite clear that this is a consequence of the crisis we have in the health system in my region. People go there either because they cannot afford to go to a GP or because they cannot get a GP because there are virtually none. They cannot access basic services. When you think about the numbers of young families in this region with sick children—some of whom can be very sick—the fact that they cannot access services in some of the supposedly affluent parts of my electorate is a disgrace.
But the government will not act to arrest the devastating decline in bulk-billing; it is threatening to reduce funding to public hospitals. Just imagine if funding were cut. In terms of her allocation of priorities, the health minister refused to attend a meeting with state and territory health ministers to discuss the Australian health care agreements. I wonder what that means in terms of demonstrating a commitment to the health of Australians in general. There is one particular issue which I have to keep on banging away at like a drum, because no-one seems to be listening, particularly not the government and the Health Insurance Commission. It relates to my ongoing campaign to secure a Medicare office in the Fountain Gate shopping centre. As I was saying, young families in Holt sometimes have to go to the doctor three or four times a week. They cannot afford to go but in some cases they cannot afford not to go, particularly if the developing illness becomes quite serious. As a consequence of the decline in bulk-billing rates, they go to the doctor and pay their fees up-front, and then they have to go and lodge their forms. But in some cases where they have gone three or four times and had to pay their fees up-front, there is no Medicare office for them to go to because there is not one Medicare office in the city of Casey.
The city of Casey now has a population of 191,000. I think the 2001 census put the figure at about 179,000, but it is much greater than that. The population of the city of Casey is growing at 10,000 people per year as young families stream into the region, but it does not have a Medicare office and it takes something like three weeks to obtain the 85 per cent rebate. As I have said to you, many of these young families have very high mortgages and are struggling as a consequence of this. It would be simple if they could go to a Medicare office and have the rebate paid up-front, but they cannot. They have to wait because there is no Medicare office.
I must admit, I am getting sick to death of speaking to bureaucracies that do not have the needs of Australians at heart. I have to mention the Health Insurance Commission. I am sick to death of its blase dismissal of 19,073 people who wanted a Medicare office, of its dismissal of my ongoing campaign and of its dismissal of the efforts of a government member—Bob Charles—who has been lobbying for this Medicare office for 11 years. Bob is prepared to support me in my quest, so this has bipartisan support. I will not tolerate the Health Insurance Commission putting up these lame excuses as to why they deny the people of Casey a Medicare office. It is just not on.
I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the issues pertaining to this Medicare office in more detail, particularly given that one of the arguments put forward was the fact that other Medicare offices are close by. I will read an excerpt of a letter that I sent to Dr Jeffrey Harmer of the Health Insurance Commission, in which I detailed some of my concerns and addressed some of the concerns that have been raised. In part, I said:
According to the data taken from the 2001 Census, the City of Casey has a population of approximately 179,341. This is expected to rise to 228,683 by 2011.
I went on to say that it is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the country. I further said:
Residents of the City of Casey are being forced to travel to locations such as Dandenong, Knox and Warragul to access Medicare services. The lack of a local Medicare office has caused widespread discontent within the local community, and Holt constituents advise me of their frustration and annoyance in regard to this matter on a constituent basis.
I note that the City of Greater Dandenong, which does possess a Medicare office, has a population of 124,536 residents. Though the City of Casey is populated by a further 54,805 residents, it is not in possession of such a facility. The negative population growth experienced in the City of Greater Dandenong is in sharp contrast to the current and projected population expansion of the City of Casey and again highlights the strong future need for a local Medicare office for the area.
For comparative purposes I included a list of the populations of various councils in metropolitan Melbourne and Medicare offices within the same areas. I want to touch on some of these because it is instructive: Bayside City Council, which has a population of 80,480, has a Medicare office in the Southland Shoppingtown. The city of Boroondara has a population of 153,860 and has a Medicare office in Camberwell. The city of Greater Dandenong has a Medicare office in Dandenong. The city of Knox, with a population of 141,408, has a Medicare office at the Knox City Shopping Centre. The city of Monash, which has a population of 160,862, has three Medicare offices: one in Mulgrave, one in Glen Waverley and one in Chadstone. The city of Whitehorse, with a population of 149,174, has two Medicare offices: one in Forest Hill and one in Box Hill. The city of Manningham has a population of 112,000 and has a Medicare office in Doncaster. Maroondah has a population of 96,000 people and has a Medicare office in Ringwood. The city of Casey has a population of 179,341, as listed on the 2001 census figures, and it has none.
Why does the city of Monash, with a population of 160,862, have three Medicare offices established within its boundaries, yet the city of Casey has not one? The establishment of such a facility not only would meet the immediate needs of the area but would cater for strong, explosive growth over the next 10 years. I understand that the residents of the city of Casey may be denied the establishment of such a facility on the grounds that the said residents can travel to the Dandenong Medicare office. That is ridiculous. They say that it is close because it is a distance of 8.18 kilometres. The distance between the Medicare office in Mulgrave and the Medicare office in Glen Waverley is 5.4 kilometres. Are we going to take one of those offices out? There is a Medicare office in Forest Hill and a Medicare office in Box Hill, with a distance of 6.55 kilometres between them. Are we going to take one of those offices out?
There is an office in Glen Waverley and an office in Knox, with a distance of 7.95 kilometres. It takes 11 minutes to get there. If you accept that rationale, which office will the Health Insurance Commission take out? I find this situation and the contention of the Health Insurance Commission an outrage and an affront. If they think they can hide behind this bureaucratic response to a sincere and genuine demand for a service, they have got it coming. I will continue to lobby to ensure we have a Medicare office. I will present another petition if it is required, but I will not rest until the families of the city of Casey, in my electorate, get what they desperately need and deserve: a Medicare office.
