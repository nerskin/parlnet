"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-27,"—by leave—I move the following amendments together:
After “Monday, 15 March to Thursday, 18 March”, insert:
Monday, 12 April to Thursday, 15 April

After “Monday, 21 June to Thursday, 24 June”, insert:

We now have from the government a proposal for one of the shortest sitting years in history for next year after an extremely short sitting period for the Senate this year. There is a longstanding average of about 70 sitting days for the Senate, and a quick look at the recent performance since the Howard government got a majority in the Senate and tended to treat it like a rubber stamp shows less and less sitting time. So we are now sitting more like 50 days rather than 70 days. There is no good argument for that. The country has not been faced with less legislation, fewer problems or less for its MPs to do; in fact, quite the reverse is the case. As we all know in this chamber, we are now confronted with some tension over sittings between now and Christmas because while the opposition, for example, is arguing that there needs to be further debate on the emissions trading scheme and is proposing that that be debated into the new year, the government is saying it wants it through and would potentially propose that we sit longer. But the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, has written to the government saying that we will not sit longer.
The Greens have repeatedly raised the issue of the Senate being treated a bit like the House of Representatives, and that is as a captive of the executive. And it is not. This is the chamber for reviewing legislation and for making sure that the government gets it right in the interests of the people as a whole. We are looking at pretty monumental legislation like the emissions trading scheme legislation, like the new legislation to do with telecommunications in this country and legislation which has to help manage the economy at the time of the global financial crisis and the much longer crisis for the environment which faces not only this country but the planet. To be able to argue in the midst of that that we should be sitting less and less—I have not heard that argument; I simply see here a prescription for the government for that outcome. It is not acceptable, nor is it acceptable for the government serially to keep thinking that at the end of the year you can have late-hour Senate sittings, extra morning sittings, the potential for Friday sittings, the threat of weekend sittings and chaos by pressure at the end of each year. It is not sensible. We should be planning much better than that. If you cannot budget the Senate sitting hours, how can you be expected to come up with better budgeting for arguably more important things for the nation?
This amendment from the Greens says: ‘Let us sit an extra 16 days next year. That would bring the total to 66, still below the average.’ We know it is an election year. We know that in election years both houses of parliament tend to sit less, not more, because governments want to get out as early as they can once they have got an election date fixed in their mind. But that is not in the interests of the nation. What is in the interests of the nation is us sitting reasonably long times—not to pad out anything but to deal properly with legislation.
The government should look seriously at this, and I hope the opposition will as well. It is a very reasonable amendment that I am putting forward on behalf of the Greens, and I hope that the Senate will adopt it, remembering of course that it is up to us, if we find that we have more sitting time than required, to very simply go home. What is not so easy to arrange is if there are not sufficient sitting hours and we have to sit more, when senators have made arrangements for all manner of other communications, events and functions in their electorates and on the national scene. This is pure and simple good management that the Greens are proposing here. I hope that the government and the opposition will agree with it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-27,"—I indicate my support for the Greens motion. In my time as a member of the Legislative Council in the South Australian parliament, I was long an advocate for longer sitting days. The Senate has a key role in ensuring that the executive arm of government is accountable. I am concerned that there has been a reduction in sitting days in the last few years in the order of 30 per cent or so. I think it is important to support the amendment by Senator Bob Brown, because it is a sensible addition to the number of sitting days.
It is misleading, though, to say that this is all we do. As some have referred to in the media, this is not just the be-all and end-all. It is important that it is acknowledged that senators—invariably those who are not ministers—are involved in Senate committees. There is an enormous amount of work done with respect to that. There is our work with constituents—and, despite what members in the other place say, we do have constituents—and we deal with issues with individuals, community groups and key stakeholders in relation to a number of pieces of legislation. That is a key part of what we do. That is part of our job.
But I am concerned that the reduction in sitting days does not reflect our workload and does not allow adequate time for debate. Therefore I support Senator Bob Brown’s amendment to this motion, because I think it strikes a sensible balance in terms of additional sitting days for the Senate to do its job, to scrutinise legislation and the executive arm of government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I was going to allow the opposition to speak first, because I might otherwise be perceived as closing the debate.
—No. We would like to hear your argument. We would like to hear your view.
—Thank you. I just did not want the perception that I might be closing the debate in relation to this matter.
 (Senator Hutchins)—No. You are speaking to the amendments. You are in order.
—I understand that, but there might be some on the other side who do not follow those niceties.
The program that is now being put forward is very similar to the program that was put forward last year. I will take the Senate through the program briefly. We usually come back around the first week in February, and in this case we are doing so again. We usually sit for two weeks then. In addition, we have to fit in the supplementary estimates, which are again there for a week for the Senate. If you look between February and April, you see that Easter comes early next year, which effectively limits the amount of time we can sit up to Easter. We are sitting quite a number of days during that period.
The Senate, like the House, has a non-sitting period between the end of Easter and May, for the budget to be able to be delivered on 11 May. The government would argue strenuously against the addition of two weeks of sitting in the middle of that period. That period is taken up by the Senate in two ways. It deals with committee inquiries that are put forward in February or which have been carried over from the previous year. The work of the Senate of course is not only within the chamber when the chamber is sitting but also dealing with committees. We also have a number of select committees currently operating—more than at any time in the past, I would imagine. In addition to that—and this is a matter that I might raise in another motion—there is substantial committee work now being referred by the opposition and the Greens to committees of the Senate to be dealt with. The Senate needs time to be able to deal with those references in a sensible way.
The period between the budget and July follows the usual sitting pattern. The budget week is, as usual, three days, when the budget work is dealt with. Then we have budget estimates, which follow that for two weeks, which is also the usual sitting pattern. Then we come back to deal with the budget bills for two weeks before what is commonly referred to as the winter recess. The second half of the year provides ‘two on, two off’—two weeks on followed by two weeks off—right through to the end of November.
I think you have to put this into two other frames. The first frame is that next year is a year in which an election could fall. Two things come from that. The first is that you would expect less legislation to occur during that period. The second is that you would expect, depending on how things occur, that part of the sitting pattern would then not be completed, although I cannot second-guess what the Prime Minister may determine.
The second frame—and this is always an issue that is raised—is that, if there are requirements for additional sitting days, the government can request those. In the past, that has generally met with agreement from the Senate, where it can be demonstrated that the government does have legislation to be dealt with and passed and there is work of the Senate to be done.
There is little practical benefit in scheduling sitting days where it could be perceived that there is no practical work—and that is a matter that has been complained of in the past with respect to bills and sitting days. As always, if there is a requirement for additional work the government has a prerogative to add sitting days to the program. In the past we have expanded the program or set aside particular times to accommodate bills.
I do not agree with Senator Brown’s proposition that we could schedule additional sitting days and then simply go home early. I think the reverse of that is a much better position to adopt. If there are bills to be dealt with, the government can indicate that additional time is required and then we can negotiate, depending on what particular type of bill it is. We can request those additional hours or days for the legislation to be dealt with. That is the process that has been adopted in the past and it is a more sensible program to adopt.
With Easter, the winter recess and what could happen in the course of the year, the 2010 sitting pattern allows the legislation of the Senate to be dealt with in a sensible way. In addition to that, in an election year the legislative requirements are sometimes slightly less. Senator Xenophon indicated that he prefers longer sitting days for the Senate. I agree with that, and that does occasionally occur. We usually deal with bills in the usual way. We ensure that we can have the second reading debate on Monday or Tuesday nights. The Senate has had long experience and practice in managing its program based on the government’s prerogative to put forward a program that is sensible and pragmatic—and the 2010 program recognises the realities of 2010.
Senator Brown has brought forward a range of arguments in this debate. I do not necessarily agree with Senator Brown’s arguments, but I do understand that the Senate always manages to deal with the legislative program and, up to this point, has been dealing with it in the way you would expect. The Senate does get through its legislative requirements in a workmanlike way.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-10-27,"—In a decade’s time, if we go the way we have gone in the last decade, we will be sitting for something like 30 days a year. Ten years ago it was 79 days, and it is proposed that we sit for 50 days next year. What a joke! The government should be able to organise the sitting weeks such that we are not left rushing things through in an ad hoc way because of deadlines and trying to get extra sitting days at the last minute. It is a shambles! Clearly the government does not have a good handle on managing business in this chamber. There has been a 37 per cent drop in the number of sitting days since 10 years ago. At the same time, there has been a 40 per cent increase in the pay of MPs. Of course, we cannot spend all our time here—we have work to do in our electorates—but, when you get down to 50 days, the balance is out of kilter.
The government say they are quite happy about openness, transparency and scrutiny—but they want to have a lack of scrutiny of their legislation in the parliament. They cannot justify a proposal to sit for 50 days next year. No way! But they think they can just come in here and slip it through. I am hoping the opposition will show a bit of backbone and, rather than just talking about the government not being able to manage their business, say that we need to have extra sitting days scheduled for next year. The opposition cannot justify 50 days and then stand up here tomorrow and say: ‘The government cannot run their business; they cannot manage the process. They cannot come in here and try to squeeze it through in the few days we have got left.’ You cannot say that today, tomorrow, next week or in the next sitting period. You have to stand up here today and say, ‘The government have lost the plot in trying to manage their business in this chamber,’ and you have to vote for extra sitting days next year. Extra sitting days next year is not too much to ask for. This is a new government and the legislation they are putting forward needs proper scrutiny in this chamber. The opposition cannot come in here and argue that we should not sit more hours because the government cannot order their business. They have to be very careful about the decision they make on this.
Extra sitting weeks for next year need to be agreed to. It is extremely important. Scrutiny of legislation is important. Debate is important. Unfortunately this government want to rush things through and not have proper debate in this chamber. In 1999 there were 79 sitting days. In 2000 there were 71 sitting days. Under the Rudd government we have 52 days, 52 days and 50 days. In 2008 we had 52 days. In 2009 we had 52 sitting days. In 2010 we will have 50 sitting days. It is going in the wrong direction; it needs to go up. So Family First will be supporting the extra sitting weeks for next year.
It needs to be planned; it needs to be orderly. Coming in here at the last minute to try to get extra days and hours here is not right. Again, the pressure is going to be on the opposition here to argue the case for not having extra sitting weeks next year. We needed more sitting weeks this year, but it needed to be planned; there should not have been an attempt to do it at the last minute, as if a gun were being held against our head. This needs to be put through and the government needs to come in here and explain why there are only 50 days. Why is it not back up around 70 days? It needs to be back up around that level. You cannot justify it not being at that level.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-27,"—There is a simple solution to this: re-elect a coalition government and we will increase the sitting hours and sitting weeks. If that message got out loud and clear, that would solve all these problems. We agree with the Greens, Family First and Senator Xenophon that the government has not planned sitting hours well for this year or, indeed, next year.
—Nor did the coalition.
—The coalition planned for a lot more sitting weeks, if I could take the interjection from Senator Brown. We need to have more sitting weeks in a year; there is no argument about that. There is an overriding premise, though, that the government of the day sets the agenda. The government of the day will set the sitting agenda for each year. It is something that we have always agreed with and supported. However, I give notice to the government for the future. Hopefully we will be back on the treasury bench for the next sitting calendar scheduling but, if we are not and if the government does not set it correctly, we will then support the minor parties—if they are still here as well—in setting a better sitting time frame for each year.
I have been on the record on three separate occasions this year indicating that the sitting schedule has not been long enough. You cannot just come to the last two or three weeks of a sitting schedule and say we need to increase the hours now. This should have been done when we needed to set the calendar at the beginning of the year. We are going to ensure that the government has the running of the program, but again the warning to the government is there: if it does not set adequate hours, we will move away from that long-held tradition of letting government set the sitting pattern and start to run interference in that program to make sure that we have adequate sitting times.
I indicate that the opposition has been reluctantly supportive of occasional extended hours when the government have come to us to ask for them. But, going back to the middle of the year, I indicated that this would not go on forever. We are not going to constantly prop up a government that does not set enough hours in its program. We even had the ludicrous situation earlier in the year where the government deliberately filibustered debate in a very light sitting year in order to negotiate with minor parties. We wasted days upon days with negotiation when that could have been usefully utilised for legislation. We will not be supporting the Greens with their amendment, purely on the basis that the government of the day should be enabled and should be given the right to set a sitting schedule, but again the warning is there: set it better or we will start to interfere.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-10-27,"—Poor decision making is becoming a hallmark of this government, putting Australia’s future at risk. One of the reasons why it is important to have the maximum number of sitting days is to ensure that the government is totally accountable for the poor decisions that it has made. The Greens come in without any warning and move this motion for additional sitting days and then rail against how unaccountable the government is, but you can rest assured that at the next election, whenever it is, the Greens will again preference the Labor Party, as they have done throughout their history.

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—Senator Brown, it is a bit like the Queensland election, when you railed against the Traveston Crossing dam and told everyone how terrible it was and how it was an environmental nightmare. Then you gave preferences to the Labor Party in Queensland to ensure their re-election.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: if the honourable senator wants to go to the coalition’s plan for 11 extra dams in Queensland, he should address the chair, not me.
 (Senator Hutchins)—That is no point of order and you know that.
—He should address the chair, not me. That is a point of order and you should adopt it.
—He is getting around to it; there is plenty of latitude. There is no point of order.
—If there is not a point of order that the speaker should address the chair, I would ask you to refer that to the President for a further ruling.
—You should address the chair on the issue, Senator Macdonald.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will continue to address you, as I was doing until interrupted by an interjection from Senator Brown, who seems to be very keen on applying the standing orders when they relate to others but not when they relate to him. Of course, he should know that interjecting is disorderly and is not allowed. But that is typical of the Greens: one rule for them and different rules for everybody else.
I can understand why Senator Brown is very sensitive about the issue of supporting the Labor Party. I continue to raise the issue of the Traveston Crossing dam in Queensland; the Greens railed against it but then supported the Labor Party, who are hell-bent and determined to build the Traveston Crossing dam. It just shows the hypocrisy, yet again, of the Greens. They will continue to support the Labor Party at the next election, which means supporting this shorter sitting period.
It is absolutely disgusting of the Labor Party to continually reduce the number of weeks that we sit every year. Under the Howard government there was a very substantial increase in the sitting weeks because we were a government that was accountable and we wanted people to understand and to be able to challenge the then government and to look very carefully at legislation that came before the parliament. The poor decisions of this government that are putting Australia’s future at risk should be subject to scrutiny, but it should be up to the government, as Senator Parry has said, to set the program so there is the maximum number of days.
We all know that there will be an election next year. That is going to mean that whatever we decide today is going to be of little consequence because, as I say, the election is due about this time next year and so the sitting days for the balance of next year will be a matter for the new government. Hopefully, it will be a government that will have the maximum sitting hours available.
The one thing on which I do agree with the Greens is how this government has continually cut back on debate and then filibusters its own legislation to stop other parties from properly debating and discussing important legislation before the chamber. We then get this hypocrisy from the Labor Party pleading for extra days because they cannot get their legislation dealt with. They should have thought about that this time last year when they set the program and they should be thinking about that today in looking at next year’s program.
I would urge the government to withdraw this sitting program and to come back to the Senate with a new program that does allow the scrutiny that Mr Rudd is so vocal about giving. He continues to say how open and accountable his government is and yet the hallmark, the measure of this issue, is how many days the parliament sits. We know in the other chamber there is never any debate; every single bill is cut off by the government so that it cannot be properly debated by the House of Representatives. We know because of the numbers over there that the Liberal and National parties have no opportunity to oppose those cut-offs, those guillotines, that are so often applied by the other chamber. But here in the Senate chamber we do have an ability to hold the government accountable. I would urge Senator Ludwig to withdraw this sitting program and to come back to the Senate with a sitting pattern that does allow for the proper scrutiny without begging and bullying the other parties in this chamber for additional days and additional hours towards the end of every sitting.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-10-27,"—I thank the Senate and in particular Senator Bishop for allowing the normal formalities with bills to proceed. On this occasion I am standing in for our very excellent and very learned shadow Attorney-General, the Hon. George Brandis SC. The Access to Justice (Civil Litigation Reforms) Amendment Bill 2009 is principally directed to the case management processes in the Federal Court of Australia, although there are some relatively minor amendments also directed to the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. Case management is the practice whereby judges control the progress of a case through the preliminary stages prior to trial to ensure that the parties keep to an appropriate timetable so that the issues in the dispute are narrowed and that unnecessary costs and delays are avoided.
The bill introduces an overarching purpose to case management, which is to facilitate the just resolution of disputes according to law as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible. This is further defined inter alia to require the resolution of disputes at a cost that is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matters in dispute. Parties to a dispute must conduct the litigation in a way consistent with the overarching purpose, and legal practitioners will be obliged to assist their clients to comply with that duty. Costs orders will be used to compel compliance and they will also be available against lawyers personally. Other sanctions may include orders for the dismissal of proceedings or limitation of the case a party may wish to present. In addition, there are amendments to curtail appeal rights in respect of interlocutory orders to refer any matter for alternative dispute resolution and to charge the heads of each federal court with a responsibility for the effective discharge of the business of the court.
At the time this bill was first introduced there was a particular concern that it did not sufficiently recognise the tension that can exist between the concepts of efficient case management and the interests of justice. This issue was highlighted by the High Court in the case Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd 1997. However, the court revisited the issue in Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University on 5 August 2009. The decision recognises that the function of case management is the delivery of justice and provides guidance to lower courts to prevent their processes being distorted, thus frustrating the proper functions of the courts. This bill sits happily with that clarification.
The bill proposes that certain alternative dispute resolution processes be used in federal civil proceedings as a means by which disputes may be resolved more cost effectively and efficiently. Alternative dispute resolution is a general turn referring to processes other than litigation used to assist people to resolve various disputes. It is important to note that there are different types of such processes, and particular types of alternative dispute resolution processes suit particular types of disputes. This bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and it reported on 17 September. The only substantive submission received was that from the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council generally welcomed the reforms which are the subject of the bill. In its submission the Law Council stated:
The concept of ‘mega-litigation’ has in recent times drawn attention to the impact that private disputes can have on the courts and the strain that such litigation can impose on the scarce public resources required to fund the court system.
The costs of lengthy and inefficient litigation are carried not only by the parties themselves but also by taxpayers, who fund the operation of the justice system. Judicial salaries, court officer and registry staff salaries and court premises costs are incurred unnecessarily by litigation that is not efficient or cost effective. If inefficient litigation monopolises court resources then those that cannot afford protracted litigation are prevented from accessing the justice system.
Subject to one amendment, which will be moved in the committee stage, the coalition supports this bill. The amendment to which I refer is a matter on which Senator Bob Brown and I have been campaigning quite vociferously in Tasmania, and that is for a full-time registrar of the Federal Court to be positioned in Hobart. The Senate has carried motions to that effect. I personally have pursued the matter at Senate estimates on the last two occasions and of course Senator Bob Brown has himself pursued the matter as well. In discussions with the government it seems that the best way forward is to have an amendment, which I understand has now been circulated on sheet 5937, revision 2. I commend that amendment to the Senate.
I conclude my comments in relation to the amendment by saying that it is vitally important that the Federal Court has an appropriate jurisdiction in every single one of the founding states of the Commonwealth. Tasmania is one of those founding states. It is called the Federal Court and one would imagine that, in the basics of the Federal Court administration, there would be equity between the States and they would all have a full-time registrar. The move undertaken by the Federal Court is at best—at very best—about saving $200,000, but we still have not got to the bottom of that because at Senate estimates we were promised that there was no surplus of staff at the Melbourne registry, but all the work in Hobart could be undertaken by the Melbourne registry, although when the Hobart registrar had to fly to Melbourne to help them with their workload it was not because there was a surplus of work in Melbourne registry.
I invite people to read the Hansard and then go figure because quite frankly the explanations provided defied the pub test, defied logic, defied common sense. It seems as though it had more to do with empire building within the registry systems rather than the good management of judicial processes. We were also promised that with less the Hobart registry figures would be even better than they are now. If that is the way to administer court registries one wonders why all the court registries do not slash staff and as a result improve their outputs. I must say, politely, the logic sought to be provided to us by representatives of the Federal Court administration lacked substance.
As a result we in the coalition believe it is justified to move the amendment that Senator Bob Brown will be moving to ensure that the Hobart court registry is reinstated to its proper place and position. It also seems that there is a bizarre demarcation dispute between the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court registry because we were told that the Hobart registrar, when he was full-time, did quite a bit of work for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not want to make a contribution to the salary of the Federal Court registrar in Hobart and so now the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, also run by the government and so also run by the Australian taxpayer, will have to find somebody else to do the Administrative Appeal Tribunal work. Whilst the Federal Court potentially might save some money it is quite clear that another arm of government will have to spend more money on servicing the Administrative Appeals Tribunal aspect in Hobart and as a result the so-called savings in globo will be substantially diminished.
I have indicated to the Federal Court that in future Senate estimates I will be inquiring into the actual alleged savings, but if this amendment is carried one hopes that everything will be reinstated, as it should be, and as a result we will not need to pursue those questions at future estimates. In brief, the coalition commends to the Senate both the bill and the amendment co-sponsored by Senator Bob Brown and me.",SENATE,<title>ACCESS TO JUSTICE (CIVIL LITIGATION REFORMS) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I am pleased to be able to support the Access to Justice (Civil Litigation Reforms) Amendment Bill 2009 before the chair today. It represents much needed reform in an area of traditional resistance to change. I am reminded of the wonderful story Bleak House by Charles Dickens. The story concerns a family dispute in chancery over a fabulously wealthy estate. The fate and fortune of so many characters is dependent upon a settlement which seems to drag on year in, year out—in fact, interminably. The only hearings in chancery were to consider applications for costs from a horde of parasitic lawyers; it was never, ever about the merits of the particular case. Eventually, as always happens, the case was brought to a close simply because the entire estate had been consumed by costs. Those who depended so much on an outcome received nothing; the lawyers, the lot. That is simply a bit of romantic background but with, of course, serious overtones. It reminds us of the real evils of a legal system which is not too many years behind us.
The bill before us today seeks to introduce a number of reforms. The first brace of these is aimed at introducing some discipline into the system, a system which for too long has simply responded to demand without proper consideration of need and good sense. The second is about improving the efficiency of the Federal Court. It is a foundation stone of our constitutional democracy that we have a system of law and a judicial system capable of dispensing justice fairly and efficiently. That has been the ambition anyway. Of course, it has not always been achieved. Too often, the system has been slow and litigious, with too much time spent on process and not enough on adjudication on the merits of the particular matter in dispute. The courts themselves are responsible for some of that, but governments more so. For too long we have been cowed by fine notions of due process. The legal profession too has much to account for due to its behaviour and self-interest.
As we all know, so much legal activity is locked up in process. It is the old standby for lawyers, who know full well that the other side can be exhausted before merits even get questioned or considered. For too long it has been a ploy as part of the battle. It is the very worst of legal behaviour, which in fact denies justice and makes a mockery of the law and proper legal process. One recent case of notoriety reminding us of this continuing failure was The Bell Group Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation in 2007. Here, two well-fed commercial giants slugged it out in what has become known as the C7 case. Justice Sackville made particular comment on the excessive costs, which I understand to have been unbelievably in the order of $200 million. The costs were totally disproportionate to the issue at stake. Again in 2007, we saw the case of Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd. Once again, two media giants argued themselves to a standstill for no real purpose except commercial pride. Both cases were obviously a complete waste of public resources.
It seems that once the legal profession joins battle there is no backing down. It is interesting to note that in the examination of this bill in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee the task of the legal profession was a matter of some considerable focus. For example, in the proposal to make lawyers responsible for the management of their case, it defeats the demands of the client, as the client has the right to continue his or her litigation at all cost. ‘At all cost’ is the appropriate phrase. Those opposite in their addendum to the committee report support that proposition, as does the Law Council of Australia. I am afraid this government is drawing a line, and it is appropriate that a line be drawn. It is simply not feasible any longer that public funding continue to flow to public functions and institutions simply because of raw demand. Take our health system, for example: we have long realised that there are better and more efficient ways of delivering health care than through large, expensive hospitals; and so it is with the court system. People need health care and they need a form of dispute resolution, but they do not always need hospitals or courts. That is not to say that access is being denied but simply that no system is or can be open-ended. It is indeed a democratic right to have a fair and equitable system of justice available to all, but it has never been unlimited and it never can be unlimited.
The cases I referred to can only be considered abuse of the democratic system of public justice. That is not to say that justice is being denied unnecessarily—quite the contrary. In fact, it could be said that these days it is more available than it has ever been, particularly through the tribunal system and through the growing use of dispute mediation. Access to some form of justice is now more available than it ever was in the past. New courts have also been provided, and the courts are well aware that demand has to be limited somehow. Thus, reforms have been made in the last decade or so, but clearly much more needs to be done.
Despite the complaints, justice is more accessible these days. But, equally, we must ensure that demand is not open-ended as this allows petty litigious behaviour to keep driving the supply side without limit. Lawyers have a responsibility here. This bill now provides that there will be penalties for them where they fail to control or properly advise litigious clients. Proposed section 43 makes specific provision for lawyers to bear costs personally. One hopes that that might make some of them think twice. The proposed section also gives the Federal Court other discretionary powers with the same end. The court may make awards for costs at any stage in a proceeding, make different awards in relation to different parts of a proceeding and make orders specifying proportions. Just as important, however, the court will be given new powers to deal with minor matters. There is some hope that this will sort out the litigious, for whom court action for too long has been a tool of the trade.
Through this bill, the court is being given new powers, including consideration without oral hearing. With or without the consent of the parties, the court will be able to dismiss frivolous and vexatious cases, those where there appears to be solid precedent rendering a case unnecessary and those where the case is adequately expressed on the written submissions. These measures are very practical indeed—so much so that one can only wonder why it has taken so long to arrive at this point. Perhaps it just goes to show how resistant the legal profession is to change. The overarching principles that drive this reform bill also make it clear that behaviour must change. Obviously, law such as this cannot be prescriptive. Hence we have in this bill a requirement that legal behaviour must be consistent with the overarching purposes of the bill—that is, a set of principles which can be applied with the court’s discretion. For example, the court’s resources must be used efficiently, cases must be determined in a timely manner and costs must be in proportion to the complexity of the matter before the court.
In applying these principles, the court, in exercising its discretions on costs, may take certain behaviours into account—for example, unreasonable refusal to participate in mediation and conciliation; failing to act in good faith in achieving resolution; unreasonably rejecting offers of settlement; and otherwise being vexatious and frivolous. By this means the court may dismiss cases outright, strike out claims, disallow evidence and award costs accordingly. In this context, I must also make mention of the new emphasis placed on mediation and conciliation. It is regrettable that the use of these means of reaching settlement in disputes is not used as actively as it should be. The National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council, whose advice was sought by the Attorney-General, responded with a recommendation that alternate dispute resolution be mandated in law. That is exactly what the Attorney has done in this bill. It is a very salutary innovation. Reference to the council’s work is recommended because it is clear that it is not as simple as it might appear. For example, it is easier to apply in civil circumstances than it is where there is a public defendant. Discretion might be limited by law, not just government policy. Nevertheless, it is important wherever possible that government agencies also adopt the principles of ADR to the maximum extent possible. Indeed the history of Defence Legal in the last five to eight years, in its way of litigating and exhausting opponents through extensive use of the courts, is a reminder to us that it would be quite appropriate for a bill sometime in the future to mandate these principles for large government departments or agencies.
Finally, let me turn briefly to the second brace of changes proposed in the bill. These relate principally to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the management of appeals. Put simply, these changes streamline the way appeals are managed. From judgments of single judges, and the relationship between those appeals and the engagement up to and involving the full court, these changes also alter the means by which some matters might proceed on to the High Court, freed of some of the current wasteful process and delay experienced. These changes also include the streamlining of the way interlocutory matters are considered. These seem to me to be sensible procedural changes which should simplify the way the court works, to the greater benefit of both the court and those who use it on a regular basis.
I commend this bill, and I also commend the consideration given to it by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. During that process it is clear that many interested parties made valuable contributions and in large part supported the provisions before us today. Clearly, when you look at the submissions, there were some exceptions. However, in my view, those criticisms do not change the major impact that the bill should have and seeks to have. Quite clearly the consultative process has been quite thorough, and it is pleasing to see the industry, and many people who made submissions, respond so effectively. In that light, I support the bill.",SENATE,<title>ACCESS TO JUSTICE (CIVIL LITIGATION REFORMS) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Access to Justice (Civil Litigation Reforms) Amendment Bill 2009. Can I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate and can I also, consistent with some of the contributions, thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who delivered their report on this bill in September. Their inquiry was conducted in a short time frame and the government is aware that at the same time the committee was considering a number of other bills and conducting major inquiries into access to justice in Australia’s judicial system and the role of judges.
The committee found that there is widespread support for the reforms contained in the bill. There were two specific recommendations made. The first was to clarify the scope and operation of proposed section 37N(1), which requires parties to act consistently with the new overarching purpose. I am advised that the government has clarified this by circulating the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. The second recommendation was to make sure that security for cost orders can still be appealed. The government has responded to this recommendation by moving a government amendment to the bill. In addition to responding to the committee’s recommendations, the government has made a further amendment to encourage judicial transfers. As some senators have recalled, the government expects numerous benefits from Commonwealth participation in a one-way transfer of a Federal Court judge to state supreme courts. These include enhanced knowledge and experience of judicial officers, retention of experienced officers for longer periods and a more consistent body of national decision making in areas of common jurisdiction. This amendment also sends a clear message that the Rudd government intends to be proactive in working with the states to pursue national court excellence. Both Senators Abetz and Brown referred to the issue of the Federal Court registry in Hobart. I can indicate that the government will support the new amendments moved by Senator Brown in the committee stage and I will make some further comments at that point.
These case management provisions are timely. High Court Chief Justice French has observed that in the Federal Court the intensity of judicial case management has been increasing, and the High Court’s recent decision on case management in the AON case will reinforce the case management reforms being introduced by this bill to effect a cultural change in the way litigation is conducted in the Federal Court, a change that leads to improved access to justice. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for the question, but there will be no chocolates today! The start of the ‘Indonesian solution’, if you want to describe it as that, was probably taken by John Howard in about 2002. In terms of expenditure already, certainly the construction of the new detention centre that the previous government authorised and funded was about $7 million—
—Which you opposed.
—No, that is not right, actually, Senator. That cost about $7 million. The Australian government has, for many years now, helped support proper processing of asylum-seeking claims in Indonesia. We have funded the UNHCR in its work in making the assessments and we have funded the international office of migration in supporting asylum seekers and caring for them during those processes. Those arrangements, as I say, were put in place during the first decade of this century by the Howard government. This government has looked to provide additional support for the UNHCR. We have increased funding to the UNHCR. We have increased funding for the international office of migration in order to provide more care for those seeking asylum in Indonesia and we have also helped fund some staff and training requirements to make the centre that was funded under the Howard government operational, to try and improve the skills of those in charge of the centre and to support their staffing needs.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I did not ask the minister for a history lesson; I asked him a specific question—that is, on the Prime Minister’s Indonesian solution. Is the $50 million just the starting point or is that the cost of the package? It was a very specific question.
—Order! You have 24 seconds remaining, Senator Evans. I draw your attention to the question.
—Thank you, Mr President. The point I am making is that our engagement with Indonesia on these matters is longstanding and that funding of these measures has been going for many years under successive governments. If the senator’s reference is to media reports of a figure of $50 million, we made clear that there were ongoing negotiations with the Indonesian government about measures under a new framework under the Lombok treaty.

I welcome it and I also welcome concern for children in detention. It has not been reflected in your contributions to debates this week, but I do welcome it. It is true that in 2005 John Howard was forced to modify his policies in relation to children in detention. Under pressure from some Liberal backbenchers, who deserve great credit for it, he moved away from the detention of children.
The government have made it absolutely clear that we do not support the detention of children, so we have made measures to try and ensure that they are cared for properly and that we run policies and values in detention that better reflect Australian values.

I will go back in the files and examine what arrangements were made by the Howard government when they authorised the construction.
My understanding is that the detention centre in question currently has 80 or 90 detainees and has capacity for about 600, so it is not overcrowded and there is remaining capacity. But we have encouraged the Indonesians to provide accommodation for families outside the detention centre. Their usual practice is to do so, and we have encouraged them to provide alternative accommodation for families seeking asylum. We do note that, despite not being signatories to the convention, Indonesia’s record on nonrefoulement is excellent. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-10-27,"—Can I first say to Senator Back that of course I would not be discussing what intelligence advice the government received from those agencies. I think that was the policy of the previous government and it is a well-established policy in terms of Australian government procedures. But there is no doubt we receive intelligence reporting on any potential activity of organisations that may be of concern, both internationally and in Australia. As you know, Senator, there has been action taken regarding fundraising efforts inside this country in support of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.
I will take on notice the detail, but my memory—I will correct this if I am wrong—is that the previous government made a change in about 2001 which banned the practice of fundraising and financing the Tamil Tigers in Australia. I will correct that immediately if I am wrong, but I think it was around 2001 that the previous government put that arrangement in place to try to combat concerns that the Tamil Tigers were being financed out of Australia and allegedly by the Tamil community in Australia. Similar activities have been taken by other nations where it was thought the Tamil diaspora might be funding the LTTE and some of their activities. That was certainly a concern of the previous government and arrangements were put in place to try to prevent that funding occurring and, as you know, through AUSTRAC and other measures we have sought to ensure that financing of such organisations does not occur.

I can assure senators that we have mandatory detention of offshore arrivals and we have processing on Christmas Island. These are exactly the same arrangements that were in place under the Howard government. As part of that processing, there are health, identity and security checks undertaken by Australian security agencies. They are rigorous and they are the same checks that have been applied for many years in Australia. They are all conducted on Christmas Island, and no-one is released onto the mainland with a visa without having had those checks successfully completed. (Time expired)

I made it clear that exactly the same security, identity and health checks are conducted on Christmas Island as were conducted under the previous government. We seek the assurance of the relevant security agencies before decisions on visas are made. They use their best officers and their facilities to ensure that we protect the Australian community. Those checks are in place. They are rigorous, they are fulsome and they are the same security checks that were in place under the previous government. I urge the Liberal Party to think about where they are going with this. I know they are desperate and I know their polling is shocking, but they should just think about this.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-10-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Fierravanti-Wells, Back and Cash today relating to border protection and to the Tamil Tigers.
Today we had contrived indignation from the minister in relation to the use of the word ‘illegal’ in response to questions asked by Senators Back and Cash. It is all very well when the Prime Minister uses the word. For example, on PM with Mark Colvin, the Prime Minister says, ‘I make absolutely no apology whatsoever for taking a hard line on illegal immigration to Australia.’ So it is all very well for the Prime Minister to use that terminology but, of course, when we use that terminology, there is indeed a different standard. I have to say that is really quite hypocritical.
I wish to pick up on a couple of points in the time available to me. The minister absolutely failed to answer my question in relation to the Indonesian plan. At estimates on 22 October, the Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues said, ‘We haven’t actually sat down with the Indonesians yet to negotiate what this framework will look like or what forms our support will take.’ But, the day after, we get reports in the paper about the so-called $50-plus million plan where Labor will be outsourcing its border protection policy failures to the Indonesians. Today I asked the minister to clarify that and to tell us what the cost is. He gave us a diatribe and avoided answering the question, which makes me think that $50 million is just, in effect, a starting point—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There are far too many conversations on my left. Could you please conduct your conversations outside of the chamber.
—Of course, $50 million is just the starting point. In the end, this is going to cost the Australian taxpayers a lot of money and, quite frankly, Minister, the Australian public is entitled to know, up-front, what their obligations are going to be and how much it is going to cost them. Yet we are not aware of what the negotiations are between Australia and the Indonesian government. Is there going to be a bounty on every boat that is caught or a bounty on every asylum seeker? The reality is that this government has totally lost control. It has effectively, over the last year, dismantled so many aspects of our immigration policy that, as a consequence—
—Like what? Which bits? They’re just words!
—Senator Marshall, you will have your chance later.
—Senator Marshall, thank you for that interjection. Of course, if you had bothered to follow all the legislative changes that your government has put through in this chamber in relation to immigration matters, you would know. Perhaps you might like to go and read the minister’s evidence.
—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, address the chair.
—But I would like to focus on one aspect in the time available to me, and that is the issue of security checks. It is appropriate that this question is asked, because the minister maintains the assurances that are given in relation to security checks. Labor did promise that it would complete its processing in the same times. It keeps saying that this is what the Howard government did. But reports being produced show that the time that is now being taken in relation to security checks certainly does not fall within the time parameters.
Security checks are very important. Why do people arrive with no documents? Why do people destroy their documents? In my time—over 20 years—of working at the Australian Government Solicitor I did my fair share of immigration law, and you can bet your bottom dollar that when people destroy their documents they do so for a reason. They want to hide their identity. They want to hide their past. And they also do so with the objective of deliberate delay and obstruction of processes, because they think it is going to make it a lot harder to find out who they actually are. It is legitimate for us to ask the question and get assurances about proper security checks.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I am pleased to rise in this debate and take up the points that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has raised. One point she raises is that the government has lost control. What hypocrisy from an opposition whose deputy leader describes that opposition as ‘a rabble’—something I have been describing the opposition as for some time. I am glad the deputy opposition leader now agrees with my view of the opposition as a rabble.
This issue is a complex and important one. The issue of asylum seekers fleeing from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan will be an ongoing problem for this community, this nation and the United Nations. I just want to bring this debate back to exactly what we are talking about. We are talking about refugees. We are not talking about illegal immigrants; we are talking about refugees. Look at article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—and I note that earlier Senator Cash was talking about how she analysed this. Well, Senator Cash is a lawyer; I am not sure if she has looked at article 14 recently. It says:
Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
People who are persecuted are entitled to seek asylum.
The 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, provide a definition of the term ‘refugee’. The definition is that a refugee is someone who:
… owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or … unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country …
This is about people who are in trouble. This is about people who are fleeing wars, who are fleeing persecution in their own country. And what do we have from the opposition? We have the lowest common denominator—the fear factor. When you do not have a policy, when you do not have any ideas, when you have no way of dealing with the issue, start a fear campaign! And that is typical of the opposition: a fear campaign against the weakest, most vulnerable people in the world—refugees. You should be ashamed of where you have taken this debate, because this debate should be about ensuring some fairness, some dignity and some protection for people who are fleeing war zones, are looking for protection and want to ensure that they can be safe from persecution in the country that they are fleeing from.
But it is so easy when you are a rabble to actually adopt the rabble approach, and the approach of the rabble is not to think the issues through; the approach of the rabble, which is the coalition in this place, is to go after the weak and exposed. It is to make sure that you hide your incapacity to develop a policy on the treatment of refugees coming to this country, to make sure that you hide your incapacity to formulate a policy of fairness and equity and of treating refugees with dignity. The Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has spoken about intolerance. Let me tell you that the coalition’s intolerance has been on show for the public to see. Your intolerance is reprehensible. Your intolerance is borne of no capacity to develop policy. Your intolerance is an absolute disgrace to this country. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2009-10-27,"—The answers of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in question time today proved yet again how chronically negligent Labor are when it comes to ensuring the security of this nation. Labor have failed the first responsibility of a Commonwealth government—to ensure the security of the nation and its people. Its continued claims that there is no causal link between the winding back of the strong Howard government policies and the increase in the number of unlawful arrivals on Australia’s shores become more absurd and more far fetched every single day as another boat arrives.
Let us run through the statistics again. There have been 17 unauthorised boat arrivals in the last eight weeks, 44 unauthorised boats since the Rudd government began their dismantling of Australia’s border protection regime and over 2,069 people have now risked their lives to come to Australia. For a Prime Minister who in a speech to the parliament in 2002 acknowledged that a government must be judged on its actions, not through the political rhetoric of government, this evidence shows that he stands condemned. He stands condemned for his government’s actions and the failure of his government when it comes to border security, condemned out of the words of his own mouth. The minister and the government are an abject failure when it comes to discharging border security policy.
If you want to talk about rhetoric, Annabel Crabb sums it up nicely today in her article:
… anyone who in the past 10 days has been knocking the top off a cold one every time the Prime Minister describes his own immigration policy as “unapologetically tough” would by now be too plastered to read this column.
Labor is contemptuous of its fundamental responsibility to maintain border security. Labor has shown contempt for the people of Australia by abrogating to the people smugglers the right to determine who comes to this country lawfully. But further, and more shamefully, Labor is contemptuous of those people who seek to enter this country lawfully through recognised migration channels.
What message is the Labor Prime Minister of Australia giving to those hundreds of thousands of people who are currently housed in United Nations refugee camps around the world and who have made proper applications—they have gone through medical and other screening tests—in an effort to seek lawful entry into Australia and other countries around the world? Mr Rudd’s message to those people who attempt to go down the legal route is this: ‘Thanks for doing the right thing, mate, but sorry—we can’t assist you because we’ve abrogated Australia’s lawful right to decide who enters our country to the people smugglers.’ What sovereign government abandons the refugees who want to enter Australia lawfully—because that is what they have done—and lets the people smugglers decide who can come to this country?
There will always be push factors across the world, but what we do not need is the foot on the accelerator approach taken by the government through a set of pull factors created by them. The reality for Rudd Labor is that, as long as it continues to dismantle the coalition’s strong border protection measures and put out the Rudd welcome mat to the people smugglers, the pull factors will see a surge in people smuggling continue. Mr Rudd must take decisive and direct action to stop this despicable trade. How much more money from Australian taxpayers will Mr Rudd pay to Indonesia to keep his own hands clean? How many more people will put their lives at risk as a result of Labor’s softened border protection policies? Mr Rudd and the minister, Senator Evans, must stand before the Australian people and admit to them that Labor has failed on border protection.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-10-27,"—There is often debate in this chamber. Because there is an opposition and a government, often that debate has differences of opinion. It can be quite aggressive from time to time, but I must say I have never contributed in a debate in this place that has actually sickened me like this debate. What really sickens me is the approach of the opposition in the way they attack some of the most defenceless and vulnerable people, who are not here illegally. They are here because they are seeking asylum. If it is proved that they are not genuine refugees and therefore here as illegal entrants, they are moved away. But the most defenceless people come here seeking refuge—refuge from some of the most hideous and sickening circumstances that exist in the world today. The political opportunism, the absolute low road, of the opposition does this country no credit, it does this Senate no credit, it does our people no credit and it makes me sick.
We had to hear Senator Fierravanti-Wells ask, ‘Why do people arrive without documents?’ and go on and make the suggestion that people who arrive here without documents have destroyed them. Then she asked, ‘What sort of people are they?’ What Senator Fierravanti-Wells should understand is that people arrive here more often than not with only the shirt on their back. The reason they have fled is that they have been displaced, and they have been displaced because their village may have been burnt to the ground or their whole family may have been murdered. Maybe those are their circumstances. Maybe they have just been moved on in packs by either military regimes or dictatorships or any of the other horrendous circumstances that millions and millions of people find themselves in, through no fault of their own. Instead of any semblance of compassion, all we get is the opposition attacking the weak and the vulnerable. I think it is a disgrace. They should take a long, hard look at themselves.
We heard Senator Back in his question today make the absolute suggestion that this process is about terrorism importation. Really, come on. Get a grip. The process of checks that goes on at Christmas Island involves security checking and health checking. It is the same format that is well established in this country. It was going on under the previous government and it has not changed. It has not changed. Senator Fierravanti-Wells knows that because we went through this in Senate estimates for hour after hour and that was the evidence of all the officials and the minister. She knows the facts but conveniently leaves that out and again simply takes the low road—the politics of dog whistling. It is shameful. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Senator Cash of course introduced the issue of queue-jumping. Well, she really took us back. She started quoting John Howard. I love it when they quote John Howard now because they pretend he has gone and then they go and quote his ideas. It was all about queue-jumping—again accommodating the lowest common denominator argument. If you want to actually have a mature debate about these issues then you really should get a grip on some of these issues and understand what the serious push factors are—the fact that there are 42 million displaced people in the world at the moment. And you want to run those lines.

Senator Cash interjecting—

—Well, you tell me where all those queues are, Senator Cash. When a village is burnt to the ground and people are moved on, and they are desperate to go, are you saying that they should go halfway around the world to get in some non-existent queue? Really, it is a silly argument.
It is not done to actually have a serious debate about these issues; it is done by resorting to the lowest common denominator, trying to evoke emotional support for their low-road politics. Through all of this, did we hear Senator Fierravanti-Wells actually suggest what the coalition might do on any of these things? She talked about some of the changes we have made, and I wish I had time to go through those things. But all the changes we made were ultimately supported in this place by the coalition. Every single one of them was supported by the coalition. We make no excuse for treating the most vulnerable people in this world with humanity. We do it in a properly regulated, tough manner—where if you come here seeking asylum, you are treated with dignity; and if you are here illegally, you get deported. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2009-10-27,"—Politics is like a pack of cards: you can always tell when the government are out of aces because they only have one card left to play. It is no longer their tough talk of ‘We’re going to turn back the boats,’ as we heard Mr Rudd say when he was opposition leader; it is now Senator Marshall’s ‘compassion card’. As if somehow letting through any Tom, Dick or Harry who wants to come here in a boat is compassionate. It is not. It is not compassionate to encourage or provide incentives or opportunities for people to hop into leaky, crowded boats and cross dangerous seas in the hope that they will be intercepted by an Australian naval vessel and brought to this country, where they can claim asylum. It is not compassionate to do that.
Let me dispel a couple of other myths that Senator Marshall has put forward. He talked about how these people come from unfortunate circumstances. I would agree, and I am sure they do. I accept that there are many ‘maybes’ that Senator Marshall raised, and many people do come from extreme hardship and extreme poverty, and from areas and circumstances which are very difficult for us to comprehend. But let us not lose sight of the facts. The facts are that millions of people who are displaced, according to Senator Marshall, are doing the right thing—millions of them are doing the right thing and going to United Nations refugee camps. They are waiting their turn. They are applying appropriately and seeking a better life for themselves and their families.
The people Senator Marshall is talking about are fleeing impoverished circumstances and dangerous circumstances. But how, then, are these people are paying thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of dollars to people smugglers to enter Australian waters illegally? That is why these vessels are called suspected illegal entry vessels because they are entering our waters illegally. These are people who are, in many cases, trashing their identification and making up a past—making up a number of circumstances so they can get into Australia, where of course life is better. Life is better in Australia, even if you are on the dole, than it is in many other places. Does that mean we should allow people to jump the queue and stop people from coming to this country via the appropriate humanitarian channels? I would say no. And to encourage anyone to enter this country illegally and take such extreme risks for themselves and their family, and to put other people’s lives at risk, is, quite frankly, irresponsible.
Once you get past the emotive arguments which tug at the heartstrings, arguments which are completed devoid of any real substance, which Senator Marshall offered, we have to come back to the facts and let logic determine how we should approach this. Here are the facts: the Rudd government changed the laws about illegal boats coming into this country and how we treat asylum seekers or illegal entrants. And what has happened? We have seen an explosion—you cannot describe it in any other way—in illegal entry vessels coming into this country. In 2002 and 2003 we had none. We had three boats in 2003-04, zero in 2004-05, eight in 2005-06, four the following year and three in 2007-08. Then the Rudd government comes in and we have 22 boats, with 1,039 people, entering our country illegally via illegal entry vessels. In 2009-10 we have had 20 boats so far, with another 964 people. The facts speak for themselves.
The Rudd government wound back effective policy that deterred people from taking unnecessary, unwarranted and very, very dangerous chances with their own lives and with other lives. And now what happens? We have the Bart Simpson of Australian politics, Mr Rudd, saying: ‘I didn’t do it. It wasn’t me.’ Let me tell you: there is a direct link. Labor changed the laws, and the boats, the hordes, started coming. The people smugglers went back into business because they knew that Australia had become a soft target under this government.
I do not know anyone who does not support Australia playing a compassionate and humanitarian role in dealing with displaced people, but it is not compassionate, it is not humanitarian, to support the business of people smugglers, who prey on the vulnerable and weak—and rich. They ignore the truly vulnerable, the impoverished, those who have no opportunities and no chance.

That there be laid on the table by the Minister for Climate Change and Water, no later than noon on 29 October 2009, a copy of a letter to the Victorian Minister for Water (Mr Holding) relating to funding approval for stage 2 of the Northern Victorian Irrigation Renewal Project, referred to by Senator Wong in an answer to a question from Senator Wortley during the supplementary budget estimates hearings of the Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on 20 October 2009 (ECA Hansard, p.128).",SENATE,<title>NORTHERN VICTORIA IRRIGATION RENEWAL PROJECT</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,15,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-27,"—by leave—Senator Wong has confirmed that she does not intend to table her correspondence to the Victorian Minister for Water, Mr Tim Holding. However, Senator Wong confirmed on 30 June 2009 that the Victorian government submitted a business case for the Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project stage 2 early works. On 7 October 2009 Senator Wong wrote to Minister Holding advising of her decision to approve only limited funding to those project components that did not entail capital works and associated water savings. The letter explained that this decision was based on advice from the Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Specifically, the department advised that the capacity to transfer water savings to the Commonwealth from Victoria’s early works proposal must be assured before investment in infrastructure can be agreed.
Earlier this year an order in council was prepared under the Victorian Water Act 1989 which would have enabled the transfer of the water savings to the Commonwealth from both the early works and the full NVIRP stage 2 project. However, as Senator Birmingham will be aware, on 12 August 2009, the Liberal, National and Greens parties acted to disallow this order in the Victorian upper house. While the Victorian Minister for Water submitted a second amendment on 1 September to enable the transfer of these water savings to the Commonwealth, this amendment is open for disallowance until 16 December 2009. Senator Wong indicated in her letter that, until the disallowance period for the Victorian government’s latest motion has passed, she is unable to approve funding for infrastructure works under the Victorian NVIRP stage 2 early works proposal.",SENATE,<title>NORTHERN VICTORIA IRRIGATION RENEWAL PROJECT</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,15,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2009-10-27,"—Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.
—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—I find it outrageous that, before a decision is even taken by this chamber, Minister Wong sends in the duty minister to state that she will not be providing the documents that this chamber may yet decide to request. Minister Wong chose in estimates last week to make a very clear political point in response to a Dorothy Dixer question. She used this letter to make a political point targeting the Liberal and National parties and the Greens and their actions in the Victorian parliament, actions which were very directly about water allocated for Victoria’s north-south pipeline. Their actions ensured that water infrastructure projects proposed by the Commonwealth—versus projects undertaken by the Victorian government—should be treated separately.
Minister Wong seemed to be mounting the argument that somehow they should be coupling them. That was an unacceptable argument at the time. Yet in Senate estimates the minister refused to provide the letter which she was quoting from. Now we have the proposition that somehow it might be refused to be tabled in response to a motion of this chamber. I find this incredibly disappointing. I hope the government will reconsider its decision with regard to this. It needs to reconsider because, if Minister Wong has written to the Victorian Minister for Water, Tim Holding, in the manner she has indicated—that is, that basically she agrees with him that the Victorian upper house should be held to ransom on this matter—it is an outrageous proposition. She knows full well that the Victorian upper house has no power to amend regulations—they can either accept or defeat. What she should be urging the Victorian water minister to do is decouple the two projects, stage 1 and stage 2 of the NVIRP, and ensure that the infrastructure she has promised can go ahead.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-10-27,"—I rise today to note the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. I note that at last we have a government committee saying what the Greens have been saying, what the scientists have been saying and what the community has been saying for decades. But the conclusion cannot be drawn that action on the very real threat of climate change to Australia’s coastal communities is going to be addressed by the government’s targets.
This is the most important thing: if we proceed with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and a national reduction of emissions target of 5 to 25 per cent, we will lock in a high probability that we will see the worst case scenario in this report actually come to pass. That is the critical thing. There is a massive disconnect between what the science is saying and what the government is saying. It is irresponsible in the extreme for anyone to report that the CPRS or the national target will in any way mitigate climate change or avoid the worst case scenarios.
We are talking about the fact that we have in Australia 711,000 addresses within three kilometres of the coast. This is a very real risk to Australia’s coastal areas. We know that with sea level rise we will get thermal expansion of the oceans as a result of increased temperature and increased and rapid melt of the glaciers. At some point we will also run the risk of losing the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. I would remind the Senate that the Greenland ice sheet is equivalent to seven metres of sea level rise and the West Antarctic ice sheet is the equivalent of six metres rise—13 metres in those two ice sheets. No-one is suggesting that they are going to be influencing sea level rise tomorrow by 13 metres; what we are saying is what the scientists are pointing out. I quote Dr John Church:
There is an important issue of thresholds. We are likely to cross a threshold leading to an ongoing disintegration of the Greenland icesheet—and remember that the Greenland icesheet contains the equivalent of seven metres of sea level rise. We could cross that threshold late this century.
This is the key point:
At a 550 ppm CO2 equivalent level there is approximately a 50 per cent risk of crossing that threshold. That is not to say that the Greenland icesheet will disappear as soon as we cross that threshold, but unless we substantially reduce levels below that value there will be an ongoing disintegration of the icesheet …

37

…       …            …
… and if we cross that threshold there will be major impacts over many centuries or perhaps even millennia.
At 550 parts per million we are running a 50 per cent risk of crossing the threshold and seeing the one-metre sea level rise that we are talking about, with the most conservative science in the IPCC’s fourth assessment report, and we are running a 50 per cent risk of crossing that threshold. At 550 parts per million, that is precisely what the Rudd government is talking about. When it goes to Copenhagen with its targets, it is talking about 550 parts per million or more, and the scientists tell us that we should be aiming for 350 parts per million.
Do not let anyone be under any illusion when we have a minister stand up in here, note the report from the House of Representatives and say, ‘That’s why five to 25 is what we need to do.’ No, it is not what we need to do. As we already know, the great fear for Copenhagen is that we will end up with Copenhagen agreeing to 550 parts per million or more, and that is going to be locking in that kind of sea level rise. What we will then see is a tremendous risk to Australia’s coastline. Let me talk about some of the impacts of global warming on the coastline. Starting with the Great Barrier Reef, scientists are now very afraid of reaching a tipping point on ocean acidification. The CRC in Hobart talks about 450 parts per million as being the tipping point for ocean acidification. If you lose those structures in the Great Barrier Reef that hold the corals together, the corals are going to disintegrate and weaken, and when they are hit by a cyclone you will get a lot of destruction of the reef.
Let us look around the Australian coastline. We have Brisbane, which is incredibly low and vulnerable. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts says that in Tasmania 20 per cent of the coastline is already vulnerable. That is the kind of response we see. Looking around the whole country, it is not just coastlines but also estuaries. We are going to see flooding in those estuarine areas all around Australia. We have this suggestion that the federal government is in some way taking leadership on issues related to climate change and sea level rise, but I want to come back to Professor Steffen, who said:
Mitigation, as vigorously and rapidly as we can, is the best insurance against the worst of the projected coastal impacts. Obviously this is a global task, but as a country with a very high percentage of population and infrastructure in the coastal zone, it should be a high priority for Australia that the international community achieves an effective mitigation strategy at Copenhagen.
The government is running up the white flag on Australia’s coastline and the 711,000 residences on that coastline. For every metre of sea level rise, you can talk about up to 100 metres of incursion in vulnerable coastal areas. Australians must take notice of the House of Representatives committee report but they must then come back and say to the Prime Minister and to Minister Wong, ‘You cannot look us in the eye and tell us that your targets are in any way going to mitigate this outcome.’",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-10-27,"—Climate change and its devastating impacts now and into the future—including rising sea levels—are indeed matters of public importance. The Australian people recognise that. The Rudd Labor government recognise that.
In November 2007 Labor was asked by voters across the nation to, among other things, take on the mounting task of addressing climate change. Frustrated by years of inaction by the climate change sceptics—many of whom still sit opposite us—pulling the strings of Australia’s environmental policy, the Australian people spoke out at the ballot box. Since this government took office, tackling the very real and increasing threat of climate change has been a very high priority. The first act of the Prime Minister was to sign the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. Unlike those opposite, we acknowledge that climate change poses threats to our environment, our economy and our society. Unlike those opposite, we believe that Australia must take responsibility for our contribution to climate change and that we must act to reduce it.
This government has committed to dramatically cutting Australia’s greenhouse emissions and it is working with households, schools, communities, businesses and primary industries to reduce carbon pollution and adjust to the inevitable impact of climate change. The government has taken a seat at the world table, for the first time, in a collaborative effort to find global solutions to this global problem. The government has been working to support green jobs and investment now and into the future. The government introduced into this parliament legislation that could have brought into law a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—legislation that would have put the brakes on Australia’s rising greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, in August, the Greens sided with the Liberals and the Nationals to vote down the CPRS.
The matter of public importance today relates to a report handed down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts and this government’s climate change policies and targets. The report of the committee, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now, includes 47 recommendations. From what I know of the report to date, it makes for sobering reading. Even a snippet from its introduction is unequivocal. I quote:
Firstly, many thousands of kilometres of the Australian coastline have been identified as at risk from the threat of rising sea levels and extreme weather events due to the impacts of climate change. The concentration of Australia’s population and infrastructure along the coast makes our nation particularly vulnerable to the coastal erosion and inundation that will accompany increases in sea level.
The government do not shy away from this report or from its findings, as daunting as they may seem—quite the contrary. As the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, said this morning on radio 2UE, we called for it. In fact, instigating this inquiry was one of our first steps in advancing a national approach to coastal policy. The government believe such a national coastal adaptation response is needed, and the Commonwealth has been working with the states and territories through COAG towards this end. We are already investing in a range of initiatives as part of our efforts to adapt to the climate change consequences we cannot avoid, in coastal areas and elsewhere. Such investments include the $12.9 billion Water for the Future plan and the $200 million Reef Rescue package. Of course, this committee report will be further examined and its recommendations considered in the light of what the government can act on and how the report will inform future policy. The Commonwealth will work with state and territory governments, coastal councils, natural resource management groups and other experts in developing a response to the report. As Minister Wong said today:
This is a report which confirms why we have to act on climate change. It confirms the sorts of impacts that we risk, and demonstrates yet again why we have to act as a nation to reduce our contribution to climate change.
… the committee has looked at a range of scientific opinion and has come to a view about the sort of risk we face from sea level rise. … I think it is quite clear from the consensus science that this is one of the consequences of climate change and we simply can’t ignore it.
And we would be, I think, irresponsible as politicians, as community leaders, to just pretend that these risks don’t exist.
Indeed, this report is the latest in a long and growing list of examples of the negative results of climate change. As committee chair, Labor’s Jennie George MP, writes in her foreword, after an 18 month inquiry with 28 public hearings and 100 submissions:
It’s one thing to read about the science but another to see first hand, as we did, the obvious and early negative consequences of climate change on our coastal zone.
Ms George also says of the inquiry:
One clear message emerged—and that is the need for national leadership in managing our precious coastal zone in the context of climate change. I am optimistic that the Australian government will meet that challenge. Indeed, many of the initiatives already instituted by the Department of Climate Change head in that direction.
As we have been reminded since the release of this report, approximately 80 per cent of Australians live near the coast and more than 700,000 homes and businesses are within three kilometres of the coast where elevation is below five metres above sea level. Unlike those opposite, this government recognises the threat of rising sea levels. We recognise that Australia’s coastline is vulnerable to climate change due to our population concentration and the natural and built assets in those areas. We acknowledge that some of these areas have faced rapid population growth; they have suffered catchment degradation and have been subject to inappropriate development, all of which have made them susceptible. That is why, among other things, we are undertaking a $25 million assessment of coastal vulnerability. This national coastal vulnerability assessment will look at the threats to our coastline, its cities, towns and infrastructure, and its biodiversity. It will consider the environmental, economic and social impacts of anticipated sea level rise, extreme storms and other climate change events. In doing so, this assessment—due for release soon—will give us a better understanding of the risks and identify the priority areas for research and investment.
After the release of this assessment, the government has committed to holding a national forum through which to develop a national coastal adaptation agenda. True to form, the opposition would rather do nothing than act on the threat of rising sea levels. On being asked by a journalist today about the need to pass an emissions trading scheme sooner rather than later due to the risk posed to coastal homes and businesses by rising sea levels, Mr Tony Abbott MP said:
When it comes to rising sea levels I’m alert but I can’t say that I’m particularly alarmed. The fact is that sea levels have risen along the NSW coast by more than 20 centimetres over the last century. Has anyone noticed it? No they haven’t. Obviously an 80 centimetre rise in sea levels would be more serious but I’m confident that we have the resources to cope.
Let us be thankful that this government is far more proactive than that. We are committed to working with local communities to address specific coastal challenges. In addition to the national coastal vulnerability assessment, our Caring for Our Coasts policy includes collaboration with coastal groups, academics, and state, territory and local governments to develop a blueprint for coastal towns and cities, enabling them to meet present-day and predicted climate change challenges. We are updating and upgrading the Disaster Mitigation Australia Package to take climate change weather events into account. We are investigating $100 million over five years in the Community Coastcare program— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-10-27,"—I do not think that anyone in this parliament—in fact, any Australians generally—would deny that our climate is changing. Of course, it has been changing for 95 million years and perhaps even longer. We read about the times when this globe was covered by ice. The ice melted some time back in Australia’s history and then the centre of Australia was a rich tropical rainforest. It is now a desert. We read about when there was an inland sea in Australia, and today it is all land. So quite clearly the climate is changing, but we do not accept the alarmist propaganda being put out by the Labor Party and, of course, by the Greens. We do know that in the last century there was a 20-centimetre rise in global sea levels, and that is significant. We also know that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted that over the coming century there could be an impact of between 18 and 76 centimetres if no action whatsoever is taken. I point out there that the lower level predicted by the IPCC for the next century is 18 centimetres if nothing is done, whereas in the last century it was 20 centimetres. I am not saying that 18 centimetres is right, but it is within the range that the IPCC has given us, and that is if nothing is done. We also know that over the last 20,000 years there has been a 130-metre change in sea levels. Sea levels do change across the board. There was a 20-centimetre rise last century and there is a predicted rise of between 18 and 76 centimetres in the next century if nothing is done.
I am confident that something will be done at some time in the future. Indeed, it was the Howard government that first addressed this issue by setting up the world’s very first Greenhouse Office. This was the very first government office anywhere in the world that started looking at climate change issues. It was the Howard government that went to Kyoto and negotiated Australia’s targets at that time, targets that have been met by this country when they have been met by very few other countries.
We are concerned about alarmist hypocrisy from the Labor Party. You have only to look at what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, said when speaking to Tony Jones on Lateline. He agreed that the upper level of rises in the global sea level could be as much as six metres—six metres!—by the end of this century. According to Mr Garrett, in 90 years time sea levels could rise by six metres. You do not need to be a great mathematician to work out that that is 66 millimetres every year for the next 90 years. This is what the Labor Party is going around trying to scare the Australian public into believing—that every single year for the next 90 years there will be a 66-millimetre increase in the sea levels around our coastline. It is absolutely ridiculous poppycock, and Mr Garrett should know it. It is typical of the fearmongering in which the Labor Party and the Greens have indulged in this debate.
It is also very interesting that the Labor Party has sent out a team of backbenchers to continue that scare campaign, that spin campaign, for which Mr Rudd and his government have become so well known. In a doorstop interview this morning, Mr Dreyfus, the member for Isaacs, was saying that Mr Rudd is going to reduce sea level rises. One might have thought that it was Moses reincarnated!
—Then he will walk on it!
—Perhaps he might walk on the water once he reduces the levels. Mr Dreyfus was asked by a journalist how much a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by Australia would mean to the increase in sea levels. He was then asked, ‘Will it be a couple of millimetres?’ Mr Dreyfus answered, ‘It will be more than that.’ So five per cent by Australia alone will mean that we will reduce sea levels by a couple of millimetres! Nobody in their right mind could possibly believe that sort of ridiculous rubbish, but it is part of the scaremongering campaign being undertaken by Mr Rudd.
The coalition’s position is quite clear. While none of us is understanding enough to be able to comment on whether the science of man-made emissions-causing climate change is true or not, I am one of those who goes along with the proposition because I am not a scientist—and the scientists seem to be evenly divided—but if everybody else in the world does it then Australia should do it too. However, we should not be destroying our economy in Australia and we should not be destroying the jobs of our fellow Australians by rushing into this ill-thought-out, poorly designed emissions trading scheme in front of the rest of the world.
Anyone with a modicum of sense would know that reducing emissions in Australia by five or even 25 per cent will not make any difference to the changing climate of the world. It will make absolutely no difference to the changing sea levels of the world. What we have to get is agreement from the big emitters: America, China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Argentina, South Africa, Colombia—all of those places that compete with the commodities in which Australia trades. When the world does move, so should Australia. That has always been the coalition’s view. That is why we started this whole debate, with the report from the former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Shergold. We have been looking at this for a long time, but Australia cannot act by itself. Unless other countries are prepared to do their bit, nothing Australia does will make one iota of difference to the changing climate of the world.
That is why this mad rush before Copenhagen in less than two months time is so difficult to understand, unless it is part of the socialist conspiracy to destroy the Australian economy and have all of Australia entirely dependent upon government handouts. I fear that that is where Mr Rudd is going. He is creating a socialist society that Gough Whitlam could only have dreamed about. But Mr Rudd is doing it by making absolutely everybody dependent on government handouts. Mr Rudd is going to tax every Australian to the hilt. Every Australian’s electricity bill and every business that operates in Australia will be taxed to the hilt by this Labor government. It will come as no surprise because that is what Labor is renowned at doing: increasing taxes. What Mr Rudd will then do, having massively increased the tax take from all Australians, is decide who should be favoured and who gets the money that he has collected. He will socially engineer a country like Australia that has been built on free enterprise, choice and freedom. That is the design of Mr Rudd’s plan. There can be no other reason for taking this action well in advance of the rest of the world. It will make not one iota of difference to the changing climate of the world. That is why Mr Rudd and his scheme should be rejected. That is why most Australians want it delayed until we see what the rest of the world is doing in Copenhagen. I certainly hope Mr Rudd takes note.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-27,"—This is a very serious matter which deserves very serious action from the government and the coalition. But that is not what we are seeing. I have just been looking at the front page of today’s Sydney Morning Herald which says that the report from the House Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, following its investigation, enjoyed cross-party support. Under the caption ‘What lies ahead’ for New South Wales, the newspaper reports that 200,000 buildings are vulnerable to sea level rise this century because of climate change, 484,000 buildings are vulnerable nationally, up to $50 billion worth of property is at risk and 20 per cent of the Tasmanian coastline is under threat. In a specific case, looking at Narrabeen and Sydney’s northern beaches, with just a 20-centimetre rise—the level of rise being described by the previous speaker in the Senate—and a one-in-50 year storm surge, the coastline at Narrabeen would be pushed back 110 metres, causing $230 million in damage. We are talking here about people being removed from their living places and having to find elsewhere to live. We are also talking now about the increasing impossibility for people who are in climate change threatened properties on the Australian coastline to be able to get insurance. We know for certain that the insurance industry is going to get tougher, not easier, in deciding where it will not insure householders or business owners in Australia against storm surges of that variety that are, one must think on the average of probabilities, going to happen in the coming decades at Narrabeen.
The problem is that the head is still stuck firmly in the sand. We hear people like the previous speaker saying that climates have changed on the planet over many millions of years and, quite falsely, that scientists are equally balanced on whether or not they think there is going to be climate change et cetera. The fact is that we are in an age of climate change. We are now facing sea level rises, and they are accelerating.
—Six metres!
—Six metres, says the previous speaker by interjection, and I note that he laughs at that. But he is the same senator from the coalition who laughed at me 13 years ago in this place when I predicted sea level rises of the sort that we are now having to talk about.
The problem here is the government’s target level for greenhouse gas emission reductions—from the country, Australia, which is the biggest per capita polluter on the planet—of five per cent over 2000 levels by 2020, four per cent if you take the Kyoto baseline of 1990. Measure that against, for example, Scotland’s legislated aim of a 42 per cent reduction, or Costa Rica, which has led the world for many years in environmental and social thinking, which wants a 100 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030. The previous speaker, representing a strongly held feeling in this parliament, said that we must not act before the rest of the world. I disagree. We are the wealthiest country on earth per capita in resources and we have the biggest coastline per capita of all the wealthy countries on earth. We have the most to lose. These reports show that there are 700,000 vulnerable properties on the eastern seaboard alone. And these properties are being affected. We had a storm from the south in Tasmania within the last month of which old-timers said they had not seen the like in 60 years. It sank boats and washed others up on the shore. But the erosion along the coastline which came from that storm surge was massive. Near my own house a boulder of five to 10 tonnes, with a large tree, fell from the cliff line and washed into the beach from this storm surge. The tree and the boulder had been there for many decades. You can say that this is a once in so often storm, but that needs to be added on top of what Senator Macdonald agreed was an 18-centimetre sea level rise in recent years.
The portents are very clear for all of us. People like the Greens mayor Jan Barham and her council at Byron Bay have been trying to warn about this and even to plan for it, and what they have received in return is sniping and uninformed invective from, for example, the editorialist of the Australian that we will live to see seas go down, a marker of the head-in-the-sand inability to deal with the problem of climate change which marks this era. The government’s proposal for a five per cent, increasing to 25 per cent if there is global agreement, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is completely inconsistent with the threat and the damage which climate change is already bringing to the Australian coastline.
We have just heard a debate with vilification against people who are moving countries because they are threatened. Look at Bangladesh, where 80 per cent of disputes in the courts are now over erosion of land, a country with a massively increasing population, very much of it less than 10 metres above sea level and very vulnerable to increasing storms and floods as the glaciers in the Himalayas melt and their water comes down the Ganges and other rivers. According to the United Nations, we face the prospect of 150 million displaced people—Bangladesh will supply many of them—by midcentury, and many of those people are going to come to Australia. That migration will make the current pressure on our seashores from so-called boat people look like nothing at all, and yet it is inherently being built into the future of this planet by the inaction of the Rudd Labor government and by the inaction of the Turnbull opposition. On top of this, in this country, now the world’s biggest coal exporter by a very big margin, Queensland Premier Bligh, with Senator Wong and Prime Minister Rudd, wants to put billions of dollars into infrastructure to accelerate the export of coal to be burnt elsewhere in the world, which will accelerate the problem of global warming in an age when people at Mildura, where there were plans for a large solar plant to produce renewable electricity without threatening the globe, have been unable to get the finance. It is a government which is failing to act on the simple, reasonable face of the facts.
There is now a House of Representatives report about the astonishing impact of climate change on Australia. With it comes the impact on the spread of diseases. With it comes the impact on the ability to produce food, which is diminished greatly; we have seen that in the Murray-Darling Basin. With it comes the loss of our ski fields and the glaciers which feed water to 1.5 billion people in South-East Asia to our north. For months of the year, very little water will run down their rivers. Those glaciers have fed those rivers throughout all of recorded human history. Yet the blinkers are on because of the power of the polluting industries over the two parties in this parliament. The power of the polluting industries goes against the nous of the majority of Australians, who want greater action on climate change and want to see some security, through government action, brought back to people living on the coastlines, and to Australians generally, for the future of this nation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I am very pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on this MPI today. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts into managing our coastal zone in a changing climate. In case people have the wrong idea, I note that this was indeed a bipartisan report, and the members of the opposition who participated in this inquiry are quite clearly signed up to the fact that climate change exists and is having a deleterious effect on our coastline. You may not have ascertained that from the comments by Senator Macdonald. The opposition members in this inquiry were Dr Mal Washer, the Hon. John Cobb, Ms Nola Marino, the Hon. Bruce Scott and Mr Jason Wood. I appreciate their contribution to this important report.
Comments are often made in the debate about climate change along the lines of ‘the climate of the world has always been changing’. Of course it has always been changing. We know there have been ice ages in the past. We know there were inland seas in Australia in the past. The difference now is that there are 22 million people living in Australia, and I do not think there were 22 million people living in Australia during the last ice age. The fact that there are some 22 million people living in Australia, 80 per cent of them close to the coast, means that the impact of climate change is going to be a lot different to what it was during the last ice age.
I am pleased to say not only that the Rudd Labor government acknowledge that climate change exists and is a problem for the population of Australia but that we have tackled the problem of climate change head-on. We have accepted the science of climate change. We have accepted the consensus that global warming does exist, that human activity is causing global warming and that global warming is deleterious. Therefore, we accept that human activity should be modified to ameliorate the impact of global warming. We have accepted the view that we need to act now or our climate will change and the population of Australia, 22 million of us, will suffer serious consequences. The government recognises the destruction that climate change will have on our country should we fail to act, and we have devised a plan to begin to reduce the severity of climate change and to maintain an environment that will support the kind of human activity that we need and want for the generations to come.
It is well known from the science that, as a nation, we are highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, and the House of Representatives report referred to in this motion before the chamber goes substantially to that issue. The effects that climate change will have on our environment, our economy and our lifestyle will be serious. The health of our population, the security of our water and energy supplies and the impacts on our coastal communities will all be significant. The nation, and indeed the whole world, is treading somewhat uncharted waters here. No-one can be exactly sure of the extent of the impact that climate change will have on our future, but we need to be prepared to accept the fact that there will be change and we need to do something about it, and that is what the Rudd government is doing.
In our relatively short time in government, the government have already proven to be a driving force for international action on climate change. Of course, the first action of the government was ratifying the Kyoto protocol, and that was seen by the world as a positive step in our commitment to stabilising the concentration in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Additionally, the government have established a mandatory renewable energy target, implemented the Clean Energy Initiative, introduced energy efficiency measures and implemented a national water strategy. The government are taking lots of action now through a comprehensive plan of action to fight the war on climate change.
The matter before the chamber states that there is a disparity between the findings of the report of the House of Reps Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts and the government’s climate change policies. The report lists many recommendations but it is my view, having quickly looked at them today, that many of those recommendations are in fact already being addressed by the Department of Climate Change, by the Minister for Climate Change and Water and indeed by the government overall. We are heading in the right direction.
But government action to combat climate change has not come easily. As we have seen again in this debate just now, in government we continually come up against that bunch of climate change deniers—the sceptics in opposition who, with their usual ‘head in the sand’ attitude, hope that Australia will be fine and prefer to do nothing. Fortunately for Australia, the sceptics have not had it all their own way in the opposition party room, as we understand it. I know all of us in the chamber are awaiting with interest the progress of the CPRS legislation through this chamber in the next sitting.
The Rudd government, I am pleased to say, has invested heavily in all aspects of dealing with climate change, coastal zones included, and we are actively fighting the battle against climate change. We are acting to reduce carbon pollution and secure Australia’s future prosperity. We have invested in clean energy programs, we are supporting businesses to take action against climate change and we are supporting households to take action. We have acted to monitor the nation’s carbon emissions levels with good, well funded science. As part of that, the government has dedicated a total of more than $15 billion to implementing a comprehensive response to climate change. The government’s climate change strategy provides the long-term framework and confidence for our nation to prosper in the shadow of climate change.
A report released earlier this year by Professor Will Steffen from the ANU Climate Change Institute found that our climate system appears to be changing faster than originally thought likely. That report, Climate change 2009: faster change and more serious risks, also found that the need for an effective reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is urgent to avoid the risk of crossing dangerous thresholds in the climate system. The report focused on rapidly changing areas of science of importance to Australia, such as the contribution of melting ice to sea level rise, acidification of the oceans and changing water availability. That report is like so many other scientific reports that are coming out now—and I think the CSIRO was here during the week. Indeed, a number of scientists have been here in Parliament House during the week, and overwhelmingly the science that they are presenting to senators and members demonstrates and reaffirms the fact that climate change is a reality and that human activity is contributing to it.
All of those reports also give us in the government the impetus to continue to act as quickly as possible to address this issue. The government has funded scientific endeavour in the Australian Climate Change Science Program to the tune of $31.2 million over four years. That will enable us to develop an even better understanding of the impacts of climate change and to develop stronger action plans to counter the effects. We have also invested $387.7 million over five years to fund infrastructure critical for climate change science.
I think it is slightly galling that this matter for discussion, which is of course critical of the government, was put up by the Greens. It is the kind of matter they usually put up when it is their turn to have an MPI, but we cannot let this debate pass without acknowledging that the Greens voted with the opposition when the CPRS legislation was before the chamber previously. It is hypocritical of them to come here and criticise the government when in fact they joined with the opposition to vote down that legislation. They voted with the opposition to prevent the first extremely important steps that the nation should take—a major initiative and an important initiative that the government are attempting to get underway so that we can begin to seriously address the effects of climate change in this nation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2009-10-27,"—I rise to speak on this matter for a few minutes, and I would firstly like to take note of the hysteria that is rising from the crossbenches and the comments that have been made by those on the opposite side of this chamber in relation to the evidence presented in this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts. I would suggest that the hysteria that we have witnessed today is far more erosive for all Australians than the potential effect of rising sea levels on our coastal areas.
What we are hearing is a most excitable and emotional response to a report on rising sea levels given that sea levels, as we have already heard, have risen 20 centimetres over the last century. To put this into context, if I may, there has been a 130-metre change in sea level over the last 20,000 years. What we have heard is nothing but scaremongering, and it is not what we should expect from this chamber. A responsible government would take a reasoned and cautious approach to the findings of this report and consider the recommendations provided with a cool head. There is no place for a hysterical overreaction to the latest report. But, as we know, it is not a responsible government that has been determining the future of Australia and the generations to come. It is not a responsible government that has plundered our financial reserves and committed future generations to paying off a $315 billion debt.
What we have been saddled with instead is a Big Brother government determined to cast its authoritative hand over the lives of all rather than allowing individuals to have a greater say over their own lives. It is this Big Brother government that demands compliance from principals and parents to build a ‘Julia Gillard memorial hall’ rather than allowing them to determine where the stimulus money could be best spent—whether on shadecloth, whether on classrooms or whether on, dare I say, more books for the kids to learn from. It is this Big Brother government that believes that parents are incapable of supervising their children and wishes to introduce a mandatory internet filtering system. Filters are available now to parents for them to determine how they wish to protect their children from unwarranted and inappropriate sites. This is a government that believes it knows best and wishes to enforce this upon all parents.
Such is the arrogance of this government that they are even now seeking to censor the very people elected to this place so that they may not have the opportunity to question or criticise the actions of the government on behalf of those very constituents who elected them. So it is no surprise that those on the crossbenches and those on the other side of this chamber have sought to tie-in rising sea levels to the CPRS legislation. But I ask: how will a reduction in CO2 emissions by five per cent make any difference to a natural occurrence that has taken place for centuries? Minister Wong said in question time today that this was further proof of why we have to act now. Well, I ask Minister Wong: why do we have to act before Copenhagen? This report should not be used to justify the Rudd government’s political agenda to pass the CPRS before Copenhagen. It is deeply flawed and in its current form will cost jobs. It is going to cost industries. It will impact on our international competitiveness and it will affect us all for many generations to come. In its current form, it will hurt each and every household in terms of the significant rise in energy costs. It is for that very reason that the coalition have sought to amend the CPRS to protect those who are going to be most impacted by it and ensure that the jobs and safeguarding of all Australians is paramount.
Can I suggest that a government’s No. 1 priority is to protect and safeguard all Australians. Bringing the CPRS legislation into this chamber and ramming it through without consideration of amendments before Copenhagen does not do that, and that is why we do not resile from the fact that we want to address climate change. There has been no suggestion that we do not support what the Senate are trying to do here. What we wish to do is make sure that the final CPRS is not as flawed as it is in its current form. This report must be considered with reason and with a cool head. It is an interesting report. It is interesting that Mark Dreyfus commented on it this morning. We have heard already that he made the comment that it will reduce sea levels and suggested that the extent of that will be more than a couple of millimetres. I find it very interesting that Mark Dreyfus has such a concern as the member for Isaacs—so concerned that he does not even live in his own electorate; he lives in Toorak, and his neighbours are not affected by this.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-10-27,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 30th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which took place in Thailand from 2 to 8 August 2009, and move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I am pleased to speak to the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 30th AIPA General Assembly. I was the leader and sole member of the Australian delegation to this year’s general assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which was held in Pattaya City, Thailand. The delegation provided an important opportunity to reaffirm the very valuable relationships and cooperation which Australia has with ASEAN. It is a unique experience to go to AIPA with parliamentarians from the ASEAN region and countries from other parts of the world to hold dialogues, to establish friendships and to learn more about the culture of individual nations. It was a pleasure to participate in the general assembly, representing Australia as an observer country, and to discuss the interests and concerns shared with all the countries in our regions.
The 30th AIPA General Assembly follows the signing of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement in Thailand earlier this year, an agreement which opens up a new basis for Australia’s relationship with ASEAN countries at a time when all nations in the region are grappling with the impact of the global financial crisis.
The full ratification of the ASEAN charter and its coming into force in December 2008 was an important step in strengthening ASEAN as an organisation, and the continued commitment amongst ASEAN nations to the establishment of an ASEAN economic community by 2015 is encouraging. The reduction of trade barriers resulting from the formation of an economic community would strengthen ASEAN’s capacity to function as a single market and production base. The dialogue session with Australia was well attended by parliamentarians from the ASEAN nations and provided an opportunity to hold constructive discussions on a range of topics, including regional security, environmental and sustainable development, drug smuggling and people smuggling.
In addition to the formal meetings and dialogues, the social events of the assembly were wonderful occasions on which to engage with our neighbouring parliamentarians and to gain an insight into each other’s cultures. It is clear that Australia is held in very high regard by the countries in our region. Many parliamentarians from ASEAN nations have strong connections with Australia, having been educated in Australia or having family living here. The delegation was very warmly received, and the engagement with our neighbouring parliamentarians provided opportunities to learn more about the issues being faced by their countries.
I would like to thank the host nation, Thailand, for the professional organisation of the 30th AIPA General Assembly. Thailand lived up to their legendary reputation for hospitality and I thank them personally for their warm and friendly reception.
I would also like to thank the Australian Ambassador to Thailand, Mr Paul Grigson, and his colleagues for the excellent briefing they gave us upon our arrival in Thailand. I believe that the 30th AIPA General Assembly presented a valuable forum for the further strengthening of bonds between the parliaments of ASEAN nations, encouraging cooperation and understanding of the many issues facing the region. I commend the document to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-27,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 4 February 2010:
The Reserve Bank of Australia’s subsidiaries, Note Printing Australia and Securency, with particular reference to:
allegations of payments to overseas agents into offshore tax havens and corruption in securing note printing contracts and what the Reserve Bank, Austrade and the Australian Government knew about the alleged behaviour;
any investigations conducted into those allegations;
any actions taken to press charges against past and existing overseas agents; and
action which may be taken to prevent improper dealings occurring again.
These are extraordinarily serious allegations which go to the behaviour of the Reserve Bank’s subsidiaries Note Printing Australia and Securency. Those allegations include corruption, bribery and the placement of multimillion-dollar sums into offshore tax havens for services that were being bid for by one or other of the agencies. I refer to a report by Richard Baker and Nick McKenzie in the Age newspaper of 23 May this year under the heading ‘Revealed: the RBA’s dodgy global deals’. It says:
The Reserve Bank of Australia has been involved in the payment of multimillion-dollar commissions to shady middlemen in its drive to win bank note printing deals with foreign governments.
Securency Pty Ltd, a Melbourne-based bank note supplier half-owned by the RBA, has made a substantial number of “commission” payments to agents, including some previously implicated in corruption scandals.
The company, which has supplied polymer material to print money in Australia and 26 other countries, is chaired by the RBA’s assistant governor Robert Rankin. Its board has another two RBA appointees, as well as executives from British firm, Innovia Films, owner of the other half of Securency.
Some of Securency’s agents are closely tied to government or central bank officials in countries ranked by Transparency International as highly corrupt.
Several agents have been named in official corruption investigations in Africa and Asia. At least one has a criminal conviction for fraud.
The Reserve Bank of Australia’s own annual report for this year, on page 41, says:
The Board of Securency has measures in place designed to ensure the maintenance of high standards of integrity …
Later on it points to the allegations that I have just enumerated, raised first in the Age. It says this:
The allegations were therefore treated very seriously, and when they were first raised the Board of Securency promptly requested an independent investigation by the AFP. This investigation began immediately and the Board has ensured that all possible assistance has been given to the AFP.
The Board of Securency also engaged an external accounting practice to undertake a thorough independent review of the company’s policies and practices in relation to the use of these agents, to ensure that they remain at best practice. At the AFP’s request, Securency delayed the start of this review until the AFP had completed its initial assessment of the allegations. The review, which is now in progress, is expected to take several months to complete.
In other words, Securency held off an external accounting exercise until after the AFP had completed its initial assessment of the allegations, but the board of Securency itself is now proceeding with a review—that is, an inquiry of its own—into the probity of the behaviour of at least some of its agents and officers. That inquiry is continuing to take place.
I know there is always in these matters some concern, where the Australian Federal Police have been brought in, that the parliament not cross over with investigations that are therefore taking place. I would agree with that. However, it is to be noted that no less than the Nigerian parliament—one of the countries in which Securency is said to have been working to get very highly profitable engagement—has and is undertaking a major inquiry. The Age in fact reported on the 23rd of this month, under the heading ‘Nigeria to act on RBA bribe claim’, the following:
Nigeria’s National Assembly is to investigate the country’s former central bank governor over allegations he was bribed to award a contract to a company controlled by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Nigeria’s House of Representatives has passed a motion requesting the assembly’s banking and justice committees investigate the Central Bank of Nigeria’s previous administrators for “brazen cases’’ of corruption, money laundering, reckless spending and issuing of non-performing loans.
A resolution read by representative John Halims Agoda and supported by 46 others said: ‘‘The committees are mandated to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the widely reported claims by the local and international media that a company, Securency, is believed to have paid millions of dollars in bribe money to Nigerian officials to secure the contract to print Nigeria’s new banknotes.’’
The Australian Federal Police has told The Age that it is investigating Securency for alleged bribery after the company paid millions of dollars to two British-based businessmen with high-level Nigerian political contacts to win a banknote contract.
Securency, which is owned by the RBA and British firm Innovia Films, has supplied Nigeria with almost 2 billion polymer strips with which to print the nation’s banknotes.
Nigeria’s main newspapers have recently accused former CBN—
that is, the Central Bank of Nigeria—
governor Chukwuma Soludo of being among those officials suspected of accepting the alleged bribes in 2006—
that is, the bribes from this subsidiary company of the Reserve Bank of Australia. This report goes on to say:
Professor Soludo, who finished his term as CBN boss in May and is now running for governor of a Nigerian state, has vehemently denied the allegations, describing them as “wild”.
Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is also expected to launch a separate investigation into the bribery claims surrounding the Securency contract.
In other words, there is a parliamentary inquiry going at the same time as the relative crimes commission in Nigeria is considering undertaking an inquiry. I cannot recall, except in the quite different case of the Australian Wheat Board’s involvement in Iraq, a case of such enormous concern for Australian corporations regarding allegations of criminal activity overseas.
It is not just incumbent upon but the responsibility of this parliament and, through this motion, the committee system to investigate these extraordinarily serious charges. The only debate that I think could be held on the matter is whether or not the fact that the Federal Police are investigating these matters ought to make us cautious about the inquiry. However, as I have just put to the chamber, both Securency itself and now the Nigerian parliament are undertaking inquiries at the present time.
I will be very keen to hear submissions from the government and the opposition, who are of course important in allowing this reference to proceed. I would point out that if parts (b) and (c) of the motion present any problem for the government and/or the opposition I would be prepared to amend the motion to delete them. That is the section which would have the inquiry look into any current investigations which are underway.
I do not think it would be an exercise in probity for this parliament to wash its hands of these extraordinarily serious claims, which have now been running for five or six months from the investigative unit of the Age newspaper without countermand that I know of, about major subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank of Australia. There is comment in those articles about the damage being done to the international reputation of the Reserve Bank by inference about the relationship to the Reserve Bank, and I think we should be very sure that we are doing all we can to protect that reputation and that relationship. We in this place know that the worst thing you can do to protect such a relationship is to ignore very serious charges that are being made. I would urge both sides of the Senate to consider these extraordinarily serious accusations and allegations—backed up by a great deal of material, I might add—of misbehaviour, not just in Nigeria and South Africa but in several other countries around the world, by agents employed by subsidiary companies of the Reserve Bank. I point out that senior officials of the Reserve Bank sit on or preside over—or have presided over—the boards of those subsidiary companies.
I have endeavoured through other ways—for example, estimates committees—to have the Reserve Bank governor or other senior officers questioned about these matters, but that has not been possible. I am not prepared to allow the matter to simply rest. It is too serious for that. It is serious enough for every senator to consider it. I believe that an inquiry should be undertaken. We have been able in the past to keep well clear of in any way compromising police inquiries that have proceeded. For any senator who is thinking about the problem of there being a police inquiry concurrent to the Senate establishing an inquiry into these allegations against the subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank, I cite the fact that the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime are matters that are being examined by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services at the moment while the matter is simultaneously being investigated by ASIC and the police. Forest managed investment schemes are being examined by the Senate Select Committee on Agriculture and Related Industries even though the matter is being simultaneously investigated again by ASIC and, according to media reports, the police could be investigating. The Privileges Committee is currently investigating a matter relating to Mr Grech while the police are also investigating matters pertaining to that person. In 1999, to go back a little, when a fraud of $8.72 million was committed against the department of finance, Senator Faulkner still questioned on the matter—and you can see how difficult it is to deal with such a matter while court proceedings are going ahead.
I think our committee is well able to steer clear of matters that the police might be looking at. We need to look at protecting the name of the Reserve Bank and the high esteem in which it is held. I do not think we can do that by ignoring these extraordinarily worrying charges and allegations that are now in the international press, not just the Australian press. I believe it is the duty, the obligation and the right of the Senate to undertake an inquiry and to try to ascertain the facts of the matter before the efflux of any further time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-27,"—I indicate at the outset that the coalition will not be supporting the reference proposed by Senator Bob Brown. Senator Brown has spent a fair bit of time talking about the involvement of the Australian Federal Police in this matter, and that is primarily the reason. Senator Brown has highlighted some matters concerning Senate inquiries concurrent with AFP investigations. I might even suggest that some of those might have even been politically charged or motivated. The Reserve Bank of Australia is something that we need to be very careful with and maintain complete independence from. We would suggest that the Australian Federal Police investigation into this matter is appropriate at this time. That would not prevent the matter from being revisited at the conclusion of the Australian Federal Police investigation. That might be a more appropriate time to look at whether a Senate inquiry into this matter is necessary.
There are some interesting factors with this that are slightly more different to some of the matters that Senator Brown mentioned. Firstly, the allegations which have been suggested in relation to this matter may be outside the scope of a Senate inquiry—in particular, with witnesses not being resident or domiciled in Australia. In fact, a number of witnesses—I would suggest most witnesses—might be outside the jurisdiction of the Senate. Therefore, the Australian Federal Police would be a far better organisation to be looking at this. That is notwithstanding any of the international treaties that we currently have. The opposition will not be supporting the reference for those reasons. We believe the Australian Federal Police at this point in time is the most appropriate and qualified agency to be investigating this serious matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-10-27,"—The government also will oppose this motion. This motion should not be supported by the Senate for the very simple reason that it is not appropriate for the Senate to be investigating this issue while the police are conducting an investigation. I am aware of the continuing media coverage alleging impropriety related to Securency’s activities—in particular, its use of agents as its representatives in developing countries. I am advised that the board of Securency have treated these allegations very seriously. The Australian Federal Police are currently investigating a range of issues in relation to this matter. I am also advised that this investigation is ongoing and, as such, it would be highly inappropriate for ministers to be commenting on the investigation and related matters. Equally, others who are readily offering comment on this case should consider whether making such comment is in the interests of a fair and thorough investigation. This includes debating these issues within the Senate or referring this to a Senate committee, as it could prejudice the outcome of the AFP investigation.
In its trade promotion activities, the government makes it very clear that it will not condone, under any circumstances, illegal activities by Australian companies overseas. Australian law criminalises the bribery of foreign public officials in business transactions whether committed here in Australia or by an Australian anywhere in the world. On 14 September 2009 the opposition supported the government to vote down the Greens’ Senate motion to inquire about the commissions paid by NPA and Securency for the service of representatives. I call on the opposition to again support the government—as they are doing on this occasion. We appreciate their support in this matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-27,"—I thank both the government and the opposition for their short contribution to this matter and I submit that they are both wrong. One only has to recollect the enormous and growing damage of the Wheat Board affair to know that. I also pointed out in my submission that the board of Securency itself has seen fit to hold an inquiry, but the government and the opposition say that the Senate should not. And the parliament of Nigeria is holding an inquiry, but the government and the opposition say that the Senate should not.
—I wouldn’t follow everything the parliament of Nigeria did.
—The opposition spokesperson says that he would not follow everything that the parliament of Nigeria does. I would suggest in response to that comment and the way in which it was pitched that I would expect better of the honourable senator opposite. I for one respect what the parliament of Nigeria and its members try to do and try to achieve.
I want to go back to some of the people who have been agents for the Reserve Bank subsidiaries, because I think that if we are not going to have a Senate inquiry we at least should have some public record of what it is that the members of the Senate—the Greens excepted—do not want to have inquired into at this time. One of those agents, according to the Age, is Mr Benoy Berry from Contec Global in London. Securency has paid millions of dollars to this London based businessman who heads a multinational technology firm, Contec Global. The firm has won large contracts across Africa, including in Sudan and Rwanda, but has also been implicated in a corruption inquiry in Uganda. In 2005, Contec Global was accused by Uganda’s internal security organisation of making a bribe of at least $1.8 million to a cabinet minister responsible for a national ID card tender process. In 2006, an inquiry by Uganda’s Inspectorate of Government found the finance minister, Isaac Musumba, favoured Contec Global’s bid even though it did not meet the selection criteria and was by far the most expensive. The office of Uganda’s President alleged Contec Global had promised Musumba a share in money gained from its inflated bid. Musumba has denied any wrongdoing.
Securency has had financial dealings with companies linked to businessman Mr Donald McArthur, who was the head of a major company involved in South Africa’s biggest-ever corporate failure in 1999. In 2005, McArthur was arrested by South African police and charged with racketeering, fraud and corruption and accused of improperly pocketing money borrowed from banks. Last year he did a deal with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty to fraud and reckless trading. He paid a substantial fine instead of serving a two-year jail term. He was also forced to pay money into the proceeds of crime fund. McArthur worked for Vivian Reddy in 2005. McArthur repeatedly denied any association with Securency when contacted by the Age, although Securency has said that he has been an agent. Mr Reddy, referred to there, is a South African casino tycoon who won the rights to promote Securency’s banknotes in Africa a few years ago and has more recently declared that he will push the notes across half the continent within a decade. One of his senior employees said that Mr Reddy’s relationship with Securency was over but would not say when or why due to ‘confidentiality and nondisclosure issues’.
Reddy is a controversial figure in South Africa due to his political connections and his bankrolling of the recently elected president, Jacob Zuma. The magnate was ensnared in the South African government’s aborted corruption trial against Zuma, who was alleged to have accepted a bribe from a French defence contractor seeking to build four ships for South Africa’s navy. In a related corruption case against Zuma’s now jailed former financial adviser, prosecutors alleged that the charitable trust account set up by Reddy was used to hide payments from French defence firm Thales to a company owned by the financial adviser and then to Zuma. Reddy’s lawyer has rejected the claims of corruption made by state prosecutors.
When we go to Cambodia, we find that Melbourne barrister Daryl Dealehr is Securency’s agent and the director of mining company Cambodian Resources Ltd. Dealehr has ties to the families of Cambodia’s late and notorious national police chief Hok Lundy and Cambodia’s controversial Prime Minister, Hun Sen. Human rights groups and former senior Cambodian officials accuse Lundy, who died last year, of being responsible for dozens of murders. ‘There is hardly anyone in Cambodia who has shown more contempt for the arm of the law than Hok Lundy’, Human Rights Watch said.
Dealehr told the Age he was surprised he had not yet landed a banknote deal for Securency but said Cambodia’s reserve bank was conservative and wedded to paper banknotes. Dealehr said that he had been duped and that he had very good contacts with bank officials and had been Securency’s agent for many years. He was unable to speak further about Securency’s affairs due to private causes. In 2007, Dealehr’s mining company won the rights to develop iron ore, gold and so on in Cambodia.
Next door, in Vietnam, in 2002, as Vietnam switched from paper to plastic banknotes, Securency teamed up with Hanoi firm CFTD and its subsidiary Banktech. In early 2002, Banktech’s deputy director was Le Duc Minh, the son of the State Bank of Vietnam’s then governor, Le Duc Thoy, who was in charge of the deal. The bank governor denied his son was involved, but Banktech documents reveal they were the ‘exclusive suppliers’ of bank printing materials for Vietnam. Securency was listed as one of its ‘overseas partners’. In 2007, a Vietnam government inquiry reportedly found irregularities and weakness through the banknote project. It found that the bank governor had failed to include a comparison of the polymer banknotes in his submission to the Prime Minister. The inquiry concluded that the involvement of his son had created a lot of suspicion, affected the transparency of the project and damaged the governor’s reputation. Securency has paid millions of dollars in commissions to CFTD directors who are connected to Vietnam’s political personages.
We can go to many other matters, some of which I have raised before in this place. But, needless to say, when we hear the litany of connections with dodgy dealers, with corrupt officials, with shady persons, with people who have criminal records and with people who are involved in multimillion-dollar international deals, which include money being passed from agencies of the Reserve Bank to offshore tax havens for payment, we have to be very alarmed. This Senate and this parliament have to be very concerned indeed.
I have seen no comeback from the Reserve Bank or its subsidiary which substantially or effectively moves to answer these accusations. This is a case of the fourth estate—in this case, the investigating unit of the Age newspaper—writing front-page stories in relation to dealings of the Reserve Bank’s subsidiaries overseas with very questionable people. It has raised an alarm which the parliament is bound to respond to. I do not accept the argument that because it is a matter now put into the hands of the Australian Federal Police this parliament should not be looking at the probity with which the Reserve Bank board has viewed its subsidiaries. I remind the Senate that the deputy of the Reserve Bank board has been the president, the presiding officer, of one of the subsidiaries I am talking about. It is a matter of very great concern to me, and ought be to every senator, that we have had no response to this matter from the Reserve Bank. I would expect that even this debate ought to give rise to a rejoinder from the Reserve Bank of Australia to this parliament. That would be reasonable and expected on matters as major and concerning as this.
I think the government and the opposition are wrong. I think we are seeing in play here a respect for office—that is, for the Reserve Bank itself—which confuses the behaviour of people who might abuse that respect which the country and the body politic give to the Reserve Bank. The very fact that it is allegedly at arm’s length diminishes not one whit the responsibility of this parliament to ensure that its handling of matters are not only in the best interests of the nation but lawful in this nation and lawful anywhere else in the world. On the face of it, that is not the case with these subsidiaries.
The opposition and the government are in grave danger of preventing the process of clearing the air on these matters of great concern. I think they have made a mistake; nevertheless, these are matters that I will continue to pursue, and they are matters that I have no doubt the Prime Minister himself is very aware of. Inaction at the highest levels of government on this matter is something that may well come back to haunt those who have failed to take action. I do not know of any action that has been taken by the government. I would expect that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have taken a very close interest in these extraordinary allegations of corruption infecting subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank of Australia. If not then there is something wrong with the way the government has looked at these accusations. If so then I think that the Prime Minister and/or the Treasurer ought to have reported to this parliament.
I have a great sense of unease about the inertia with which the government has greeted the terrible news that is unfolding about the dealings of some of the people that the Reserve Bank subsidiaries have been involved with—and which, we must presume, the people on the board of the Reserve Bank knew about, to some degree, quite some time ago. I know that Securency did a review and stopped certain activities as far back as 2006, but we deserve to know why the parliament was not acquainted with that, why we have not heard of further action since then and why the accusations continue to roll without there being a response from the government. The government should come to the parliament with an explanation as to what it knows about these dealings which have involved members of the board of the Reserve Bank and do what it can in the current circumstances to clear the air.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-27,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 4 February 2010:
The Reserve Bank of Australia’s subsidiaries, Note Printing Australia and Securency, with particular reference to:
allegations of payments to overseas agents into offshore tax havens and corruption in securing note printing contracts and what the Reserve Bank, Austrade and the Australian Government knew about the alleged behaviour;
any investigations conducted into those allegations;
any actions taken to press charges against past and existing overseas agents; and
action which may be taken to prevent improper dealings occurring again.
These are extraordinarily serious allegations which go to the behaviour of the Reserve Bank’s subsidiaries Note Printing Australia and Securency. Those allegations include corruption, bribery and the placement of multimillion-dollar sums into offshore tax havens for services that were being bid for by one or other of the agencies. I refer to a report by Richard Baker and Nick McKenzie in the Age newspaper of 23 May this year under the heading ‘Revealed: the RBA’s dodgy global deals’. It says:
The Reserve Bank of Australia has been involved in the payment of multimillion-dollar commissions to shady middlemen in its drive to win bank note printing deals with foreign governments.
Securency Pty Ltd, a Melbourne-based bank note supplier half-owned by the RBA, has made a substantial number of “commission” payments to agents, including some previously implicated in corruption scandals.
The company, which has supplied polymer material to print money in Australia and 26 other countries, is chaired by the RBA’s assistant governor Robert Rankin. Its board has another two RBA appointees, as well as executives from British firm, Innovia Films, owner of the other half of Securency.
Some of Securency’s agents are closely tied to government or central bank officials in countries ranked by Transparency International as highly corrupt.
Several agents have been named in official corruption investigations in Africa and Asia. At least one has a criminal conviction for fraud.
The Reserve Bank of Australia’s own annual report for this year, on page 41, says:
The Board of Securency has measures in place designed to ensure the maintenance of high standards of integrity …
Later on it points to the allegations that I have just enumerated, raised first in the Age. It says this:
The allegations were therefore treated very seriously, and when they were first raised the Board of Securency promptly requested an independent investigation by the AFP. This investigation began immediately and the Board has ensured that all possible assistance has been given to the AFP.
The Board of Securency also engaged an external accounting practice to undertake a thorough independent review of the company’s policies and practices in relation to the use of these agents, to ensure that they remain at best practice. At the AFP’s request, Securency delayed the start of this review until the AFP had completed its initial assessment of the allegations. The review, which is now in progress, is expected to take several months to complete.
In other words, Securency held off an external accounting exercise until after the AFP had completed its initial assessment of the allegations, but the board of Securency itself is now proceeding with a review—that is, an inquiry of its own—into the probity of the behaviour of at least some of its agents and officers. That inquiry is continuing to take place.
I know there is always in these matters some concern, where the Australian Federal Police have been brought in, that the parliament not cross over with investigations that are therefore taking place. I would agree with that. However, it is to be noted that no less than the Nigerian parliament—one of the countries in which Securency is said to have been working to get very highly profitable engagement—has and is undertaking a major inquiry. The Age in fact reported on the 23rd of this month, under the heading ‘Nigeria to act on RBA bribe claim’, the following:
Nigeria’s National Assembly is to investigate the country’s former central bank governor over allegations he was bribed to award a contract to a company controlled by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Nigeria’s House of Representatives has passed a motion requesting the assembly’s banking and justice committees investigate the Central Bank of Nigeria’s previous administrators for “brazen cases’’ of corruption, money laundering, reckless spending and issuing of non-performing loans.
A resolution read by representative John Halims Agoda and supported by 46 others said: ‘‘The committees are mandated to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the widely reported claims by the local and international media that a company, Securency, is believed to have paid millions of dollars in bribe money to Nigerian officials to secure the contract to print Nigeria’s new banknotes.’’
The Australian Federal Police has told The Age that it is investigating Securency for alleged bribery after the company paid millions of dollars to two British-based businessmen with high-level Nigerian political contacts to win a banknote contract.
Securency, which is owned by the RBA and British firm Innovia Films, has supplied Nigeria with almost 2 billion polymer strips with which to print the nation’s banknotes.
Nigeria’s main newspapers have recently accused former CBN—
that is, the Central Bank of Nigeria—
governor Chukwuma Soludo of being among those officials suspected of accepting the alleged bribes in 2006—
that is, the bribes from this subsidiary company of the Reserve Bank of Australia. This report goes on to say:
Professor Soludo, who finished his term as CBN boss in May and is now running for governor of a Nigerian state, has vehemently denied the allegations, describing them as “wild”.
Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is also expected to launch a separate investigation into the bribery claims surrounding the Securency contract.
In other words, there is a parliamentary inquiry going at the same time as the relative crimes commission in Nigeria is considering undertaking an inquiry. I cannot recall, except in the quite different case of the Australian Wheat Board’s involvement in Iraq, a case of such enormous concern for Australian corporations regarding allegations of criminal activity overseas.
It is not just incumbent upon but the responsibility of this parliament and, through this motion, the committee system to investigate these extraordinarily serious charges. The only debate that I think could be held on the matter is whether or not the fact that the Federal Police are investigating these matters ought to make us cautious about the inquiry. However, as I have just put to the chamber, both Securency itself and now the Nigerian parliament are undertaking inquiries at the present time.
I will be very keen to hear submissions from the government and the opposition, who are of course important in allowing this reference to proceed. I would point out that if parts (b) and (c) of the motion present any problem for the government and/or the opposition I would be prepared to amend the motion to delete them. That is the section which would have the inquiry look into any current investigations which are underway.
I do not think it would be an exercise in probity for this parliament to wash its hands of these extraordinarily serious claims, which have now been running for five or six months from the investigative unit of the Age newspaper without countermand that I know of, about major subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank of Australia. There is comment in those articles about the damage being done to the international reputation of the Reserve Bank by inference about the relationship to the Reserve Bank, and I think we should be very sure that we are doing all we can to protect that reputation and that relationship. We in this place know that the worst thing you can do to protect such a relationship is to ignore very serious charges that are being made. I would urge both sides of the Senate to consider these extraordinarily serious accusations and allegations—backed up by a great deal of material, I might add—of misbehaviour, not just in Nigeria and South Africa but in several other countries around the world, by agents employed by subsidiary companies of the Reserve Bank. I point out that senior officials of the Reserve Bank sit on or preside over—or have presided over—the boards of those subsidiary companies.
I have endeavoured through other ways—for example, estimates committees—to have the Reserve Bank governor or other senior officers questioned about these matters, but that has not been possible. I am not prepared to allow the matter to simply rest. It is too serious for that. It is serious enough for every senator to consider it. I believe that an inquiry should be undertaken. We have been able in the past to keep well clear of in any way compromising police inquiries that have proceeded. For any senator who is thinking about the problem of there being a police inquiry concurrent to the Senate establishing an inquiry into these allegations against the subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank, I cite the fact that the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime are matters that are being examined by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services at the moment while the matter is simultaneously being investigated by ASIC and the police. Forest managed investment schemes are being examined by the Senate Select Committee on Agriculture and Related Industries even though the matter is being simultaneously investigated again by ASIC and, according to media reports, the police could be investigating. The Privileges Committee is currently investigating a matter relating to Mr Grech while the police are also investigating matters pertaining to that person. In 1999, to go back a little, when a fraud of $8.72 million was committed against the department of finance, Senator Faulkner still questioned on the matter—and you can see how difficult it is to deal with such a matter while court proceedings are going ahead.
I think our committee is well able to steer clear of matters that the police might be looking at. We need to look at protecting the name of the Reserve Bank and the high esteem in which it is held. I do not think we can do that by ignoring these extraordinarily worrying charges and allegations that are now in the international press, not just the Australian press. I believe it is the duty, the obligation and the right of the Senate to undertake an inquiry and to try to ascertain the facts of the matter before the efflux of any further time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-27,"—I indicate at the outset that the coalition will not be supporting the reference proposed by Senator Bob Brown. Senator Brown has spent a fair bit of time talking about the involvement of the Australian Federal Police in this matter, and that is primarily the reason. Senator Brown has highlighted some matters concerning Senate inquiries concurrent with AFP investigations. I might even suggest that some of those might have even been politically charged or motivated. The Reserve Bank of Australia is something that we need to be very careful with and maintain complete independence from. We would suggest that the Australian Federal Police investigation into this matter is appropriate at this time. That would not prevent the matter from being revisited at the conclusion of the Australian Federal Police investigation. That might be a more appropriate time to look at whether a Senate inquiry into this matter is necessary.
There are some interesting factors with this that are slightly more different to some of the matters that Senator Brown mentioned. Firstly, the allegations which have been suggested in relation to this matter may be outside the scope of a Senate inquiry—in particular, with witnesses not being resident or domiciled in Australia. In fact, a number of witnesses—I would suggest most witnesses—might be outside the jurisdiction of the Senate. Therefore, the Australian Federal Police would be a far better organisation to be looking at this. That is notwithstanding any of the international treaties that we currently have. The opposition will not be supporting the reference for those reasons. We believe the Australian Federal Police at this point in time is the most appropriate and qualified agency to be investigating this serious matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-10-27,"—The government also will oppose this motion. This motion should not be supported by the Senate for the very simple reason that it is not appropriate for the Senate to be investigating this issue while the police are conducting an investigation. I am aware of the continuing media coverage alleging impropriety related to Securency’s activities—in particular, its use of agents as its representatives in developing countries. I am advised that the board of Securency have treated these allegations very seriously. The Australian Federal Police are currently investigating a range of issues in relation to this matter. I am also advised that this investigation is ongoing and, as such, it would be highly inappropriate for ministers to be commenting on the investigation and related matters. Equally, others who are readily offering comment on this case should consider whether making such comment is in the interests of a fair and thorough investigation. This includes debating these issues within the Senate or referring this to a Senate committee, as it could prejudice the outcome of the AFP investigation.
In its trade promotion activities, the government makes it very clear that it will not condone, under any circumstances, illegal activities by Australian companies overseas. Australian law criminalises the bribery of foreign public officials in business transactions whether committed here in Australia or by an Australian anywhere in the world. On 14 September 2009 the opposition supported the government to vote down the Greens’ Senate motion to inquire about the commissions paid by NPA and Securency for the service of representatives. I call on the opposition to again support the government—as they are doing on this occasion. We appreciate their support in this matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-27,"—I thank both the government and the opposition for their short contribution to this matter and I submit that they are both wrong. One only has to recollect the enormous and growing damage of the Wheat Board affair to know that. I also pointed out in my submission that the board of Securency itself has seen fit to hold an inquiry, but the government and the opposition say that the Senate should not. And the parliament of Nigeria is holding an inquiry, but the government and the opposition say that the Senate should not.
—I wouldn’t follow everything the parliament of Nigeria did.
—The opposition spokesperson says that he would not follow everything that the parliament of Nigeria does. I would suggest in response to that comment and the way in which it was pitched that I would expect better of the honourable senator opposite. I for one respect what the parliament of Nigeria and its members try to do and try to achieve.
I want to go back to some of the people who have been agents for the Reserve Bank subsidiaries, because I think that if we are not going to have a Senate inquiry we at least should have some public record of what it is that the members of the Senate—the Greens excepted—do not want to have inquired into at this time. One of those agents, according to the Age, is Mr Benoy Berry from Contec Global in London. Securency has paid millions of dollars to this London based businessman who heads a multinational technology firm, Contec Global. The firm has won large contracts across Africa, including in Sudan and Rwanda, but has also been implicated in a corruption inquiry in Uganda. In 2005, Contec Global was accused by Uganda’s internal security organisation of making a bribe of at least $1.8 million to a cabinet minister responsible for a national ID card tender process. In 2006, an inquiry by Uganda’s Inspectorate of Government found the finance minister, Isaac Musumba, favoured Contec Global’s bid even though it did not meet the selection criteria and was by far the most expensive. The office of Uganda’s President alleged Contec Global had promised Musumba a share in money gained from its inflated bid. Musumba has denied any wrongdoing.
Securency has had financial dealings with companies linked to businessman Mr Donald McArthur, who was the head of a major company involved in South Africa’s biggest-ever corporate failure in 1999. In 2005, McArthur was arrested by South African police and charged with racketeering, fraud and corruption and accused of improperly pocketing money borrowed from banks. Last year he did a deal with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty to fraud and reckless trading. He paid a substantial fine instead of serving a two-year jail term. He was also forced to pay money into the proceeds of crime fund. McArthur worked for Vivian Reddy in 2005. McArthur repeatedly denied any association with Securency when contacted by the Age, although Securency has said that he has been an agent. Mr Reddy, referred to there, is a South African casino tycoon who won the rights to promote Securency’s banknotes in Africa a few years ago and has more recently declared that he will push the notes across half the continent within a decade. One of his senior employees said that Mr Reddy’s relationship with Securency was over but would not say when or why due to ‘confidentiality and nondisclosure issues’.
Reddy is a controversial figure in South Africa due to his political connections and his bankrolling of the recently elected president, Jacob Zuma. The magnate was ensnared in the South African government’s aborted corruption trial against Zuma, who was alleged to have accepted a bribe from a French defence contractor seeking to build four ships for South Africa’s navy. In a related corruption case against Zuma’s now jailed former financial adviser, prosecutors alleged that the charitable trust account set up by Reddy was used to hide payments from French defence firm Thales to a company owned by the financial adviser and then to Zuma. Reddy’s lawyer has rejected the claims of corruption made by state prosecutors.

Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-10-27,"—Before question time, when we started this debate, I was pointing out the absolute failure of the Rudd Labor government in the health portfolio. Senators would remember my comments before question time about how, before the election, the Rudd Labor government promised the world on health but have delivered next to nothing. All we have had is a whole series of reviews, followed now by reviews into those same reviews; a return to the bad, old-fashioned crusade against private health; and the occasional lazy, ill-thought-out, short-sighted budget cut, usually targeted at those Australians who access services through the private health system.
One of the reviews commissioned by the government upon coming into office was the National Preventative Health Taskforce. That review went for 15 months. It considered all of the issues. It considered the best way forward from its point of view. It made a whole series of recommendations. The minister received the report of the National Preventative Health Taskforce on 30 June and we were led to believe at the time that the report would be released. At the last minute, the release of that report was canned because somebody in government, and I can only guess who, made a judgement that it was too hot to handle—some tough decisions would have had to be made and there may well have been some consequences in terms of public opinion. The government then sat on it for two months. It was only an order of this Senate which forced the government to publicly release the National Preventative Health Taskforce report on 1 September. It was a disgrace that we had to wait for those two months.
Since then, have the government done anything? Have the government made any announcements in relation to any of the recommendations: what should happen to the tobacco excise, what should happen to alcohol taxation, what should happen to alcohol advertising and what should happen to a whole series of other recommendations? No, they have not. In fact, when the Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech, made the very sensible and constructive suggestion that we should increase the excise on tobacco by 12½ per cent, the government came out and opposed it. They pooh-poohed it. It was an eminently sensible suggestion. What is the minister scared of? What are the government scared of? Why are they not prepared to take on the tobacco companies? Why are they not prepared to make some tough decisions in the health portfolio about alcohol taxation or about a whole series of other issues?
The minister has been out there saying that the opposition want to delay or block this bill. We do not want to do anything of the sort. I cannot believe that the government would make such an incredibly unbelievable suggestion. If you look at the second reading amendment we have put forward, you can see that what we are saying is that this bill should be considered only after the government has tabled its response to all of the recommendations of its own National Preventative Health Taskforce review. That is eminently sensible. What it means is that, if the government were to come into this place today and tell us which recommendations they support and which ones they do not, we would be able to deal with it in very good time—before 1 January 2010, which is when this agency is supposed to come into effect.
We support effective preventative health measures, but we do not support just setting up another agency without a clearly articulated purpose. This government uses bureaucratic processes—it uses reviews, task forces, committees of inquiry, further reviews and new agencies—to avoid making decisions. This is a strategy to create the impression of a government that is busy—busyness instead of a focus on outcomes.
One of the real problems we have in the health portfolio and one of the things that any future Australian government will have to address is duplication in management of the health system. This is yet another bill which is going to create duplication. I would be very interested to hear the response from the government to the points I am about raise. We are here being asked to support legislation to set up the National Preventative Health Agency which will be funded at a total cost of $133.2 million over four years. This includes establishment costs of $17.6 million. It will oversee spending of $102 million on a national social marketing campaign targeting obesity and smoking and a total of $13.2 million in research spending to support policy development.
The federal Department of Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon’s own department, already spends $31 million per year in departmental expenses for two programs that administer $204 million in funding for disease prevention and strategy. Both those programs already include national-level social marketing campaigns targeting obesity and smoking. This figure includes—and this comes straight out of the budget papers—$152 million that has already been allocated for the existing drug strategy program in 2009-10, with $24 million of that total having been allocated for departmental expenses. In 2009-10, the department will continue a social marketing campaign aimed at raising awareness about the risks of overweight/obesity. In total, $52 million has been allocated, including the promotion of healthy lifestyles, reducing and preventing diabetes, and the detection and prevention of cancer. Of the total, $7 million has been allocated for departmental expenses. And the list goes on.
We support effective preventative health measures, but one of the other measures in the budget is going directly counter to that. Cataract surgery is a very effective and a very cost-effective preventative health measure. It helps to prevent falls, fractures and the mental distress from going blind. It helps to improve quality of life. It helps to prevent social isolation and early institutionalisation. It is one of the most effective and cost effective preventative health measures currently being funded by the Commonwealth, yet this government wants to cut it in half.
Our main criticism with this legislation is that the government is putting the cart before the horse. It came with all these promises about what it was going to do in preventative health. In two years as Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon has not been prepared to make one single hard decision. We understand that there are some difficult decisions to be made in some of the areas this preventative health strategy focuses on, such as tobacco, alcohol, obesity and food, but the minister has not made them. The Rudd government has not made them. It had a 15-month review and nothing has happened since then. The minister has ducked for cover. She has refused to release the report for two months. She has been sitting on it for four months without making a decision. This minister is unable to make decisions right across her portfolio. We had her inability to make a decision on the ill-considered chemotherapy budget cut. She has been unable to make a decision on clinical treatment guidelines for ADHD, she has been unable to make a decision on any of the recommendations out of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and she has been unable to make a decision on any of the recommendations in her own National Preventative Health Taskforce report.
We have got report after report piling up and we have got the minister ducking for cover. Instead of telling the Australian people how she proposes to move forward on the price of tobacco, alcohol taxation arrangements and various other issues such as advertising et cetera, she is ducking for cover and just going to set up another agency. We acknowledge that this agency can do some good work as long as it is well targeted and as long as it is focused on tangible, effective outcomes. But with this minister we are worried that this is just part of another delaying tactic and making people believe that she is doing something when she is doing nothing.
This is a very serious concern. The objectives of preventative health are obviously shared by all. We all agree that we should encourage healthier lifestyles and thereby reduce pressure on an already overburdened health system. I have already mentioned that the government’s decision on cataract rebates will actually put more pressure on our health system, particularly on our public health system. It will put more pressure on elderly Australians, which will result in more falls, more fractures, mental distress and early institutionalisation. We support strong preventative health measures, including on tobacco, alcohol, food et cetera. However, there is a very fine line between giving people the information they need to make informed decisions and a nanny state telling people how to live their lives. We do not believe that preventative health should be about social engineering. We believe that preventative health should be focused on achieving serious, tangible and positive practical health outcomes. On any of these counts, this minister has failed. She has failed to make tough decisions. She has failed to look the vested interests in the eyes and say, ‘This is the way forward.’ All we have got from this minister—
—From you, on vested interests?
—I hear an interjection from Senator Evans. I am sure that you would do a better job in this portfolio, Minister. As a good senator from Western Australia, I think that you should go to the Prime Minister and ask him for the health portfolio, Senator Evans, because in two years this Minister for Health and Ageing has not made one single tough decision. Maybe Senator Sterle would do a better job. I can see him putting his hand up. Senator Sterle would like to make a contribution in the health portfolio. I am sure that Senator Sterle would be able to make a few tough decisions because certainly Nicola Roxon is not able to make a tough decision. Nicola Roxon has been sitting on her hands for the last two years. She has been running review after review. We are now having this review into the review, with a propaganda exercise across Australia with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health Ageing going for photo opportunity after photo opportunity at a hospital near you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am sure that Nicola Roxon and the Prime Minister will turn up for a photo opportunity at a hospital near you.
I am not sure how much that will achieve in terms of better health outcomes. In fact, I dare to say that it will not achieve any better health outcomes. If you look at all the data that has come out in recent times, the situation in our health system is worse today than it was when the Rudd Labor government was first elected to government. I will just recap. In health before the last election Australians were promised the world. They were promised that the Rudd Labor government had a plan to fix public hospitals, and if it would not achieve it by the middle of 2009 it would put a proposal to the Australian people for Canberra to take over the running of public hospitals. No progress has been made at all. After the election, rather than implementation of a plan we had a 20-month review which is now being followed by a review into the review. We were promised that the government was supportive of and committed to retaining the existing private health rebates and the overall private health policy framework, only to find out after the election that the government had returned to its bad, old-fashioned, inglorious past of running a crusade against private health. We were told that health was going to be a high priority area, only to find out that in two successive budgets, while there was reckless spending everywhere else in every other portfolio of government, in the health portfolio there is ill-thought-out, short-sighted budget cut after budget cut.
We are supportive of preventive health. We are supportive of effective preventive health measures. We are not interested in delaying this bill, but if our second reading amendment, which I will move now, is successful it is going to be up to the government how quickly we can deal with this. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for 3 sitting days after the Government has tabled a response to all of the recommendations of the report of the National Preventative Health Taskforce”.
We would be able to deal with this before the end of the year very easily. All the government has to do is give us a list: yes, we support this one; no, we do not support that one; we may support part of this one but not in its entirety. The Australian people deserve to know what direction this government is proposing to take on preventive health, as the Australian people deserve to know what the direction of the Rudd government is going to be for the remainder of its term in the health portfolio generally. For two years it has been ducking and weaving for cover and we have not seen any serious answers. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-10-27,"—The Greens welcome the release of the Preventive Health Taskforce report and we believe it provides Australia with a strong strategy that would improve health outcomes for the Australian community. The Greens believe a greater focus on prevention in the health system is absolutely necessary to improve the overall health of our population and in the long run it will also result in reduced health costs associated with preventable hospital admissions and other health services and in overall improvement of our community’s health. The Greens believe that strong leadership is required in preventive health and that it needs to get the attention and funding it deserves and very strongly needs. Unfortunately, short-term political cycles have in the past and may in the future encourage governments to favour short-term fixes over long-term preventive health strategies. We believe that is one of the reasons why we need an agency and a longer term strategy to deal with preventive health. We have to focus on keeping people well and out of hospital and we believe we therefore need to start dealing with these issues around preventive health.
We have to invest in the future of the health of our people and our community or our health system will continue to suffer in the years to come. Without action now, the increases in chronic conditions and the ageing population will see health and aged care costs rise from about $84 billion in 2003 to a massive $246 billion in 2033. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare tell us that in 2008 only 2.5 per cent of Australia’s health budget was allocated to preventive health, with the remainder spent on care and treatment services.
It is generally considered that tobacco cessation or anti-smoking programs have been successful in Australia. The 30 per cent decline in smoking rates between 1975 and 1995 prevented over 400,000 premature deaths and saved costs of over $8.4 billion, more than 50 times greater than the amount spent on anti-smoking campaigns over that period of time. In other words, that investment was not only good for our health but was also good for the bottom line. Unfortunately, programs such as this have been spasmodic. In the past community organisations have had to lobby. There has not been an overall strategy about how to deal with preventive health programs, how to deal with these key chronic issues. This particular program in terms of an anti-smoking campaign or tobacco-cessation campaign, as it is sometimes called, was achieved through a combination of measures. There were price signals through higher tobacco taxes and information programs, which were also an essential part of the campaign. Restrictions on advertising, sale and consumption of tobacco were also important elements. Concerted efforts over more than 20 years have changed community attitudes towards smoking and this has also helped to make it socially less acceptable. In fact, it is considered positively antisocial by many people now. It has also helped to bring down our smoking rates. In other words, there has had to be a strategy that has many elements over a number of years.
To some extent the lessons from this anti-smoking campaign can be applied to such things as alcohol and obesity. However, there are some key differences in those products. For example, for tobacco use there is no safe level, whereas we are not applying the same process to alcohol or to, for example, junk foods. Instead, consumers are advised to limit or moderate their consumption. It is not possible and it is not appropriate, many would argue, to make junk food or alcohol campaigns take the prohibition approach or the same way that smoking has been made socially unacceptable. We therefore need different approaches but we do again need long-term strategies and funding, and a combination of methods to start dealing with these issues.
According to figures in a recent report published by VicHealth on the health and economic benefits of reducing disease risk factors in Australia, 13 per cent of adults drink alcohol at a risky or high-risk level long term. Annually, Australians drink more litres of alcohol per capita—9.8—than Americans, at 8.4; Canadians, at eight; Swedes, at 6.6; and Norwegians, at 6.4. Brief alcohol interventions in primary care can reduce alcohol consumption by about 10 per cent, or approximately four standard drinks of alcohol per week.
In Australia, 62 per cent of men and 45 per cent of women are considered overweight or obese. High body mass contributes 7.5 per cent to the overall health burden in Australia, with type 2 diabetes, 40 per cent, and heart disease, 34 per cent, as the major risks. Obesity rates in Australia are generally increasing, so we quite clearly need to be addressing this issue.
Both these sets of statistics highlight some of the pressing problems facing Australians and their health and yet again highlight the need for preventative health agencies such as that proposed, along with long-term strategies and long-term commitment of funding to address these issues. We need much better data to continue to deal with some of these issues. We believe we also need innovative pilot programs. Currently in Australia the potential opportunity cost savings to the health sector are $812 million if we are able to eliminate, for example, just obesity issues.
I quote those statistics in order to give a brief snapshot of why we think it is so important that we start addressing these issues. Not only are there, as I said earlier, some very important economic considerations here but, most importantly, this is about the health of our community and ensuring that we have good health programs and are generally improving the health of the Australian community.
The National Preventative Health Taskforce made 34 recommendations and 135 subrecommendations to government. It did in fact call for the establishment of an agency with the capacity to effectively monitor, evaluate and build evidence. This can be achieved by commissioning surveys of activities undertaken by different sectors and looking at barriers to and enablers of action. The National Preventative Health Taskforce called for an agency that could facilitate a national prevention research infrastructure to answer the fundamental research questions about what works best. The task force called for an agency that could provide resources and advice for national, state and local policies; generate new partnerships for workplace, community and school interventions; assist in the development of the prevention workforce; and coordinate and implement a national approach to preventative health social marketing. These recommendations, we believe, are all important.
The Greens believe such an agency is important. We are, however, concerned with some of the aspects of the government’s approach to setting up the agency. While we strongly support the agency and strongly believe in the need for an agency, we think it needs to be well funded and set up appropriately if it is to do the job that the government assure us they are keen to see it do and that the Preventative Health Taskforce recommended that it do. We have no doubt that such an agency is needed, and we support the concept. However, we believe the agency should be more independent than what the government propose. We also think it is vital that consumers—health consumers, for example—are represented on the advisory council. In fact, we would prefer it if the model had been more along the lines of the establishment of a national agency with a board that was more independent than an advisory council. I will go into the details around those issues a bit further down the track.
We know that most interventions to prevent the harm caused by alcohol, tobacco and obesity attempt to change consumer behaviour. A common approach to attempt to change behaviour has been to run social marketing programs. In some areas these have been effective in the past and in some not. I think every Australian could name at least one successful social marketing program that has been targeted at good health outcomes. Successive governments have run advertising and information campaigns to improve diets and increase physical activity with the aim of preventing or reducing obesity. Despite these campaigns, obesity rates have unfortunately continued to rise. This suggests that to date some of these programs may well not have been effective and, if we are going to change behaviour, we need to provide different information, refocus our social marketing campaigns, deal with economic incentives and, in some cases, change our legislative base—for example, by banning junk food advertising, an approach that the Greens have been advocating for some considerable period of time.
We need to have a greater understanding of consumer interaction. This conclusion is supported by research in behavioural economics which has shown that, in many cases, even when consumers have ready access to understandable information, they may still fail to choose the products or the services that best suit their needs. This is because they may ignore and misinterpret relevant information or fail to act on the information because of other barriers to them changing their behaviour. Biases in consumer decision making are well known to traders of goods and services. They have large marketing budgets and present their products in the best possible light within the limits of the law. They may also exploit consumer biases to increase demand for their product. The large amount of advertising generated by the manufacturers of junk food, for example, makes it very difficult for healthy eating messages to be effective. Again, it highlights the need for strong programs and a variety of programs to tackle this problem from a variety of angles. It also highlights the need for consumers to be involved in assisting in the advisory process.
The Greens believe that the Preventive Health Agency could be better served with an increase in funding allocated to the program, particularly to social marketing. We also want to see key specific performance indicators in place to make sure that the agency is able to justify its activities with nationally agreed outcomes and that the programs it is advocating or putting in place are actually effective. We need a good, strong evidence base to make sure these programs are well targeted. We understand that the government does not want to weigh down the Preventative Health Agency with unrealistic expectations when it first starts. However, we believe it is very important that a strategy is put in place and that funding is provided to allow this agency to be effective. If it does not receive the funding that is necessary, it unfortunately will not be able to be effective. The agency also needs to have the capacity to work across all government, including with those agencies that affect good health outcomes, such as those involved with housing, education, infrastructure, employment and economics as well as those directly involved with health. The Greens believe that if the Preventative Health Agency is to make any real progress in health prevention it must be independent.
We understand that this has been discussed at COAG and that the decisions about the structure have been made through the COAG process, talking to state and territory health ministers. While we understand the necessity to do that, we have come up against the same process as, for example, under the Safe Work Australia legislation—that is, decisions that have been made at COAG are locked in and the government then expects this chamber to rubber stamp those decisions. The Greens do not see that good legislative process works that way. The Senate deserves the right to review legislation and the Greens have reviewed this legislation.
Although we support the concepts and very strongly support the concept of an agency, we do have some concerns about its structure. We believe that a lot of the effectiveness of the agency will be restricted by the government essentially turning it into an advisory agency. It requires the same process that is in the Safe Work Australia legislation: the ministerial council signs off on strategies and on the operational plan. We do not believe that is effective. It then often comes down to the lowest common denominator. We may not have strong preventative health programs if it comes down yet again to the lowest common denominator. We have seen that in the debate over junk food advertising. We have seen that in self-regulatory bodies that look at alcohol advertising. We do not believe that is appropriate. We believe there should have been a board put in place to ensure that the Preventative Health Agency is more independent.
The Greens have a series of amendments that we are proposing to address the issue of independence. We are not taking it right back to the board approach, but we are seeking to make amendments that give the body a bit more independence and do not require the ministerial council to sign off on the strategy. It would require the agency to draft up the strategy and the operational plan and present those to the ministerial council. It would allow the minister to request for changes to be made, but it would not give the minister permission for the final sign off. That is an attempt to ensure that we do not yet again go back to the lowest common denominator—which, unfortunately, we have seen far too much of in a whole variety of areas, and water is an absolute classic example of that.
The changes the Greens are proposing will make a significant difference to the way the Preventative Health Agency carries out its work. The changes will make the agency much more independent and give it the capacity to deliver stronger and more effective strategies to address preventative health. We believe the agency should have an increasing budget into the future, so that as it builds up its evidence base and its strategies, working across state and territories, it will be able to deliver strong and effective programs.
We are also concerned that the way the bill has been drafted gives the CEO, rather than the agency itself, objectives to implement. We are circulating amendments that address the issue of objectives for the agency. The agency itself does not have objectives. We believe it would be more appropriate for the agency to have objectives that it is supposed to achieve, as that is the reason for the existence for the agency in the first place. We also believe that there need to be consumer representatives on the advisory council. They are a key part of the preventative health strategy and it should be specified that they be on the advisory body. We are moving some amendments that would require at least two, and a maximum of three, consumer representatives on the body.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2009-10-27,"—I rise tonight to speak on National Seniors Week and specifically on the importance of our senior citizens in the community. National Seniors Week is a chance for our seniors to enjoy themselves, to find new hobbies and to learn new skills. It is an opportunity for them to join together to share their experiences and meet different people. For the younger people in the community, it is a great time to show elderly parents, grandparents, neighbours and friends that they really appreciate them.
This year I celebrated National Seniors Week in a couple of ways. Firstly, I held an afternoon tea in my office, to which local seniors from the Kingborough Bowls Club were invited. It was an opportunity for the bowling comrades to catch up away from the green and a good way for my staff and me to get to know more members of the community. A very enjoyable afternoon was had by all. There was a lot of laughter and jocularity, but there was also a serious side to the event and that was the opportunity it gave me to thank those members of the community that attended for the hard work that they put into the community.
I also marked the occasion by attending an afternoon tea hosted by the Huon Valley Council. This event was also attended by the Deputy Premier of Tasmania, Lara Giddings, and the state member for Franklin, Daniel Hume, and included entertainment by Victorian entertainer of the year Rodney Vincent. Mr Vincent, who was part of In Melbourne Tonight with Bert Newton and Graham Kennedy, told jokes and stories and sang a mixture of songs. Some of these were older but others were quite well-known more modern tunes. People joined in and sang along. There were over a hundred people in attendance. I put on the record my thanks to the Huon Valley Council for hosting this event and for bringing so many members of the community together. The Huon Valley is in a regional area of southern Tasmania, so all those people appreciated being brought together.
In my home state of Tasmania, the theme for National Seniors Week this year was ‘A colourful week to be grey’ and it was officially held between 1 and 7 October. The 2006 census registered 97,051 people in Tasmania who were 60 years of age or older. That amounted to a bit over 20 per cent of the state’s population, and I imagine that that figure has increased quite significantly since then. Across Tasmania, there were over 360 events listed for the week and there was something for everyone to participate in. Just some of the events that seniors could partake of included taking a line dancing class, learning about powers of attorney, taking a river cruise, learning how to use a computer, going for a swim, attending a driving seminar and watching a movie. Many events were free, while others were available for a substantially reduced entry fee. I thank all the sponsors of Seniors Week in Tasmania and the Tasmanian government for their support and input into Seniors Week in Tasmania. As I said, I also thank the many and varied organisations that facilitated the event for those seniors.
It is important to note that senior citizens have contributed much to Australia over the course of their lives, and that they are still contributing every day. They have worked hard and paid taxes. They have served the nation at war. They have raised children and in some cases have raised their grandchildren, and they continue to do so. Many have been foster parents. They have made laws in our parliaments and saved lives in our hospitals. They have helped other elderly people who are not as healthy as they are. Many are still active as volunteers, and I note here my own parents, who are in their 80s and who still volunteer two or three days a week in community organisations and an aged-care facility. They are involved in many clubs, choirs and community organisations. I nearly have to make an appointment to catch up with them when I am home. Seniors have done all these things, and continue to do so, because they want to help others and because they know they have something to offer the broader community. And our seniors certainly do have much to offer younger people. We can all learn a great deal from those who have more life experience than we do. While searching on the internet, I found a quote by Andy Rooney. He said, ‘The best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.’ How true that is.
Not only can we learn from the more senior members of our community, we should also be inspired by them. For example, in Tasmania we are undergoing local government elections and there is actually someone 81 years of age, an ex-serviceman, standing at this month’s Waratah-Wynyard local government elections. Then we had the World Masters Games in Sydney. The games had a shot-putter who was 100, a sprinter who was 90 and a swimmer who was missing a leg from a shark attack over three decades ago. Canadian Olga Kotelko, aged 90, won both the 100 metre sprint and the shot-put in her age group. Her shot-put was a world record. Olga proudly stated, ‘There was no-one else my age, but it felt really good and I’m quite pleased.’ Australian competitor Carl Herbert, who is 69, decided to walk from Gympie to Sydney as a warm-up for his events. That is 1,100 kilometres. What an inspiring group of people.
Our seniors deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. They often lose much of what they took for granted when they were younger. Their hearing might fade, their vision may deteriorate and they may walk slower or suffer from Alzheimer’s, dementia or other health problems. Or, indeed, they may be very physically fit and healthy but they may struggle adapting to life once they retire from the workforce. Equally, they may continue to throw themselves into life at full speed by taking up new hobbies or volunteer work. Seniors may have family to help them but sometimes they are completely on their own. Seniors, like any other group, should not be pigeonholed. They are all individuals and should be treated as such. So, what can be done to help the seniors around us? It might just be that you say hello to an elderly person at the letterbox as you are walking down the street. A quick word and a smile just might make their day. You might offer to help around the house or in the garden. Maybe they do not drive any more and need someone to take them to the doctor. It does not have to be a huge gesture. Like most people, they will appreciate whatever you do for them.
We all know that the Rudd government believe in a socially inclusive community and values equally all sectors of the community. As part of this belief, the government are doing everything possible to help the aged community. Firstly, we have recognised the work of the former Howard government in establishing the position of Minister for Ageing. We kept this ministry because it is essential to ensure that our senior citizens get the attention they deserve. We have increased the pension for all categories. This means that it is not only age pensioners who are receiving more. It means people who are seniors, but not yet old enough for the age pension, are getting an increase as part of whichever pension they are on. We have introduced the work bonus for age pensioners who have some form of income. We have introduced the pension supplement, which consists of a variety of payments that were previously paid in quarterly instalments. The pension supplement includes the telephone, utilities and pharmaceutical allowances and the GST supplement and is paid fortnightly. This will obviously help people with their budgeting.
Care of our seniors is an area of great importance and, like all areas of the health system, the aged-care sector is being considered as part of the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission. The Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Justine Elliot, states:
It is important that the health, hospitals and aged care systems work together to meet the care needs of older Australians in an affordable, accessible and sustainable way …
With more than 900,000 older Australians either in residential care or receiving help in their own home, it is essential we have the most efficient and effective system possible. The Rudd government is investing $19 million in an aged-care training package that is designed to create up to 4,600 new places in the aged- and community-care sectors. And, with Australians now having the longest life expectancy in the English-speaking world, we are responding to the challenges of our nation’s ageing population. In my home state of Tasmania, the Bartlett government also recognises the need to give seniors as much support as possible. The state government continues to fund pensioner discounts as part of the new water and sewerage billing process that is underway there.
Our senior citizens are an important part of our life. They have contributed much to our society and we must always remember that. National Seniors Week, as I said, was a chance for the older members of the community to come together, celebrate their lives—(Time expired)

Expenditure on hospitality between 24 November 2007 and 30 June 2009 totalled $55,283.51 (refer Attachment A).
Answering this question would result in a considerable diversion of resources as the level of analysis required would necessitate recourse to staff located at numerous sites across Australia.
