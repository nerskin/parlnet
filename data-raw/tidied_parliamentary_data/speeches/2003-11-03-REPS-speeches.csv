"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to East Timor, 3 to 5 September 2003. It was a great privilege to be the deputy leader and to be part of the first official parliamentary delegation to East Timor since independence. We were honoured by the extraordinary sitting of East Timor's national parliament. Although parliament was technically in recess, over 50 parliamentarians came and shared the day with us and showed us over the new house of parliament, which was built as a gift from Australia to the world's newest democracy. The dialogues that were held concentrated on the political and economic future of the country. The president, Xanana Gusmao, was most gracious and hospitable in inviting the delegation to his office, which is in a burnt-out building and has been only marginally tidied up. Living and working in the same conditions as his people showed he has an affinity with the past as well as is looking with them to future. He is obviously very much loved by his people.
The country is still in a very raw state; things are taking time to rebuild and redevelop, including the infrastructure and the culture. There is a need to build East Timor's institutions and self-reliance to bring the country's skills up to a level where it can be autonomous. There was some concern shown for the impending withdrawal of the UN Mission of Support because of the state of transition, but it is hoped that East Timor will be able to have more extended assistance to allow the easing out of UNIMET and the support for the local institutions to take over. 
So much is still to be done. There is still a culture of dependence—the entrepreneurial spirit is missing. Agriculture, which is so vital to East Timor's economy, is still really at a subsistence level. Maize, cassava, rice and sweet potatoes dominate, although some coffee is again being developed as a cash crop. There are still concerns about food security, and farmers would benefit from some exchange programs and exposure to new methods of farming—for example, we saw the amount of rice that is lost during processing. Several rice and seed trials are under way with Australian input, which we hope will increase productivity. Although the country has taken huge steps since 1999, we were concerned about the level of support that will be provided after the withdrawal of the UN. It is clear that ongoing assistance will be needed from Australia to help East Timor continue its leap into the 21st century.
Our visit also included an inspection of the Australian Defence Force contingent, which had us visiting the base in Dili as well as the forward operating bases at Moleana, Maliana and Junction Point Alpha. I must say that I was very impressed with the friendliness yet complete professionalism of our young men and women over there. The forward bases are fairly basic, yet there is an enormous amount of enthusiasm shown for the job that is being done. The success of the Australian contingent in East Timor is a testament to the professionalism and the training of these troops. With the UN leaving in 2004, the delegation felt that there was room for an expanded effort in the areas of public information—such as information gathering—capacity building and community liaison.
There were also a number of visits to community projects, which had us pitching over some very basic road infrastructure—luckily there was not a lot of traffic around, otherwise it would have been much worse. We were greeted very cordially by villagers. We saw young ones being schooled in the dances of their country and they accompanied themselves on local percussion instruments. It was noted that there is a need to assist East Timor in recapturing their culture, particularly given East Timor's history of colonisation and occupation. It is a young nation: approximately 50 per cent of the pop-ulation are under 25 years of age. Recapturing culture will be crucial to building the nation's consciousness and effective community development.  
I would like to thank the embassy staff in Dili, particularly those who organised the visits outside the normal program, which included visits to the orphanage, the memorial swimming pool at Dara and the Street Children's Art school. Thanks also to our hosts, the East Timorese, who were very patient and understanding in answering all our questions. I would also like to thank Adam Cunningham and my two colleagues Bill and Peter.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—I thank my colleagues Bill Heffernan and Dick Adams, and I pay tribute to committee secretary Adam Cunningham, who did an excellent job, and to Australian Ambassador Paul Foley and his staff, who organised the delegation and this program so very capably. Mr Speaker, you will be heartened to know that Australia is highly regarded in East Timor, which is actually called Timor Leste. We are certainly not forgotten for the wonderful work that we did in East Timor's hour of need. I was there in 1999, just a month or so after Australia went to the aid of the East Timorese. I saw the terrible devastation right across the country and I saw how the people had been so badly affected. But it was a joy to go back in 2003 not so long ago and see how life has returned and to see the happiness of the people of East Timor—how they have progressed and how they are rebuilding their country. It is terrific.
But East Timor is still a fragile country. It is still in danger of not being able to organise its economy properly. Just last year 40 per cent of the entire rice crop—the entire rice production of the country—was lost. It was lost because there is no marketing and distribution system in the country to get that rice off to market to get it to consumers. Also a significant problem is that there is no middle management ability in the country. You have people who are very good thinkers, like Prime Minister Alkatiri and President Xanana Gusmao, but you do not have the people in between to do the organisation and to make sure the place runs properly. For example, we went to the emergency department at Dili Hospital and one of the doctors said to me, `We don't have any thermometers in the emergency department.' I immediately thought, `I'll get a Rotary club in Australia to send over a box of thermometers.' They said: `No, that is not the problem. We have got the money; it is just that someone has forgotten to order them.' That is the kind of fundamental management issue that is seen right across the economy in East Timor.
Australia can help in relation to the commercial opportunities that are there—for example, the supply and distribution of fuel. Australia's very good overseas aid program is helping the farmers to understand how to better produce their products and to get them to market. It can help them with management issues.
Mr Speaker, you might be interested to know that members of parliament in East Timor do not have an office. Their office is actually in the parliament itself. They have at their desks all their resources to carry out their parliamentary duties—that is, all the papers, correspondence and whatever. Members of parliament come into the parliament and do their work at their desks. They still do not have any telecommunications infrastructure, there is no IT and there are no computers; there are none of the facilities that we have as members of parliament to help us in the discharge of our duties. If you are lucky to have an email address as a member of parliament in East Timor, it might be at Yahoo or Hotmail. It is not a government email address. But to their very great credit they run a credible parliament. Their Speaker runs the parliament as our parliament is run, due respect is shown to the parliamentary process and they are doing very well indeed. 
I would also like to echo the member for Lyons' comments about the members of the Australian Defence Force we met at the Australian national command centre and also out in the field at Moleana, Maliana and Junction Point Alpha. Principally the members of the Defence Force were from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment based in Townsville. We met Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Smith, a very capable leader who, one day perhaps—and I hope this does not affect his career—might be Chief of the Defence Force. He has that capability. He is highly regarded not only by the people who work for him but also by the Australian Defence Force itself. Those people are extraordinarily professional. They do Australia proud in what they do in their overseas deployments. They do it to help the people of East Timor, and they have done a mighty job. Congratulations to the members of the Australian Defence Force who so capably have represented Australia. (Time expired)

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I present the Commonwealth Land at Point Nepean, Victoria Bill 2003. I am today introducing a private member's bill which would transfer all of the Department of Defence land at Point Nepean in Victoria to the Victorian government, without charge, on the proviso that the Victorian government maintains this land in perpetuity as a national park and is responsible for its ongoing maintenance. The Victorian government in turn has made abundantly clear its willingness to do these things.
One of federal Labor's environmental policies and commitments is to hand over the land at Point Nepean as a national park. This should not be a controversial issue. I am amazed that the federal government has not done this. I expected all along that the federal government would bow to public opinion on this issue, but I reckoned without their arrogance and cockiness. Their view is that they are so far in front that they do not need to worry about public opinion. Public opinion in Victoria, which the Liberal Party is wilfully refusing to listen to, could not be plainer. Over 9,000 Victorians signed a petition calling for all of Point Nepean to become a national park, and 400 Victorian community groups have signed a community consensus statement saying that the entire site should be national park under one management and rejecting the federal government's plan for a 50-year lease to private developers. 
The community's opposition to the federal government's plan could not be plainer. But instead of listening to that opposition, the Liberal Party and the member for Flinders have sought to pretend that the government is protecting Point Nepean when it is manifestly handing over key sections of it for commercial development. For example, the Liberal member for Flinders put out a taxpayer funded brochure to all Flinders residents, under the heading `Point Nepean not for sale', which said:
The last 85 hectares of Pt Nepean will not be sold but will be given to Parks Australia which runs Kakadu and Uluru National Parks ...
That was, and is, utterly wrong. Parks Australia will have no role in the management of the 85 hectares. The landlord will be the Department of Defence, and the tenant will be a consortium which includes the Queensland property developer FKP Ltd. But the member for Flinders has been so anxious to look on the bright side of this terrible performance by the Howard government and so anxious to put the Liberal government's case to the Mornington Peninsula people rather than put the Mornington Peninsula's case to the government that he rushed into print, at great taxpayer expense, with this nonsense. The member for Flinders throughout this issue has fundamentally misunderstood his role. It is to represent the Mornington Peninsula in Canberra; it is not to represent the Liberal Party on the Mornington Peninsula. He misled the House with this untrue claim and misled every household in his electorate.
The Victorian Labor government has been endeavouring all along to see this land preserved forever as national park. Last week it wrote to the member for McEwen, who as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence has been responsible for the Point Nepean fiasco, indicating that the developers will have to get a planning permit if they want to engage in building or demolition works. This is a good thing. The Queensland property developer FKP Ltd, which is leading the consortium which the government has given this 40-year lease to, has been prosecuted for illegally felling trees and destroying vegetation. It was fined $4,000 by Maroondah council after chopping down gums and failing to protect other trees on a Croydon building site in January this year. It has also been guilty of clearing rare coastal bushland in the shire of Maroochy in Queensland. It is just not good enough to allow a group with such a record to access areas adjacent to rare coastal tea-tree or moonah woodland. The ancient moonah woodlands on Point Nepean have been heritage listed.
This issue demonstrates clearly the fundamental difference between Liberal and Labor on environmental issues. When you see a thing of beauty, do you cherish it and protect it, or do you try to make a quid out of it and profit from it? The Liberals invariably do the latter. They just cannot help themselves. Originally they wanted to sell it all. Since then, under pressure from the public, they have done backflip after backflip but still cannot bring themselves to do the decent thing. Today is their chance to do the right thing, support my private member's bill and protect Point Nepean for all Victorians—not just the few—for all time. It is high time the federal government cut through their veil of secrecy surrounding the leasing process by providing full public disclosure of all the bids for Point Nepean so we can discover whether the FKP lessee disclosed these previous environmental breaches.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the efforts of the personnel of the RAAF Contingent Ubon who served in Thailand during the Vietnam War;
(2)	acknowledges that these personnel were assigned to provide support operations in Ubon post-June 1965 by the Joint Planning Committee Report 110/1964;
(3)	acknowledges this directly affected the Vietnam War in that they provided air and ground defence of the Royal Thai Air Force Base and all assets and installations the United States Air Force (USAF) collocated on the base whilst the USAF 8th Tactical Fighter Wing undertook combat operations into North Vietnam and Laos;
(4)	acknowledges that the RAAF 79(F) Squadron were on “Alert 5” status and provided CAP operations in Ubon;
(5)	acknowledges that whilst the RAAF servicemen were assigned to the command and control of the USAF 7th Air Force in Vietnam, they remained under Australian control; and
(6)	recognises the efforts of those who served in Ubon by the way of the award of the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal (VLSM) to be worn by the amendment of the “Area of Operations” for the Vietnam War effort and by the amendment of the reg-ulations governing the issue of the VLSM.
Today I would like to recognise the efforts of personnel of the RAAF Contingent Ubon who served in Thailand during the Vietnam War. This particular group of veterans is seeking parity with other Australian Defence Force personnel under our system of honours and awards, with its claim that the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal is the appropriate campaign medal for their direct support operational service during the Vietnam War.
The principles that govern awards are often longstanding but were articulated comprehensively and put in place by the CIDA review under the then Labor government in 1993-94 and have been subsequently supported by the current government. The then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator John Faulkner, in 1994 signed the gazettal notice that prescribed the eligibility for the Vietnam Logistic Support Medal. Notably that eligibility was not extended to those posted at RAAF Ubon.
I firstly say thank you to Mark Stockton from my electorate, who is present in the gallery today, whom I have been working with on this matter. Mark has kindly shared his experiences with me about his service. This motion today is to acknowledge that these personnel were assigned to provide support operations in Ubon post June 1965 by the joint planning committee report 110/1964. It is to acknowledge that this directly affected the Vietnam War in that they provided air and ground defence of the Royal Thai Air Force base and all assets and installations of the United States Air Force on the base whilst the US Air Force 8th Tactical Fighter Wing undertook combat operations into North Vietnam and Laos.
It acknowledges that the RAAF 79(F) Squadron were on `alert 5' status and provided CAP operations in Ubon. It acknowledges that, while the RAAF servicemen were assigned to the command and control of the US Air Force's 7th Air Force in Vietnam, they remained under Australian control. To recognise the efforts of those who served in Ubon by way of the awarding of the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal, there need to be amendments to the `area of operations' for the Vietnam war effort and amendment of what governs the issue of the medal itself. 
One of the arguments for the awarding of this medal put forward by some of the veterans who participated in Ubon is that, although they were based in Thailand, their actions were directly related to the conflict in Vietnam. In support of their case, they have compiled a range of information relating to their roles during the war. I will go through some of those now. On 25 November 1964, the US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, stated:
If it were necessary to apply increased pressure on North Vietnam by way of participating in these attacks, it would be very helpful for the United States to have Australian aircraft either participating in these attacks or standing by to protect Thailand, Laos and South Vietnam against expected counter attacks.
Some veterans say that this was a precursor to their direct support of the Vietnam War effort. Following this statement, the US Air Force commenced Operation Rolling Thunder from bases within Thailand and this led to the `alert 5' task undertaken by the RAAF Sabres at Ubon. From April 1965, the first US Air Forces F4 aircraft arrived at Ubon, and that force built up to over 75 aircraft by the end of 1968.
In June 1965 a conference between the US Air Force and the RAAF at Ubon agreed that the RAAF Sabres would undertake the `alert 5' task to protect the Ubon base. The use of force and the protection of forces within Thailand were authorised. This included the protection of US Air Force personnel within Thailand involved in the Vietnam War. Some veterans of Ubon say the role of the ground based defence could not be misconstrued as air defence of Thailand but in fact was in direct support of action being undertaken in Vietnam. They also say that the RAAF at Ubon were included in the mainland South-East Asia air defence system as the Vietnam War escalated and air defence became increasingly important, and that all of South-East Asia was joined into one fully integrated air defence system for the Vietnam War area.
I have spoken to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence about this matter and he has agreed to take a look at the case put forward by veterans of Ubon. The minister has indicated that he will invite the RAAF Ubon Reunion-Recognition Group to a meeting with him and the Directorate of Honours and Awards so that respective information sets can be reconciled. The minister is very willing to consider any new information, particularly information which supports a claim that RAAF Ubon aircraft were tasked to support the Australian national effort in Vietnam or that personnel were required by government policy to directly support the Vietnam effort. I thank him for that, and I am sure the personnel who served in Ubon will thank him as well.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I am happy to second the motion. I have some support for the motion, and I compliment the member on bringing the motion forward just as I compliment the Ubon medal group who have fought a very long and protracted campaign to have their claims recognised. I might say at the outset that the position of the ALP is today what it was under previous shadow spokespersons Chris Schacht and Laurie Ferguson, both of whom were very sympathetic to the Ubon group. I am pleased to see that the incoming minister has adopted a more responsible and reasoned position to this claim than his predecessor. The group says:
The claim made by ex RAAF personnel who served at the Royal Thai Air Force Base, Ubon Thailand from 25.6.1965 to 31.8.1968 is that their service was a `direct support' role of the Vietnam War effort, undertaken within Australia's `concept of operations' for that war effort! This service to Australia has, so far, gone unrecognised as such and must so be recognised to rectify Australia's military history of the overall Vietnam War effort. 
The incoming minister has said that he is prepared to meet with this group. He rang me today and told me what he was prepared to do, and I indicated support for that process. I must say that this contrasts dramatically with the very, very shabby way in which the previous minister—the recently sacked `minister for medals', as she described herself—treated this particular group of veterans.
The other thing that I think must be taken into account is the very strong support that this group has received from Rear Admiral Kennedy. I know that Rear Admiral Kennedy wrote to both Minister Scott and Minister Vale, giving very, very strong support to this claim. In the letter that Rear Admiral Kennedy wrote to Danna Vale in April 2002 he said:
In 1999 I was chosen by Minister Bruce Scott, your predecessor, to assist Mr Justice Mohr in the Review of Service Entitlement Anomalies in respect of South East Asian Service 1955-1975.
I will not read all of the letter, but he went on to say:
I thus became convinced that RAAF service from June 1965 on was in direct support of the Vietnam War and Justice Mohr supported this. Failure to recognise correctly this service is a real injustice.
I find it impossible to understand how the previous minister could come into this House and argue that the Ubon group was in Thailand to help defend Thailand—that is rubbish! The Ubon group was in Thailand to support the Vietnam War. As far as I am concerned, they are entitled to the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. I have a further letter from Rear Admiral Kennedy, who after writing to the minister in April wrote to her again on 21 September, saying:
Dear Minister,
I wrote to you more than four months ago asking you to look again at the RAAF UBON Anomaly. When may I expect the courtesy of a reply?
Well, it appears that that courtesy was never extended to Rear Admiral Kennedy or to the Ubon group. I simply say this: it is time that we dealt with this issue. There is a solid claim to, in the words of the motion moved by the member:
... recognise ... the efforts of those who served in Ubon by the way of the award of the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal ...
These blokes went away from home, they supported the effort in Vietnam, and I think they have a very, very good case for the recognition of that service by way of this medal.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Defence: Royal Australian Air Force Contingent Ubon</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—I am pleased to rise today in support of the private member's motion by Mr Bob Baldwin, member for Paterson, to ask the government to fully investigate all new evidence to support the issue of the VLS Medal to the Royal Australian Air Force—RAAF—personnel who served in Ubon in Thailand during the Vietnam War. I thank the member for Paterson for moving this motion to recognise their contribution.
I would also like to acknowledge Mr Mal Barnes, who lives in my electorate, for his dedication and persistence to ensuring that the personnel receive their correct recognition, based on new evidence. Mal has stated that, with the new evidence provided, he will not let this matter rest until they receive their fair hearing based on this new evidence. I have no doubt in my mind that Mal will keep his word to continue fighting for a fair hearing.
I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Royal Australian Air Force personnel who served in Ubon. The Royal Australian Air Force deployed personnel to Ubon from 1965 to 1968 after receiving a request from US President Johnson for Australian assistance and support in the lead-up to the Vietnam War. In response to the President's request, the joint planning committee, in conjunction with the joint intelligence committee, reported to the government on the Australian Defence Force and the possible Australian contribution to phase 2 operations in the Vietnam War. Both the defence committee and the chiefs of staff committee then endorsed the report. However, the RAAF Ubon Reunion Recognition Group have advised me that there were three contribution aspects of the Australian Defence Force service mentioned in this report: firstly, the Army and sending a battalion; secondly the Navy and the use of HMAS Sydney and escort vessels; and thirdly the Air Force. 
The report stated:
The scale of air effort currently suggested indicates that this is well within the capacity of the United States air forces and naval air units in the area. The possible use of Sabres at Ubon has been raised and with a small increase in manpower they could be employed in the `air defence role' at a high state of alert.
The report also went on to say that if the squadron were not required in the air defence role it then could participate in operations, including ground attack over the whole area of Laos and North Vietnam, as envisaged in the United States proposals.
This RAAF `direct support' contribution, which was conceived in exactly the same instrument that authorised other Australian Defence Force contributions to the war effort, for military purposes is a `Vietnam War contribution', even if it was undertaken in Ubon in Thailand and not in Vietnam. Although the RAAF were not in Vietnam and were based in Ubon, they state they still provided air and ground defence at the Royal Thai Air Force Base as well as protecting all assets and installations of the United States Air Force whilst the United States Air Force 8th Tactical Fighter Wing undertook combat operations in North Vietnam and Laos. The Ubon personnel stated that they were on standby, should it be necessary to apply increased pressure on North Vietnam by way of air attack. They were advised by the US that it would be helpful to have Australian aircraft either participating in these attacks or on standby to protect Thailand, Laos and South Vietnam against counterattacks.
On several occasions the United States Air Force requested the `use' of RAAF Sabres in Laos for various operations. Trials of long-range fuel tanks and the fitting of United States Air Force bombs were undertaken at Ubon. The United States Air Force were given command control of the Ubon contingent and they were the ones who released them from alert status. The reunion group claim that the Alert 5 air defence role continued from 25 June 1965 until their withdrawal in 1968 and they performed exactly the same role as the RAAF's F18 fighters. That role was the protection of coalition forces assets whilst they engaged the enemy.
It is interesting to note that the HMAS Sydney veterans who were also deployed under the same instructions as the RAAF Ubon personnel were acknowledged and given the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal and received royal assent on 24th February 1993. The RAAF Ubon veterans have advised me that had they known about the JPC report 110/1964, the report that was instrumental in HMAS Sydney veterans receiving their medals, and the report that authorised Ubon's role conjointly with HMAS Sydney's role, they would have `joined the fight' back in 1991 and would have had this anomaly rectified. Unfortunately, the Ubon veterans only recovered the JPC report in 2002. The RAAF Ubon Reunion Recognition Group have spent many years investigating their case and pleading it to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence and they have provided all evidence to support their claim. I am pleased to acknowledge Minister Brough's indication that he is willing to organise a roundtable discussion.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I certainly put on the record my appreciation of the member for Paterson's raising this matter. It certainly represents a very studied rebuke to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I am genuinely pleased today that Minister Brough has determined that there should be a roundtable discussion of these matters. They have been on the public agenda for quite a while. A series of other inquiries into this matter have failed to come up with the rational, logical conclusion that this service was as the campaigners claim. In my period in the portfolio I had a significant number of discussions with Mal Barnes, Richard Stone, Michael Morrissey and other Ubon veterans. I have to say that they have displayed a degree of analysis and work that should not merit the reported tantrum that the minister put on in the office of the member for Forde. It certainly would represent a very sorry state of affairs that people who think they have a legitimate grievance, think they have some rights and think that their service should be recognised were treated in such a fashion.
I have supported this campaign for the personnel who served at Ubon, Thailand, from 1962 to 1968, during an earlier part of the Vietnam War. I well recall that in 1997 the member for Mackellar, who was the then minister, sought to continue the fiction that our personnel were at Ubon `pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam War'. That was her comment on 13 February 1997, in an attempt to stonewall these people's rights. That laughable claim was demolished by the release of declassified United States military documents. These documents freely acknowledge that the US tactical control force in Thailand, with which the RAAF Ubon contingent was connected, was `assigned to the tactical air support group in Vietnam' and formed part of the South-East Asia Integrated Tactical Air Control System, which controlled strategic air operations. These operations included, of course, Operation Rolling Thunder, which involved the saturation bombing of Vietnamese National Liberation Front and Pathet Lao positions and supply lines.
Only diehard, self-interested partisans now deny that the real task of the RAAF Ubon deployment was to provide air and ground defence for US aircraft and personnel engaged in missions that originated from Thai soil. The SEATO `cover' was a ruse to deny the true nature of those operations, which were under American rather than Thai control. The fact that RAAF personnel were directed to remain in Thai airspace—and the opposition has always freely acknowledged that they were—does not detract from this reality. 
Since 1997, when I first publicly supported the Ubon cause, their position has been considered by two service entitlement reviews that the government was forced to commission—and I mean forced, because of the pressure of these groups—namely, the 1999 Mohr review and the 2002 independent review of veterans' entitlements chaired by Justice Clarke. As a result they obtained repatriation pension rights and upgraded medal entitlements. Significantly, these acknowledge that RAAF operations at Ubon assumed a warlike nature from June 1965, when the original rules of engagement, which basically restricted the use of force to cases of self-defence, were revised.
The Ubon personnel continue campaigning for access to the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal, the VLSM. Once again they have hit a brick wall with the coalition over recent months. It seems that the coalition are still reluctant to acknowledge the inextricable link between operations at Ubon and the Vietnam War. That is what the resistance to this medal is all about. Following the earlier reviews, the government are happy to concede that service at Ubon after June 1965 was `warlike' but they refuse to mention just which war was involved. Do they suggest that Thailand was under direct military attack between 1965 and 1968? Of course they do not. The truth is that Ubon was all about the Vietnam War, and their medal should acknowledge this fact. 
In conclusion I again commend the initiative in bringing this matter forward. I hope that the pressure by the member for Paterson, members of the opposition and the service community is successful. I totally repudiate the minister's recent outburst in this House when she tried to say that giving these people their rights somehow besmirched or downgraded the Vietnam veterans who died in Vietnam. That is a total fallacy and I repudiate it totally.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Defence: Royal Australian Air Force Contingent Ubon</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2003-11-03,"—It might very well be asked why the Labor Party, the opposition in this case, did not change this issue in the 13 years of their rule, particularly in 1993 when we saw the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal regulations declaration come out, signed under Senator John Faulkner. It is very pertinent that this should have been rectified by them at the time. Not wanting to play politics, as others have in the House today, I want to merely look at the issues associated with the member for Paterson's motion. I think he needs to be commended on putting this motion forward.
I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by our defence forces during the Vietnam War and the sacrifices made by our servicemen. I personally believe that all those who offer their services and who are deployed overseas in any battle—even in the earlier wars on Australian shores—need recognition and are entitled to recognition. Such recognition should be given to the people who served in Ubon. I certainly welcome the minister's offer to have discussions with the RAAF Ubon Reunion Recognition Group because I think this is one step forward to certainly overcoming some of the issues of recognition that the RAAF Ubon Reunion Recognition Group would like to see resolved. Also, I welcome the fact that the Ubon people will get, hopefully, a formal briefing on what information was particularly at hand in determining entitlement for the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal, and also on the assessment process that took place with respect to Ubon. It is my understanding that the minister is very willing to consider any new information, particularly any information which supports the claim that RAAF Ubon aircraft were tasked to support the Australian national effort in Vietnam or that personnel were required by government policy to directly support the Vietnam effort.
My electorate of Riverina is home to all three arms of the Australian defence forces and I am extremely proud to represent the many dedicated service men and women who live and work on our bases. Of course, many of the people who served in Ubon clearly would have trained at RAAF Base Wagga Wagga. Just recently I spent some time with Dr Peter Ilbery at the Uranquinty recognition memorial day discussing what role Uranquinty played in the Second World War. I think it is most important to bring this to the table, simply because it is the recognition that Dr Ilbery wanted and has received for the way in which Uranquinty was part of the process and for how it fared in the training of pilots who served overseas. It is a very proud day and a very proud moment for these people. What you see here is a sense of pride, a sense of wanting to be recognised as having served and having been served in this process in Ubon, and a desire for that to be recognised with a medal, and I think that is most important. I understand those feelings because, having a service base in my electorate, I find that I have all of these representations constantly. RAAF Base Wagga Wagga is home to a large section of our defence community. It is one of the city's largest employers, with around 1,200 personnel working, studying, socialising and living at RAAF Base Wagga Wagga. It is the largest ground training base in the RAAF, and support and training activities are carried out on the base. 
The issue that I particularly want to raise is the support that the member for Paterson has provided to the Ubon service. He has brought this issue to the table in fairness and in decency, and the minister has responded to the member Paterson. To his credit, he has gained an enormous amount of latitude with respect to trying to finally put this issue to rest after all of these years—something, as I said, that any other government at the time could have done many years ago. Again, I commend the member Paterson on what he has been able to achieve in bringing recognition to the plight of those people.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I, too, want to rise and speak on the motion moved by the honourable member for Paterson and thank him for bringing the issue before the House. You will note that all speakers have spoken in favour of his resolution. I say generally that as a nation we have not treated Vietnam veterans well. I just remind the House that when we ask members of the armed services—whether they are in the Army, the Navy or the RAAF, and whether they are regulars, reserves or conscripts—to go, they actually do not get a choice as to whether or not they go. It is a fact that we should always value the service they render to the nation under the direction of the government of the day.
The member for Riverina raised the issue of why this was not fixed up under 13 years of Labor. I suppose it is a fair question, but it is also the case that additional information comes forward with the effluxion of time—particularly, there is additional information with records being declassified. I think it is quaint that we still have the concept that only those who are at the front line are involved in a war. Why would you put an Air Force base right at the front line? It makes quite some sense now that you should have aircraft, for example, operating and being based well away from the front line. There is no doubt that this was a front-line base. Aircraft were taking off three at a time, 24 hours a day, and the Australians and other service people at the base at Ubon had a price on their heads. The critical issue is that we can change the boundaries of what we define as the `area of operation'. There is no doubt that the United States Air Force believed that this was an `area of operation' in support of the war in Vietnam and operations in Laos, and I think Australians should do the same.
The other issue is that I want to thank Mal Brough for agreeing to see these veterans. I have no doubt that they will be well received and sympathetically heard, and all members on the Labor side have welcomed that initiative. Again, for the member for Riverina, it really does contrast with the meeting that Danna Vale had with the very same group of people. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Chifley will address members by their appropriate titles. 
—I will quote one of the participants at that meeting, who said: 
The RAAF Ubon Group was meeting to provide the Minister with more irrefutable evidence about their long outstanding anomaly claim for Vietnam War recognition. The meeting took place in the office of the Member for Forde, Kay Elson MP. 
She also spoke on this motion. The quote continues:
Kay too was stunned: “The Minister took objection to the fact that we pointed out untruths, bias and plain lies in recent correspondence received from the Minister and her advisers.” Mal Barnes pointed out: “She stood up, shouted and directed verbal abuse at me whilst I remained seated in a chair. She was off her tree. It left me shell-shocked! In all my years in commerce, I have never been subjected to such inexcusable arrant insulting behaviour from a person of high office, her conduct at this meeting was nothing short of preposterous and most certainly not that of a Minister—
—The member for Chifley is getting very close to flouting the standing orders here. If you want to attack a member, you should do it by a substantive motion. 
—These are not my words. 
—I still say that you are running very close to flouting the standing orders.
—That is an interesting interpretation, but I will accept your ruling. All I can say in fairness to the minister is that I believe that behaviour was out of character, but I still think it was totally unacceptable. It was embarrassing to the member for Forde, Kay Elson, and I find it totally embarrassing. I want to reiterate that I have every confidence in Mal Brough. I believe that this motion has assisted in facilitating the meeting, and I thank the member for Paterson for moving it. Like all other speakers, I hope there will be a satisfactory resolution of what appears to be, on prima facie evidence, a longstanding injustice to a group of Vietnam War veterans. (Time expired)

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—Last week the Senate Select Committee on Medicare delivered their inquiry report and put forward their proposals to address the crisis in health care. These bright sparks came up with a plan to increase the private health insurance rebate to 40 per cent a proposal that, despite being hosed down very quickly by the government, once again shows just how out of touch many government members and senators are with what the public actually want in their public health care system. It is no wonder the Treasurer put a very quick stop to this bright little idea because an increase to the private health insurance rebate would cost $800 million. So how could we actually use $800 million effectively? Eight hundred million dollars would be a boost to the public health system struggling under this government's cuts, cuts that have cost the Tasmanian public health care system $40 million over five years and the national health care budget a billion dollars over five years. Eight hundred million dollars could be used to fund the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme, cut by this government, for another eight years. It is time this government faced up to the reality about public health care and started looking at realistic strategies to save the best health care system this country has ever had—Medicare.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Health: Funding</title>,Statements by Members,3,1,speech

How does the Prime Minister respond to the statement made by Mrs Russell in referring to his action, when she said:

I want to take the opportunity of saying that, whatever the circumstances of it, as the head of government, I accept responsibility as inevitably in these things the head of government must. I also take the opportunity of saying to the honourable gentleman that suggestions made in some newspaper articles—and, indeed, contained in a letter that he wrote to me—that the failure to invite her might have been in some way due to the fact that she had been critical of government policy in relation to benefits for the families of deceased Defence personnel have no substance of any kind—no substance at all. I can only say that I am profoundly sorry that it occurred. I apologise to the lady concerned. It was an inexcusable oversight, and I can assure the honourable member that, whatever the lead-up to it was, it was not malicious.

I have subsequently spoken to those people and there was no way in which there was going to be any disturbances within this House by those people.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	understands that Australians want decisions made on the basis of good policy and what is best for communities, not what suits the electoral pendulum;
(2)	affirms the need for an integrated approach to transport and urban development policy to tackle issues assoc-iated with the growth of our major cities;
(3)	recognises that cities need integrated transport and urban development policies involving all tiers of government and the community in the decision making process;
(4)	accepts that Labor has led the way on these important issues with the announcement of an integrated transport plan for Sydney; and
(5)	recognises that:
(a)	Labor will not build an airport at Badgery's Creek, nor will Labor sell the Sydney Basin airports in a cash grab that ignores community and aviation in-dust-ry views;
(b)	Labor understands that the growth ambitions of Sydney Airport are not acceptable and that a second Sydney airport is required; and
(c)	Badgery's Creek remains the Coalition's preferred site choice for a second Sydney airport.
This is a very important motion because it goes to honesty and integrity in decision making and the development of good public policy. It calls for an integrated approach to urban transport and urban development issues. It recognises that one cannot look at just one particular mode of transport; one needs to think holistically in terms of rail, road and air transport in the development of transport. I particularly want to read point (5) of the motion, which asks that the House recognise:
(a)	Labor will not build an airport at Badgery's Creek, nor will Labor sell the Sydney Basin airports in a cash grab that ignores community and aviation industry views;
(b)	Labor understands that the growth ambitions of Sydney Airport are not acceptable and that a second Sydney airport is required; and
(c)	Badgery's Creek remains the Coalition's preferred site choice for a second Sydney airport.
Accompanied, I might say, by the honourable member for Greenway and the honourable member for Fowler and others, in July Simon Crean at the Mount Druitt workers club—and I know that might be offensive to some coalition members but it is a great club with good membership—on that Sunday announced that Badgerys Creek was dead as far as Labor were concerned. We will not build Badgerys Creek, and that is a clear difference between the coalition and Labor. It is true to say that in the Mount Druitt St Mary's Star, the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, said: 
I think people have total confidence in me. Over the last eight years I have never changed my mind on Badgerys Creek. My record is solid.
Well, that is a fair statement, I guess. But the problem is that Jackie has not changed the mind of anyone else in the coalition. Be under no illusion. Joe Hockey, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, in a very courageous speech to the House on 20 August said:
The second point in relation to Sydney airport is that this government is committed to a second airport in Sydney.
This is the coalition! He went on:
Existing government policy is to commit to a second airport ... at Badgerys Creek—
the coalition are committed to Badgerys Creek—
with a review in 2005. That is the policy that we have had for the last two elections. That is the commitment that we have made, and that is our existing policy. It is a commitment to a second airport in the Sydney basin at Badgerys Creek, with a review of the need ... in 2005. That is the policy that we have had since the 1996 election, and it is entirely consistent with the fact that we legislated the cap of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport, that we legislated the curfew at Sydney airport and that, through legislation, we ensured that regional aircraft will be able to access Sydney airport.
That is a clear, unambiguous statement by, I might say, an acting cabinet minister at the time. And all I say is this: Labor in Western Sydney have made our position utterly clear on Badgerys Creek—we will not build it! And the member for Macquarie, the member for Macarthur, the member for Mitchell, the member for Lindsay and the member for Parramatta—these are the Western Sydney Liberal members—ought to be honest with the people of Western Sydney, just as Mr Hockey, the minister, has been honest with the people in this parliament, and say that the coalition is committed to building the airport. None of those members nor Jackie Kelly can change the coalition's mind. Their policy, by hook or by crook, is to build Badgerys Creek. If you want an airport in Western Sydney then you vote for one of the Liberal federal members in Western Sydney, but if you do not want an airport in Western Sydney—if you think Western Sydney should not have an airport—you have one clear choice come the next election: vote for a Labor person, because we will kill it stone dead.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—As a consistent and unequivocal opponent of the prospect of an airport at Badgerys Creek, I am grateful to the honourable member for the opportunity to say a few words on this to again restate my opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek. I find myself agreeing with at least one part of the honourable member's motion—the first part—which says:
... understands that Australians want decisions made on the basis of good policy and what is best for communities, not what suits the electoral pendulum ...
So I thought I would go back and check out the consistency of the member for Chifley in terms of what his comments about Badgerys Creek have been at different stages in the electoral pendulum. There has been a veritable goldmine of comments by the member for Chifley, and we could spend all day reading these. I thought I would remind the House of a few of those comments. On 31 May 1995 the member for Chifley said:
As far as western Sydney is concerned, I am delighted with the initiatives of the government in proposing that we should have an international airport at Badgerys Creek. 
Again on 31 May 1995, the member for Chifley said:
I do not apologise for advocating an airport—
at Badgerys Creek. He went on:
... the people of western Sydney ... are excited about the fact that jobs will be created. The airport will have a catalytic effect in the western suburbs of Sydney.
You are right there, Member for Chifley: it would have had a catalytic effect! On 18 October 1995 the member for Chifley said:
... I believe, to take up seriously the issue of the construction of a major airport at Badgerys Creek—something that I have been seeking for a long time.
And on we go. In June 1994 the member for Chifley spoke of the decision about Badgerys Creek. He said:
... the magnificence of the decision by the government and by the minister—
the then member for Kingsford-Smith. On the same day the member for Chifley said:
... this airport may very well be privately owned and run. I do not give a damn who owns it or who runs it, as long as it is in vicious competition with Kingsford Smith airport ...
These are all the gems from the member for Chifley regardless of the electoral pendulum—just based, I would imagine, on good policy. And then we have many of his colleagues reinforcing him in that. I will quote one from a couple of years ago. The member for Werriwa, again giving great credit to the member for Chifley, said on 28 March 2001:
I can remember WESROC convening meetings where my friend and colleague the member for Chifley would come along and advocate the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. Some people regard him as the father of the proposal—the person who put it on the agenda in a substantial way in Western Sydney ...
Well, we must wonder then what his commitment is to not responding to the electoral pendulum. There has been no consistency—it is absolute hypocrisy. Member for Chifley, while I respect a lot of your work in the electorate, I am afraid you do not have a leg to stand on on this particular issue. We have seen many others from the other side—the member for Grayndler, the member for Kingsford-Smith, the member for Watson, the member for Barton, the member for Lowe, the member for Werriwa and the member for Blaxland—all advocating strongly an international airport at Badgerys Creek. Are we to expect that somehow, suddenly, the Labor leopard has changed its spots? It would like to pretend that it has, but the evidence is clearly to the contrary. The message is clearly that Labor says one thing in opposition and does something to the contrary in government. Do not listen to what it says in opposition; look at what it did in government.
The other question is this: if Labor are canning the idea of Badgerys Creek, where are they going to put it? The bell has been rung on this one with ALP policy statement 071 in July this year and the Leader of the Opposition raising the possibility of Richmond as a site for another airport. I can make this very clear. I have news for the Leader of the Opposition: my constituents—constit-uents of Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains—will not allow the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to transfer their plans for Badgerys Creek from Badgerys Creek to Richmond for some cheap political gain dictated by the electoral pendulum.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—The member for Macquarie comes into the House and tells us what Labor and the member for Chifley have done in the past in relation to Badgerys Creek airport. But what he will not do is give a commitment that a Liberal government will never ever build Badgerys Creek. Instead, the Liberals want to give us Badgerys Creek on the never-never plan: they might build it one day but they do not know when. When you look at transport planning or the need for an integrated approach to transport and urban development, the last place to go would be to this government. When it comes to planning, this government has a golden rule. And what is that golden rule? Never make a decision today that you can put off until tomorrow. The one thing about this government that you can depend on is that it will avoid making decisions at any cost.  
Transport and urban development must be planned if we are to avoid the problems associated with the growth of our major cities. It requires looking ahead for decades at the impact on growth and planning now to meet those needs. But while this government thinks that it can put off until tomorrow what it should be doing today, businesses, government agencies and ordinary people need to plan their future with some degree of certainty. And there is no better example of this government's failure to commit to a plan than the tale of Badgerys Creek airport.
Who could forget—I am sure that the member for Chifley will remember this—when this government came to office in 1996 the Prime Minister declared that, instead of Badgerys Creek, the government would consider putting Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy. That is the kind of decision making that this government is famous for. But in planning for transport, especially for airport needs, it is essential that we have some degree of certainty. Airports have a major effect on the health, safety and lifestyle of residents in large surrounding areas.
Planners need to know well in advance where airports will be sited in order to avoid the kinds of impacts that airports like Kingsford Smith have on nearby residents. And you cannot make major changes to existing airports like Bankstown without affecting people who have lived with low-level impact but who now face the prospect of jet aircraft operations over their homes. But that is what the member for Macquarie has been pushing for. Let us go back to August 1999, when the member for Macquarie told the parliament:
... the consultancy report points out ... that better development of Bankstown airport, just a few kilometres away from Kingsford Smith, can help relieve some ... capacity problems. 
And in November 1999 the member for Macquarie told the House:
We need to work on more effectively using the resources that we have got—using Kingsford Smith more effectively.
	...	...	...
Moving some of the regional and lighter planes out to Bankstown ...
But that is not what the member for Macquarie wants in his own backyard. It is quite obvious that he does not want it in his own backyard. When it comes to Richmond air base, he told the House in August this year that Labor wanted to turn Richmond into a noisy commercial airport and put airport noise into seats they do not care about. The member for Macquarie is happy to dump commercial operations onto Bankstown but he will not have them in his own backyard. And he will not agree with Labor's policy to move the second airport out of the Sydney basin altogether. Only the member for Lindsay wants to do that, and she came out with the harebrained idea—does the member for Chifley remember her harebrained idea?—of building the second airport on pylons in the Pacific Ocean.
The member for Macarthur sees no need for a second airport for 30 years, and then it will not be close to Sydney. But the time to plan for our transport and urban development needs is now. If we are to avoid what happened with Badgerys Creek we need to plan for our airport needs now. We cannot keep putting off the hard decisions the way this government does. (Time expired)

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—After first being promoted by the member for Chifley, Badgerys Creek is now off the agenda. Everything else is on the agenda, subject to an environmental impact statement, including the air base at Richmond. Labor's integrated transport policy, which you must be familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, contains the heading `A potential new role for Richmond airport'. The document states:
Labor believes Richmond Airport could play a larger role in addressing Sydney's general aviation needs and possibly other aviation operations.
There it is—it's the Labor Party's policy. They want Richmond. They have canned Badgerys Creek and they are going for Richmond. In a media release on 28 July the member for Chifley said:
Labor has lost 5 seats in Western Sydney and this decision—
That is, to can Badgerys—
is essential in the fight to win them back. 
That is what it is all about—it is a political statement. But what is the policy? On the one hand it seems to be Richmond but on the other hand it seems to be saying, `Anywhere but Badgerys Creek, subject to an EIS.' Isn't that a compelling argument to go to an election with? Won't that convince people in Western Sydney that you are half serious? `We are going to have anywhere but Badgerys but we are going to have an EIS first.' What does that mean? You're going to have an EIS on Badgerys and put it straight back at Badgerys immediately after the election. 
—Get the policy changed.
—Sell Badgerys Creek.
—Of course you could; that's the next change of mind. It is a seasonal thing, you see. About 1992, propose Badgerys; about 2002, reject Badgerys; and about 2012 put Badgerys back on the agenda again. Of course that is the proposal. I am very interested in what Anthony Albanese said. He said:
What I say is, if we're going to have a consensus about removing Badgerys Creek site from our platform, what we need to do is to not have a `Where's Wally' approach to the airport. We need to identify a site as our preferred site; say we'll support it subject to an EIS. 
So we are going to have a `Where's Wally' sort of exercise—that is what Anthony is saying—that is all over the place. You have ruled out Badgerys but you have ruled in Goulburn, Williamtown, Canberra, Wilton, Galston, Richmond, Holsworthy and Somersby—you have got the lot—and you are going to have an airport somewhere on those sites, subject to an EIS. That is wonderful politics. That is just going to frighten the whole population of Sydney. Previously you worried only the people in Western Sydney; now you are going to worry the lot of them. I do not think that is a very sensible policy. I know that if you lived in Western Sydney, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you would be part of it, but I know that you are not; you are against it. So the `yous' I have used are not referring to you—if you understand what I mean.
This is the confusion of the Labor Party on this issue. In 1996 Cheryl Kernot, in a press release, said: 
... further steps in the environmental assessment process had to occur before the Government made a final decision and the Opposition was not going to pre-empt or circumvent that process. “There is a process in place,” she said, “and we have always said we will not jump in before that process is completed.”
There you are—looking at the EIS: no decision for five years, six years, seven years, and suddenly you are going to can Badgerys on no grounds whatsoever, except it is politically expedient. You have said it is politically expedient—that is what you are going to do. The policy was also enunciated by Kim Beazley at the same time when Kim, in 1996, was saying that he was all for Badgerys Creek. What does Mark Latham say? This is a bit of coat-trailing if ever I have seen it. When Mark Latham, who is from Western Sydney, wanted to make remarks about the opposition's decision not to go ahead with Badgerys, the member for Werriwa, who has been a keen promoter of the Badgerys Creek site, said:
If the Howard Government had kept its promise it would be open today. You'd be taking flights out of Badgerys Creek. But they broke their promise and in the Labor Party we can't allow the uncertainty to go on.
What is that? That is a `me too' statement. The member for Werriwa is saying that he wished the Howard government had made a decision to go ahead with Badgerys, he regrets that it has not, and now he agrees that the Labor Party has no choice but to agree with the government.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak to the private members motion moved by my colleague the member for Chifley. It draws attention to the need for forward planning for integrated transport and urban policies in all our major cities—no more so than in Western Sydney, which is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. In recent years in Western Sydney we have seen new suburbs springing up with poor public transport links. In the electorate of Greenway we have seen new suburbs in the north-west sector, with most commuters having to drive or take a bus to rail connections on the Richmond line—to Blacktown station and Seven Hills station—and linking up with the rail commuters from Penrith and the Blue Mountains.
There is a huge disparity in the number of trains that travel from the CBD to the Richmond line compared with the Penrith line, despite the rapidly growing population on the north-western corridor. There has been no serious attempt to redirect the public transport clientele through the Hills district into the CBD, other than by road transport. It is quite clear that these areas have large enough populations to support a fixed rail form of transport. Even at this late stage of urban development a medium-gauge rail system, as operates in the Perth metropolitan area, could run adjacent to some of our major road networks, like the M2 and the under construction M7. As a long-time advocate of the construction of the Western Sydney Orbital—or, as it is now known, the M7—I am delighted to see extensive construction work being carried out on this project. This construction, however, is causing considerable inconvenience to local residents in the form of air and noise pollution and traffic congestion, again highlighting the need for the major road projects to be carried out prior to residential development. That of course takes foresight and planning—two skills the Liberal government seems to lack.
The Western Sydney Orbital will, after construction is complete, of course prove to be extremely beneficial to the Western Sydney region. That is why business groups and local residents have been calling for its construction for over 20 years. I have made numerous speeches in this place explaining the benefits that the Western Sydney Orbital will have on the region. Industries want to be closer to good road networks to move freight efficiently. At present, trucks clog Western Sydney roads, creating pollution, noise and congestion. The roads were not built to sustain the kinds of truck movements that currently exist; therefore the roads require extra expenditure on maintenance. The orbital road will be good for business and it will be good for local residents. 
Along with most other Western Sydney residents, I have always been a strong opponent of the toll on the M7, particularly for local residents. However, with the federal government being reluctant to fully finance this part of the national highway system, the state government had little alternative but to implement the toll. I might add, it is the only toll on the national highway in Australia. This is a clear demonstration of the Howard government's failure in its responsibility to the Australian people.
Turning to other matters regarding the need for proper and appropriate planning for our major cities, we need to examine transport policies and urban design policies together. They are very much two sides of a single coin. As a means of slowing down the urban sprawl that is engulfing us and placing enormous pressure on our transport and health systems, the New South Wales Premier has advocated a reduction in the number of migrants to the Sydney area. He is putting up the `house full' sign for the Sydney region. This approach runs contrary to the argument that Australia needs to increase its migrant intake to increase our population to ensure continual strong economic growth. The total Australian migrant intake has a direct impact on the Sydney urban sprawl.
Before I run out of time, I want to comment on Badgerys Creek, as it has been raised again today. Whatever has been said, whatever has happened in the past, it is Simon Crean and the Labor Party that have put Badgerys Creek airport to bed totally. The member for Mitchell has been an advocate of the airport at Badgerys Creek. If it is claimed that the member for Chifley is the father of Badgerys Creek, then I will say that the member for Mitchell is the mother of Badgerys Creek, because on 7 October 1993 he said in a private member's motion that he:
... endorses the immediate construction of a private/public airport at Badgerys Creek with a full international capacity including a 2900 metre runway.
He said in his speech:
I believe that there are good arguments why there should be immediate regenerated interest in Badgerys Creek, and that Badgerys Creek should in fact be the site of a second international airport for Sydney.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—Today's motion on transport and urban development moved by the member for Chifley is nothing more than an exercise in hypocrisy. I will start with the very first paragraph of the motion, which says:
... understands that Australians want decisions made on the basis of good policy and what is best for communities, not what suits the electoral pendulum ...
The member for Chifley seems to have forgotten that he put out a press release on 28 July 2003 which said:
Labor has lost 5 seats in Western Sydney and this decision is essential in the fight to win them back. 
I say to the member for Chifley: so much for the first statement about using the electoral pendulum. To look at hypocrisy further, I will take the House on a trip down memory lane—right back to 24 May 1989, when the member for Chifley said: 
I have always been an unrepentant exponent of building an airport at Badgerys Creek in the western suburbs of Sydney. 
So gushing was he that, not more than three weeks later, he said:
I guess it would be inappropriate for me not to say something about Badgerys Creek. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know from previous speeches of mine in this House that I remain an unrepentant champion of Badgerys Creek. I believe it is inevitable that Badgerys Creek will be built.
Not even a year went by before he then said:
We are not ashamed to say that we believe that that is a viable solution to Sydney's airport needs. In fact, we will be delighted to be with the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) later in the year when he turns the first sod at the general aviation airport there. We have to be frank. We have some expectation that the third runway environmental impact statement may fail and that we will have a domestic or international airport at Badgerys Creek.
This is what consistency is all about. I will even show how proud he was when on 31 May 1995, not that long ago, he quoted an article from the Blacktown Sun, which in part said:
... and blamed the then Labor Cr Roger Price, now Federal MP for Chifley, for helping bring the airport to Badgerys Creek.
The member for Chifley then said in this House:
I want to plead guilty. I have to say that the Labor Party organisation in my area did have a tradition of being against an airport. I suppose, as a new federal member of parliament, one of my most nervous moments was to report to my FEC and seek its support for a campaign to get an international airport at Badgerys Creek. 
I must say, though, that there have been some on the Labor Party side who have been consistent against the airport. One has been the member for Prospect, and I have looked at her speeches. And then I looked at the member for Grayndler's speeches. When he spoke of this new policy which was announced by their leader, Simon Crean, he said it was an:
... example of a bad policy process leading to a bad policy. The fact is that people such as myself and other members around Sydney Airport were not consulted about this policy. 
He was supported by the member for Sydney, who said:
I think it was the wrong decision to make. I've been open about the fact that I think it's the wrong decision to make but, you know, all I can deal with is what I've got in front of me. 
The member for Watson, who is never short of a word, said on 28 March 2001:
When you do look at the totality of the plan, the only answer on what to do with Sydney airport is to build another big airport that will take jets, small aircraft and freighters, and that is Badgerys Creek. 
A person who was usually consistent—up until he was made the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—was the member for Werriwa. On 28 March 2001, the member for Werriwa said in this House:
The best arrangement is obviously to fly into Badgerys Creek and have connecting domestic and international flights for people from rural New South Wales. So too, if they fly into Sydney, they should have those connecting flights.
He at least admitted later:
... Bankstown will not be adequate. The proper thing to do is to use the large market that is available surrounding the Badgerys Creek site. 
Further, never one to be boastful, the member for Werriwa said:
I go back to 1987 when I started to advocate, while on the Liverpool council, the construction of Badgerys Creek, which was within the municipal boundaries. In 1991 I became the mayor and chairman of WESROC and I can remember that every single state and federal MP in the region was in favour of Badgerys Creek. 
At the time of the recession and substantial unemployment, everyone wanted to build the second airport for its job generating capacity. 
That is an admirable thing. He further said:
The potential has always been there. From 1991 through to about 1993 or 1994, all MPs, state and federal, were supporting the Badgerys Creek site. I can remember WESROC convening meetings where my friend and colleague the member for Chifley would come along and advocate the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. Some people regard him as the father of the proposal—the person who put it on the agenda in a substantial way in Western Sydney because of its positive economic and employment impacts. 
Further, he said:
So Labor policy is to proceed at Badgerys Creek—that is crystal clear—
But now, because he has been made shadow Treasurer and he has been brought into line by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, he is changing his mind. What we have is wedge politics, but the wedge is within the Labor Party. We have those around Sydney airport wanting Badgerys Creek, and we have those around Badgerys Creek wanting something else.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2003-11-03,"—I wish to draw to the attention of the House the extremely depressing conditions that prevail throughout rural Australia, particularly that part of rural Australia that I represent. At the time of speaking to the House, all of the Central West and other areas of Queensland—the Great Mid-West, as they are called—are suffering very severe drought conditions. In my lifetime as a parliamentarian, spanning some 30 years, I cannot ever remember us getting knocked back for drought moneys when we made a serious attempt at them. But given the administration of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—the honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr Truss—once again Mr Truss is going to score a first in the incompetence of the handling of his portfolio and the incompetence of the department which he presides over.
Believe it or not, a drought declaration for North Queensland has to be undertaken by officers of the department living in Canberra. I pointed out to the officers in the department that some 20 stations are destocked either partially or totally and that I can give them the names of stations where they have moved from having 15,000 sheep down to 400 sheep. I can give them the names of stations that have been pushing down prickly trees for their cattle to eat for some six or seven months. They have now run out of prickly trees. I can point out to them stations where they have been handfeeding part or all of their herd for some five months now. Effectively what they said was that their computer model did not indicate that we had drought conditions.
The DPI officers who live in North Queensland have traditionally assessed these situations. It is thought by some people—who I think live in the Stone Age—that they are going to get a better deal from the coalition than they are going to get from the Labor Party. It may be true that they will not get a better deal, but it is most certainly not true that they are getting a good deal now or can survive on the deal that they are getting at the present moment. Go no further than this decision. 
AgForce, the industry representative body in Queensland, is led by probably the finest farm leader we have in the country. He, along with John Bronger of the Pharmacy Guild, is one of the two finest leaders of owner-operated businesses in this country. The situation is that AgForce has come forward and said that there is a very severe drought on up there. The DPI, the local state officials, have said, `There is a very severe drought on in half of North Queensland.' Everyone seems to agree on this except the officers of the department here. They cannot even see fit to leave their computer screens, with their computer models, in Canberra to go up there.
It must be pointed out that I do not expect officers in Canberra to be experts on landforms throughout Australia; nor do I expect that they would be experts on weather conditions. In the area that I represent—in the cracking clays, the vertisol soils, the black soil plains, if you like, of the northern half of Queensland—if you get anything less than an inch of rain it really does nothing else but fill the cracks. Nothing will happen as far as grass growing. If you get more than two inches of rain it all runs off; the soil seals over. It is a very drought-prone area in its natural state. To apply a computer model that will work in western New South Wales or north-western Victoria to North Queensland, where we have a drought at the end of each year, is quite ridiculous. We have an entirely different situation.
As far as governments coming to grips with what needs to be done for these people, we really do not need to be providing a handout, even if there is a small subsidy involved. I was reading the brief on ethanol from the congressional briefing paper in the United States and it mentioned in passing that the corn growers were enjoying a subsidy for this year in excess of $1,000 million, at a guaranteed price of $2.60 a bushel. That is how other countries treat their farmers. If we could just get interest rates to the same level as the interest rate that the government pays—which is probably around four per cent or less at the present moment—we could pass on to the growers the benefit of that wholesale interest rate that government enjoys. That wonderful and great man John McEwen provided for us development banks which simply loaned the money out to the farmers at the same interest rates that they were borrowing money. That was carried on in the same tradition by Doug Anthony, his successor. Quite frankly, if you put 0.2 per cent on it—and I was one of the two ministers overseeing the QIDC in Queensland—you make very handsome profits. So we are not asking for a handout; in fact, we are inviting the government to make profits. Lending in agriculture is very safe.
The policies imposed upon us by the current regime—and I must again mention Mr Truss and Mr Anderson, who are both ardent free traders—have deregulated industries. It is not a philosophy of the Country Party, which I have spent most of my life in, or the National Party, as it later became. Most certainly, in its modern context, it is the philosophy of the ALP. People got up all the time and talked about 25 per cent tariff cuts. That came from Mr Whitlam. The father of economic rationalism in this House was none other than Mr Keating. When that person deregulated the wool industry, he first undermined the scheme and then abolished it. When he did that, the price for wool dropped clean in half. The member for Richmond is in the House at the present moment. When his father introduced that scheme, the price for wool went up 300 per cent. What a wonderful, magnificent contribution to this country Mr Anthony made as a minister and as Deputy Prime Minister. In 1989 that scheme resulted in one-tenth of the nation's entire export earnings coming from one commodity—wool. The deregulation of that scheme took earnings from $5.9 thousand million a year—one-tenth of our export earnings—down to a situation now where half of the sheep herd has vanished. 
Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, let me switch subjects completely. You, the member for Richmond and I represent part of the banana industry. I represent the larger share of the industry. If AQIS, or Biosecurity, as it now calls itself, should exist then it should exist to protect the industries of this country and to prevent disease from coming into this country. The Philippines has 23 diseases of bananas that Australia does not have, including the dreadful moko and black sigatoka diseases which you are quite familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure. In New Scientist magazine of February this year there was a front-page article on how the banana industry is vanishing and is doomed as a result of those two diseases—both of them endemic in every part of the Philippines. How any responsible minister or any responsible government could seriously consider for a fraction of a second bringing those bananas into this country and still say they have a quarantine service is beyond the wildest stretch of my imagination.
Let us save the Australian public money and close the quarantine service down, because it should not be there if it allows bananas to come in. The grape decision staggered me, when we brought the grapes in from California where a 10th of them have died as a result of Pierce's disease. But if this happens, I will not use the arguments that 5,000 or 6,000 Australians will lose their jobs or that the economies of whole towns will completely vanish overnight. It would be naive for me to do that. For my colleagues on the right who may be a bit ignorant about these things, the industry will be replaced by cattle—an industry that employs nobody at all.
We could put most of these shire areas, such as the Innisfail shire area and the Tully shire area, under cattle and we could run the whole industry with 100 people—and this is a place where there are probably 3½ to 4½ thousand jobs at the present moment in bananas. If they are replaced by cattle, that will be the fate that awaits those towns—similar to the ethanol for sugar industry and the tobacco industry. A reintroduction of the tariffs we were allowed to have, and the introduction of a cancer research levy if necessary, will, I am sure, guarantee that we will be able to have tobacco back in the Australian marketplace again. And, of course, as I speak, the dairy industry is going through its death throes throughout major parts of Australia. That is the situation in rural Australia.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NATS,2003-11-03,"—I move: 
That the requested amendments be not made.
The schedule of requests from the Senate for the amendments to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 involves extending the time limits for making past period claims and for payments of top-ups by a further 12 months. The changes would also allow the tax file number link between Centrelink and the ATO which facilitates the reconciliation process to remain open for an additional 12 months. Consequential changes consistent with the further 12-month extension are also requested for the application provisions in the bill so that the amendments cover the 2000-01 income year and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
The government opposes these changes to the bill. The bill already gives families an extra 12 months in which to make family tax benefit and child-care benefit lump sum claims and to receive a top-up payment of family tax benefit. This will give families up to two years after the end of an income year to claim their entitlements. Two years is a very generous timetable, particularly when compared to time frames applied to other welfare payments. Extending the time frame by an additional 12 months—that is, giving customers three years to claim or receive a top-up payment—is not needed. The majority of customers lodge within two years of the end of the income year. As well, the proposed amendments would weaken the purpose of the payment, which is to assist with the cost of raising children. Families need this support when they are raising children, not three years later.
In relation to extending the time frames to the 2000-01 income year, it would not be possible to identify all family tax benefit customers who missed out on lump sum payments or top-ups to their family tax benefit as a result of lodging their tax returns late for the 2000-01 income year. This is because the tax file number link between Centrelink and the ATO that facilitates the income reconciliation process for the 2000-01 income year has already been broken in accordance with the current legislative requirements.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I request that the amendments to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 be made, because families under financial pressure simply cannot afford this government, and there are two key amendments which ease that financial pressure. What we have here is a family payment clawback that makes Ned Kelly look like Santa Claus. Families pay more tax and get less in family payments under this government, and then they are expected to pay more and more for the health and education of their kids. The $1 billion black hole, which was highlighted in today's question time, has been saved by stripping it from the payments of hardworking Australian families. The answer that Minister Anthony gave today shows how mean and tricky the government is prepared to be to cover up its withdrawal of much needed family payments.
Last year, 2002-03, the Howard government spent $1 billion less in family tax benefit and child-care benefit than it forecast. This system has an inbuilt automatic clawback that ensures that families never get what they expect, and this goes to our two amendments. First of all, people who needed a catch-up, not a top-up, in the first year of operation have been denied it, costing them $37 million. That is $37 million that has been ripped from those people because of this mean legislation. So one of our amendments goes to the core of that.
The second amendment goes to stopping the stripping of tax returns which so far, to our knowledge, have been stripped from 230,000 Australian families. We are constantly told by this government that this is a generous system. How generous it was in 2000-01, when it came in. It was so generous that families were to be compensated much more than the cost of the GST. We now know that it is $1 billion less than the government has claimed. In fact, if you look at some of the new analyses of this payment system you will see that families receive in real terms $212 million less in family tax benefit than they did in the first year of its introduction. That is, in real terms there is now less money after three years of operation of the system than there was originally, plus families have been saddled with the GST, plus they have been saddled with extra costs of education, plus they have been saddled with extra costs of health care. That is why families feel under tremendous financial pressure. So tax is up, family payments are down and family budgets are squeezed. 
Today in question time the minister produced a typically mean and tricky answer to explain this clawback, which goes to the very heart of our amendments. He asserted that the clawback happened because of stronger than expected growth in wages. He said that it came about because of the means testing of benefits. That was a lie. The problem is that the initial budget forecast of wages growth for that year was 4.2 per cent and it was downgraded by the Treasury to 3.25 per cent. So wages grew less than was anticipated. The government took $1 billion out in the last financial year and it says that it happened because wages grew more than it thought they would. It was simply a lie. That is why there is an enormous clawback which goes to the fundamental problem with this bill, which is that there are parts which automatically take payments off families who are entitled to them. Families need these payments to feed, clothe and educate their kids on a weekly and fortnightly basis.
When the minister spoke to the amendments he had the hide to say that we could not provide the catch-up, not the top-up, to families for 2000-01 because that need had passed, yet he refuses to change the debt trap in the system and says, `It's okay; families should take less on a yearly basis and claim it at the end,' as a justification for the fact that it is a debt trap. It is a family payment clawback. It is one of the biggest fiddles that have ever been imposed on Australian families in the history of this nation. The government is quite prepared to pay family payments to millionaire families but when it comes to average families it will not pay a category of the catch-up payments. When it comes to the broad mass of families, they are all being saddled with debt.
This government's family payment debt trap is tearing the heart out of family budgets and placing parents under great financial stress. It is hitting one in three families. The average debt is $900. That is why these amendments must be passed—to stop the government thieving back this money from people's tax returns. That goes to our amendment about stripping. This government is like a thief in the night. It is building its surplus on the hard work of Australian families—(Time expired)

That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 15 October 2003, namely: Forecourt scoria restoration, Parliament House.
This motion proposes the restoration to the forecourt area at the front of Parliament House. This project has arisen due to the movement and failures of finishes in the Parliament House forecourt. It has been an ongoing problem since construction and is now at a stage where the unsightly displacements, with cracking and undulating finish, are becoming hazardous to foot traffic and a disruption to the visual aspect which is required for official occasions. 
Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Presiding Officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precincts and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government is responsible for other works in the parliamentary zone. Accordingly, this motion is moved on behalf of the Speaker and the President. The works are expected to cost in the vicinity of $1,250,000 and will be funded from the Joint House Department administered funds appropriation. The National Capital Authority has given works approval and, given the nature of the works, the Presiding Officers did not think it necessary to refer the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories for inquiry and report.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I acknowledge the presence of the Attorney-General in the chamber and I thank him for his courtesy. Age is very much a defining feature of who we are. Our chronology can have an enormous bearing on many of our characteristics. Through the various stages in our lives—from infancy to childhood, adolescence to adulthood and middle age—our physical and mental qualities change with time. Age does, at certain stages in our life, also demand special treatment, recognition and sometimes protection. We would all accept that. It is frequently said that how a nation treats its young and its elderly is an indication of how civilised it is, and we accept that proposition. 
Many current stereotypes about age-related characteristics are wrong, misconceived and hurtful. Notions of younger adults being irresponsible and older persons being inflexible, hard to train and not adaptive are frequently generalisations that have no reflection of reality and often deprive both industry and the individual of considerable opportunity. Our economics and our advancement demand that the attitudes and myths that perpetuate negative age discrimination are shattered. It is in this task that the government should lead, and we note that the substance of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003, albeit with some changes, is supported by the opposition. All states and territories have already outlawed age discrimination and, while the federal government is the last to act, we believe that late is better than not at all. 
Law reform is a powerful tool that can do much to eliminate prejudices. In itself, it can reflect community aspirations that help mould conduct so that those aspirations become standards. A generation ago, laws prohibiting sex, race and other ill-founded bases for discrimination wiped out many stereotypes that were largely unquestioned. One only needs to go back a little over two decades to be in an era where certain jobs were reserved for males and others for females. As late as 1980, a woman called Deborah Wardley was still involved in a fight that went all the way to the High Court to be allowed to pilot a commercial aircraft. She won that fight. Right up until the 1980s, job advertisements were segregated into women and girls, and men and boys. In the former category were positions like secretaries, sales assistants and nurses, and in the latter category were truck drivers, carpenters and managers.  
The move to eradicate age discrimination has come more recently, and there is still much to do. Until relatively recently, it was not uncommon for employers to set baseless age limitations for jobs. In our newspapers, it was easy to find employers expressly stating in job advertisements that applicants be under 40 or 45 years of age. These sorts of limitations had no rational basis, and they not only excluded worthy applicants but reinforced the message that age would dictate a person's ability to perform certain work when such an assumption was nothing short of wrong and destructive of both the individual and the corporate talent. 
Some of the quotes found in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's excellent report into age discrimination, entitled Age Matters, tell of the ageism in contemporary Australia. For example, one quote from a person stated:
I was registered for unemployment and when I asked why no jobs had been referred, I was told by a CES staff member that I was past my use by date ...
Later, the report gives an account of a male teacher who applied for a subject coordinator's position. He was asked why he did not seek the position 20 years earlier. In respect of accommodation, the report reproduces an extract from the Youth Affairs Network of Queensland, which says:
There is no legal reason that people under 18 years of age cannot sign a lease, however this is still cited as a reason for them not being leased flats, units and houses.
Age discrimination persists as a negative force that requires appropriate government attention and, as I said, that is supported by the opposition. In November 2001, the Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, wrote:
Age discrimination complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission between 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 have tripled. More than 200 people phoned the complaints information line after being deemed `too old' for a position.
Under New South Wales laws, age discrimination was the first most common ground for complaints in 2000-01 to the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board, making up nine per cent of complaints in total.
Not only are these views that promote age discrimination an affront to the dignity of older persons but also they impair the efficient functioning of the labour market. On a macro level, an ageing population has serious economic consequences for the Australian economy. Over the next 20 years, the growth in the Australian population of labour force age will be 14 per cent, but the number of people between 55 and 64 years of age is expected to increase by over 50 per cent. On an international scale, participation in the Australian labour market stands at relatively high rates for young workers but low rates for older workers. For older Australians, the labour market is not serving them well. This proportion is exemplified in the disappointing reality that Australia has the highest unemployment rate for men aged 55 to 59 of any country in the OECD. So there is a real cultural barrier to be overcome in that respect alone.
What these statistics bear out is that the case for human rights goes beyond legal niceties. Human rights do more than achieve the noble objective of upholding the dignity of individuals. Respect for fundamental human rights pays significant economic and social dividends as well. Recalling the comparison to sex discrimination, the rise in female participation in our labour force has been a significant contributor to our rising economic prosperity. Not only can women now fulfil their potential and aspirations but also industry has an enlarged pool of skilled labour. The higher labour participation rate of women significantly boosts the gross domestic product of Australia.
Demographers have charted how our growing life expectancy and declining birth rates are changing the population profile. As a nation, our average age is increasing. It is predicted that, between 2011 and 2031, the number of people aged over 65 in Australia will grow from three million to five million. Over this period, the number of persons over 85 years of age will almost double, to 1.1 million. This will be in most of our lifetimes. Perhaps more dramatic than these figures is the slowdown in the rate of work force growth. Between 1978 and 1988, the work force grew by 23.5 per cent. In the succeeding decade, the rate fell to 17.1 per cent. Over the decade 2000-10, the rate will dwindle to just 13.8 per cent. So, from 1978 to 2010, it will go from 23.5 per cent down to 13.8 per cent—a significant decline. 
These trends point to a significant shift in the ratio of those who work to those who are in retirement. This will put an increasing strain on the economy, and it will be necessary to find the resources to fund retirement incomes and deliver wealth and fundamental services to other segments of the population. However, as pointed out in the bill's explanatory memorandum, an increase in 10 percentage points in the work force participation of Australians aged 55 to 70 years of age would largely cancel out any negative effects of an ageing population. It is therefore in everyone's interests to seek to increase labour force participation amongst older workers, not by way of necessity but by way of creating opportunities equally for senior Australians as for young workers.
Of the various means pointed towards this goal, such as retraining programs for older workers, altered retirement income policies and so on, it remains essential that we as a society break down those views that perpetuate age discrimination and promote a culture that effectively locks people out of those opportunities which benefit not only themselves but, as I have said, the nation as a whole. On this front, Labor welcomes federal age discrimination legislation, just as there already exists complementary state, territory and federal antidiscrimination legislation in respect of sex, race, disability and other grounds. The addition of federal legislative protections against age discrimination will signify the complete and comprehensive rejection of negative age discrimination by all Australian governments.
However, there is considerable scope for the government, we believe, to improve in respect of this bill, and I will address those areas. Labor hopes that the government will indeed accept our amendments that will, firstly, extend the operation of the bill to relatives and associates. These will be debated, I understand, at a later stage in the Main Committee. The prohibition of age discrimination to a person's relatives and associates was considered by the government, but we understand it was rejected. The government's information paper on the bill contained a passage that said it would be inappropriate. But, regrettably, we fear that, in the rejection of that proposal, perhaps the government has been overly influenced by employer organisations, or at least certain ones, without regard to the broader interests of the community.
It is not difficult to envisage, for instance, where discrimination on the basis of the age of a relative or an associate may arise—for example, in an employment situation where an employer discriminates against an employee who cares for an aged relative, because of an apprehension by the employer that the employee will need time off to attend to the needs of that relative. Another situation might be that of a hotelier not allowing parents with young children to stay as guests, because of the hotelier's anticipation of unruly behaviour by children. Labor takes the view that the Commonwealth legislation should set the standards and not merely provide the lowest standards of protection. I might add, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, that neither you nor I would have unruly or difficult children. I say that with my fingers firmly crossed! But Labor takes the view that the legislation should set the standards and not merely provide the lowest standards of protection. We believe that the government's capitulation, perhaps, to some of those more limited interests has impeded what would be effective operation in that area. 
We believe that another inadequacy with this legislation is the government's choice to water down the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination, by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for the conduct complained about. This is a significant issue; it is an issue of substance. The requirement that age discrimination be the dominant reason is a much harder test than that which applies, for instance, under the various state and territory laws dealing with age discrimination. Generally in antidiscrimination laws the relevant test is met even if the discriminatory action is only one of several reasons for the conduct that is the ground for the complaint. The provision in the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act is a good example. Section 4A provides:
If:
(a) an act is done for two or more reasons, and
(b) one of the reasons consists of unlawful discrimination under this Act against a person (whether or not it is the dominant or a substantial reason for doing the act),
then, for the purposes of this Act, the act is taken to be done for that reason.
So probably the most significant amendment we will be moving seeks to have included in the act a test that age discrimination is one or more of the reasons, as opposed to the dominant reason, for the discrimination.
The government's reasons for the more difficult threshold to maintain the complaint are, we believe, not based on sound reasoning and, indeed, are at odds with the government's rationale for bringing forward the legislation as a whole. We note that the government's case for introducing the legislation is said to be as follows:
If the status quo is retained, older Australians and younger Australians would bear the cost of ongoing discrimination, suffering the effects of marginalisation, unemployment or under-employ-ment, damage to self-esteem, reduced social participation and reduced access to goods and services. The community would also lose the benefits of diverse contributions to society by people of different age groups. 
Labor agrees with those sentiments entirely. In weighing up the case for legislative reform in this area, the government reasoned:
The self-regulatory measures suggested in Option 2 are not appropriate for the problem of age discrimination as they do not provide an adequate remedy.  Legislative mechanisms for providing protection against age discrimination would appear to be the optimum way of dealing with the problem. 
Similarly, simply retaining the status quo, as suggested in Option 1, is not an appropriate option in this case. As noted above, there are gaps in the existing coverage of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws which would not be rectified by simply retaining the status quo.
Again, we consider that the government has advanced a compelling case for legislating to prohibit age discrimination at a Commonwealth level, and we agree with the argument it has advanced. But, in the execution of the legislation, the government has softened unnecessarily the impact in these important areas.
Age based harassment is the other area that we have concerns about in this legislation. The government's position on age based harassment mirrors its position on relatives and associates. The government raised the issue in its information paper but, after noting that only the Northern Territory specifically banned age based harassment, the government succumbed to business concerns over the issue and declined to ban age based harassment in the legislation. Age based harassment is a real phenomenon that should be stopped. No more should young apprentices and junior staff be bullied and treated in a demeaning manner, and no longer should older Australians be subjected to derogatory taunts. 
With the three amendments which we will be proposing at the detailed stages of the debate, we believe the operation of the Commonwealth's age discrimination legislation will go from being perhaps the weakest in the land to being on par with the best. As amended by those proposals, we consider that the proposed legislation will be better able to fulfil its mission—one on which the government and the opposition agree—to protect Australians from negative age discrimination and to have a significant benefit in promoting tolerance and a culture of utilising our nation's best talent base, irrespective of a person's age.
On the issue of exemptions in the legislation, Labor will reserve our judgment until the operation of the legislation has been considered in time. In this sense, we believe it is vital that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have sufficient funding and resources to make that assessment on the operation of the legislation. As I have pointed out, having these measures operating effectively has not only social benefits but also economic benefits, and we believe that that should be a consideration in funding the important work done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. For this to happen, there must of course be no more cuts to the commission's funding, and the government must respect the commission's independence and integrity and let it get on with this work in its respected and objective way.
With Labor's package of amendments, we believe the bill will become balanced, effective and should serve the purpose that it is designed to achieve. We are all susceptible to the effects of age, which regrettably we start to feel. They are something beyond our control. What is in our control, however, is the power to break down the stereotypes and prejudices that have held back those in our society who have every ability to make a contribution but have been dismissed simply because of their age. In conclusion, I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to ensure that federal age discrimination legislation contains the best standards of protection of older Australians, a failure which is consistent with its neglect of the human rights of all Australians, as evidenced by its introduction of legislation to weaken the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other actions to wind back protections for Australian citizens”.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Is the amendment seconded?

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—The opposition support the measures contained in the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003. Australia have a proud record in the area of the control of ozone depleting substances. We have managed to meet the targets and deadlines proposed in the Montreal protocol and the subsequent upgrades and amendments to these protocols. In most instances, we have been able to meet targets ahead of time and to exceed the requirements. A continuing bipartisan approach and generally good cooperation from the private sector have been major contributing factors to our success.
It is only appropriate that Australia should be a leading nation in this area. Ozone depletion issues affected the Southern Hemisphere earlier and much more significantly than they did the Northern Hemisphere. High rates of skin cancer are already a public health issue in Australia and, indeed, continue as a major concern. Thinning of the ozone barrier increases the potential exposure to damaging UV-B light—the main causative factor. There are other effects as well. The cost-benefit ratio of one to seven in the review of the existing legislation speaks for itself.
Ozone depletion is an important problem, where the widespread adoption of international protocols has helped to limit the damage. Hopefully, the problem will be largely remedied over the next several decades. Most of the current indications are positive, although there are a few worrying signs. Records from the CSIRO station at Cape Grim in Tasmania are showing that most of the levels of the controlled ozone depleting substances are decreasing in the atmosphere. The unfortunate exception is CFC-22, which was the most used CFC and is the most abundant ozone depleting substance in the atmosphere. Although the rate of increase has slowed greatly, it is still increasing.
Continuing vigilance and adherence to strict standards will be required. It is unfortunate that, in this context, some wealthy nations are working towards a relaxation of some aspects of the protocols. Methyl bromide, for example, has a high ozone depletion potential. It is an important fumigant. We must try to avoid simply relaxing the controls to allow its continuing use, and I hope the government does not take a dodgy approach to the so-called critical use exemptions. There is an urgent need to research and find alternative fumigants.
There is a second area of concern associated with the release of human generated additions of gases to the atmosphere. The effects on climate change are now seen as significant and problematic by the consensus of scientists world wide. Weather patterns are starting to show significant change all around the world. The Beijing amendments, which we are dealing with here, extend the range of considerations from ozone depleting gases to others that do not cause ozone depletion but, equally, have the potential to contribute to atmospheric warming and climate change. The measures we are considering are largely concerned with the national implementation of these international protocols. 
Concerns about global climate change affect all nations, perhaps some even more than Australia. We should not imagine that this is an issue that we can be slow in addressing. It is important that Australia show leadership and be at the forefront of measures designed to minimise the impact of our activity on the climate. The last seven or eight years have seen a significant change in weather patterns over, for example, South Australia. Although there have been previous severe droughts lasting a season or two, the current prolonged drought has been unprecedented in our records. Indeed, it would appear that the rain-bearing westerly airstream has moved southwards from our continent into the Southern Ocean. This is something that the member for Cowan might be familiar with in his part of the world—that is, the drying of the Perth climate when compared with what it experienced 20 and 30 years ago and before that.
Computer modelling of the weather, at the Bureau of Meteorology and elsewhere, has shown just such a pattern associated with an increasing influx of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Interestingly and perhaps disturbingly, the models show a similar effect when a cooler Antarctic stratosphere is factored in. Temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere have fallen significantly with the local loss of ozone and it appears that these two factors have worked together to produce the recent changes. In southern Australia, only a small area in south-western Tasmania has received above-average rainfall over the last several years. The whole of the rest of the southern part of the continent—we are talking about south-western and Western Australia and around Adelaide and the vast majority of Victoria, so all of those areas and few areas further north—has had a succession of dry years; the driest on record for a large part of the region.
The atmosphere is a very thin and delicate region. Human release of substances to the atmosphere has produced measurable and observable changes in composition over a period of decades. Ozone depletion and greenhouse warming are two quite different problems but to some extent they feed one another and in many cases they are now being seen to combine to produce significant climate change. Human inputs to the atmosphere and their contribution to climate change are an urgent issue for Australia, an issue of enormous economic and social importance. It is vital that we take steps to reverse and, certainly in the short term, limit undesirable activities. This legislation is a very small contribution towards this goal. None of the substances included currently contributes significantly to atmospheric warming. They all have the potential to contribute if released in larger quantities. The substitute refrigerants that we have developed to replace the ozone depleting substances are, in some cases, capable of making a similar contribution to atmospheric warming. Careful monitoring of their use is an important and desirable part of limiting the harm, and that is largely what this legislation addresses.
The legislation itself should certainly not be seen as a solution to our climate change problems. We should always remember that the major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and methane. Steady increases in the level of these two gases in the atmosphere over the last century or so are responsible for over 90 per cent of the human generated change. The substances that are the subject of this legislation are potential contributors. At present their effects are insignificant but if not controlled they might build up to a contribution of a few per cent and that could well be an important additional burden. But carbon dioxide principally and methane, as a second factor, are the substances whose emissions must be controlled. It is disappointing that, in spite of successful negotiations to obtain concessions for a number of special issues that affect Australia, this government has decided not to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. That is worse than disappointing; it is shameful. 
The amendments before the House have two main thrusts. The first is to extend the types of measures adopted for control of ozone depleting substances to other substances that have global warming potential. They cover most of the more direct and obvious replacements for the ozone depleting refrigerants and bring them under a similar regulatory regime. The second impact is to centralise the regulation into a single consistent set of rules for the nation. There are obvious advantages in terms of certainty and efficiency, particularly for enterprises that operate in several states or territories. The opposition support this thrust of the amendments in principle. We do have some misgivings about putting this kind of responsibility into the hands of a government that has shown in other areas that it is quite prepared to modify regulations and procedures and walk away from international protocols when they do not suit its prejudices. But if we do not take appropriate action to deal with human influences on global climate, effects that are already becoming apparent—and I will return to this issue—will amplify and we will have more drastic problems to deal with in years to come.
The original legislation was introduced by the Labor Party in 1989. The first bill which we are debating here, the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, continues the generally bipartisan approach which has been taken on this subject. The purpose of this bill, in amending the Ozone Protection Act 1989, is to establish a national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone depleting substances and the synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. It also implements the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The existing legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances by over 80 per cent since its enactment back in 1989. To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has adopted a variety of ozone benign substances and technologies, including the synthetic greenhouse gases: hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. These gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer but are potent greenhouse gases, with their emissions having an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne for tonne basis. Although these gases currently comprise only a very small part of Australia's overall greenhouse gas emissions, their use and emissions are on the rise as substitutes for ozone depleting substances. The explanatory memorandum asserts that amendments introduced by this bill will deliver on commitments to manage synthetic greenhouse gas emissions, as detailed in measure 7.2 of the National Greenhouse Strategy. The second reading speech asserts the amendments also implement the key recommendations of the government's review of the Commonwealth's ozone protection legislation under the national competition policy.
The two additional bills which are we are debating here, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003, extend the current payments applying to the manufacture and import of prescribed ozone depleting substances to certain synthetic greenhouse gases and allow for an increase in payments. So what these bills are doing is extending the system in the existing legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone depleting substances to also include the synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. They are designed to simplify the current regulatory arrangements—for end-use control of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives—by replacing existing state and territory legislation with a single national framework. That framework will allow the government to enact regulations to target preventable emissions and adapt these controls over time to reflect changes in technologies and practices. 
In implementing these controls, the government will draw upon industry expertise and experience, including through the use of industry boards. The second reading speech says:
The states and territories agree that replacing existing controls with the proposed nationally uniform approach should deliver environmental gains more efficiently, and realise benefits to industry in terms of increased certainty and consistency.
The bill reforms the current financial arrangements for the ozone protection program to establish the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Account. The reforms will accommodate the additional regulatory responsibilities assumed by the government under this bill and increase transparency by consolidating all financial arrangements into one account. The new arrangements will, on a cost recovery basis, fund administration of the amended act and programs to reduce the environmental impact of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements.
The bills also implement the Beijing amendment to the Montreal protocol. The Beijing amendment requires a ban on the trade in, and manufacture of, bromochloromethane and a ban on trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries not committed to their phase-out. The explanatory memorandum outlines industry support for the bills on the basis that they provide `necessary certainty and consistency with regard to its obligations to effectively manage ozone depleting substances'.
There was support for the legislation from the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, which said that supporting the bills is a sensible and comprehensive approach to the matter. They said that the bills recognise that a least cost approach is the best way forward and that in this case reducing emissions will position our economy for the future. The Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating also said that the bills will provide Australia with a world-leading program for the control and management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. There was also support for the bills from Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation.
There was, however, some support for greater effort to move in the direction of increased use of natural refrigerants. Indeed, the Greenchill Technology Association indicated very strongly their belief that the bills ought to go further. They described the government's approach as a necessary but not sufficient response to the problems caused by HFCs. They said that whilst trying to manage and control emissions is a laudable objective, emissions will continue to increase as they continue to be used. As it is far more effective to reduce emissions by using naturals instead, this needs to be the central thrust of the legislation. So there were some concerns about the legislation on the basis that we should be looking to move in the direction of natural refrigerants.
I believe that the concerns raised by Greenchill and by others are best addressed through the development of policy on natural refrigerants rather than through seeking to amend the bills before the House, because the bills before the House otherwise improve existing arrangements for the management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. I will come back to this question of proposed amendments in a moment, but I will make a couple of other points before I do that. 
The first point is that this legislation is the product of a policy commitment made by the Commonwealth government back in 1995. I think that when the government stands up and says that introducing these bills will contain greenhouse gas emissions and provide greenhouse gas dividends it ought to be noted that this commitment was made back in 1995 and, had this legislation been introduced in a quicker and more timely way, we would have been saving much more in the way of greenhouse gas emissions. So there has been delay. That has resulted in millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere over the last decade, which could have and should have been prevented.
The second point I want to make comes back to methyl bromide. This is a powerful ozone depleting substance. All uses of methyl bromide other than for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes are to be phased out in Australia by 1 January 2005, consistent with our obligations under the Montreal protocol. However, parties to the protocol recognised that transitional access to methyl bromide after that time may be justified. In 1997 they adopted a formal decision to allow limited critical use exemptions in some rare cases. That decision made it clear that such exemptions would be granted only when several strict criteria are met. It appears that the government may seek to allow or support dubious exemptions which compromise the intent of the phase-out. That is something that the opposition will continue to monitor. In general, the bills represent an improvement on the current arrangements for management of both ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. I understand that it will not have a financial impact in that proposed increases in licence application fees will satisfy the legislative requirement for revenue neutrality in administering the act.
I think there has been a certain amount of mischief on both the government side—the Liberal side—and the Green side of this debate. I received correspondence from the executive director of the Australian Fluorocarbon Council and from representatives of the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Association. In those emails they said they were very worried that there was difficulty in having the bills scheduled for debate. They wrote to request my assistance in expediting this matter and to ask if I could assist in moving these bills forward. Mr Deputy Speaker Price, as you will be well aware, I have no influence over the management of the business of the House. That is entirely in the hands of the government. The delays in bringing these bills forward have been entirely a matter for the government. It is their choice as to which bills should be brought on for debate and which bills should not be brought forward for debate. If the government were endeavouring to suggest to the industry that Labor was somehow holding up this legislation, that would be completely untrue and a piece of mischief on their part.
On the other side of the coin, the Greens have foreshadowed amendments to this legislation, which they have foreshadowed by way of press release, not by way of discussion with us. There has been some lobbying in the last couple of weeks endeavouring to suggest that we should be supporting amendments which take us in the direction of natural refrigerants. One of the difficulties in relation to these proposed amendments, which have been bowled up late in the day, with people sending us emails the day before this legislation was originally scheduled to come on for debate, is that this approach does not show a great understanding of how a large democratic party works. We certainly do not spin around on a 20c piece in relation to these matters.  
More importantly, the issue is that this legislation should take us forward. The government is clearly setting out the case that this legislation does take us forward—for example, by telling us that it will deliver a greenhouse gas abatement equivalent of up to six million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum by 2010, which is about one per cent of Australia's 1990 emissions. If we accept the figures provided by the government and understand that this legislation is benign, then putting us in the situation of holding the bill to ransom and saying, `We will not support it unless it does other things,' can make life very difficult. If the legislation is amended in the Senate but not supported by the government as a result of the Senate amendments then, of course, people will be open to accusations that they are holding up what is good and worthy legislation. The Labor Party are prepared to consider the proposals to advance the cause of natural refrigerants and to give them due policy consideration, but that is something we will consider as part of our policy development work, not in terms of support for amendments to these particular bills.
In the remaining time open to me, I want to return to the question of climate change. I said in my remarks that the bills are useful in relation to greenhouse gas abatement, but they are far from a major or even significant step forward in relation to greenhouse gas abatement. Climate change is, in my book, the most serious environmental question facing the planet. Every day there is evidence of climate change. We saw it with the Californian bushfires. We saw it with the hailstorms in south-east Queensland recently. Storm events with hailstones the size of golf balls and cricket balls lashed south-east Queensland and caused at least $8 million damage—and it may be much more than that by the time the claims have been properly lodged. In the ACT, we saw storm events with hailstones contributing to the blacking out of more than 20,000 homes in the ACT and something like 40,000 homes in New South Wales. Back in April 1999, we saw a billion dollar Sydney hailstorm.
Interestingly, the Insurance Australia Group—it is their business to know whether climate change is happening and what impact it is likely to have on insurance claims—have done modelling and their preliminary findings show that even small adjustments to the key parameters would combine to form a superstorm and create a hailstone event that has the potential to far outstrip the horrendous April 1999 storms in both intensity and scale. There have been bushfires, there have been hailstorms and there is the evidence we have seen in relation to the Queensland wet tropics. Recently, I drew public attention to the findings of researchers that show that, in the area of the wet tropics, climate change will have severe effects on the long-term survival of many species. Most upland species will disappear if average temperatures increase by anything over one degree Celsius. We also have the prospect that carbon dioxide concentrations will reduce the nutritional value and increase the toughness of most foliage, which has implications for leaf-eating species and for litter-feeding insect eaters, and that the cloud base will rise higher above the ground than it is at present. A lot of those endemic rainforest species are distributed over areas with a very narrow range in temperature and rainfall, so relatively small changes in temperature and rainfall will have a major impact on the capacity of species in the wet tropics to survive. 
It is of concern whether we are looking at those things or at the phenomenon I mentioned earlier which was referred to in a recent Catalyst program as the Antarctic vortex. That is where the rain-bearing winds over southern Australia during the winter period which give southern Australia much of its rainfall are now apparently being sucked further south as a result of the interaction between the hole in the ozone layer and increasing temperatures on the continent. As that effect becomes more dramatic, the rainfall will be sucked south into the ocean and we will not get it. Southern Australia will enter a period of reduced rainfall and extended drought conditions. That sort of change is potentially dramatic for this continent. Australia is already the world's driest inhabited continent, and the prospect of reduced rainfall in southern Australia ought to be a matter of major concern. 
Unfortunately, this government does not get it in relation to its attitude towards climate change. It claims that we are on track for meeting our Kyoto target. The point is that we contribute less than two per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but it has nothing to say about the other 98 per cent. The one vehicle that is there to try to tackle global climate change and global greenhouse gas emissions is the Kyoto protocol on climate change, and this government has done everything it possibly can to scuttle and undermine the Kyoto protocol. It has not played a part as a good international, environmental citizen. Indeed it is very much in Australia's best interests to get action at an international level to contain our greenhouse gas emissions. The rest of the world is responsible for over 98 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and this government has absolutely nothing to say about how we deal with those greenhouse gas emissions.
—This government ought to be ratifying the Kyoto protocol. The government's position is a matter of international embarrassment. The parliamentary secretary at the table, Dr Stone, might not be aware of it but around the world our environmental reputation is mud as a result of the stance we have taken on this. Try talking to some of those South Pacific nations—Tuvalu, Kiribati and the rest of them—and see how they feel about the prospect that they will be flooded as a result of us undermining the Kyoto protocol.
We should be ratifying the Kyoto protocol on climate change and urging the United States and Russia to do likewise. It is of course necessary for either the United States or Russia to ratify the protocol for it to come into effect. If we do not get that collective international action then the problems we are talking about—droughts, bushfires, floods, cyclones and increased susceptibility to tropical diseases—will only become more serious. So I urge the government to do the right thing on climate change. Collective international action can work in relation to the Montreal protocol and the ozone problem. It can also work in relation to the Kyoto protocol and the climate change problem. We need to take the same constructive approach to climate change as we have been taking to ozone so that we can get the effects that are necessary to protect the planet's climate, and particularly Australia's climate, in the years ahead.",REPS,<title>OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—I rise today to speak to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and related bills. The purpose of the bills is to amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to maintain the national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone-depleting substances, ODSs, and newer synthetic greenhouse gases, SGGs, to be used as their replacements. Australia's ozone protection legislation has made a significant contribution to the global effort to phase out ozone-depleting substances. Through cooperation between government and industry the legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone-depleting substances by over 80 per cent since its enactment in 1989. 
To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has adopted a variety of ozone benign substances and technologies, including the use of synthetic greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons. These gases do not endanger the ozone layer but are now recognised as potent greenhouse gases. Some of these SGGs have an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis. For example, the hydrofluorocarbon 134a is 1,300 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis.
The bills also extend the system in the existing legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone-depleting substances. This enables Australia to ratify the most recent amendment to the Montreal protocol—the Beijing amendment—and address environmental issues raised by the increasing adoption of SGGs where they are used as alternatives to ODSs. These amendments have been developed following extensive consultation with state and territory governments, industry and other stakeholders over the last four years. There is widespread support for these changes, which will allow a national uniform approach and deliver effective environmental gains, certainty and consistency as a benefit to industry. These amendments affect businesses in the airconditioning, refrigeration, foam, fire protection, fumigation in agriculture, aerosol and precision cleaning industries. Greenhouse gases emitted during the production of aluminium, magnesium and electricity are exempted from the bill and will be addressed through voluntary programs. 
The bills have the potential to reduce Australia's overall emissions of greenhouse gases by the equivalent of six million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum by 2010, or up to one per cent of 1990 levels. The bills cover the phasing out of these ozone-depleting substances: bromochloromethane, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform.
Hydrocarbons, which are used as an alternative to ozone-depleting substances in car airconditioners, are neither ozone depleters nor greenhouse gases and are not regulated by this regulation. However, hydrocarbons are flammable and in some applications raise occupational health and safety issues. The aim of the bill is not to phase out SGGs as there is no reasonable number of alternative substances available to replace them. They were originally adopted as replacements for ozone-depleting substances. The aim of the bill is to minimise the emission of these gases. The earth's ozone layer protects all life from the sun's harmful radiation, but human activities releasing ozone-depleting substances have damaged the shield.
Ozone is an extremely rare gas, representing three out of every 10 million molecules. Most atmospheric ozone is concentrated in a layer in the stratosphere about 15 to 30 kilometres above the earth's surface. Ozone is a molecule containing three oxygen atoms. It is blue in colour and has a strong odour. The oxygen molecule, which we breathe, has two oxygen atoms and is colourless and odourless. 
The ozone layer absorbs a portion of the radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the planet's surface. Most importantly, it absorbs the portion of ultraviolet light called UVB, a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280 to 320 nanometres, a nanometre being one billionth of a metre. It is produced by the sun. UVB has been linked to many harmful effects, including various types of skin cancer, cataracts and harm to crops, certain materials and some forms of marine life. The ozone layer also absorbs all the lethal ultraviolet C radiation. 
At any given time, ozone molecules are constantly formed and destroyed in the stratosphere. The amount, however, remains relatively stable. The ozone depleting substances that have been used over the past 50 years or so were initially thought of as miracle substances. They were stable, non-flammable, low in toxicity and inexpensive to produce. Over time, CFCs found uses in refrigerants, propellants, solvents, foam-blowing agents and other small applications. Others—such as chlorine-containing compounds including methyl chloroform, a solvent, and carbon tetrachloride, an industrial chemical used in fumigation; halons, which were found to be extremely effective fire-extinguishing agents; and methyl bromide, a very effective soil fumigant—have atmospheric lifetimes long enough to allow them to be transported by winds into the stratosphere.
The CFCs are quite stable, although on exposure to strong ultraviolet radiation they break down and release chlorine and bromine, which in turn attack and destroy ozone. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules. The net effect is to destroy ozone faster than it is naturally created. One example of ozone depletion is the annual ozone `hole' over Antarctica that has occurred during the Antarctic spring since the early 1980s. Rather than being a literal hole through the layer, the ozone hole is a large area of the stratosphere with extremely low amounts of ozone. Ozone levels have fallen by over 60 per cent during the worst years. In addition, research has shown that ozone depletion occurs over the latitudes that include North America, Europe, Asia and much of Africa, Australia and South America. Thus ozone depletion is a global issue and not just a problem at the South Pole.
Data collected in the upper stratosphere has shown that there has been a general thinning of the ozone layer over most of the globe. This includes a five per cent to nine per cent depletion over Australia since the 1960s. In addition to this general thinning, more dramatic damage occurs over Antarctica each spring when the ozone hole forms. The 2000 ozone hole was the largest on record, measuring 32.9 million square kilometres—more than three times the size of Australia—and, for the first time, extending over populated areas.
The prospects for the long-term recovery of Antarctic ozone are good. Non-essential consumption of the major ozone-depleting substances in the developed world slowed during the early 1990s and ceased in 1996. Stratospheric chlorine levels should return to pre ozone hole levels by about 2050.
Since most of the ozone-depleting substances are released in the northern hemisphere, a common question is why the ozone hole occurs over Antarctica. The first part of the answer is that, even though most of the chemicals are heavier than air, regardless of where they are released, they mix throughout the troposphere—the layer extending up to about 15 kilometres above the earth's surface—over about a year and then mix into the stratosphere in two to five years. The second part of the answer is that, although the overall process is similar between global ozone depletion and the ozone hole, there are two different types of ozone depletion chemistry. Both types are important, but the ozone hole seems to grab most of the attention.  
The first kind is called homogeneous depletion. Resulting from reactions as gases mix together, it is responsible for the reduction in global ozone levels. The five per cent to 10 per cent drop in ozone over the US is an example of homogeneous chemistry. The second kind of ozone depletion chemistry, called heterogeneous, causes the radical destruction of ozone over the Antarctic each spring that we call the ozone hole. It results from chemical reactions on the surfaces of ice particles. The existence of these particles and the seasonal and geographic location of the hole all result from a combination of meteorological and other effects that are specific to Antarctica at that time of year.
Each winter, the air around the South Pole cools and begins circulating to the west. This vortex effectively isolates the air over Antarctica, with three effects. First, outside air, which is relatively ozone rich, cannot mix in and sustain ozone levels. Second, the chemicals that tend to slow down the depletion reactions cannot mix with Antarctic air. Third, the heat from outside air is shut out, prolonging the period of very low stratospheric temperatures. Because the air gets so cold over Antarctica each winter, the vortex remains intact for several months, finally breaking up in December. The vortex is the reason for the timing and location of the ozone hole, because such vortices do not form over more temperate regions, and, as such, homogeneous gas phase chemistry is the dominant global concern, producing long-term ozone depletion trends. 
The Antarctic is a very cold place; temperatures in the lower stratosphere drop below minus 80 degrees Celsius. Ordinarily, the stratosphere is so dry that it will not support clouds, but these cold temperatures do produce ice clouds, called polar stratospheric clouds or PSCs. Some of the clouds are water ice, but more prevalent are clouds of nitric acid and water. Like the wind vortex, the formation of PSCs has specific impacts. In the absence of polar stratospheric clouds, most man-made stratospheric chlorine is locked up in relatively inert compounds. However, the surfaces of the ice particles in the clouds allow these compounds to react, converting the chlorine into ozone-destroying forms. These reactions are different from those occurring when gases mix over mid latitudes. 
The forms of chlorine released from the clouds' surfaces cannot destroy ozone without the addition of UV light, which is not available during the southern winter. Thus their concentrations rise until the sun appears during the spring. When the sun does rise, the chlorine is rapidly converted to chlorine monoxide, and this is followed by a very rapid set of reactions, destroying up to 70 per cent of the ozone in the lower stratosphere over a period of a few weeks.
The net effect of these factors is the ozone hole, an easily measured, well defined seasonal phenomenon. The depth, area and timing of the hole vary from year to year, but, as the polar vortex breaks up and the stratosphere warms, the heterogeneous chemistry shuts down and ozone levels over the Antarctic return to near normal. The ozone hole generally lasts from September to December, although the exact time period varies from year to year. The ozone hole is the most obvious effect of the release of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere and is also the most extreme example of ozone depletion. However, the long-term downward trends in ozone levels over most of the globe also pose a serious threat. Although not as spectacular, homogeneous chemistry is a significant problem. 
In conclusion, the 1999 Beijing amendment has already essentially been practised by Australia. The Beijing amendment contains four key elements: the ban on production and trade in bromochloromethane except for essential uses to countries that have ratified the Beijing amendment; the ban on trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries who have not agreed to phase out these gases; the phase-out schedule for hydrochlorofluorocarbon production in developed countries, with phase-out by 2040; and mandatory annual reporting of methyl bromide imported for quarantine and preshipment purposes. Australia's trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries who have not agreed to phase them out is negligible. Australia has voluntarily reported its quantity of methyl bromide imported for quarantine and preshipment purposes. Australia does not manufacture bromochloromethane or hydrochlorofluorocarbons, has not recently exported bromochloromethane, and on average imports less than one kilogram of bromochloromethane per year. So, basically, we have enacted this already.",REPS,<title>OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-11-03,"—You might expect that as the sole Greens MP in this House I would welcome the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and its associated legislation, and I must say at the outset that these changes are long overdue and very welcome—as far as they go. And that is just the problem: they do not go anywhere near far enough. It is a missed opportunity. There are widespread concerns about the bill, despite a stated aim of minimising the impact of ozone-depleting substances on the environment.
The minister has told us that the purpose of this bill is to amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to ensure we have a truly national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases—SGGs—used as their replacements. The minister told us that it also ensures Australia remains an international leader on action to preserve the earth's ozone layer by implementing the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says this will be done by amending the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to:
	introduce a licensing system for the import, export and manufacture of syn-thetic greenhouse gases (SGGs) used as alternatives to ozone depleting sub-stances (ODS), accompanied by a licence application fee, activity levy and reporting obligations;
	introduce a licensing system for refrigeration and air-conditioning equip-ment imported into Australia containing the ozone depleting substance hydro-chloro-fluorocarbon (HCFC) or the syn-thetic greenhouse gas hydrofluoro-carbon (HFC), accompanied by a licence application fee, activity levy and report-ing obligations;
	extend the existing licensing system for the import, export and manufacture of ODS to a new ODS, bromochlorome-thane, including the associated licence application fee and reporting obligations;
	provide for national consistency in end-use regulation of ODS and their SGG alternatives through a power to create regulations for this purpose, replacing State and Territory ODS and SGG end-use regulations that vary in both scope and nature;
	extend the scope and purpose of the Ozone Protection Special Account to include all costs and revenue associated with the amended Act and management of Australia's National Halon Bank; 
	introduce application fees for an exemp-tion to import or manufacture certain products containing or manufac-tured with ODS; and
	undertake a series of minor technical amendments to clarify the definition of “Protocol” for the purposes of the Act, and clarify the status of ODS and SGG imported for destruction.
That all sounds very worthy, but there are significant problems with this bill, and I would like to highlight some of those. For example, it has been argued that the bill is worthy of support because it improves legislation requiring review. However, this assessment is flawed for the following reasons. Firstly, it disregards the potential of natural refrigerants—as opposed to synthetic refrigerants—to replace fluorocarbons. The member for Wills has already made reference to concerns of peak environmental groups. The most significant of these is the exclusive focus on end-use controls on fluorocarbons taken by the bill and the unjustifiable dismissal in the explanatory memorandum of the potential for the uptake of non-ozone-depleting substances, non-SGG alternative substances and not-in-kind technologies such as hydrocarbons, ammonia, water and carbon dioxide.
The government has repeated fluorocarbon industry views that these substances and technologies are unproven or unsuitable. Amongst experts in the use of natural refrigerants there is no uncertainty about their suitability for use in a wide range of applications, and there is very strong interest in the refrigeration and airconditioning industry in pursuing these solutions. The government claims that a study being conducted into the suitability of natural refrigerants is needed to resolve uncertainty. The study referred to was undertaken at the behest of the natural refrigerants industry. It has been published in draft form and sheds very little new light on the suitability of alternatives, merely presenting instead a snapshot of opinion across different sectors of the industry. Taking firm action to encourage the use of natural refrigerants is not in any way dependent on the findings of the study, which is apparently being used by the government as an excuse for doing nothing. This outrageous attempt by the government to dodge the most pressing issues confronting the Australian refrigeration industry is simply unacceptable.
The use of hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, will expand dramatically in the next few years. There is therefore no excuse for the failure of the bill to provide for strong action to facilitate a transition to the use of other substances and technologies. The limited extent of the uptake to date says nothing about the potential of such environmentally benign technologies to replace fluorocarbons in most applications, and immediately. There is a real strategic requirement to make the adoption of natural refrigerants a priority of the act and its associated regulations. The feasibility of replacing fluorocarbons is demonstrated by a number of European Union member states that have gone further by proposing a phase-out of HFCs as the primary mechanism for minimising emissions. Additionally, clear guidance needs to be given by the parliament on the formation of the proposed national industry boards.
The detailed changes to the governance of the industry will be substantially determined by the regulation made under the legislation, in particular the establishment of national industry boards that will replace the current state based licensing system. I would like to talk a little about this issue. These new national boards will play a crucial role in influencing the performance and direction of the industry, and it is essential that the boards that are put in place to perform these functions enjoy the confidence and trust of the industry participants—not just the big end of town players and those with a vested interest, such as manufacturers of chemicals and equipment, but also those workers and contractors who are at the coalface, so to speak, in the installation and maintenance of airconditioning and refrigeration facilities. They're the ones who will be regulated! 
It is widely anticipated in the industry that the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council, NRAC, will be appointed by the government to administer the refrigeration industry board. Back in June, I asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage a number of questions about NRAC. The first related to the Australian Greenhouse Office having invested $3.6 million of taxpayers' funds in two organisations, Refrigerant Reclaim Australia and the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council Ltd through a Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program performance based grant to facilitate better handling and recovery of hydrofluorocarbon and perfluorocarbon refrigerants. According to the minister's reply this activity is expected to result in abatement of greenhouse gases equivalent to 3.58 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
My second question sought information on Refrigerant Reclaim Australia and NRAC in regard to their legal status, structures, directors, key operating personnel, and financial reporting. The minister revealed that Refrigerant Reclaim Australia, RRA, is a company limited by guarantee which exists primarily to be the trustee of the Ozone Depleting Substance Reclaim Trust. RRA is a not-for-profit industry-funded organisation that has been established to recover and destroy waste refrigerant gases. RRA has a board of directors and a chief executive. It contracts with professional organisations to effect the recovery, transport, storage and destruction of waste refrigerants, and, according to the minister, it utilises world best practice Australian-developed destruction technology to transform waste refrigerant to salts and water.
The minister further pointed out that the board of RRA is a vertical slice of the refrigeration and airconditioning industry, with representatives from importers, wholesalers, contractors and end users of refrigerants. Current directors are from five organisations: the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Contractors Association, the Australian Refrigeration Wholesalers Association, the Australian Fluorocarbon Association, the Vehicle Air-conditioning Specialists of Australasia and the Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Association. The Chief Executive of RRA is Michael Bennett. As RRA is not a publicly listed company, it is not required to produce public financial reports. However, RRA is required to report to the Australian Greenhouse Office on expenditure relating to its Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program grant. No such reports were available at the time of the minister's response to my question on this matter.
In regard to NRAC, we were informed that it is a not-for-profit, limited liability company with a board of directors and a chief executive officer. Current board members include representatives of the four organisations I have referred to but excluding the Australian Fluorocarbon Association, along with the Motor Traders Association of Australia, the Institute of Refrigeration Airconditioning Service Engineers, the Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air-condition-ing and Heating and the Air-conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association. Current directors are from the AIRAH; AREMA; ARWA; RACCA; VASA; and the AMCA. NRAC is currently preparing a financial report for the Australian Greenhouse Office covering the period from 19 September 2001, when the first funding was received, to 30 June 2003. That statement has not yet been received. 
I also asked a question seeking details of any contracts between these organisations and the government. We know that the Commonwealth signed Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program deeds of agreement with Refrigerant Reclaim Australia and the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council on 19 September 2001. As the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program is focused on the delivery of abatement in the Kyoto protocol commitment period, and these projects therefore need to continue throughout this period, the deeds of agreement do not expire until 2013.
There are therefore a number of questions that could be asked about the validity of the abatement methodology proposed by NRAC and the extent to which it is likely to succeed, and particularly about whether NRAC is achieving the milestones specified in the deed of agreement with the Australian Greenhouse Office. One of those milestones is the registration of contractors working in the refrigeration and airconditioning field. I understand that NRAC is way behind in the number of membership registrations it needs to have, yet it is quite explicit in its June 2002 annual report that it will be in deep trouble if the legislation before us is not passed to make the scheme compulsory.
Understandably there are substantial objections from many in the industry in regard to NRAC being handed this critical regulatory role. They include a number of small business operators in the airconditioning field in my electorate of Cunningham who came to see me earlier this year and raised concerns about the impact of this new national regime and the dominance of NRAC on an industry which is going along smoothly under the present state regulatory regime. Those local business operators were very concerned about the idea of NRAC coming in and regulating on a national scale.
As you can see from the above information, NRAC is dominated by refrigerant importers and large equipment manufacturers and has been greeted with great scepticism by contractors and other industry professionals. Reflective of this lack of trust by the industry in the NRAC are the very modest membership levels NRAC is understood to have achieved to date. A number of well-established industry associations worked cooperatively in the late 1980s and early 1990s to establish the state based controls and licensing requirements for CFCs and came up with effective and widely accepted arrangements. These industry associations and organisations are the repository of the technical knowledge and practical experience that is required to develop effective systems of control and management of the industry, and it is essential that they be assured of a decisive role in the establishment of the national industry boards under this legislation. It is imperative to the success of the national industry boards that they are comprised of a genuinely representative group of experienced industry professionals and that the industry is not placed under the control of a small group that does not have the confidence of the industry at large.
As I said in the debate on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 2003 earlier this year, we are in danger of allowing the industry dog to wag the regulatory tail. Workers and contractors in the industry do not want this and the government needs to recognise their voices and listen to them. A further consideration about this bill is that significant improvements can easily be achieved by taking time to consider amendments. Unfortunately the member for Wills has indicated the opposition's refusal to consider such amendments, citing them as `mischief' by the Greens, although our suggested amendments do go towards supporting natural refrigerants. 
When this bill reaches the Senate, the Greens will move to ban imports of synthetic greenhouse gases in small split-system airconditioners. Small domestic airconditioners imported into Australia and prefilled with synthetic greenhouse gases, called fluorocarbons, can be installed by unqualified tradespeople, which leads to the greenhouse gases leaking. If the airconditioners were imported without the gas inside, they would have to be installed by qualified tradespeople, which would stop thousands of tonnes of ozone depleting and greenhouse inducing gases from escaping to the atmosphere. This simple move would make a big contribution to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and is strongly supported by companies like Pioneer Air Conditioning and industry groups like the Heating and Cooling Association of Australia.
The Greens will also move amendments to the legislation to phase out synthetic greenhouse gases altogether and promote the move to natural refrigerants which harm neither the ozone layer nor the climate. The transition to natural refrigerants is well established in Europe and if Australia followed suit we would be well-positioned to lead the way in Asia. I therefore call on the government and the opposition to back the Greens move to ban imports of split-system airconditioners precharged with synthetic greenhouse gases and not to cave into pressure from the fluorocarbon users.
The Greens amendments to support the industry's call for a ban on the imports of split type refrigeration and airconditioning equipment precharged with HFCs and HCFCs will have a significant immediate and positive effect on improving industry practices and reducing emissions. The amendments aim to require that fluorocarbon refrigerants would have to be put into split systems—as opposed to sealed `packaged' systems—in Australia by licensed technicians, reducing leaks and waste from overcharged and/or incorrectly installed systems. An effect of this requirement will be to encourage the purchase of split type airconditioners from specialist airconditioning and refrigeration dealers and installers, who are licensed to handle refrigerant gases and are required to abide by best practice techniques to avoid leakage in the installation, operation and ongoing servicing of the equipment. Qualified professionals taking due care in the installation of split-system airconditioners is an important strategy to achieve substantial reductions in emissions from this rapidly growing sector of the industry.
The practical measure of requiring split-system airconditioners to be charged with a nitrogen holding charge instead of environmentally harmful refrigerants will provide an effective means of improving industry practice, reducing emissions and enhancing the efficient operation of airconditioning equipment. It will also help to support small- and medium-sized Australian companies and will assist them to make the investment in training their employees in best practice refrigerant handling techniques. Further significant improvements to the bill could be achieved by implementing the refrigerant classification and safety standard, AS1677 parts 1 and 2, and expanding the purposes for which funds established under the act may be used.
In summary, the government's approach encourages the overseas fluorocarbon industry while ignoring or hampering the domestic natural refrigeration industry. It is obvious that the fluorocarbon industry is concerned by the potential loss of market share they face from competition with products that are less damaging to the environment. This bill ignores numerous issues which, although largely unseen, have an impact on the lives of many Australians. The bill, as currently proposed, is seriously flawed and contains several problems that could be easily fixed. I would strongly urge the government to reconsider its position on this legislation and to take action to bring about improvements that will provide support to the Australian refrigeration and airconditioning industry and make a more substantial contribution to the reduction of harmful ozone depleting and global warming gases. Until it does, I cannot support the legislation in its present form as the government could so easily do much more to deal with this important issue.

"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on and support the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. This is a non-controversial bill. Although I understand that the Greens are not supporting this bill, the Labor opposition have indicated that they will support it. It is an important amendment that should have come before this parliament quite some time ago; in fact, it could have come before this parliament many weeks ago. The only reason that it has not come before the parliament is that the opposition would not agree to have this bill debated in the Main Committee. As honourable members would know, the debating time in this House is quite limited and the government's legislative agenda makes it quite difficult to get bills onto that agenda and debated in this House. However, there is the second chamber, which is available for debate and does have time available, and this bill could have been introduced into the Main Committee several weeks ago.
So the opposition has delayed the introduction of an important amendment which will help protect our environment and the ozone. I was disappointed to learn that, when industry sources approached the Labor opposition to clarify why this bill had not come before the Main Committee, they were informed apparently by the opposition that it was the government that was objecting to this bill being taken to the Main Committee. Nothing could be further from the truth. The government was keen to have this bill introduced and was prepared to take it to the Main Committee several weeks ago. Having said that, I am pleased that this bill is now in this chamber. It will hopefully be debated in the Senate as quickly as possible and it will shortly come into effect to help protect our environment and our ozone.
Australia's world-recognised efforts in ozone protection have been truly national efforts and have traditionally received support from all parties in the parliament. I am disappointed that the member for Cunningham, who represents the Greens, has left the chamber, but I will be interested to see the reasons why the Greens will not support this bill. I believe that the Greens are going to introduce some further amendments in the Senate. 
The introduction of the Ozone Protection Act by the Hawke Labor government in 1989 and subsequent amendments by the Keating government in 1995 received broad bipartisan support in this House. The important amendments we are considering today—which will result in one national program covering both ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used in what are termed the `Montreal Protocol industries'—will hopefully receive bipartisan support, and I really urge the Greens to reconsider some of the objections they have to this bill. 
The measures in this bill, which have the industry's full support and which were developed over a lengthy consultation period, will give Australia the most comprehensive package for minimising the atmospheric impact of these industries anywhere in the world. The government have made many comments about the Kyoto protocol, and we are very committed to reaching some of the commitments that were established at the Kyoto protocol. This bill is further evidence of the government's commitment to meet the Kyoto target of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions by 2008.  
While the government is pleased to put forward this bill and I am very pleased to speak in support of the amendment, I would also like to congratulate the industry associations that have worked closely with the government to develop a package of controls which will deliver the best practical outcomes to minimise the emissions of what are, after all, nonflammable, colourless and odourless gases. I would particularly like to congratulate Steve Anderson, the executive director of the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, and Mr Greg Groppenbacher, who also represents the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, for the work that they have done to ensure that the industry is well represented and for the work they have done to assist the government to put forward this bill.
The Australian Fluorocarbon Council has been a central and influential player in this area for some 15 years. The council is composed of representatives of all the major user groups and in particular has representatives from all the industry associations in the airconditioning and refrigeration industry. This structure has enabled the council to put forward a broadly based view to the government and draw on the expertise across the industry to develop practical responses to the environmental challenges that the industry faces.
I am aware that quite some time ago the industry came to the government with what it termed a `responsible use strategy'. Recognising that controls would, and indeed should, come, the Australian Fluorocarbon Council proposed a four-part strategy comprising: a ban on the use of disposable containers of fluorocarbon refrigerants; the extension of product stewardship obligations to cover all fluorocarbon refrigerants; the introduction of a national training and certification program for airconditioning technicians; and a general prohibition on emitting any fluorocarbon to the atmosphere when it can be practically prevented. I am pleased to say that all these elements will be put into place in one form or another under the provisions of this bill.
The Fluorocarbon Council has been responsible for a range of significant initiatives over the years which have earned it a number of awards from bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Perhaps the most significant of these was the establishment of Refrigerant Reclaim Australia, which I am advised is possibly the best organisation of its type in the world. To put it simply, Refrigerant Reclaim Australia is an industry-financed, not-for-profit organisation that is responsible for collecting and safely destroying any surplus or unusable fluorocarbon refrigerants anywhere in Australia. It is these refrigerants—the ones that cannot be used, the ones that have no economic value—that end up being emitted into the atmosphere, because obviously it is easy to discharge them into the atmosphere. As I said earlier, they are odourless and colourless gases, but unfortunately they have significant environmental impacts. 
Refrigerant Reclaim Australia achieves this by paying bounties for returned refrigerant, and this is financed via a voluntary industry levy. In its 10 years of operation, this organisation has destroyed approximately 900 tonnes of ozone depleting refrigerants—a magnificent effort that is helping to protect our environment and particularly help stop the depletion of our ozone. Unfortunately, since it is a voluntary organisation, not all companies pay the levy and we end up with this `free rider' issue that often creates serious problems with voluntary programs. While Refrigerant Reclaim Australia pays to take back and destroy everyone's refrigerant, unfortunately not everyone pays the levy—because as I said earlier it is a voluntary levy. 
This bill will help to place the product stewardship obligations across all of the refrigeration and airconditioning industry. While Refrigerant Reclaim Australia will remain a voluntary program, there will be no more free riding. Companies will pay a levy either to the organisation or to a similar body or they will make their own arrangements which will have to meet the standards set down by government.
A further example of the effective working relationship between government and industry has been the establishment of the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council. Established with assistance from the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council is composed of all relevant associations in the refrigeration and airconditioning industry. It is responsible for implementing a nationwide training and certification program for technicians and companies in the industry. While this group has made great progress, the difficulties of an effective voluntary program in this area are apparent. The bill will allow for the establishment of a mandatory national training and certification program for the airconditioning and refrigeration industry.
As I said earlier, this is a very important bill and I am disappointed that it has taken so long for it to come before the parliament. I would certainly urge those in the Senate to help, assist and speed the progress of this legislation through the Senate. I would appeal to the Greens to act constructively for once in their lives—to look at this bill, which is a great step forward in protecting our environment; to support the bill; and to support the government in what they do. I think the Greens are losing a great deal of credibility. Their stunt in the parliament recently during the visits of the President of the USA and the President of China certainly depleted their credibility. And as far as I am aware, the member for Cunningham—the sole Greens representative in this chamber—has never once supported the government. If they were in fact a party that was—
—If you did something decent, he might!
 (Ms Gambaro)—The member for Robertson has the call.
—Even the Labor Party on occasions supports the government! It really shows something of the mind-set of the Greens that they are not even prepared to look at the issues on the basis of merit and they simply vote against the government. This is an opportunity for the Greens to look at this issue and for once support what the government is trying to do.
This government has been at the forefront of protecting the environment, through many initiatives, such as the Natural Heritage Trust, which is the largest environmental program that has ever been introduced by any federal government to protect our environment. We receive little or no recognition for that, particularly from the Greens, but it is a program that is supported very strongly throughout the community, through Landcare and Dune Care and many other programs in the community. This is just one way of showing that the government is doing something for the environment.
The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is another way in which the government is showing that it is getting serious about protecting our environment. It is also an indication of how serious the industry is, not only in wanting to protect their industry but also to show that they are looking at a way of protecting the environment and ensuring that the airconditioning and refrigeration industries are seen as viable and long term, and are seen to be protecting the environment. The fact that these industries had already set up a voluntary levy that managed to reclaim a great deal of excess, surplus and useless ozone-depleting gases and had them destroyed in a way that was environmentally safe and did not contribute to the depletion of our ozone layer shows that industry is very serious about ensuring the protection of the environment. The fact that industry is prepared to work with government and put forward constructive ideas shows that it is also very serious about these issues. 
It is a great disappointment to me that a party such as the Greens, who claim to be a party for the environment, have damaged again their waning credibility by the fact that they have refused to support this amendment bill. I believe they are planning to obstruct the passage of this bill in the Senate, which will further delay a bill which is designed to enhance and protect our environment.",REPS,<title>OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—We are dealing with three bills here tonight, so it is a cognate debate. We are dealing with the  Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, and my comments, arguments and debate will essentially go to this main bill. Attendant upon that bill are the regulatory matters dealing with licence fees, so we also have the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003. These two sets of measures fundamentally simply update the current situation. They allow for a new range of licence fees to take into account what the central part of the bill is concerned with—that is, in particular, the synthetic greenhouse gases that have been so effective in reducing the deleterious effect on the ozone layer of the previous gases that were used.
What has been available since those gases—the CFCs and so on—were phased out has had a particular effect. It has been argued in this debate, quite rightly, that there has been an 80 per cent effect in terms of the lowering of the deleterious effect on the ozone layer as a result of Labor's 1989 policy, which was that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, should be written out of the additives that we had or the key components that we used, particularly for refrigeration.
This is a wonderful example of how you can get it right, in terms of dealing with manufactured goods. You can see a problem, clearly, in terms of deleterious or inappropriate effects in this instance: the effects of chlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer. When Labor were in government in 1989 we said that we should write down our usage of chlorofluorocarbons and that there would be a direct, scientifically measurable effect from putting this policy into practice. We can say all these years later, in 2003, that the Labor government were right and the scientific advice they had was correct. We can say it was a good, right, proper and just measure, indicating that you can effectively regulate the industry. We can say there is a direct correlation—a simple cause and effect—between the depletion of the ozone layer and the use of chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration, and in aerosol sprays, and if you reduce those properly you will see a measurable effect on the ozone layer.
We know from reports over the last two years, and particularly this year, that the increase in the rate of depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica has been arrested. In fact, the indication is that we are on the way back, in terms of dealing with the depletion of the ozone layer. The measures that we have taken and the measures that have been taken in America and in Europe, have had a direct and measurable effect. In particular, because we are contiguous with Antarctica, what we have done on this continent has borne fruit. We could rightly say that, responsibly, in government we did what was necessary. But, if you cast your mind back, if you think of the voices within the manufacturing industry at the time, and the voices in the debate generally, there was a great deal of hemming and hawing—a great deal of: `We don't know whether this is really possible; there would be a major impact on Australia's employment.' It was seen as too hard to do and the cost pressures were seen as too great. I would think that, given the effluxion of time—and we are talking about more than 14 years—everyone in the industry would now argue that this was a relatively easy thing to do once you recognised the necessity for it and coupled that, and the scientific work that went with it, with a government willing to put in tough legislation to make those changes. You can achieve good environmental outcomes if you have those connections. 
What does this bill deal with? It recognises that good policy can have good outcomes—and we have seen that over the last 14 years. But it also shows us that when you take a certain set of steps there can be, in the words of one particular past politician, `unintended consequences of your actions'. By substituting synthetic greenhouse gases—particularly hydrofluorocarbons and perflourocarbons—for the chlorofluorocarbons, the gases that initially caused problems with the ozone layer, we have fixed one problem and created another. This bill recognises that fact but does not do anything to fix it. It says we need to monitor this closely and that we need to bring in a regime, through the attendant bills, where we do the proper licensing and so on, and get people to actually think about what they are doing. But there is a continuing problem here. Those gases that were substituted are doing the job of protecting the ozone layer, and the campaign in the seventies and eighties to address this evident problem had its effect. But when they made the change, they did not predict—and it may have been possible to predict but, as far as I know, no-one did so at the time—that the synthetic gases would reduce ozone depletion but at the same time would increase the greenhouse effect massively. What is argued in the explanatory memorandum and the background papers is quite simple. It is argued that these gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer but are potent greenhouse gases, with their emissions having an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis.
Reading that, you would think that here is a major and significant problem. The propensity of these two substitutes is to create a far greater problem than we have seen before. What you have to do then, of course, is take the next step and say, `What is the relative proportion of these gases in terms of our total use?' If you look at the background work that has been done on this you will see that they in fact make up only a very small part of our overall greenhouse gas emissions, and their use as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances is on the rise, so we have more of them. You would have to ask how significant a problem this is going to be if they fix one problem and help to create another one—and push that forward.
This bill really does not have much of an answer to that, except to say, `They're there, and we'll keep a bit of an eye on it, but we're not really sure.' If you look at the explanatory memorandum, it says that the bill will deliver on commitments to manage these synthetic greenhouse gas emissions—and that is detailed in measure 7.2 of the National Greenhouse Strategy. The second reading speech also asserts that the amendments implement the key recommendations of the government's review of the Commonwealth ozone protection legislation under the national competition policy, but they do not fix the problem. They say, `The one core thing they were meant to do in 1989 is done, but we have to leave the rest in abeyance.' 
What has the response been to that? The response has been that, in part, the size of the usage is much smaller when compared to the rest of the uses we have and the greenhouse gas problems we have through diesel particulates or through petrol-driven cars. They are a much greater concern than what is created here. Therefore, when you look at that on balance, you would say that they may not be as significant a problem. However, if you are looking at fixing the problem finally, you could propose that, instead of using these substitutes, we should look at natural refrigerants. It has been argued fairly extensively that that is a better way to go.
I am sure that since refrigeration was first discovered and since Australia first established a significant meat trade with Britain—at the end of the 1800s, from 1875 or so onwards—the value of refrigeration has been experienced and appreciated by people at both ends of the trading spectrum. Certainly those people in Australia who had the benefit of refrigeration in the 1940s and 1950s appreciated it. There was not too much of it around in Bankstown on a household basis. I can still remember my grandmother, coming from the country as she did, using extremely old methods of refrigeration until finally she bought an American Kelvinator and introduced the wonderful world of modern refrigeration to her house in Bankstown. If you think about it, it has been just over 50 years that we have had a completely different way of preserving our food and having the benefit of that in what is a very modern context compared to what went before it.
If you look at the broader question of change here, I am sure that if you talk to most of the manufacturers now and you put the question to them: `Would you use chlorofluorocarbons again, knowing what you know about their ozone depleting character and nature?' most of them would say: `No. Given that we've got these substitutes—the hydrofluorocarbons and the perfluorocarbons—we're happy to go along and use those.' If you put the attendant question to them: `What about substituting those with natural refrigerants?' currently they would say: `We haven't seen all that much research around in terms of doing that. We'd like to do the right thing by the environment, but where's the evidence that these things will do their job?'
There is a correlative problem that is probably greater than what it was some years ago. If I think about the number of refrigerators that I have—I have added it up—I have about seven that I am responsible for. It used to be only one. If I think about my own house, I have one in the garage. Luckily I have that, because the one we bought four years ago broke down a couple of weeks ago. Because Fisher and Paykel are now running out of New Zealand, they do not supply parts except through Queensland via New Zealand. The computer boards they have have to be remanufactured. We have been waiting about four weeks now—if you do not go through a Fisher and Paykel bloke—to get the fridge back. Luckily we still have the old Kelvinator. A number of years ago when my wife wanted to change this, Jack Fitzpatrick, who was the president of the Central Bankstown branch of the ALP and who also ran JJs Electrics and Sporting Goods store, said, `Why don't you just use the old one? It'll go for another 30 years.' He was actually quite right. That used chlorofluorocarbons but it still runs. We know that modern refrigerators, like modern cooking appliances, have built-in obsolescence. 
Even when you move from chlorofluorocarbons to the modern equivalents—the hydrocarbons or the perfluorocarbons—you have a problem in that you have to throw these things out on a far more regular basis. Not only is there then the question of what is emitted when you are using them; there is also the problem, if you are going to throw the appliance out—hopefully we will not have to do that; hopefully this board will work—of the impact of that on the environment. That is something that 20 years ago we did not have to take into account so readily. We know that obsolescence is a problem in the computer industry, but the problem is increasing because most of our manufacturing in the whitegoods area is based on a simple proposition. What you get in the marketplace is based on price rather than on price, cost efficiency, quality and so on. While most whitegoods are based on price, they have a very short-term running cycle.
Economies have changed over that 50-year period since we have had extensive refrigeration in Australia and, therefore, the impacts have changed as well. Those things which can cause deleterious effects can do so in unexpected ways. Very few people would have expected that they would have to replace their whitegoods on such a regular basis. I know, Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, that you and the minister at the table, the member for Curtin, and all of those people, male or female, who have had to deal with these domestic problems understand fully that the world has changed and that we have this increased obsolescence. As legislators we need to be aware of that, and the bill that we have before us now deals with only part of the problem.
It is an indication as well that, when you are dealing with changes in technology, you are also dealing with unexpected or unintended consequences. You can hope and expect that natural refrigerants might be used. My grandmother used one—it was called a block of ice. We know that, prior to ice becoming significantly available, ice-runs went through the streets, such as those in Greenacre. In fact, my grandfather had an ice-run in Bankstown in competition with the Foxes. Ice was quite available and was a natural refrigerant.
It was better, I suppose, for the environment than the kerosene based fridges that were used at the time but no-one has yet come up with something that is significantly easy to use in terms of natural refrigerants. Those who argue that it is simple to solve these problems can readily say, `Why don't you use the natural methods?' Companies would do so if those problems were easily solved. What the legislation indicates is this: at any particular point in time, whether it is 1989 or 2003, a government acting in the best interests of its people will use the current state of scientific knowledge to attack a problem. That is what we did in 1989. That is when the projection was that if you decreased chlorofluorocarbon use we would be able to fix the problem with the ozone layer. All the scientific evidence that we have indicates that that is in fact coming true, that the probability is that we will be able to solve that one. Now we have a correlative problem in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
As the member for Bonython, who will be speaking later in this debate, has pointed out time and time again, the larger problem we have with greenhouse gases is the fact that our energy uses are so dependent on petrol or diesel products and we do not use the great natural advantage that we have got—natural gas. Its impact on greenhouse gases, if it were more broadly adopted, would be far less than what we have got from petrol-driven engines and the effect throughout industry of using diesel. Australia does not have a policy which would force people, by dint of circumstance but also by dint of government action, to really look closely at their energy use and the effect that energy use has on greenhouse gases. 
Labor forced that to happen in 1989 with our legislation on ozone protection. But where the synthetic fuels have created a greenhouse problem we do not have any kind of government grasp of this significant problem and of the fact that we have major overuse of not just these gases but also petrol and diesel. By substituting natural gas, we could therefore dramatically cut our use of those greenhouse gases, deliver to the people of Australia a better product at a cheaper price and revolutionise the way that we deal with the problems we have now in terms of the Kyoto protocol by pushing in that way. What we have seen, as no doubt the member for Bonython and my colleagues will attest, is no government commitment whatsoever to grasping this problem by understanding it or putting in place a set of protocols that could actually deal with it. This legislation, in passing form, attempts: (1) to recognise the strength of what Labor did (2) to press forward with the solutions that we provided, but (3) to not really have a new program put into place to deal with the unintended consequences of those synthetic greenhouse gases that have caused this significant problem.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—I am delighted to rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003. I do so knowing that earlier today I rose and spoke about the death, the passing, of Gareth Hardin, who wrote `The tragedy of the commons' in 1968 and published that in the journal Science. As I mentioned earlier today, that was one of the seminal environmental treatises of the 20th century. When I spoke of it earlier today, I spoke of it in the context of a localised example of a tragedy of the commons: the soiling of Gunnamatta beach, the staining of the oceans and the waste of water which occurred off my own electorate. This legislation addresses the alternative. It addresses a global example of the tragedy of the commons. Hardin's thesis was simple. Hardin's thesis was that, in a world full of rational actors, there is a certain amount that each of us could do and each of us could contribute to the environment. If there is a group of herdsmen who surround a commons and if each grazes one cow, that commons can accommodate them. If, as a rational actor, an individual herdsman grazes an additional cow, that is to his or her benefit. But if all do the same, they exhaust that resource. That is essentially what is meant by the commons: that intuitive commonsense for an individual amounts to collective failure when allowed without looking at it from an overview.
That is what this legislation and the whole notion of modern environmentalism focuses on. It focuses on one word, one concept: externalities. Externalities are those things which are by-products of an individual's or a group's actions and which are not borne by that individual or that group. When the actions of a series of groups become the actions of states, which become the actions of nations and which become the actions of continents and there is no single collective responsibility, then we have systemic failure. That was what Hardin recognised in 1968, that is what Rachel Carson recognised half a decade earlier with a treatise called `Silent Spring', and that is what came to pass with the gradual erosion and depletion of the ozone layer. That ozone layer is part of our protective shield. It shields us from the sun's rays, it allows our crops to grow and it protects many parts of the way in which the natural planet functions. Our actions taken collectively, not with collective malice but with collective indifference, were leading inexorably to not just depletion but collapse of the earth's protective ozone layer. In that context, these bill being debated cognately are part of the global response, not just the Australian response, to dealing with the problem of depleted ozone. Fundamentally, at their best these bills are about making an investment not for us but for our children and for their children so that the legacy we bequeath is not a worse world but an improvement in the quality of life without the trade-off of destroying the very incubator in which they live. 
Essentially, the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Ozone Protection Act 1989. It introduces new controls for substances that have detrimental impacts on the atmosphere. They are, firstly, ozone depleting substances—those which through collective use and the effluxion of time destroy the ozone layer—and, secondly, synthetic greenhouse gases which are used as alternatives to ozone depleting substances. One of the great dangers we have is the very simple notion of robbing Peter to pay Paul if we try to solve one problem by creating a problem in another area, albeit inadvertently. These controls are introduced for the purposes of implementing Australia's obligations to minimise the consumption and emission of ozone under the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
I want to address these concerns in three phases: firstly, to understand a little of the background to these bills; secondly, to understand their importance; and, thirdly, to examine some of the core provisions which they enshrine. Looking at the background, what we see is that ozone depletion is a global problem, but it also provides perhaps the pre-eminent example of international cooperation to tackle an international problem. It is a significant problem, not just globally but in particular for Australia, because of the specific damage to that portion of the ozone layer which overreaches Australia. The causes of this significant ozone loss over Australia, particularly over southern Australia and the polar regions, have been the growing levels of ozone depleting substances in the upper atmosphere, known as the stratosphere.
The 1989 Montreal protocol has provided the framework for Australia's response to ozone depletion, and it has provided the framework for an international response. The previous steady rate of increase in the global atmospheric concentration of ozone depleting substances has slowed significantly in recent years. Scientists attribute this to adherence to the bans in the Montreal protocol. It is a successful example of an international agreement acting in the collective interest. In that context, global measures are seen to be having an effect. Critically, as a result of the decision to introduce this, there has been a great growth in alternative technology. It is a classic example of sustainability driving innovation. We forget sometimes when we look at the status quo of the world that we are incredibly innovative. When we resist the alternatives and stay with the old ways, we are often taking a more inefficient path. As a result of the Montreal protocol and the obligations we imposed upon ourselves, there are now many alternatives to ozone depleting substances.
What has happened in Australia is that we have phased out chlorofluorocarbons for general use. Only very small amounts are now used for essential purposes. Halons and methyl chloroform have also been phased out. In addition to that, in the phase-out process other compounds—hydro-chloro-fluorocarbons—were substituted for CFC use. Importantly, these have a much lower ozone depleting potential than CFCs, although there is still damage and we must work to provide alternatives and to eliminate these substances. What is interesting is the overview. Emissions are being held at 1989 levels. Not only is the phase-out target of 2020 on track; Australia is ahead of its obligation in its targets for its 2020 goals. 
One of the things I talked about earlier today was the notion of a national sustainability initiative—a broad based initiative which covered the four spheres of water, land and biodiversity, human settlements and energy, and the atmosphere. What we see here is one example of setting a generational goal, setting a regime in place to achieve it and establishing a protocol and a policy program by which we set out to pursue physical changes in the way in which we live. That is a process that I believe we need to take part in as a nation, to set across all of those core sectors so that we have goals for ozone depletion, for a reduction in land clearing and for establishing in Australia total wooded biomass—or the total volume of wood that is alive and growing in our fields. It is so that we have goals for the flow of water and for the absolute cessation of all ocean outfalls by the year 2025. The target of 2020 for the elimination of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances from the Australian landscape is one which I believe is a single example of what should be a national, broad based approach to the creation of a national sustainability initiative.
These bills have two primary purposes: firstly, to ensure that Australia has a truly national regulatory scheme for the management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacement and, secondly, to ensure that Australia—both for reasons of self-interest and good citizenship—remains an international leader on action to preserve the earth's ozone layer. Their two purposes are, firstly, to ensure that we have an adequate, real, hard, practical regulatory scheme and, secondly, to show that we are playing our part, doing our bit and holding up our responsibilities. In that context, what we find when looking at the importance of the bills is that they set out to address the issue of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases.
I also want to mention, very simply, some of the core provisions of the bill. Item 4 amends paragraph 3(a) of the act to replace the reference to the `convention and the protocol' with the `Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol' so as to clarify our international agreements. Perhaps most significantly, item 6 amends the bill to incorporate two objectives into the act: it institutes controls on the manufacture, import, export and use of substitute greenhouse gases to give effect to Australia's obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and it promotes, argues for and establishes the framework for responsible use and management of all ozone-depleting substances controlled under the act so as to minimise their impact on the atmosphere. There are a lot of elements but, essentially, it puts in place a harder, more advanced regime than that which already exists for ozone-depleting substances and substitute greenhouse gas substances.
I want to step back for a moment and return to Garrett Hardin. Looking back at the work he completed almost 35 years ago, we see that his thesis was spot-on. It recognised that our actions, which may be taken inadvertently and collectively, could lead to a negative and, in some cases, potentially catastrophic effect either at the local level or at the global level. These bills are an acknowledgment of Garrett Hardin's work, which recognised that we can take steps and transform the way we do business, and we can take steps and have an impact on our global environment. We are already seeing a dramatic change in the way in which we deal with ozone. There is more to be done, whether it is in our greenhouse gas emissions, in our water use or in our land clearance. These are things which my generation has a responsibility to take up, and we are doing that. We do it with a passion, with a commitment and with fervour. I am delighted to commend these bills to the House, and I wish them safe passage.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—It is the case that the world has recently started to confront a number of global problems in relation to the environment, and the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and related bills deal with two of the most serious of those problems. The first one I want to refer to is the challenge of the depletion of the ozone layer by a number of chemicals which have been entering the atmosphere—such as the chlorofluorocarbons—and which have been released over recent decades as a result of industrial processes. This has brought about the well-known problem of the ozone hole. It has increased the amount of ultraviolet radiation which can strike the earth, particularly in Australia where we are most vulnerable to the problem. 
The challenge has been met by the Montreal protocol, although the history of that has been somewhat chequered since the world first started to address this issue. Indeed, it is worth noting that, at the time this problem was first identified by scientists, it was the United States government which first wanted to address it seriously. The European Community to some extent resisted that challenge by the United States and actually took some time to come on board to meet that global challenge and agree to a worldwide measure that would seek to prevent those chemicals from escaping into the atmosphere and depleting the ozone layer. Finally, a protocol was adopted which has had a relatively significant impact on the escape of those chemicals into the atmosphere and which has been fairly much accepted by the worldwide community. It has had some degree of success by way of scientific and verifiable measure. It has had a degree of achievement, although it will be many years—from recent reports, I understand probably up to 50 years—before we can declare victory and move on from that particular challenge and see the ozone hole repaired. As is the case with many of these environmental challenges, it is relatively easy to release these compounds into the atmosphere, into the water or into the soil, but it is quite difficult to see those chemicals degraded and removed from the global environment. Of course, that is especially the case with many of these chlorofluorocarbons and related compounds. They are long-lived compounds in the environment and they take some time to break down, whereas they readily mop up ozone and easily remove ozone from the atmosphere. Their deleterious impact on the environment is quite quick. It is much harder to take them out of the equation that it is to put them into the equation. So we will have to wait a little longer for the cure to take effect.
However, the fact that the world has been able to agree, in the relatively short space of a decade or so, on a global protocol which has had reasonable success in being enforced throughout the world at a practical level in terms of stopping the trade in those chemicals, stopping the production of those chemicals and seeing the introduction of a reasonable range of substitute chemicals and industrial practices which will prevent the release of those chemicals, as other members have indicated in this evening's debate, I think is a great credit to global organisation. It is also a great credit to global science in identifying the problem in the first place, in cooperating on a collaborative basis, in tracking the problem, in bringing it to the attention of the world's governments, in seeing the problem through in terms of enforcement, cooperation, and prevention of the manufacture and distribution of those chemicals, in seeing the outcomes through and, finally, we hope, in tracking the gradual reduction of the ozone depletion in the atmosphere and in measuring the gradual and total closure of the hole. However, more than that, because that is just a final symptom of the ozone depletion, I suspect there will be total resolution of the problem in a decades-long time frame, and we are well on track to that. 
That relates quite well to the other aspect of this legislation, which is of course greenhouse, but the two are more interrelated than that. They are both global problems which relate not only to the global science community, the global diplomatic community and governmental communities but also to the global industrial communities and the global economic community, because all these things are interrelated in how we deal with them. Just as the world comes to grips with environmental problems at this level, to some extent we also fortunately have the infrastructure at the scientific and diplomatic levels to begin to grapple with these problems. I would certainly accept, as many other members would as well, that we do not have the infrastructure at the scientific, diplomatic and governmental levels to resolve them as such, but we certainly—fortunately—have the infrastructure at those levels to at least make a reasonable effort to come to grips with them.
That is why we have before us, in another context, treaties such as Kyoto as well as those like the Montreal protocol. As a member of the treaties committee of this parliament, I have seen many other related documents which at least show the world's governments are making a serious effort to deal with all these interrelated efforts. Of course, many of the same chemicals which we have had to deal with at an industrial and scientific level in relation to the ozone problem are also greenhouse gases, and vice versa: those gases which contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect also contribute to ozone depletion.
It is very much the case that we need to bring some serious science to dealing with both of these problems. But it is not only science that needs to be brought to bear when dealing with them. It was the case with ozone and it is much more so the case with greenhouse that we need to apply much more than just science, although science of course is fundamental to identifying and quantifying the problem and looking for solutions. But economics and statistics are also vital parts of this fundamental equation. It is those to which I would like to turn the balance of my remarks this evening and when I later resume my remarks.
As is the case with the greenhouse issues, with which this bill also deals, statistics and economics will play a fundamental role because the greenhouse question, like the ozone question, will be played out over a very long period of time. Part of the reason for that is a statistical and economic question. While it is the case that ozone-depleting chemicals are in the atmosphere for a long period of time doing the damage that they do to the ozone layer, it is also the case that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases—there are at least six major greenhouse gases that we have identified, along with water vapour, that do serious harm to our planet in the context of greenhouse and accumulating heat—remain in the atmosphere for a long time. We need to look at the statistical base of how those who are looking at the greenhouse issue have done their calculations because this will have a significant policy impact on how parliaments and governments deal with this issue. 
I would like to draw the parliament's attention to the work of Ian Castles and David Henderson because it is very relevant to the way in which we approach this. Ian Castles is well known to Australians and Australian government officials. He is now at the National Centre for Development Studies at the Australian National University but he was formerly the head of Australia's national office of statistics, the ABS. David Henderson, who is now at the Westminster Business School in the UK, was formerly the Chief Economist of the OECD. So both gentlemen are very substantial figures in the statistical world with very significant backgrounds.
Both have been recently doing some work on the way in which we might look at the background calculations which underlie the Special report on emissions scenarios. This report was put together by the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was the base work for the Kyoto treaty—the base work on which everyone looks at climate change. So it is very important that when you look forward at the projections—the temperature change projections which underlie all the work on Kyoto, greenhouse and temperature change—you look at the underlying statistical work which projects forward the CO2 increases in the atmosphere and you look at the underlying statistical work which supports it. These two gentlemen have done a lot of work on that and they have looked at the economics and the statistics which underlie that basic work.
While I and my colleagues on this side of the House could not be described in any way as greenhouse sceptics—far from it—I take the view very strongly, as do my colleagues, that we face a very serious challenge from greenhouse and global warming on planet earth; that climate change, like ozone before it, is the most serious environmental challenge that the planet faces at the moment; and that the Kyoto treaty is one of the best ways we have of addressing that challenge. So now we have to look forward and see how we can address these issues in a very serious and stable way.
To do that we have to look very closely at the emissions scenarios that underpin these challenges. We need to be certain that the statistical bases and the projections which underlie them are as sound as they possibly can be so that, when we make projections about the temperature changes and we ask governments, populations and voters to make sacrifices and changes to the underlying economy that supports our own country and other people's economic bases, we do it in a way that we have confidence in and that we can ask them to have confidence in. To do that, we have to be very certain of the projections we make. That is a very important basis for the work which Henderson and Castles have done and which I would like to share with the House in this context. The work they have put forward is very fundamental to this. In fact, some of those projections do cast doubt on the basis of the work of the IPCC.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2003-11-03,"—I rise in support of a constituent of mine in Newcastle, Mr Chris Gorman, who is in the chamber tonight. Chris has achieved something extraordinary. He has sufficiently overcome the emotional distress caused by his personal experience as an innocent victim of child abuse to publish a moving book outlining his life's journey. This journey winds through a childhood characterised by poverty, neglect, grief and sexual abuse, fortunately towards stronger friendships and more loving family relationships but most importantly toward some understanding, acceptance and self-respect. But the journey has been a troubled one, punctuated by depression, mood swings, emotional break-downs and relationship failures—nothing atypical for those people traumatised in their youth by abuse.
Chris was born in Limerick, Ireland, just after the end of World War II. When he was four, his mother died and although he had a father it would be reasonable to say his father was an ever-absent one who basically abandoned his parenting role. What Chris may not have understood is that the loss of one's mother before the age of 12 is considered to be the trauma most likely to leave a legacy of emotional scarring. But of course there was more for Chris.
His book is titled A Hole in My Heart—a hole and an emptiness created by the loss of his mother at such a tender age, a hole that has taken a long time to fill. Chris experienced sexual abuse from the age of seven in both the home of relatives and an orphanage—that is, in places where children should be both secure and safe. Last week everyone's ABC televised a Welsh movie based on child abuse. It was truly a moving and revealing exposition of the reality of child abuse. At the end of that movie a silent statement was shown telling that, of the 52 council areas in the UK, 42 were undergoing investigations into the abuse of children in council institutions, a terrible indictment on the caring role of government in Britain, which is of course where Chris grew up. Regrettably the movie was shown just before midnight, not really a popular viewing time—but then child abuse is not really a popular subject, although it is experienced by so many.
In his 20s, Chris had what he sees now as the good fortune to come to Australia, where his new life began. Although he would be grateful to call Australia home, his time here has had its struggles too, particularly with his emotional health and the health of his relationships. But Chris was eventually assisted by a TAFE counsellor after enrolling at TAFE to take on the challenge of improving his literacy and numeracy skills, which were affected by his disjointed education and the troubled times of his youth. I must say this illustrates the wonderful spin-offs for students of all ages provided through our public education institutions. 
In his book, Chris urges others who may have had the same experiences as he has had to take up counselling opportunities. Although counselling has allowed Chris to confront his past and his suffering at the hands of adults, it has also brought to life again—as it does—the dreadful memories of domination and brutalisation by adults, betrayal by adults who should have listened and believed him and helped him, the lack of trust he then had for others, the fear of rejection living with him forever and the guilt and shame no child should ever feel. I quote from Chris's book. He says:
I've had to grapple this `hole in my heart' for most of my life—in writing this book I am closing the hole and look toward a healthier future—with clarity, strength and pride.
I commend Chris on his achievement in publishing this book, which I am told is a sell-out, and for his attempts to help others. Chris's challenge now is perhaps the most difficult one, and that is to find ways to let go. 
Recently in Australia we marked Child Abuse Week and poverty week. Chris's story reminds us that Australian children are still at risk of abuse and neglect, and it is to our shame that we as a nation have not sufficiently responded to protect our most vulnerable and to help those who have been harmed to recover and heal. Having spent three decades in schools as a teacher and principal, I know the pain and grief when a child discloses their experiences of abuse. We must as a nation make more concerted efforts to protect our children and ensure their early lives are ones of wonder and joy instead of struggle and harm. I therefore recommend to the House Labor's plan for a national commissioner for children and young people and encourage the government to do more to protect our children wherever they live and whatever their circumstances.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Child Abuse</title>,Adjournment,24,1,speech

"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-03,"—The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1)-(11)	The number of employers covered by the Superannuation Guarantee (SG) regime is estimated to be 900,000. 
Independent SG compliance surveys have, historically, been commissioned by the ATO. Information in relation to employer compliance with the SG can be found in the relevant Annual reports published by the Commissioner of Taxation. 
In the period 1 July 1996 to 31 July 2002 there have been notifications of insufficient contributions made in respect of 42,588 employers. The actual number of employee complaints in this period would exceed this figure, as complaints against employers are often received from more than one employee.
As a general rule, an employer is contacted within 14 days of an employee notification of insufficient contributions being lodged. A final notice is issued 30 days after the SG debt is raised. A notice of impending legal action is issued approximately 30 days after this final notice where debts remain outstanding.  
Legal action is commenced where payment is not received or there is no satisfactory arrangement to pay in place. The period before legal action is commenced is dependent on many factors.
During the period 10 September 1995 to 31 August 2002 there were a total of 3459 cases where “legal action” involving the courts was taken in relation to Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) debts. Information regarding the success of these actions, where the matter has actually been resolved through the courts, is not readily available from ATO records but is a matter of public record. 
Information regarding the number of complaints resolved with full payment by the employer of all outstanding monies is not readily available, and in any event would be potentially misleading. It should be noted that not all complaints received by the ATO indicate that an employer has failed to make superannuation contributions. Some complaints arise because employees are unaware of the destination of their superannuation contributions. To combat this problem the Government has amended the SG regime to require employers to advise employees of the destination of superannuation contributions made to accumulation funds (from 1 July 2003).
It is not possible to accurately estimate the number of employees who have not received the superannuation guarantee contributions to which they are legally entitled, as the SG system is a self-assessment system. Whilst the ATO does conduct audit activities, the main sources of information about employer non-compliance are sourced from employees, employer self-assessments and broad based research conducted from time to time - all of which indicate a high level of employer compliance.
No estimate of the number of employees who have lost their SG entitlement due to employer bankruptcy or receivership is available. This is because no information is collected by the ATO in relation to superannuation contributions that have not been paid prior to bankruptcy or liquidation. 
The ATO is only empowered to act to collect the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) when an employer has failed to make the appropriate contributions by 28 July following the end of the relevant financial year. The ATO cannot act on unpaid contributions where the SGC debt has not crystallised. Any estimate would therefore be misleading. The Government has recently moved to require employers to make a minimum of quarterly superannuation contributions, to reduce the amount of superannuation contributions at risk should an employer become insolvent.
For the same reasons, the number of employers that may have failed to make contributions because of insolvency is unknown.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Contributions</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,26,1,answer
