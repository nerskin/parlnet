"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-08-24,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. Does the minister recall announcing funding under the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program for the Frankston Community Arts Centre on 15 September last year? Does he recall telling local journalists that the lobbying by Dunkley MP Bruce Billson was a critical factor in securing the $1.5 million grant, as was reported in the Frankston Standard  on 21 September? Precisely what weight did the minister and Senator Hill give the intervention of the party room colleagues in vulnerable coalition seats in their deliberations over the allocation of the $70 million fund? Was this Frankston grant one of the 16 bottom drawer projects?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-08-24,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister that he said that Mr Billson was a critical factor. Secondly, I remind the minister that I asked whether this Frankston centre was one of the 16 bottom drawer projects. He knows what I mean. Finally, isn't it a fact that the ministers had their own points system employed on the 16 occasions when they rejected official advice 
 and that their scheme involved the electoral pendulum and a highlighter pen?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-08-24,"—First of all, I do not know any Mr Bruce Billston. I am surprised that someone who has been trying to chase the seat of Holt for some years would not at least pass through Dunkley from time to time and see a few signposts up. Obviously you did not need any assistance from the local member. Certainly, there was no shortage of people offering their comments on their pet projects—and that is not confined to our side of the chamber. I suspect that most of you were asleep at the wheel and did not bother. That was the real problem. You were scurrying around taking instructions from the ACTU when you should have been out in the community looking at what sorts of projects there were that might have deserved support. That would have been a lot more productive.
I certainly do recall paying a visit down there and I remember that it struck me at the time that it completely vindicated the objective decision we had made on the merits of 
 the project. That is always very important. I think that was one of a number of the projects that would withstand close scrutiny—in fact, all of the projects would. That is critically important if the Labor Party wants to continue to rabbit on about this issue. I have to say it must have been a bit gloomy this morning when the old tactics committee got together and said, `What have we got to show for yesterday?' There were five questions on the subject, and all they got was a bit of a run in the Aus which confirmed the proposition that I put yesterday, and that was that you do not slavishly follow the advice of bureaucrats.
Let us get back to the main game here. If the Labor Party are critical of these projects, do they object to the restoration of the Great Synagogue Tower in the Sydney seat of Sydney? Do they object to the restoration of the Polly Woodside and Federation Tapestry in the seat of Melbourne? Do they object to the restoration of the Naval Stores and the Commissariat Museum in a Brisbane marginal seat? Do they object to the National Wool Museum in Corio, or the development of the Tuggeranong Homestead in Canberra? One could go on. The fact is that Senator Faulkner put his very big foot in this some days ago when he claimed that there were 16 shonky projects. All I can suggest to you is that when you get together for the post mortem afterwards you start to do a bit of serious homework, you go through these projects and try and make some judgments—you might even get Senator Collins to visit a couple more of them. She might even find out who the local members are, and then you can start to make a judgment about whether these projects were worth while. When you do that, I think you will find that they all stack up very well indeed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-08-24,"—No, no, I think you have to go back about three or four years to find that sort of system in operation, and I think we all know who invented that scheme. Of course, it sounds as though nothing has been learnt from that fiasco. The fact that Mr Billson might have been critical of the project really did not come into our considerations. I am interested that the experts in bottom fishing on the other side somehow think that because we exercise independent judgment we are rejecting advice. This is just a canard that has been peddled by the likes of Senator Faulkner for weeks on end. This must be about the fifth occasion that he has tried to get this issue off the ground. It has gone nowhere for the simple reason that everyone who has studied it understands that there is a discretion there. What the bureaucrats actually said was, `If you want to take the cut-off point that we insert arbitrarily, you only need to look at 114.' We actually did our homework and looked at the lot.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-08-24,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. The minister will be aware of the need to further improve communications services in regional and rural Australia. Will the minister inform the Senate of any recent advances in this area and is the minister aware of any alternative policy proposals? What would be the impact if these alternatives were implemented?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telecommunications: Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-08-24,"—We are certainly aware of the need to improve services in regional 
 areas. The tragedy, of course, is that only one-half of the parliament seems to have the same view. We only have to go back to the early 1990s when that extraordinary deal was made to phase out the analog service without any replacement in prospect, and then, to compound the felony, to sign up to legal agreements which would have exposed the Commonwealth to hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The idea of simply doing a deal without having any idea of what might follow was probably the height of short-sighted stupidity, and demonstrates without doubt that the Labor Party was not interested in letting the technologies sort themselves out or in trying to develop a long-term policy approach.
Senator Bourne interjecting—
—Do not get excited—you will get a cheap phone in the very near future because I am about to confirm that today Telstra has announced the new pricing structure and services for the CDMA network. Senator Allison, I know, will be particularly interested in that, because dual mode handsets will be available for $69. I am not here to spruik, but that does sound, on the face of it, like a pretty good deal. I am particularly pleased about the fact that we do now have world-class technology available in competition with GSM, which in itself is world-class, and for the first time we will have a very decent range of competitive alternatives in the marketplace.
By the end of next year CDMA will be available in all analog areas, and Telstra has confirmed that it plans to extend CDMA into areas not previously covered by analog. Telstra analog customers will be able to connect to CDMA with no connection fee. I do not need to remind the Senate of the inherent superiority of digital services, but certainly CDMA and GSM will offer services such as advanced message bank, call forwarding, calling number display and call waiting, and, when we get to the third generation, even Senator Lundy will be able to work out which button to press to be able to access the Internet. You will have your own flat panel screen that will fold out and you will be able to play to your heart's content.
While you are taking time off to claim for your RSI disability, can I entreat the Labor Party to simply reconsider the Luddite position they adopted at the last election. Remember Senator Schacht? This is his great claim to fame, apart from being the almost endorsed candidate for Makin—and we wish him well in that regard. Makin will be a very tough call, but if anyone from Labor can do it, Senator Schacht can. But his lasting contribution to ensuring the Labor Party lost the last election was to bag the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. There was about $150 million left in it, but they said they would freeze it. That came on top of being opposed to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund a few years back, and when the Telstra bill came up in the chamber only a matter of a few months ago they were at it again. It was tragic. Senator Boswell had a field day going all around Queensland—he even went outside his home state—pointing out the fact that we had a whole series of initiatives to benefit regional and rural Australia and the Labor Party opposed every one of them. That is the tragedy: they have no interest at all in attending to the needs of regional and rural Australia. Today also happens to be the day on which the final four per cent will get their digital data connections—very good news for rural Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telecommunications: Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-08-24,"—Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator Stott Despoja about the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act and the establishment of a radiation and health safety advisory council. I sought an answer from the minister. I seek leave to incorporate that answer in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator STOTT DESPOJA —My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Is the minister aware that, under the ARPANSA legislation, a Radiation and Health Safety Advisory Council is established which has a community representative. Is it the case that both the National Environment Consultative Forum nominees have been rejected—both nominees put forward by that forum have been rejected by the Minister for Health and Aged Care? If so, could the minister provide reasons for the rejection of both nominees, and could the minister also confirm whether these are the only nominations received by the minister that have been rejected? 

SENATOR HERRON —The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The ARPANS Act (1998) establishes a Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council to advise the CEO of ARPANSA. The Minister appoints members of Council and has consulted widely in identifying potential Council members.
Many suggestions for membership were received, including those from the National Environment Consultative Forum referred to by Senator Stott Despoja in her question.
The Minister has reached a decision on membership of the Council and considered all the nominations put forward in making his selection. At this time, the position on the Council which represents the interests of the general public is unfilled.
The Minister would like to appoint someone with very wide environmental and public health experience, as ARPANSA's responsibilities cover both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, including issues such as the proposed national radioactive waste repository and questions concerning health risks from mobile phone use.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Radiation and Health Safety Advisory Council</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-24,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, which is to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 268.
I do this because, while I note that there has been a move to not give formality from both the Labor and the government side of the house, this is an important public matter. We have a crisis in the forests which is at the moment nationwide but which has come to a head in Western Australia. That crisis has now reached a point where citizens who have been peacefully protesting in the forests of Western Australia over the last weekend were set upon by a masked group of men, who were pro-logging, armed with baseball bats and other weapons. They were in fear of their lives and in fact had their lives threatened.
It is clear to everybody with an objective point of view that this situation has not been helped but has been inflamed by the very minister appointed by the Prime Minister to help this matter come to a solution—the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Wilson Tuckey. Even his colleagues at state level in Western Australia have found that this minister, rather than helping the situation, has made it worse. The environment minister in Western Australia, Cheryl Edwardes, has accused Mr Tuckey of inflaming the forestry debate and has told him to `grow up and shut up'. Just today the West Australian news 
 paper, not known to be vocal in favour of conservation, had this to say:
Mr Tuckey is not noted for adopting a conciliatory approach to problems and many people fail to understand why Prime Minister John Howard appointed him to such a sensitive portfolio.
The passage of time has done little to ease their concerns. Preaching a scientific solution . . . while acting like a boofhead is clearly counterproductive.
Those are very strong words about a failed minister in a portfolio which has been failed because the Prime Minister himself—
—Madam Deputy President, I do not like interrupting but I seek leave to make a 10-second statement which might save some time for Senator Brown.
—Leave is granted.
—I was just going to suggest that we will support the suspension so that we can actually have a debate on the substantive motion. If we can actually proceed to the debate, that will mean we can get on to the substantive debate rather than discuss the suspension motion for the next few minutes. We will support the suspension of standing orders.
—I was going to speak on this, irrespective of Senator Campbell's intervention. If Senator Brown wants to finish, that is fine and then I will speak. If he has finished, I will speak now.
Government senators interjecting—
—I will continue. Through you, Madam Deputy President: I would have agreed to your proposition, Senator Campbell, but as there is not unanimity on it I will continue at this stage. The point here is not just the failure of this appointment but the determination of the Prime Minister to put Wilson Tuckey into this position.
—Please refer to the minister by his correct title.
—The Prime Minister knew his record just the same as everybody else did, both inside the parliament and in the public domain. This is the Prime Minister who said he would govern for all of us. This is the Prime Minister who is, in effect, a 
 Jekyll and Hyde when it comes to the forests issue. He wants to present himself as a Jekyll but in fact he has, through Mr Tuckey, presented the Hyde face, the dark and antisocial face of the debate in this country. Instead of elevating the debate he has thrown a firecracker into it, and that is in the proven form of Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation.
If the minister were to fulfil his obligation not just to the Crown but to the people of Australia, he would have been putting this debate on a win-win basis. The vexatious forest industry is destroying much of the natural heritage of this country against the wishes of 80 per cent of Australians, not least the Western Australians, Tasmanians, Victorians and New South Wales people who are directly involved so far in this RFA process. The Prime Minister should have been in the business and in the process of getting this industry relocated, with jobs safe in the plantation basis which is available. But since the regional forest agreements came in, the jobs have been shed from the industry, as we knew the woodchip industry would have it. In Tasmania 480 jobs have been shed since the regional forest agreement came in. Where has been the minister's condemnation of the woodchip industry for shedding those jobs?

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-08-24,"—Despite some of the interjections from those opposite, I am not trying to waste time on this issue. There are two or three points that should be made. Firstly, I think the question—whether a censure motion of a minister should ever be put in this chamber without debate—should be decided now, and the answer is no. I do not think you can take those motions as formal motions without hearing the arguments for and against, especially the arguments for.
I do not think it would have been appropriate for us to vote on censuring a minister of the Crown without hearing the arguments. It is appropriate on a whole range of other issues—otherwise this chamber would be totally bogged down—but on a censure motion itself I do not think that is possible. That is the first point I wanted to make. I 
 apologise to the whip. If he gave some indication that we would deal with this formally, I certainly was not consulted. Even in a democratic, centralist unit like the Labor Party, we individual Labor senators have some rights occasionally to put a point of view.
—Except on the republic.
—If you can find a royalist in the Labor ranks, you name them.
—It was from a former Democrat!
—That is right. There is a secondary issue involved here that I am uncertain of—and that is only through failing memory as an ageing apparatchik that is nearer the door to leaving the chamber forever—and that is the efficacy of moving in this chamber a censure motion of someone in another chamber. I have a dim memory that the coalition here has done that in the past, but I cannot remember. Senator Brown may have looked up the precedents on this and may be able to assist me, because he will have a right to respond if this debate is not fully occupied. I do not know that it is a great system if we can censure someone in another chamber who is not here to defend themselves. On the other hand, Senator Brown's party is not represented in the House of Representatives, so I understand why it may have to be taken up here.
But I do have a difficulty. I do not recall the Labor Party, and I stand ready to be corrected, in my time in this chamber moving a censure motion against someone in another chamber. I have said before that I think censure motions are pretty much devalued in this chamber through overuse. The last one carried here was when Senator Hill was censured, and it was the flimsiest one I have ever seen in terms of a substantive case against a minister. We all voted out of form on that but, you know, it was not the toughest case ever run against a minister.
In conclusion, I also put on record my regrets that I have never had a censure motion even put against me, let alone carried, in this chamber. I do not know whether Senator Brown would consider attaching my name to 
 Mr Tuckey's, just to help me out here. You can imagine the tragic circumstances when you front up to the preselection panel and the first questions is: Senator Ray, why have you never been censured in the Senate? Shamefully, you have to admit that you are so well-behaved and have such propriety that in fact you have never ever managed to provoke a censure motion against you.
Whether censure motions should ever be regarded seriously, given their rather tawdry history in this chamber, I do not know, but I have to respect the fact that Senator Brown may take them very seriously and may have a strong case to put. We do not want to waste too much time today but we would like to give him the opportunity to put those views, because I think he feels very strongly on them. But I do put Senator Brown on notice that this is a sort of one-off support on a censure motion, that we would like them to be taken seriously and not moved week by week. I am not saying that Senator Brown would do so, but it is a rather serious step.
If Senator Brown is given the opportunity to respond, I would ask him—or any coalition senators—to indicate to me whether there has been a precedence for this chamber moving a motion against a minister in another chamber. I have a feeling, just in the back of my memory, that there might have been, and maybe we will get that checked. I notice that Senator Crane is giving me some body language that it has never been done.
—Not that I know of.
—Not that you know of; that is entirely possible, but we will at least have that—
—Winston is encyclopaedic on these things.
—Order! Senator Campbell. Senator Crane should not be interjecting out of his seat, either. I would suggest a check with Odgers .
—We know what you are encyclopaedic about—hiring aircraft; so we will not proceed with that today. (Time expired)
—Senator Ray, there is a list in Odgers , in chapter 19, 
 for you to pursue. Senator Brown, I am sorry, you have no right of reply on the suspension motion. Senator Ray is leading us all astray.
—That was just my invitation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-24,"—I continue from where I left off yesterday and remind the Senate that this is not to be taken as my first speech. The Democrats will be presenting a set of amendments to the RFA legislation. For the reasons I have outlined, the Australian Democrats would like to see this legislation thrown out of this house and never seen again. As this is very unlikely, our amendments to this legislation are to make the RFA areas consistent with national competition policies, to make the agreements available for public comment, to include sunset clauses, to pick up our obligations under international environment law, to make the legislation subordinate to 
 national environment legislation and export controls, and to oppose unlimited compensation.
We will also be presenting a number of amendments to the ALP amendments. I was quite astonished to read the ALP amendments. The ALP knows that, if the logging industry were forced to compete in an economically efficient manner and pay a fair market price for the resources it so greedily devours, it would have to get out of Australian native forests forever. The ALP must choose between the competing demands of old-growth loggers and the environment. It cannot have it both ways. Either you calculate the value of the forest in cubic tonnes or you look at its inherent value as a living treasure.
On close reading, the ALP's amendments barely acknowledge the concept of forest protection. We have a Wood and Paper Industry Council proposal because the ALP believes that forests are a free resource put there solely to feed woodchip mills. The native forest logging industry is one which should be wound down as soon as possible. Why the ALP wants to wrap the native forest woodchipping industry in cotton wool, protecting it from the real world, is beyond me. The economic and environmental arguments for not proceeding with the RFAs are irrefutable. The government and the ALP claim regularly that their policies are not about using industry policy to pick winners or, in this case, losers. But they are contradicting this mantra by continuing to subsidise an industry in decline, protecting it from real market forces and genuine competition.
We look forward to the support of all parties for our initiatives towards recognising the importance of the environment in the RFA legislation. It is unfortunate, but this legislation will not solve the forest issue. It will not make it simply go away, as the ALP and the coalition would like. They do not like the unrest in their parties nor the unedifying brawls on the front of newspapers. They do not like caucus and party room unrest nor fights between unions and business, and state and federal counterparts. They see forests as a bleeding sore that can simply be fixed with a bandaid solution that will last for 20 years.
The south-west of Western Australia is becoming the front line of the forest war. The first victim in this battle has been constructive dialogue, and now lives are being put at risk. The government must accept responsibility for this and for negotiating a poor and unfair agreement that is diametrically opposed to community wishes to preserve old-growth forest and halt the logging of native forests. The community is wise to this issue and will not give up. The sector will decline, and old-growth habitat will disappear. The community will get angrier, and politicians will be held to account. Come election time, we will see undignified seat scrambling and the odd new national park created. This will be followed by more outrage from the unions, and the cycle will repeat itself. The RFA will come back to parliament over and over again. This is why it is important that the major parties stop pretending it will go away and actually move to start protecting our remaining old-growth forests now.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-24,"—I speak near the end of this debate and, in doing so, will address some issues that are of importance not just to the parliament but also to the broader public. As we come to the end of this debate, we need to take into account the importance of this issue across the nation. This is one of the most controversial, heated and divisive issues that Australia has confronted over the last decade. It is a debate which, with few exceptions, traverses the nation; it is a debate that has continued for years; it is a debate that divides not only communities or states but also families. One only has to look at the situation in Western Australia to acknowledge that the impact of this debate has divided people in their communities and in their families. Senator Greig was right in saying that it is a debate which shows no signs of abating. I am one of those who believe that this debate will continue beyond the next federal election. It is a debate that will influence the outcome of many seats at the next federal election. It is a debate that is driven in such a way that it will not abate just because we pass this legislation.
The process itself, if this legislation is passed, will be under constant scrutiny by the 
 public, and the process itself will have to be a lot better than the one in Western Australia before the public accepts it. If there is one thing that this parliament should take into account in respect of Western Australia, it is that where governments go through token processes, where governments pay lip-service to concerns for protection of old-growth forests and habitats, then, though the process may be quick and dirty, the outcome will not satisfy the public, and the public have a way of ensuring that their voice is taken into account. What I am saying is that, if this legislation does pass the parliament, then, no matter in what form it passes the parliament, governments in Australia will be held by the public to their obligations, and their obligations basically are to take into account real and meaningful processes, not tokenistic and lip-service processes as we have seen in Western Australia.
There is genuine concern for the preservation of old-growth forests and habitats, and there should be. There is genuine concern about the preservation of jobs. But what we have to take into account as a national parliament is that we should not be driven by one side of the debate or the other; we should take the opportunity to take a holistic approach to this issue. If we were to do that, I think we would very quickly come to the conclusion, as loggers are finding across the country, that there is no long-term security—no medium-term security for many of them—in relying on the logging of old-growth forests and the destruction of old-growth habitats.
The best way to have a sustainable industry is to extend and expand the plantation timber resource. As I say, when you look at the experience over the past five or six years, despite promises, despite commitments, those who have relied on the viability of an industry dependent on old-growth forests quite often find themselves out of employment. It is an unfortunate part of the change that is going on in their communities, but also it is a reflection of the short-sightedness of those who are driven by an obsession to log old-growth forests and not to take a longer-term or medium-term view of not just plantation forests but also alternative industries and 
 regional development plans for some of the areas we are talking about.
This debate has gone off the rails in the last few months, not just because of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey, but also because of a bodgie process in Western Australia. What we have had is an irrational debate over recent weeks rather than a rational debate. We have had abuse from a federal minister rather than a democratic acknowledgment of people's rights to have different points of view. We have a process which, in a sense, is quite indefensible—but one which the federal minister for resources, Wilson Tuckey, tries to defend. As I say, this is an issue that will keep coming back to this Senate—if not by way of legislation, then by way of controversy, by way of public concern, by way of public opposition, as Richard Court found in WA.
We are also coming to this debate in a somewhat new legal environment. We are coming into this debate after the passage of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill. That has changed the ground rules to some extent—to a big extent. We have heard Democrat speaker after Democrat speaker talk about how their amendments are intended to overcome the effects of the EPBC legislation. Let us put it on the record that that legislation passed this Senate—and could only have passed this Senate—with the support of the Australian Democrats. There were not the numbers on the floor of the chamber for that legislation to have passed before 1 July. It was the Democrats who signed the death warrant for so much of the old-growth timber that they are now expressing concern about.
The biodiversity bill has had an impact. It has had a negative impact on the protection of old-growth forests. It is a bit rich for the Australian Democrats to come in here, having passed the bill, having sold out on some of their long expressed concerns, and attempt once again to play catch up—to play catch up in terms of wanting to protect the old-growth forest but also to play catch up in political terms. What Senator Brown has been saying about them and what I have been saying about them in respect of their approach to the 
 EPBC legislation is right. They entered into a quick and dirty deal which did not sufficiently protect the environment, and this is one area where the environment was not protected.
If you look at advice that is available to the parliament from the Parliamentary Library, you will find, in a paper that we had prepared by the library on 26 July, that the views are pretty clear. The paper says:
Irrespective of the provisions of individual RFAs and irrespective of the RFA Bill, once the EPBC Act comes into force, the Commonwealth's scope for involvement in forestry issues will be reduced, in particular—
not solely and exclusively but in particular—
where an RFA is in place. Division 4 of Part 4 of the Act contains wide exemptions for forestry operations permitted by regional forest agreements and for regions subject to the process of developing and negotiating a regional forest agreement.
That is the clear legal position. Basically, in passing that legislation, in going through a process of consultation with a government—private, secret negotiation with Senator Hill—what the Democrats did not do was protect what they are now seeking to protect. We remember they came into this place and said, `Look, we have got this amendment and we agreed with the government that this would be fought separately from the deal we have had on the legislation,' knowing full well that that amendment could not have been passed in this place in that debate because the numbers were not there to pass it. They lost their opportunity to protect what they now seek to protect—to protect what they then in a subsequent amendment sought to protect in this debate. The consequence of allowing that bill through, of missing that opportunity, is what I have just read out from the library advice. The library advice also says:
Section 524(3) of the EPBC Act will have the effect that the decision to grant a woodchip export licence will not trigger the Act's operation. The subsection provides that a decision by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation under certain Acts, including the Export Control Act 1982 , is not an action for the purposes of triggering the EPBC Act.
The advice goes on to say:
Under the EPBC Act, it is not possible to invoke world heritage powers to protect RFA areas from forestry operations where the areas possess world heritage values (and therefore might otherwise trigger the Act's operation) but where the property is not actually listed  as World Heritage.
The advice, extensive as it is, also says:
The limited number of `national environmental significance' triggers in the EPBC, the wide RFA exemption within that Act, coupled with the removal of the Export Control Act  as a trigger, as well as the effect of regulations made under the Export Control Act mean that, irrespective of the provisions of individual RFAs, the Commonwealth's scope for involvement in forestry issues is likely to be reduced, especially in RFA regions.
Not in RFA agreements but in RFA regions. That is the horse they let bolt when we discussed the EPBC legislation a little while ago. Now they are coming into this place again with an amendment, which they are challenging all of us to support, to basically fix up what they mucked up.
One would have a degree of sympathy with the Democrats, in that they were enormously naive when they last negotiated with the government. But it is a bit rich to muck something up and then come here and say, `Oh well, you'll prove your credentials, whether you support our amendment or not.' The fact is that the amendment that they are to move in this debate to exclude the operation of division 4 of part 4 of the EPBC Act only half undoes what they did with the EPBC legislation. Let us be under no delusion about this. They will not fix up what they rendered asunder with their vote and their negotiations with the government on the previous legislation. They will come in here and say, `This is important. We have got to remove division 4 of part 4 of the EPBC legislation and then everything will be okay in terms of the forests.'
But the advice that I have just received from the library runs contrary to that. That advice, dated 24 August, says:
Effect of repeal of Division 4 of Part 4 of the EPBC Act
If Division 4 of Part 4 of the EPBC Act is repealed effective before July 1999 when the EPBC Act and the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 1999 (ERCP Act) commence, the effect of this will be to expand the Commonwealth's 
 potential scope for involvement in the approval of forestry operations as compared to the scope for involvement under the EPBC Act as it currently stands. Nevertheless, its scope for involvement will remain considerably less than under the current regime where the granting of woodchip export licences under the Export Control Act 1982  can trigger Commonwealth involvement. This is due to section 524(3) of the EPBC Act, under which government authorisation under the Export Control Act 1982  is not an action for the purposes of triggering the EPBC Act. This substantially lessens the Commonwealth's statutory powers in relation to forestry operations, regardless of the Democrat amendments.
This is clear legal advice from the parliamentary Information and Research Service that their amendments proposed now will not return the situation to what it was before the EPBC legislation that they entered into and passed with the government in the last session of parliament. They cannot undo what they did then. That just proves the point that we have been making all along. That was a hasty, ill-conceived, secret deal, the victim of which was protection of the environment. The advice goes on to say:
The repealing of Division 4 of Part 4 would however ensure that other triggers in the EPBC Act could be invoked if relevant. It would also leave in question the status of forestry operations in regions in which an RFA is currently being negotiated (see section 40 of EPBC Act). This would add to the doubt surrounding the RFA process (as certain provisions of RFAs, as mentioned above, are of questionable status).
So there is certainty that you will not go as far as where we were before the EPBC legislation. There is also some uncertainty as to other areas that the Democrats are trying to repeal. So with certainty you can say that they mucked up badly last time. With certainty you can say that, no matter what their amendments do this time, you will not go back to the situation that prevailed before the EPBC legislation.
That is only in respect to division 4 of part 4 of the act. There are other provisions in that legislation which by amendment this time the Democrats are not seeking to return to the prior situation. That EPBC legislation, as we said at the time, had loophole after loophole, escape clause after escape clause, trigger after trigger to ensure that the Commonwealth 
 could absolve itself of responsibility in national environmental protection—and not just national but regional as well. This advice goes on to say:
Alternative means of exempting RFA forestry operations under the EPBC Act—
and it lists ministerial discretion, ministerial exemption, ministerial declarations and bilateral agreements. All these areas would be available to the federal government under this legislation, regardless of whatever happens to this legislation even if the Democrat amendments are passed. All these areas would be available for the federal minister to ensure that the levels of protection that were available pre-EPBC legislation will not prevail into the future.
The Democrats are not seeking to amend those parts. They have signed up to them in the deal with the government. They signed up to provisions about which, for instance in respect of bilateral agreements, the advice says:
The Commonwealth could enter into bilateral agreements that delegated the approval powers in relation to forestry operations to the State with which it made the relevant RFA agreement (see section 29).
That is a power which will stay with the Commonwealth minister regardless of what happens, because the Democrats are not moving amendments to repeal that. And they are not moving amendments to repeal that because they actually signed up to that. That was part of their integral arrangement with the government. In respect of ministerial declarations, the advice says:
In theory, the Environment Minister could make a declaration under section 33 that forestry operations in RFA regions did not require approval.
Another escape clause. In respect of ministerial exemption, the advice says:
The Environment Minister could exercise his/her power under section 158 of the Act to provide an exemption for a controlled action if of the view that the action is in the national interest. Such an exemption cannot be reviewed by Parliament.
In respect of ministerial decision, the advice says:
Under section 75 of the Act, the Environment Minister could decide that a particular forestry operation was not a controlled action. 

That is a ministerial decision. The advice says:
If Division 4 of Part 4 were to be repealed, there would be various mechanisms available for exempting regional forest agreement forestry operations from the EPBC Act even if they had a significant impact on a matter or matters of national environmental significance listed in Part 3 of the Act. These possibilities, combined with the removal of the Export Control Act as a trigger, mean that Commonwealth involvement in forestry issues could be minimised regardless of the existence or repeal of Division 4 of Part 4 of the EPBC.
That is where we are in respect of this legislation now. I say to the Democrats that the two bits of legal advice from the library make it very clear that they did not know what they were doing then or else they are trying to mislead us now. The end result of their amendments getting up now would still be, as the advice says, not only a diminution of Commonwealth responsibility but enormous opportunities for the Commonwealth to even absolve itself of those opportunities and that responsibility as well. So your amendments are catch-up in terms of politics but not catch-up in terms of law. They fail in that respect.
As I said earlier, we are coming to the end of this part of the process. Our amendments are obviously geared towards trying to ensure continued public scrutiny of the process. The government has claimed and screamed loudly that to allow the parliament to have some ongoing interest in this area will lead to uncertainty and to some sort of anarchy in terms of these agreements, but let us remember what we are doing. Through this legislation we are giving industry, in particular, a 20-year period of certainty and security. If we apply the letter of the law, as the WA government is doing, we do so in a way that does not guarantee sufficient scrutiny at the start of, nor sufficient scrutiny through, the process. The public of Western Australia have told their government that they are not prepared to sit idly by and allow the government to enter into an arrangement with industry, the direct consequence of which has been the destruction of much important and cherished old-growth forest and timber.
So what we are trying to do on the Labor Party side is to have a capacity for ongoing 
 scrutiny and to move a number of amendments to try to tie this legislation to the objectives that the previous government set in developing its regional forest agreements legislation. We had as our agreed principles the objective of ensuring sustainability of forests and forest practices. In moving those amendments we make it very clear again that, though the government says to Labor, `This is your bill,' this is the name of our bill but this is not our bill. This is a bill that has changed enormously since 1992, Senator Crane—who is sitting there with his ears pricked at that. This is a bill that may have the same title as the 1992 legislation but differs so often in terms of objectives, demands and processes from the 1992 legislation. It is for that reason that we deem it appropriate to move amendments, in a number of areas that have already been detailed by Senator Forshaw, to ensure not just a process but a defensible one. In closing, I say again that we should take particular heed of the voice of Western Australians who have had an opportunity to scrutinise their processes in that state. Unless this parliament puts up a process that is defensible, the debate will continue and the debate will be as divisive as it has been.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-08-24,"—In speaking to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  before us, I would like to deal with some of the issues that were raised in the Senate legislation committee inquiry into this legislation. In that inquiry, in the two days of hearings we had in Melbourne, we probably heard every conceivable point of view in the forest debate that it was possible to put. Some of it was very constructive, and we had the extremes from both sides of the debate putting their views. While there were two dissenting reports—one from the Labor Party representatives on that committee and one from the Democrats—I think the fundamental principles we set down in the majority report really set the scene to move ahead on this. The unfortunate thing is that we did not get to the legislation earlier. I heard some comments earlier about why we had not brought on this legislation. But the filibustering that went on in this place on the tax debate back in May and June—and before 
 that—meant that there were time constraints caused by the wasting of time, and the government was unable to get to a lot of legislation that it would like to have got to.
We did make a number of recommendations on this legislation. The first recommendation was that the legislation be passed unamended by the Senate. There is one particular issue that I wish to deal with on the amendments that have been proposed by the Labor Party, and that is the parliamentary disallowance of the agreements. I think we need to look at this from both a pragmatic and a constitutional point of view. In terms of the management of the land and the forests, there is no question that the constitutional rights of the states must stand up. If this amendment is passed, I have no doubt that, whichever state is overridden by this Senate, regardless of who is in government, the issue will very quickly go before the High Court and there will be a long drawn-out battle, with very clear right on the side of the states. It is totally impractical to proceed down that line and it would defeat the purpose of the national forest policy statement.
I was rather surprised to hear from Senator Bolkus—and I presume he was referring to the national forest policy statement—that it had changed dramatically since 1992. I am not aware of any changes whatsoever that have occurred. In fact, the principles of the national forest policy statement, which I will come to if I have time, stand as strongly today as they stood at the time they were put together. I point out that there would be constitutional problems if this Senate were given the power to override agreements that were signed by the states. There are other areas where the Senate can have that power, because the responsibility has been put in the hands of the Commonwealth, but in this instance it is not. So that amendment is flawed before it even gets off the ground. People who vote on this legislation should take careful note of that fact.
Another issue that was raised right across the board—there was no particular champion of the cause—was the consistent criticism that people did not know what was in RFAs; there was not enough public information. The 
 Senate committee, therefore, recommended that, for their first five years, an annual report on the RFAs be tabled in the parliament, which will allow total scrutiny of any upgrading changes that are made during that time. One of the furphies the committee was able to put to bed was that changes cannot be made to an RFA. Albeit difficult in some instances, changes can be made, according to the circumstances.
The committee recommends the government establish the wood and paper industry council. This came directly from the submission of the union representatives. Minister Tuckey has agreed that a wood and paper industry council should be established, but we on this side of the chamber do not agree that it is necessary to spell out all the fine detail of the membership and structure of that committee. We would sooner have a flexible approach to this and a committee which is structured to deal with the principles required in this area but which can have the flexibility to change membership and direction and to do things that are in the best interests of the timber industry. The amendments put before us ignore the fact that rigidly setting something in concrete in legislation such as this effectively removes any flexibility that such an industry council may have. It is not necessary for it to be put into legislation.
The next issue I wish to raise, which relates partly to something I have already spoken about, is the access to RFAs. In this particular case we are dealing with the actual RFA itself, not the ongoing review on a yearly basis over five years, but we believe that, once it is signed by the Prime Minister and the respective state premier or their nominee, the RFA should be tabled in the Commonwealth parliament. That is to allow for the total transparency that the majority on the committee believes is necessary to get rid of some of the claims made about RFAs which are not true. While it is a fact that, even under the current situation, people can get access to it, we believe that we should make that totally visible. I make that point.
One of the most important resolutions relates to employment, the status of plantation development, the status of the forests in 
 various places and the changes that may occur. For example, major fires or floods occur from time to time that do alter balances. The Australian Bureau of Statistics should run annual questionnaires to establish over a period of time what is actually occurring in the forests, whether they be on private land or on public land. During the hearings we heard from one source—I will not mention any names—that should have been reliable in telling us the situation with regard to plantation forests, that said Australia could switch very easily to the utilisation of plantation forests and rely much less on the natural forest. Equally we heard from other witnesses, who are equally qualified, that it would be some years—probably 15 to 20 years—before the plantations could fill the gap that would exist if you were to reduce on a large scale the access to the natural or regrowth forests.
We even heard from other scientists and individuals, and I have also had private correspondence on this, that there would always be a demand or a necessity for the utilisation of a percentage of natural forests because of the requirements from the timber industry of Australians as a people. It should be noted that—and not many people in this debate acknowledge this—on average every man, woman and child in Australia uses three tonnes of forest products every year. That has to come from somewhere, or you are going to have to change your habits very dramatically. There are many personal items as well as paper and furniture that are produced from the forest through that particular process.
I make this point: against the fact that we import close to $2 billion worth of timber products into this country per year, we need to share our responsibilities as a nation in terms of what we extract and harvest from our forests. It is a renewable resource, and I doubt whether anybody, except the true scientists, when they go into a forest that has been regrowing for 40, 50 or 100 years, is able to tell the difference, anyhow. At the end of the day, a tree is a living thing, as we are, and it has a life span to maturity then it starts to go backwards for a period of time and then it dies. Much of the emotion in the debate is ill-founded and not based on fact.
Another point I want to make here is that it has been claimed and argued that harvesting the forests in Western Australia has contributed to the salinity problems which exist in that state. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is not one skerrick of evidence anywhere that, where forest harvesting occurs, there has been any land go saline or any increase in the level of salinity in the water in streams, rivers or soaks. In fact, the dead opposite occurs when there is a major forest operation in an area. Young growing trees utilise significantly more water than medium- and old-growth trees and they reduce the watertable which in turn reduces the salinity take-up. Nonetheless, when you get into the heavy rainfall areas where the major forestry areas are, it is not a problem and there is no evidence indicating one skerrick of salinity.
The other point that I would make comes to the argument about the animals, birds et cetera. There is not one piece of evidence of any loss of any animals in the Western Australian forests from forest harvesting. The areas where there is a problem are areas where there has been clearing and the natural habitat has been destroyed in one way or another because it has not been fenced out. I can speak from experience on this issue in relation to the blue-green parrot, which is supposedly living only in Fitzgerald Park. There was a certain amount of land in Fitzgerald Park which was pulled back from being opened up for agriculture because of the concern about this particular parrot. We now find that we have blue-green parrots living in the tree lines which are planted across the properties, our property included. So, if you fence out the particular habitats, the protection of our flora and fauna can be accommodated and can be combined with a proper commercial farming operation. Then you find the benefits that flow to the economics of the farm operation because of the protection, the lowering of salinity and a whole range of things.
There are a lot of myths surrounding this particular debate, but I will return to the survey by the Bureau of Statistics which I was talking about. We asked to have included in it questions on assessment of natural forest 
 areas; plantation forest areas, public and private; the tourism industry; the service industries; and other industries operating within each RFA region. Nobody was able to give us anything like an accurate clue, for example, on how many jobs were generated from tourism as against the jobs generated from forestry operations. Worse than that, they could not give us a clue on the interlinkage between the jobs which were created there. We thought that was information which was very important and which we should in fact collect.
I want to make a couple of quick observations in the time I have left in regard to the national forest policy statement and touch on the things that are included there and are required to be dealt with when developing an RFA. Of course, the fundamental purpose of this legislation is to give resource security to the people who work in forest industries. We often hear the woodchip companies cited in the capital cities, but there is a lot more to the timber industry than that. There are the contractors who own the trucks, the tractors and the various equipment that moves them around. It impacts on them and on all the employees right through the process if the Commonwealth reneges on its responsibilities.
We have the issues of conservation, wood products and industry development, integrated and coordinated decision making and management, private native forests, plantations, water supply and catchment management, tourism and other economic and social opportunities, employment, work force education and training, public awareness, education and involvement, research and development and international responsibilities. I cannot emphasise the last issue too much. Whenever we walk away from our responsibilities in supplying some of that three tonnes I talked about, it means that we send a ship to one of the countries up north and, because they do not have the rules and disciplines that we have in this country, we become part of the process of raping the forests of Indonesia, Malaysia and our other northern neighbours. Of course, they have enormous economic pressures on them at their particular stage of development.
In winding up my remarks, I say that what this legislation will do is give that resource security that is needed. Once that 20-year RFA is put in place, it will remove the double jeopardy from having combined Commonwealth and state acts operating together, and that is very important. People should have to operate under only one set of laws, not two sets of laws. I believe that if these other issues I have raised are picked up in the proper manner and if these amendments are not proceeded with, because they will put us back into the double jeopardy situation in many areas, then this legislation will make a major contribution to the development of the timber industry in this country, and not only will we see the use of the existing forests in an ecologically sustainable way but also we will see a further development of plantations and the contribution they can make to reducing that enormous timber deficit that we have at this time.
