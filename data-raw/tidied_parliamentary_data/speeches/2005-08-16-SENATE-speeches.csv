"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2005-08-16,"—At the request of Senator Kemp, I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
—I wonder if the minister might just briefly elaborate on the reasons for that motion.
—This is a customs bill which relates to the cargo management re-engineering program. As a result of ongoing discussions with industry, it was thought appropriate to extend the period of time for the implementation for imports—it is a new program that is being put in place—to 12 October. The reason for urgency is that we need to put this legislation through the parliament so that it will change the cut-over date for the new program, which was previously in August. It will extend the program by about six weeks. If we do not do it this week then we will not be able to give industry that extra time that it needs. It is a matter of six weeks extension, but it is important and that is the reason for the urgency.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-08-16,"—In continuing my remarks about this legislation, can I say that I am very concerned about just what this legislation represents. As someone who has been involved in vocational education and training for a long time, I see the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 as another grab for power by a government that wants to tighten its grip on the education sector until it actually has it in a stranglehold. It is an attempt to further its agenda of trying to legislate the states out of existence as well as forcing—and forcing is what it is—its radical take on industrial relations into every facet of society. Let us look first of all at the government’s industrial relations tirade within these so-called skilling Australia’s work force bills. Here is the cause of the greatest unease and what has been alluded to a number of times by my colleagues: clause 12(1)(b), which forces TAFE colleges to offer Australian workplace agreements. The bill at clause 12(1) states:
The State must implement workplace reforms in the vocational education and training sector, including the following:
                  …         …         …
(b)   ensuring that TAFE institutions introduce more flexible employment arrangements by offering Australian workplace agreements to staff, except where making such agreements under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is not possible because of the corporate status of the TAFE institution, in which case other individual agreements should be offered;
There it is: the government’s radical industrial relations agenda slotted in, as it has been in so many bills before, audaciously as can be. Surely the vocational education and training system is no place for the Howard government to be driving home its ideological industrial relations agenda. We have seen it with universities. We have seen it with the Australian technical colleges. Now we are seeing it with TAFEs.
It is interesting to note that, despite active promotion by the Howard government since it took office in 1996, AWAs have only achieved coverage of about 2.4 per cent of the work force up to 2005, and not all of them were taken up willingly. Perhaps this is why the government is mandating it through legislation, compelling industries that have existed happily without AWAs to effectively force them on their employees.
If you want to see just how well the mandating of AWAs has been received within the community, you need to look no further than the workplace relations minister’s very own department. A large number of employees from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations have previously walked off the job due to this government’s AWA-centrism. All new employees must sign an AWA as a condition of employment and as one employee stated:
If you want a pay rise, the only mechanism to get it is to go on to an AWA ...
I quote from a letter from DEWR employees written to their minister:
Dear Sirs
I am writing to express my concern at the failure of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) to finalise certified agreement negotiations with staff and our union.
Despite twelve months of talks your Department remains unable—or unwilling—to deliver an agreement that provides fair employment conditions. This unfinished business reflects badly on your Department and on the entire Public Service.
I urge you to:
-       immediately finalise negotiations
-       respect people’s bargaining choices
-    ensure the new agreement gives DEWR staff the right to access the AIRC to resolve disputes
-    ensure current redundancy entitlements are not cut.
Is it any wonder that the very people charged with implementing the government’s irrational agenda are protesting against it? AWAs are specifically designed to make it easier for employers to undercut award and collective agreement conditions. AWAs allow employers to single out employees, to force new working conditions on to them and to do that to them one at a time. They give employers more control over working hours, reducing overtime pay and making more people casual employees. The government’s new laws will allow employers to put workers on to individual contracts that cut take-home pay and reduce employment conditions to only five minimum standards: the minimum hourly rate of pay—which is currently only $12.75 an hour—eight days sick leave, four weeks annual leave, unpaid parental leave and weekly working hours. Are these the sorts of working conditions we want our educators, those who are raising the leaders of tomorrow, to be forced under?
Let us think about this government’s record on vocational education. The Liberal government is determined to abrogate the Commonwealth’s funding role in education and training at a time when businesses around the country are demanding a greater, not lesser, role from government when it comes to the planning, funding and delivery of education and training programs. Yesterday, the Australian Industry Group was highly critical of the lack of investment in traditional apprenticeship training. The government cut funding for TAFE during its first two budgets and failed to provide any growth funding in six of the last nine budgets. It has also cut university funding, and upfront fees have been increased at most universities by 25 per cent to try to correct the shortfall. This is not a government that is concerned with promoting education and training.
Let us also take into account that adults wishing to retrain who also have families have the added concern of high child-care fees—something which the government, again, has done nothing constructive about—and their universities are not going to be able to offer them any services to assist, as a result of the voluntary student union proposals. Recently I received a submission from a group of constituents who are very worried about this legislation. It highlights the genuine concerns and, more importantly, the real effects of the Howard government’s radical assault on the vocational education sector. These constituents feel that these bills look like a cost cutting exercise which will significantly reduce education opportunities for Indigenous people, especially those in isolated communities. These constituents attend Tranby Aboriginal College, which is the oldest independent adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education centre in Australia. Anne and Bill, two students, wrote in regard to the effect of these bills combined with the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2005:
Tranby, and three similar Educational Institutions around Australia, will lose $3.7 million over two years in direct funding. A further $10.9 million, which has been quarantined for allocation to independent community-controlled institutions (like Tranby) will now be available for open competition between all organisations involved in “skilling” the Australian workforce. This will be a common pool with no preference for Indigenous people.
Tranby Aboriginal College is an alternative and independent learning environment for adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Part of the Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd, the college is located in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe and has been teaching students since 1958. It has helped to skill a number of important Indigenous community leaders since that time. An average of 150 students every year attend the college from all over Australia, developing the knowledge to empower both themselves and their communities. Evening courses are also available to non-Indigenous students. Tranby also provides staff development training to Indigenous and non-Indigenous organisations and government departments. So it is particularly concerning to me that Tranby, in New South Wales, and the three similar institutions in other states will be losing more than $3.7 million over two years in direct funding.
The government claims to be promoting ‘practical reconciliation’. What could be more practical than the work of Tranby in its programs to skill Indigenous people to work in their own communities? One can only hope that pleas such as Anne and Bill’s, and the many others received by my colleagues in this place, highlight to this government how damaging a blind ideological pursuit of an agenda considerably out of step with the Australian public opinion can be: damaging not just to the majority but also to the minorities—those who most need the government’s support and assistance.
I come now to Australia’s national skills crisis and the extent to which this bill purports to address the crisis. The Reserve Bank of Australia drew attention to the skills crisis in March of this year, when it raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent. There are two factors which the RBA emphasised. The first was pressure on wages and, as a consequence, inflation and interest rates as a result of the skills crisis. The second was capacity restraints as a result of a neglect of infrastructure. This is a national crisis, a crisis that has seen the government attempt to import a solution, a quick fix, and which is very much an admission of guilt. The quick fix has seen the Howard government import around 178,000 extra skilled migrants since 1997, at the same time turning away more than 270,000 Australians from TAFE since 1998.
How do these bills actually respond to the national skills crisis so clearly articulated by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the OECD and various Australian peak industry bodies? The government’s response was simple: to vacate the space, because it has never had a nation-building perspective in the areas of skills development, training and lifelong learning. It was to treat Australian educational institutions, learners and training providers with contempt, in that the Prime Minister unilaterally announced the abolition of ANTA and the national system of vocational training by press release. There was no consultation with anyone, and certainly not with the state governments and other stakeholders in the vocational education and training sector that are vitally affected by this legislation. This was because the Prime Minister, in his haste to vacate the space, wanted to abolish ANTA by 1 July this year. This was a purely political decision. There is not a shred of evidence that any educational or economic motive prompted this action.
To date, there have been paltry efforts to explain the abolition of ANTA by this government. This is simply because, as those who have an involvement in the vocational education sector know, ANTA was a thorn in the side of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, who wants to run the show. He has done it in schools and universities. It was surely only a matter of time before he would attempt to impose an ideological agenda on this area. He has already sought to impose it on schools and universities. That includes draining $500 million from the sector and rebadging and reannouncing, with great fanfare, the funding already announced during the election campaign last year.
The Howard government’s policies demonstrate the contempt in which this government holds public education, and this contempt has sown the seeds of the skills crisis now confronting Australia in the 21st century. We on this side of the chamber are truly appalled at this. Labor believe that our national training system should be supported by a strong, independent tripartite body which is able to provide broad based advice to the entire sector.
Training our current and future work force should be a partnership between all involved: government, industry and, of course, workers. These bills do not honour those principles. They abolish ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, by repealing the Australian National Training Authority Act and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act, which were both put in place by a Labor government in 1992. In their place, the bills establish a new system for the provision of Commonwealth funding to vocational education and training in Australia—a system of agreements with states and territories that in essence represents an increasing grab for power by an extreme, arrogant and out-of-touch government that is bent on imposing its radical ideology on every facet of Australian society.
When the current system was set up by Labor in 1992, there was extensive consultation. The current Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, introduced the package to establish ANTA and noted in his second reading speech that ‘the agreement was reached after a sustained period of negotiations’.
It is clear that the government is using this legislation as another vehicle for imposing its ideological agenda in industrial relations. The abolition of ANTA means that Commonwealth funding to the states and territories for vocational education and for educational facilities such as TAFE colleges will now come directly from the Department of Education, Science and Training and will therefore be under the direct supervision of the minister. The legislation provides that grants cannot be made to a state unless there is a Commonwealth-state agreement in place, and it stipulates that such agreements must be concluded during 2005. Given that it is now the middle of August 2005, the Commonwealth is putting the squeeze on the states by saying, ‘Sign this agreement now or you get no funding.’
The government’s insistence on Australian workplace agreements as part of the funding agreement demonstrates quite clearly that this legislation is being used as a vehicle to introduce their industrial relations changes into the system, just as they have sought to do through the university sector. This legislation does nothing more than play TAFE teachers off against each other and, through them, Australian students—students that are the only solution to our government-created skills crisis. It treats the invaluable contribution our vocational education and training teachers have made to skilling Australia with contempt and derision.
How will these bills assist teachers to address the skills shortage created by and left to fester by this government? As I have said, the government cut funding for TAFE during their first two budgets. In fact, they failed to provide any growth funding in six of the last nine budgets and now, after emasculating a once proud institution, they want to use it as a political football in their assault against the unions in their now fever-pitch industrial relations tirade.
Education unions across the country are being punished for fighting the government’s assault, for fighting for the right to skill Australians as opposed to simply importing a quick fix that does nothing but try to hide the damage this government has inflicted. The New South Wales Teachers Federation indicates on their web site:
Since 1997 Federal TAFE funding has been cut by 26% in real terms and now the Federal Government is threatening to cut nearly 25% of TAFE’s total funding. For NSW this means $1.4 billion over the next three years. This is equivalent to about 450,000 student places across Australia just when we face a massive skills shortage crisis.
Labor is standing stand side by side with them in their fight. We stand for a strong Australian trained work force; we stand for a vocational education sector that is not totalitarian in its operation but rather is a partnership between all those involved. We stand for a work force that is not forced into an ideologically driven agreement that will slash working rights and put added pressure on Australian families. We stand for a fair go, for opportunity for all, and for a well-resourced public vocational education sector which will train and equip for Australia’s future. We certainly do not stand for blind ideology. We believe in a fair go, we believe in offering everyone an opportunity, and we believe in public education. Labor will not be supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-16,"—I rise to speak on what might be described as an overly-prescriptive bill, the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005, and the associated bill, the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005, that deals with the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA. The Democrats do not support these bills, nor did we support the unilateral abolition of ANTA. The abolition of ANTA was announced by the government after the election. It was not taken to the public as an election issue, and it was done without consultation.
While we support many of the bills’ objectives and note that the new training arrangements appear to have inherited many of the cooperative elements of the ANTA framework, we are opposed to the overly prescriptive nature of the arrangement and the direct role of the department in the administration of these arrangements. In our view, these arrangements are unnecessary, restrictive and likely to lead to less flexibility. In fact, we believe that the motivation for the abolition of ANTA and this new arrangement is to deflect criticism that the government underspent in this area. As a result we now have a skills crisis, which I note the government continues to deny because that would be an admission of failure. The only way to save face has obviously been to blame the states, and the only way for the government to look as if it is saving the system is to take it on itself.
I believe that history shows that it was this government that challenged the fundamental underpinnings of the ANTA agreement, specifically with the abolition of growth funding in 1996, and also with reduction in expenditure through so-called efficiency dividends and requirements for the states to achieve growth through efficiencies.
The coalition cut funding in 1996 and 1997 and then froze it from 1998 to 2000. In those five years student numbers increased by over 16 per cent, and there has been annual growth in the delivery of courses of around six per cent per annum for the past 10 years. The funding for training fell in real terms by 19 per cent between 1997 and 2002. In 2004, 40,000 young people missed out on a TAFE place. As noted in the joint ALP and Democrat minority report on this bill, Commonwealth funding for VET has fallen by 6.5 per cent since 1997, when adjusted for CPI movements, while state and territory funding has increased. The Democrats have been arguing for years now for an absolute minimum of five per cent annual growth funding in real terms to be put in place if we are to address the training and education needs of Australia’s young people and combat the growing skills crisis. This legislation does not do that.
As I mentioned earlier, the Democrats are very concerned about the highly prescriptive nature of the legislation. Like they have done with higher education, the government have taken a strongarm approach to industrial relations by tying the funding to implementation of their IR agenda. I think it is ironic that the government have sought changes to the industrial relations act to curb what they call third-party interference by unions yet this is exactly what they are doing here by imposing their ideology in exchange for funding. In 1996 the Democrats supported the introduction of Australian workplace agreements to the industrial relations system, but at the time and now we believe that it is up to the employer and employee to decide what sort of agreement making mechanisms they use. The government should not be doing this by force, as they are in this legislation.
The legislation also prescribes that funding be increased to facilitate an increase by five per cent a year in the proportion of apprentices and trainees eligible for user-choice funds under the New Apprenticeships scheme. A number of submissions to the inquiry on the legislation raised concerns about the success of the user-choice scheme, with an independent report arguing that the scheme has risks. The Democrats have been arguing for more than 12 months now that the user-choice scheme should be put on hold until there is a proper review and evaluation of this policy, and we again urge the government to do this.
We are also concerned that the payments received under the act are not to be used for providing vocational education and training to overseas students or for private recreational pursuits or hobbies. The Bills Digest on the bill points out:
In 2003 one in three VET students were not studying for a qualification.(11) While many of these would be self funded, they would be users of infrastructure and other services supported by government funding.
The Democrats believe that provision of education and training is in the national interest and therefore should be a public good. The Bills Digest points out that this policy—and I quote:
... also appears incompatible with developing lifelong learning pathways particularly in an ageing society, matters which are the subject of the government’s own discussion paper on adult learning.
On a final note, we believe the government has overlooked the importance of acknowledging the critical role training providers play in the overall delivery of vocational education and training by excluding them from 4(b) of the objectives clause. In their submission to the inquiry on the bills, TAFE Directors Australia stated:
TDA continues to emphasise that much of the inflexibility and non-responsiveness for which the ANTA arrangements were often criticised was due in no small part to the absence of training providers from relevant consultation and decision-making arrangements. TDA emphasise that while the needs of industry and workforce development must drive the outcomes of the national vocational and education training system, neither industry clients nor Commonwealth/State administrations are best positioned to design the means for achieving these outcomes. The training design and delivery expertise which reside in the TAFE system can materially enhance the outcomes of training for both employers and individuals and it is important that this is now recognised and incorporated in national decision-making processes.
The Democrats strongly support this sentiment, and I will be moving an amendment to the bill to include training providers in the objects clause.
The Democrats believe that the government would have been better off genuinely renegotiating the ANTA agreement. We suggest that they should have negotiated a five per cent minimum in annual growth funding; a requirement for at least 70 per cent of content to be delivered by permanent, professional, accredited teachers by 2007; professional development for TAFE teachers so that they would have up-to-date industry experience, teaching competencies and qualifications; improved data gathering on skill needs; better sharing of infrastructure, especially in the regions, by public institutions and business; improved training and retraining strategies for older workers, people with disabilities and the welfare dependent; commitments from state and territory governments to nationally consistent and significantly reduced fees and charges for TAFE courses; reform of funding models for VET in schools; and establishment of a further education commission to conduct a review of Australia’s current and future vocational education and training needs. I wish we were debating these matters, which have been on the agenda for reform in the TAFE sector certainly for as long as this government have been in power, yet we are not.
We believe that the problems that the government appear to have had with the TAFE system could have been better addressed through providing appropriate funding and continuing to work with the states, training providers, industry and unions to further build on the achievements of the ANTA arrangements to meet Australia’s skills crisis and the social and economic needs of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-08-16,"—This legislation is a matter of profound sadness for me. I think that the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 are a further example of bills so inaptly named that it would suggest a case of misleading the Senate. This legislation actually abolishes the Australian National Training Authority. For honesty’s sake, I think it would be more appropriate to speak of these bills as the ANTA abolition bills. The opposition will be moving amendments in the second reading debate, but if those amendments are not carried the opposition will be opposing this legislation. It is a matter of some regret that this legislation is before the chamber. It is a matter that the nation as a whole should regret. This legislation continues a series of bills through which this government is essentially seeking to turn back the work that Australians have performed to produce great results in many aspects over the last decade and a half.
ANTA, and the national training agenda that it embodied, was one of the great achievements of the Keating government. I have participated in every relevant debate in this chamber since the establishment of ANTA. I recall that the very first bill we debated went to the question of the appointment of the CEO. It is a matter of deep concern that ANTA, which has been known as a world leader in vocational education and training, has now reached the point where the government has this abolition legislation before us. Under the leadership of ANTA, the Australian national vocational education training regime has played an essential role in nation building over the last 12 years or so.
ANTA has played a leading role on the international stage, and Australia has, as I say, been seen as a world leader with regard to national policy development and endeavour in vocational education and training. The work of ANTA has been seen overseas to be as significant as the work that has been undertaken with regard to vocational education and training in some of the great centres of world opinion and practice. For instance, I have had various discussions with German officials, and in Germany ANTA was understood to be an institution of considerable significance. I am profoundly thankful for ANTA’s achievements and I trust that those achievements will outlast the existence of ANTA itself. I trust that the collective aspirations of the vocational education industry in this country will see that those achievements are maintained.
I take the view that the abolition of ANTA is wrong. It is appalling. I take the view that this is further evidence of this government’s short-sightedness and of just how out of touch it is. It is a government that is essentially extremist in its nature. It is a government that is pursuing an ideological agenda, an ideologically motivated vandalism, for which the country as a whole will pay a very high price. ANTA and its officers have given great service to the people of this country. The authority has achieved much over the last 13 years. It has been led by a series of outstanding public servants and policy experts, whose legacy will continue to be understood and acknowledged internationally for many years to come. ANTA was the body that dragged Australia’s eight disparate, separate vocational educational and training systems first into the 20th century and then into the 21st century.
My own association with ANTA and the great expertise of the national training agenda goes back to my days in the Victorian government when I worked with the then state education minister, Joan Kirner. That was during the period in which the initial agreement was signed off with Paul Keating. It was an agreement which could have produced so much more. We came within one vote of developing a truly national institution 13 or so years ago. If it had not been for the leadership change in New South Wales, with Premier Greiner as I recall it, a very different picture might well have emerged from that original agreement. As I say, I have participated in every relevant debate in the 12 years in which I have been in this chamber, and it has been a great disappointment to me that the enormous potential of the National Training Authority, which might well have been reached, has been frittered away by this government.
Australia of course needs to modernise its vocational education and training system. It has to be opened up to new ideas and new levels of skill development. ANTA did that. It also provided the impetus for the streamlining of curriculum development and moved—I make no apologies for this—a considerable distance along the path to ensure that there was a national framework for the creation of a training system that meant that you could get a qualification that meant something anywhere in the country. There were genuine steps made towards the development of a nationally consistent approach to vocational education and training in this country.
Under ANTA we have some of the more advanced systems of training frameworks in the world, based on a competency model rather than on a time-served model. There is a flexibility in the system, where workers and employers alike can find the value of training. It can develop benefits not just for one sector of the economy but for the workers themselves, in terms of enrichment of their lives and their capacity to participate fully in the economy and the society, and for employers, in terms of their businesses.
The Australian training packages developed under ANTA’s auspices were much more accessible and transferable and are a major export service. It is through these processes that Australia has become a world leader in these various aspects of vocational education. It was a unique vision and a unique conjuncture of minds and perspectives that formed and supported that cultural change that arose from the period of the Keating government and the work of the education ministers of the states at that time.
The government has said that ANTA has to go because there is no national consistency. Of course, the government also says that it is run by the unions and that businesses do not get a look in. What a load of nonsense that is. ANTA was always based on the presumption of a tripartite approach to cultural change because that is the only way you get the best out of people—by drawing people in to sit down and talk about problems, ensuring that workers, bosses and government sit together and work through problems. They are plain wrong on those claims. They are particularly wrong, and totally dishonest, in the claim about the failure of national consistency. Those that know something about this matter would recall that, back in 1999, the Australian government instructed the government’s solicitors, Minter Ellison, in the examination of the national consistency program at the time, to exclude from the options paper it prepared for cabinet the proposition that there be a national legislative framework. We all know that is the only way that there can be an effective means of ensuring national consistency.
The instructions from Minter Ellison said that you must go on the basis of common agreements and common clauses in the ANTA agreement. So it was the Commonwealth government itself that excluded from the processes of the intergovernmental agreement the national legislative framework. The fault lies with the Commonwealth government, and it now seeks to use this as a pretext for its abolition of the Australian National Training Authority. We know that you cannot get genuinely national consistency without that legislative underpinning. We know from the railways how difficult it is to get eight separate governments to move together to ensure that there is one single railway gauge throughout the country. We know how difficult it has been in the history of this country to have that sort of standardised approach. A national recognition of vocational qualifications is much harder to achieve than the standardisation of the railway gauges.
ANTA worked tirelessly towards this objective. Under its stewardship, I think that considerable progress was made. But it is totally dishonest to now turn around and say that more progress has not been made because of ANTA when in fact it was the Commonwealth government’s own policy and the instructions that its lawyers and public servants issued that have led to that result. The Commonwealth government, despite the fact it is providing only 35 per cent of the funding, is seeking to impose its will upon the system in such a way as to sweep away the achievements and the structures of vocational education that have produced such great results over the last decade and a half. This government is seeking to use that one-third funding to bully the states in a rather ham-fisted way to accept the ideologically-driven plans of the extremists within this government.
In the industrial relations situation, that has become all too apparent. The government is seeking to impose its antiquated, facile approach to industrial relations through the use of AWAs. It wishes to shut out the voice of working people when it comes to vocational education. It seeks to impose upon the vocational education system a narrow and extremist view of the definition of industry. Take for instance the question of the national industry skills committee that this government is seeking to impose. It says that the committee will have: one employer nominated by the Australian government; one employer representative of ACCI; one employer representative of the AiG; one employer representative from the Business Council; one representative from the National Farmers Federation; three other employers nominated by the Commonwealth; and one single, solitary representative of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is its idea of fairness. That is its idea of trying to ensure that people get a fair approach and fair access to information and advice.
So we will have nine members, one of which will be a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the eight others will be employers. So we have a crucial body with no other representation from the states and territories and no other representation from the various bodies responsible for the actual provision of the training. The states and territories are frozen out of the national decision-making processes. It is not just working people; it is also the states, which provide two-thirds of the money for the operation of the vocational education scheme.
There were 84 staff at ANTA of whom 76 are now leaving. That is an incredible loss of corporate memory. It is an extraordinary waste of expertise. It is a massive loss of corporate and collective knowledge and expertise. Frankly, the vocational education system in this country is notoriously complex, and it is complex by necessity. These are extremely important issues that we are dealing with. We cannot afford to lose 76 out of the 84 staff. We cannot afford to lose that level of understanding. This is a very sad indictment of an extremist government. It shows a lack of vision and a lack of understanding and is a real indictment of the destructive nature of a regime that now thinks that, because it controls the Senate, it can do whatever likes.
The government’s concern is that there has been a failure to have a more simplified and streamlined approach to vocational education and training. Where is the evidence for these complaints? Where is the criticism that the government points to? Where is it coming from? I certainly have not seen much of it. The ANTA board itself has sought to draw to our attention its concerns. In a letter to the minister on 15 April 2005, the ANTA board set out what it considers to be a responsible set of principles to ensure the continuation of an industry led national vocational education system. Among other things, the ANTA board said that there had to be a mutuality of influence between government and industry in decision making. That is quite apparently lacking in these arrangements.
The second thing that the ANTA board said there had to be was a genuinely independent secretariat to serve the advisory bodies. That has yet to be established, because it is assumed that the department of education, who have long been at war with ANTA, will take over those responsibilities. So that second point from the ANTA board has yet to be acknowledged as being important. I suppose Mr David Hind will look with some disappointment on the fact that the government has failed on that point. The third critical issue was that there be continued leadership in improving outcomes for people with disabilities and for Indigenous Australians. I notice that the last on this list has been all but ignored. Three out of three, Dr Nelson; you have failed. The key points that the chair of the ANTA board, David Hind, wrote to you about in terms of the concerns of the ANTA board have not been acknowledged. There has been no genuine independent secretariat for this new advisory structure. There has been no mutuality in the way employers, the government and of course workers can influence decision making about training policy. What we have here is an employer dominated group. We now have a situation where those fundamental principles of tripartite decision making have been rejected.
The national vocational education system in terms of the principles set out by the ANTA board reflects the aspirations and the goals of ANTA itself. They articulate the interests of workers and of trainees. It is a model which has worked exceptionally well in this country and has provided us with an international reputation that we should be proud of.
What we have here is a government whose short-sightedness has fundamentally undermined the national vocational education and training system in this country. The sector will be unable to meet the aspirations that ANTA has set down because this government has undermined the philosophical principles that produced a truly effective national training scheme, which had the fundamental presumption of there being a need for genuine partnership and a unity of purpose. That is what ANTA brought to the national training system and that is what I am afraid the new arrangements brought into play by this government will so heavily discount. We will see a situation where in the future the very best of this country in terms of knowledge and expertise will be removed from the effective administration—(Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-08-16,"—Despite what we have just heard from the senator opposite, the sky is not going to cave in when the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 go through the Senate. The provision of leadership in the area of vocational training, particularly leadership from this government, is going to continue and is going to be provided in great abundance. The training outputs of the national system, complemented hopefully by reformed state systems, will continue to be excellent. I want to come back later to the output of the training system as led by the federal government, which has been so heavily criticised by Senator Carr and others on that side of the chamber who have spoken before me.
It has become crystal clear over recent years that the states and the territories are the ones who, in fact, have fallen short in their responsibility to provide an efficient, successful and outcomes focused vocational education and training system. Indeed, I would submit, as a former minister for training in a state system, that much of the blame for the current skills shortages being experienced in the various sectors of the Australian economy can be clearly sheeted home to the failure of the Labor states to have a serious go at fixing their VET systems.
I am not going to focus too much on the Queensland government today because there will be other opportunities for me to talk about the devastation that they have wreaked on the VET system that I left behind. There will be other times, but today I will focus very specifically on the contents of these bills. I see gross failure at a state level as being the main cause of the issues that Senator Carr has raised, which is one of the reasons that, once the pressure was applied by the federal government, the states have very quickly launched inquiries into how they can fix up their system. Quite frankly, unless they heed some of the advice that is coming from my side of politics, they will not fix their VET systems.
What this legislation reflects is the Howard government’s commitment—in light of the states’ inability to act—to tackle the challenges facing the VET system and to help restore quality and excellence. At this point I would like to take the opportunity to commend my colleague and fellow Queenslander, the member for Moreton in the other place, for his dedication as Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. The legislation is before us today due to his personal commitment to build and secure a quality VET system for all Australians. I know that he has been backed up 100 per cent by Minister Nelson in doing so. I also note that, as a result of the minister’s proactive discussions with state ministers over recent months, he has been able to obtain some agreement from them on a number of facets of this legislation. Additionally, the recent concession by the state premiers that they must work towards ensuring the portability of apprenticeship qualifications across state borders stands as another testament to the minister’s ability to achieve outcomes.
I appreciate the minister’s contribution all the more given my time as the Queensland minister responsible for vocational education and training. In my time in that role I grappled with many of the same challenges facing him now. I must say that I think the package that the minister has developed represents a viable, robust and incisive series of reforms—a series of reforms that represent an excellent opportunity to achieve substantial improvements in the VET system. The process of developing this package has attracted much interest from the TAFE sector. To their credit, many people within TAFE have been supportive of change. They too recognise that there are substantial problems facing the sector and they have happily suggested a number of constructive reforms.
What we have here is a bill many provisions of which the Labor states and key components of TAFE have ticked off. This is not the scorched earth bill that members opposite suggest it is. It is a bill which the Labor-run states and TAFE—which, as I am about to say, is very heavily union dominated—have ticked off. Many of these provisions have been ticked off in a bipartisan fashion. There is, however, a core of belligerent individuals hell-bent on preventing any change, no matter how sensible the proposal. Their complaints as represented by their colleagues in the Australian Labor Party, particularly those who have spoken in this debate in the other place and here today, are summed up rather succinctly in an ABC report from April of this year—yes, I do listen to the ABC, very carefully. The report said:
... the states say they will not agree to the Commonwealth training package because it is unfair to teachers.
Unfair to teachers! There was no mention of students, no mention of retraining unemployed persons so that they can be helped into employment and no mention of apprentices or trainees. All that was mentioned was that it was unfair to the heavily unionised work force of TAFE teachers. That is what is at the hub of this argument. What senators opposite are seeking to do is protect the privileged place, the privileged position, of a heavily unionised work force. They ignore the difficulties facing students, apprentices and trainees and focus solely on demanding absolutely no change to their current archaic industrial arrangements.
This, I suggest, is the sole cause of their opposition. It is not the increased levels of funding offered to the TAFE sector, which in fact are happening. It is not the commitment of the government to remove impediments to competency based qualifications. It is not the proposals to increase the utilisation of TAFE assets. It is none of these things. Opposition to this legislation is based solely on the unions’ hostility towards achieving workplace flexibility. That opposition is completely unfounded. The stated reasons for their so-called concerns have been disproved time and time again.
Workplace flexibility does not mean that you will be forced into a contract. They know this, but as usual they will not face up to the facts. Workplace flexibility does not mean that you will not retain your right to join a union, call a union representative or ask a union representative to help you negotiate a workplace agreement, if indeed you want the assistance of a union representative. Workplace flexibility does not deprive you of your right to collectively bargain. What it does is provide you with an opportunity to negotiate an AWA if you choose to do so. If you do choose to negotiate an AWA, you can do so in the full knowledge that any agreement must under the law be superior to the terms and conditions of your covering award. There is no requirement to accept or even negotiate an AWA. The only requirement is that TAFEs offer employees an opportunity to negotiate one.
What flexibility will do is remove one of the major impediments to addressing our skills shortages. TAFEs deliver the vast majority of apprentice training in skills shortage areas. Flexibility will allow TAFE managers to align their training much more closely with the needs of apprentices and their employers. There are many other good proposals in this bill, particularly in terms of working towards the effective portability of qualifications across state borders, something which, as I have already said, was agreed to and ticked off by the Labor states. There is a lot of good stuff in this bill, and many good provisions have been ticked off by the Labor states. The proposed appropriations and funding mechanisms are also excellent developments in terms of securing a sustainable future for the VET system, including the changes in the administrative arrangements that senators opposite, particularly Senator Carr, have railed against.
I worked very closely with ANTA. I am actually one of the people in this chamber who has had almost three years of working experience in relation to ANTA. The Australian National Training Authority was established in 1992 to coordinate the levels of government in establishing a national vocational education and training system. Closing ANTA down, even by the stretch of the wildest imagination of anyone who sits on the other side, is in no way the detrimental act of vandalism that people opposite are accusing us of perpetrating. Twelve years on, this national system with industry leadership—the national system that ANTA was created to nurture—is in fact in place.
We need to have a look at some of the circumstances that were in place back in 1992 when ANTA was established. Australia then faced an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. Today the unemployment rate stands at 5.1 per cent. We now face quite a different predicament: the need to maximise Australia’s skills base to make sure that we can provide the skilled workers that industry and businesses need, where and when they need them. Twelve years ago, before the establishment of ANTA, Australia had eight separate training systems operating quite independently of each other with the content and delivery of training largely determined by training providers. Today the foundations of a national system are largely in place. However, real progress on a number of key issues has been thwarted by the states and territories, by Labor Party state ministers—not by the people in ANTA, not by the very dedicated group of people that I got to know and who have been very committed to advancing the interests of a genuinely national vocational education and training system, but by Labor state ministers responsible for the development of a national system of vocational education and training.
In the light of this, the Australian government has determined that it will play a genuine leadership role in continuing to promote and put in place a genuine system of vocational education and training. The abolition of ANTA and the transfer of its functions to the department reflects the Australian government’s commitment to a more integrated and proactive approach to the education and training needs of young people.
I heard Senator Carr talk about 74 or 76 people who used to work for ANTA leaving ANTA. What happens when administrative arrangements are changed subsequent to elections and subsequent to government decisions is that some people will have to consider what they do next and where they are going to go under the new arrangements. The advice that I have received is that, if those ANTA people had wanted to integrate themselves back into the machinery of government responsible for the administration and development of a genuine vocational education and training system, they could have gone over to the department and they could have continued to contribute the undoubtedly magnificent skills and corporate memory that they had developed as a result of their diligent application in ANTA.
I take this opportunity to say thank you to all those people who committed themselves to the development of excellence in vocational education and training across our nation. I believe most of them will still continue, in one way or another, to make a contribution to the development of excellence and to the sustainment of excellence in our vocational education and training system, be it at a state level or at a federal level. But the advice that I have is that none of them were asked to go or were not afforded further opportunity to serve in the training system that they helped to create.
I heard Senator Carr talk about the new national industry skills committee. He railed about the lack of adequate union representation on that committee. What that particular statement underlines is the basic misunderstanding that the Labor Party have of training in this country and it also underlines their true motives. The misunderstanding is that they have failed to acknowledge, time after time, that the two most essential components of the training system are the employers and the trained output. If you do not have the employers participating and having a fundamentally dominant and entrenched role in the provision of training, they will not have the confidence that employers need to have in order to employ the trained outputs. You can never move away from that reality. You just cannot move away from that basic reality.
I say to the senators opposite that this government has its priorities right. It is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of creating competence in the training market that gives the employer the trained output that they need to have in order to have the confidence to employ them. That is the first misunderstanding that is constantly propagated—probably deliberately—by senators opposite and other members of the Labor Party. The employer is the fundamental underpinning of a training system.
The other thing that has happened—and I think Australians are increasingly realising the importance of this point—is that the Labor Party have lost the battle of ideology when it comes to workplace relations. We have heard reflected in the speeches made by Senator Carr and undoubtedly we will hear in the speech that is about to made by Senator Marshall that they are now looking towards perhaps extending the activities of the unions into the area of training. Having lost the battle of ideology when it comes to workplace relations, they are now seeking to increase their influence, their relevance and their recruiting practices within the area of vocational education and training. This has been going on now for approximately 10 years as, progressively, union membership in the more traditional trades and other areas where union membership has been high continues to decline.
They are trying to shift the ground so that they can gain relevance in an area where, with all due respect, they should not be seeking the relevance that they are demanding. I see a sinister motive—a very sinister motive: a cynical and ideological motive—for their determination to get themselves even more involved in the area of training. Nobody is denying anybody the ability to have their input, but I again reiterate a point that I fervently believe—that is, that the two most essential components of a training system are the employers and the people being trained. Without a very good relationship between those two components, you just do not get an output that employers have confidence in employing.
Let us look at what this government has done in terms of funding. This year the Australian government will spend a record $2.5 billion on vocational and technical education, including an additional injection of over $280 million for a suite of new initiatives designed to address skills needs, particularly in the traditional trades. The funding package for 2005-06—and we have not heard this from those opposite—includes: $343.6 million to establish the 24 Australian technical colleges in regional, and I stress regional, and also metropolitan locations suffering skill needs, to provide quality education and trade training for senior secondary students; $4.3 million to establish the institute of trade skills excellence, which will provide industry, as a key client of the national training system, with the capacity to identify, acknowledge, reward and promote excellence in skill development and training; $20.7 million for a tool kit for each new apprentice starting an apprenticeship in specific trades from 1 July 2005; $12.6 million for an additional 5,000 places in the New Apprenticeships Access Program, which assists job seekers who experience barriers to skilled employment to obtain and maintain a new apprenticeship; $5.8 million towards an additional 7,000 school based new apprenticeship opportunities and up to 4,500 pre-vocational training places in the trades over the next four years through group training arrangements; and $15.3 million for a scholarship for new apprentices who successfully complete the first and second year of a new apprenticeship in a trade with skills needs with a small to medium sized business.
That level of funding and these initiatives clearly underline this government’s commitment to the development of vocational education and training for this year. I could go on and talk about the in-training numbers, the record completions, the traditional trades, women in New Apprenticeships, young people and mature-age workers in New Apprenticeships and the satisfaction levels that have been measured in relation to all the participants in the system. The figures for those have been put on the record time after time in this place and in the other place. All of those figures show that, under the system of vocational education and training, for which the federal government has been providing key leadership, there has been a massive increase in all of those key areas. To pick up on the last point made by Senator Carr, we now have record low numbers of long-term unemployed people as they have been placed in employment, mainly the result of the Howard government’s training initiatives. I am very proud to support this bill, and I am very proud to support and recognise the achievement of this government in vocational education and training and, in particular, in the strong national leadership role that it has played since it came to power in 1996.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-08-16,"—I rise today to address yet another piece of flawed legislation that combines all the worst aspects of the government’s hubris and contempt for the welfare and prosperity of the Australian people and I thank the previous speaker, Senator Santoro, for most adequately demonstrating that point on behalf of the government.
The Howard government continues to wage a contemptible war on the workplace rights of Australia’s men and women whilst disregarding the real needs of our economy and, in particular, the skills shortage. The legislation before ustoday is no different in this regard and it too highlights in a stark sense the hypocrisy of the Howard government over education and training issues. There is gross hypocrisy in this government’s position on training issues. During its first term in office, the Howard government tore millions of dollars out of vocational education and training and then spent the remainder of the past decade ignoring the frantic cries for support of the sector in order for it to meet Australia’s training needs. Those calls were ignored at the time, yet, today—in the midst of a skills crisis—we have some government action. That action, however, outlines a regime of legislative proscription comprising interference in and control over institutions that would have been deemed excessive even in Franco’s Spain let alone in the field of public vocational education and training in Australia in the 21st century.
The objectives of the bills before the Senate are appropriate enough, but the text of the legislation itself completely fails to meet them. We do need to provide a highly skilled work force which will meet the future needs of Australian businesses, industries, communities and individuals, and promote a national approach to the delivery of vocational education and training. We must ensure that this occurs through collaboration and cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states, unions, businesses and educational institutions for us to support a national training system that is responsive to the needs of industry, employers and workers. Undoubtedly, the system should ensure high quality and nationally consistent vocational education and training, but the government alludes to making the system streamlined and simple to access. Since when has the Howard government ever been concerned about simplifying and streamlining?
The Minister for Education, Science and Training in particular has made it more difficult for education providers, participants and aspirants in general with practically every piece of legislation he has introduced into the parliament. Again, this legislation is no different. Simplification of vocational education and training is a noble ambition, but one that has already been lost through the dissolution of the Australian National Training Authority and the attempt to impose shameful workplace relations requirements on educators. On this issue, it is worth noting that the Liberal and National parties are deliberately ambushing our vocational education and training providers—and that has also been the case with the higher education sector. These providers are being placed in an impossible situation in which their funding is tied to circumstances that are unwanted, unnecessary and impossible to implement. It is yet another example of this government placing ideology over commonsense and decency. There is not, to disappoint government senators, an easy or quick answer to addressing the skills shortage, and this legislation will certainly not do the job. There are many aspects of vocational education that cannot simply be sped up or streamlined and, by placing educators on workplace agreements that undermine their job security, nothing will be done to improve the current skills crisis.
Then there is the element of uncertainty introduced with the legislation by making annual payments to the states for the sector reliant upon the federal minister’s discretion. An obvious question is: what happens if and when the government decides to fund a particular training course for only two out of three years? What happens then? Will the trainees then have to somehow find the resources to pay for private finalisation of their qualifications? It is a preposterous situation. So too is the intention of the legislation to give back some funding to the sector—mind you, via private providers—with money that should have otherwise been pouring into the public vocational education sector for years. The fact is that the money promised by this legislation is money that has been withheld from the public system for years. It is not really new money at all. It is worth noting the minister’s previous experience in spending public money to prop up private education facilities and how that became an absolute disaster. We all remember that great white elephant that was Melbourne University Private.
It is of great concern to me that government senators would be so excited at the prospect of opening up our public education facilities for the use of private providers. They seem to forget the crucial point that publicly funded educational infrastructure has always been designed and paid for on the premise that it would facilitate the training of those in the pubic system. If private providers cannot afford to fund the necessary resources they need in order to offer high-quality training alternatives to those offered by the public system, it is not the job of the Australian government to financially prop them up. Whatever your ideology, this situation does not make good economic sense.
The government cannot simply, for the first time in a decade, pull its head out of the sand, glance about, finally hear the cries from individuals in the community, from businesses, unions, the states—from the entire nation—and from the OECD, and react by glossing over a decade of negligence, throwing a paltry and inadequate sum of cash on the table, and then patting itself on the back for a job well done. The government’s inaction has been a job far from well done.
Calling upon the states and territories to increase their funding to the sector is yet another example of the hypocrisy and empty words used with callous abandon by government members in this place. There are aspects of this legislation that would be embarrassing if, in its entirety, the legislation was not such a disgrace. Abolishing the Australian National Training Authority Ministerial Council and replacing it with the vocational education ministerial council, which has the exact same composition and responsibilities as its predecessor, is obviously a pure stroke of genius. Suffice it to say that it is an excellent example of the astonishing semantic foresight of this government. With this breadth of vision and commitment to radical restructuring that is so profound that to the average Australian it might seem pointless and unnecessary, it is not hard to see how the situation got this bad in the first place. What characterised the success of ANTA was its tripartite nature. Established with, and composed of, government, workers and business, it was an effective example of functional federalism through the collaborative approach adopted by state and Commonwealth governments, and of partnership with the community and business. Its success can easily be measured by our country’s current prosperity.
If this government was serious about anything other than union bashing then it would acknowledge that the quality of training provided in public institutions throughout the community is essential to ensure flexibility in our work force. Comprehensive training, combined with a stable and resourced vocational education and training sector that allows for additional and rapid retraining, is what is required but what this legislation will fail to deliver if Labor’s amendments are not adopted. Is it arrogance that is causing the government to knowingly destroy the opportunities of a generation of deserving Australians, or is it ignorance? Or is it a sad combination of both?
Apprentice drop-out rates remain unacceptably high. However, nothing in the legislation before us counters this issue, or seeks to address the poor pay and conditions many apprentices have to endure. In 2003, there were some 46,000 deserving applicants nationally who were denied a place in one of Australia’s TAFE courses. The government must now recognise that meeting this demand is another crucial step towards addressing the skills crisis. This situation has represented an absolute insult to the Australian people and the Australian economy. In particular, it is an insult to the thousands of students who have applied for and deserved entry into our TAFE courses over the past decade but, due to a lack of funding and not their inabilities, have been denied a place. When businesses in the information and communications technology sector, in the electrical and electronics industries, in the food, health, science, building and engineering industries, are all suffering from skills shortfalls, how can this government justify turning away thousands of aspiring Australians with the merits and qualifications to learn? You cannot ignore the fact that the privatisation of public utilities and infrastructure has also played its part in contributing to the decline in apprenticeship training.
User choice in the legislation must also be clarified. Under the plan, it will be all too easy for unscrupulous employers to exploit apprentices in tandem with private providers, by insisting upon their choice of training at a cost disadvantageous to the apprentice. This concerns me greatly, as it would the community generally. How then do we develop a system that delivers high-quality vocational education to the Australian people and leaves trainees skilled and productive, a flexible work force that can adapt to new technologies and work practices that meet Australia’s social needs—in particular those of our ageing population—and is not left behind by the fast pace of technology and innovation, and changing work patterns? We will certainly not do so with this legislation, that is for sure.
We do not have a skills shortage in this country—we have a skills crisis. In March this year, the Age newspaper in Melbourne reported that there were 1.7 million people in Australia who were unemployed, underemployed or prematurely retired. Many of these people are lacking in the skills and training they need to fill the job vacancies that have been identified for them. We cannot pretend that this has just occurred. We did not all wake up yesterday to find a skills crisis in this country. And it is not an issue that can be solved by offering a poisoned chalice of funding and stripping the entire work force of their basic human rights.
Let us not forget that the promise of financial aid from the Commonwealth to the states under this legislation is tainted by more than the ideological gun the government is holding to their heads; it is also tainted by the wider implications of the aforementioned changes to the infrastructure of Australian workplaces. Even if—and we have to really stretch our imaginations here—this package was capable of providing more skilled workers for Australia, potential workplaces will be suffering tremendous instability from the foul legislation proposed by this government to strip away the rights of working people to fair pay and conditions. The turmoil and crisis this government has provoked, through its neglect of the funding of vocational training, is about to be multiplied a hundredfold throughout the workplaces of Australia.
Our ageing population means that Australia requires more health professionals to care for our elderly and more tax revenue to pay for this care, and the retirement of workers from sensitive industries is going to further exacerbate the skills crisis. This issue requires real and immediate attention, not diversions such as the legislation before us today.
No legislation with industrial relations components can be considered by this chamber without recognising the deliberate attempt by this government to politically persecute union members and violate their rights as stated by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This legislation, with its AWA proposition, is no different.
But let us take a look at AWAs. They have been a real embarrassment for the government. The 2.4 per cent of the workplaces they cover hardly validates the always false mantra that the award and enterprise bargaining system is outdated. The fact is that the system is obviously superior to that of individual contracts, the vast majority of Australians support it and it should not be messed with. So how does a government drunk on power and determined to crush any organisation or individual capable of exposing its unfairness, inadequacy or hypocrisy get more people to sign up to dud AWA deals? It forces them to, of course. If, after 10 years, over 97 per cent of Australians have shown that they are not interested in AWAs then it is clear what the government is trying to do with legislation such as this: it is social engineering of the worst kind.
Why are we spending billions of dollars on a war which is now supposedly about bringing democracy to the Middle East when we are stripping our own citizens of the most basic rights, including the right to freedom of expression? I despair for the National and Liberal parties of the coalition. I have always believed you to be ethically and ideologically inadequate when it came to governing, but I am disgusted by how underhanded and despicable your actions have become. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-16,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I refer the minister to Telstra CEO Sol Trujillo’s declaration to the shareholders last week that he was hired by the board ‘to tell the truth’. Can the minister confirm that the truth Mr Trujillo told the Telstra board is that Australia is in the bottom quartile of developed countries in terms of its telecommunications services? Does the minister recall the Prime Minister’s statement during the last election campaign when he said:
We believe they (services) are, to use my expression of three years ago, up to scratch.
Who should the Australian public believe in relation to the true state of telecommunications services in Australia: Prime Minister Howard just before an election or Sol ‘I have to tell the truth’ Trujillo?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-16,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate how much money Telstra has spent on share buybacks to prop up the price of the stock over the last three years? Does the minister agree that, because of these buybacks, Telstra has failed to make essential investments in its network and thereby has reduced the competitiveness of Australian businesses? Don’t Mr Trujillo’s comments show that the Telstra board has been focused on the government’s desire to fatten up Telstra for sale rather than on delivering services for businesses and consumers in this country?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-16,"—Thank you, Senator Conroy, for the question. The situation with services in Australia is of course that this government has invested over a billion dollars to ensure that, whilst and until competition works more evenly and matures right across Australia, it identifies areas of unmet need where services from time to time have been patchy and makes the investment to ensure that services are adequate for those in rural and regional Australia. It is very interesting to see on the front page of the Australian today a glowing story about how those in rural and regional Australia are certainly much more satisfied with services provided by Telstra. I think it shows quite clearly, and indeed the story featured shows in point, that services that were undreamt of a matter of a couple of years ago are now regularly and quite routinely available right across Australia.
The government’s approach to encouraging competition—which means that there is a range of competitive services available in populous areas and a lot of choice for consumers together with regulated safeguards that look after the interests of consumers and targeted investment either where there is market failure or where it is uncommercial for telecommunications providers to go—is in fact a formula that has seen the roll-out of broadband double across this country, just in the course of the year that I have been in this portfolio. We now have I think nearly two million subscribers, and we are actually climbing on the OECD ladder. In fact, we are now in the top 10 countries when measured by the rate of take-up of broadband.
I do not think it could be said that services in rural and regional Australia are anything other than vastly improved by this government’s consistent investment in what is needed by way of broadband and by way of targeted infrastructure. This will ensure that there are backbones that provide up-and-down links and a range of technologies that give rise to services in health, education and distance learning. These are all areas I have seen with my own eyes, having been to some 45 communities that are rolling out broadband.
From my own experience and having regard to the government’s record on the level of investment in this country, it is fair to say that services are well and truly adequate. That is not to say that, as this government looks to future proofing the bush, there is not some need to look at some future arrangements. With technology changing so quickly, you do not know in five years time what is coming down the pipeline. Technology that is adequate now will not necessarily be adequate in five years time. That is the area where some provision needs to be made to ensure that services are not only adequate now but will remain so into the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-16,"—I am not going to comment specifically on Telstra’s financial performance. There is some capital expenditure money in the budget, as I understand it, that Telstra will be providing to remediate some of the exchanges. Senator Conroy would know that this government is not going to leave behind the people in rural and regional Australia. This is in contrast to the Labor Party, who have not had a plan to spend a cent in rural and regional Australia. They have not in the past and they certainly do not now. They are a one-trick pony.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-08-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Conroy today relating to Telstra.
The minister has demonstrated today that she, like this government, is completely and totally out of touch when it comes to the question of telecommunications. We have here a government which is hell-bent on taking action in complete contrast to the wishes of over two-thirds of the people of this country. We have here a government which is unable to stand up to the management of Telstra which is running riot with a public company. We have to ask ourselves: what would the consequences be of a management like we have now, if the company were fully privatised? We have got into a situation where, according to today’s Financial Review, the management of Telstra is now seeking to blackmail this government—it is set to threaten this government with a capital strike if this government does not do what the management of Telstra wants it to do in regard to the deregulation of telecommunications.
The company is now earning the highest corporate profits this country has ever seen—a figure of some $4½ billion—as a direct result of its price-gouging of domestic consumers. It is a situation in which $125 million has been gouged from the public—for instance, through the massive increases in line rental. Since 2000, we have seen line rentals increase from $11.65 per month to over $30 per month. It is now costing $360 per year just to rent the line and the bit of plastic. That is before you make one single phone call. What would it be like with a fully privatised Telstra?
We now have a situation in which a company is securing profits of $4½ billion. Of that $4½ billion, $2½ billion should come back to the taxpayers. You have to ask yourself: what is the economic logic of a government that seeks to give away those dividends to the public? What is the logic of a government that is seeking to hand money back to the private sector in this way when the needs of this country are so evident and so pressing? How can the government claim that it can buy off part of this parliament and seek to bribe members of this parliament by suggesting that a fund be available for people in regional areas when so many cities in this country are going without services at the moment? You do not have to go to the regional areas to find out just how inadequate Telstra’s services are. You only have to be 90 minutes from the Melbourne CBD, where constituents of mine in the Seymour district—hardly a remote area—say that they cannot get mobile services within one and a half hours of the centre of Melbourne. I am told that you can only get services in parts of the districts around Seymour between 12 pm and 1 pm on a weekday, and you can only do that if you stand on the roof of your ute in a paddock.
I am told that you cannot get mobile services in Canberra, five kilometres from Parliament House, on Hindmarsh Drive and William Hovell Drive. There are blackspots within five minutes of this parliament. We have a similar situation at Bellarine Peninsula just outside Geelong in Victoria where people cannot get mobile services. We have a situation out in Calwell, in Tuggeranong, where, in recently developed areas of this capital city, Telstra cabling will not even support the most rudimentary ADSL services provided. A resident of Calwell has told my office that he had his phone line tested by two internet service providers and both of them said that the line was not up to scratch. We are talking about the capital of Australia, not remote regions. We have the failure of Telstra, despite the enormous profits that it is making, not being able to provide services to this country.
There was a time in this country when Telstra was regarded as one of those fundamental nation-building instruments that the government had at its disposal. We are now being told that, through price gouging and the buying of votes, these fundamental public assets are going to be taken away from the people of this country and given to the private sector for the benefit of the few rather than to build the nation as a whole. We have a situation in which the three amigos in the new Telstra management are now seeking to blackmail this government with a capital strike if this government does not come on board and do what it is told by this new management. We have the Americanisation of telecommunications and we are told that this is good enough for the new-look National Party. How pathetic! (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-08-16,"—The contorted, twisted logic we have heard from Senator Carr is simply breathtaking. Senator Carr argues that we ought to not sell Telstra because the services are inadequate and because Australians are not satisfied with the services they receive. He said, ‘Just how inadequate Telstra’s services are is obvious by moving around Australia.’ Senator Carr has quoted from a Newspoll survey which purports to prove that people do not want to sell Telstra, but he neglects to mention that the same poll also canvassed the question of how satisfied Australians were with the services that Telstra provides. What does the poll show? It shows that, in a survey across the whole population, something like 75 per cent of those who were surveyed were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the services provided by Telstra in their local area. Again, a majority of people polled by Newspoll indicated that they found the charges levied by Telstra for their services to be either satisfactory or very satisfactory. Evidence like that demonstrates quite clearly that Australians have noticed that, under this government, there has been a substantive and sustained improvement in the quality of services that Telstra provides. That is not surprising, because this government has assiduously set out to put standards in place that will raise the quality of telecommunications services that Australians can expect to receive.
Of course, Labor did none of that. Labor had no plan, no provision of a platform from which services could be built. The fact is that, in Labor’s time of looking after Telstra, we saw services go backwards in many respects. During the 13 years that Labor was in government, there were no requirements on telephone companies to either install a new service or to fix a service or line that had become dysfunctional within any particular time frame. This government has put those standards in place. Under Labor, the most remote customers in Australia could expect to wait up to 27 months for a new service to be installed. Under this government, with the customer service guarantees that have been put in place, no customer has to wait more than 20 working days for a new phone service. Similarly, we have put in place requirements for the repair of lines and other basic standards for provision of services to the community through the universal service obligations. That is a demonstration of why the regulation of those services is important. It is the regulation of those services and the provision of a basic set of standards below which any provider of telecommunications services should not go that are the important features of this debate, not the question of who actually owns the shares in the company.
If we are serious about providing high-quality services to the Australian community, we should do so by setting standards for all providers in the marketplace, not just one of them. Of course, there are a number of those providers out there. Optus, Vodafone, Hutchison and so on are now providing services to the community. We do not own those companies. We should therefore be prepared to regulate that marketplace without having to be in there as the owner of one of those service providers and have the problem of a conflict of interest with both regulating that marketplace and owning one of the key providers within it. The fact is that Australians are broadly satisfied with the services that have been provided by Telstra. To the extent that people are not satisfied, the argument needs to be addressed as to why you would continue with the present ownership arrangements if people are dissatisfied with the services that they receive from Telstra. If those arrangements are in some way connected to the ownership of Telstra then please explain how you need to own Telstra to be able to regulate it. The fact is that you do not, and the lifting of standards that we have achieved— (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2005-08-16,"—That was a very interesting response because Senator Humphries and no doubt the rest of the Liberal Party are obviously choosing to read only the part they want to read. Senator Humphries makes a great deal of the percentage of people who are satisfied with the service, and completely fails to address the issue that, despite the fact that there has been an increase in satisfaction, there has also been an increase in the number of people who do not want to sell Telstra. This is what the government, for some strange reason, does not seem to get. The Australian public does not want you to sell Telstra.
Senator Helen Coonan adopted the same attitude last week when I asked her a question about polling undertaken by the New South Wales Farmers Association. She dismissed that completely. She also dismissed a nationwide poll to which I referred. This poll was in the Canberra Times and was remarkably similar to the Newspoll one which was published in the Australian today. Indeed, the Canberra Times poll goes a bit further, and breaks down by state the level of disapproval of the government for selling Telstra. It was very interesting to note that the disapproval was highest in Queensland, where 79 per cent of those polled disapproved of the government selling Telstra. That has got to be as close to unanimous as you would want. That has got to be a very strong, and increasingly strong, message to the government which they appear determined to ignore. This is apparently on ideological grounds, because the government have been thrashing around trying to find a reason to sell Telstra—because they are regulating, because they want more competition, all these kinds of reasons—but basically they just have an ideological position that they want to sell any asset held in public hands, despite what the people of Australia are telling them.
I think the people of Australia are telling the government that they do not want Telstra sold because there is an increasing understanding that telecommunications are vital to families and to businesses in Australia. This is what, with the improvement of services and the accessing of those services, people are beginning to understand—how much better telecommunications make their life and their business, and how important access to telecommunications is for their lives, for their education and for their business. They do not want control of that telecommunications infrastructure taken out of the hands of the government.
This is something that, up until now anyway, the National Party seemed to be aware of, and that Senator Barnaby Joyce seems to have made great play of in the past. But it now looks like he is also willing to sell out for a slush fund being set up for the National Party. That would indeed be a betrayal of the 79 per cent of Queenslanders who do not want Telstra sold, regardless of the services, if he gave the numbers to the government and voted with them to sell Telstra. It would be a great betrayal of the people who elected the National Party and the Liberal Party to government and to a majority in this house.
It is interesting to see how the government has reacted to the new CEO of Telstra, Mr Trujillo. Every day, Senator Coonan must get up and wish that she had Ziggy Switkowski back as CEO of Telstra, because Sol Trujillo has certainly created a great deal of interest here. The government has been busy fattening up Telstra for sale—by not spending enough on infrastructure, by not spending enough on maintenance and by reducing its work force—to improve the profits of Telstra and make it look good. Then Mr Trujillo comes along, takes over the business and states what is to him blindingly obvious: that in fact not enough has been spent on broadband and other infrastructure by Telstra, that it has been neglected in the past few years and also that Telstra’s profits are likely to diminish with increased competition and with worldwide trends.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-08-16,"—A group of schoolchildren has just left the gallery and they will be asking their teacher, ‘Who was that frightening looking man who spoke about Telstra and seemed angry about Telstra?’ I will tell them who it was. It was Senator Carr, who was so concerned about the sale of Telstra that he made his speech and scurried out of here. This is the same fellow who was so concerned about the Commonwealth Bank and Australian Airlines that he was quite happy for them to be sold off. We did not hear a word from him then.
Then he had the gall, in the two minutes he was here, to talk about his regional and rural bona fides. He stopped eating eggs when he found out where they came from, and he has only just discovered where milk comes from. Honestly and truly, how dare Senator Carr come into this chamber and talk about Telstra and telecommunications when he was part of a government which for 13 years did absolutely nothing for telecommunications in this country. Indeed, they left a legacy that I think people have stopped talking about because they do not believe it happened. That legacy was the withdrawal of analog before the 1996 election. With the swipe of a pen they took analog out of the system, without any idea of a replacement. And it was up to this government to do something about it, which we did.
Again, the Labor Party, who did nothing in 13 years of government, have now got the gall to turn around and lecture us. It is a policy-free zone across the other side, and this policy-free zone is lecturing to us about telecommunications in regional and rural Australia. What a gall. You did nothing in 13 years and you have absolutely no idea what you want to do. In fact, I think the only thing you have got going at the moment is—that’s right—$5 billion worth of taxpayers’ money to be spent on now obsolete dial-up internet services. Well, thank you for your contribution to telecommunications in regional and rural Australia, if that is the best you can do after all the time you have had to look at what the deficiencies are!
For the benefit of the Senate and those who are listening, I will just go through what the Allen Consulting Group actually found out about the Howard government’s telecommunications reforms. I will go through those, and you might want to listen. And Senator Carr, instead of coming in here and feigning indignation about Telstra and scurrying off again, should come and listen to this. The Allen Consulting Group found that government reforms have increased the size of the Australian economy by more than $10 billion—$10,000 million; created approximately 26,000 new jobs; and delivered benefits to small businesses of $2.1 billion. As a result, Australian households have been on average $720 better off.
There are now more than 100 telecommunications carriers operating in Australia. What did the Labor Party do? They had this nice cosy little duopoly of Optus and Telstra—or Telecom, as it was—and that is all they did. That was their contribution to telecommunications in this country. There are now more than 16 million mobile phones in operation in Australia, operating on a variety of networks, including Hutchison’s 3G network. The number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now well over one million. In a good sign for competition, almost half of Telstra’s ADSL subscriptions are wholesale services being resold by competitors.
We are happy to have a sensible debate on this, but we are not going to be lectured to by a group of people who simply have no policies to address real issues in regional and rural Australia. This government’s record stands on its own with the money that we have spent, nearly $1 billion, and over 33 new and different programs have gone into regional and rural Australia since 1996—the Liberal and National parties working together to ensure better telecommunications for regional and rural Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2005-08-16,"—I do not have a voice of the volume of Senator Ronaldson’s—
—Or Senator Carr’s!
—or Senator Carr’s—but I will certainly speak with as much passion about this issue. I have taken great interest in the responses of Senator Coonan, Senator Humphries and Senator Ronaldson on the issue of the full privatisation of Australia’s national telecommunications carrier, Telstra. I have to say that, having listened carefully to the questions and having read other information that the government have put out justifying their proposal to flog off the rest of Telstra, I am still really puzzled. I am sure my puzzlement will earn me some gratuitous comment from the other side about how naive I am on these matters—and maybe, being a newcomer, I am—but I do not understand why the government want to spend billions of taxpayers’ dollars to prop up Telstra to make it more attractive to private investors when, overwhelmingly, the people of Australia do not want it sold.
As Senator Hurley said, there was a survey reported in the Australian newspaper today which said 70 per cent of Australians do not want Telstra sold. But I do not need to refer to a newspaper poll to find out that Australians do not want Telstra sold; I can rely on my own experience. Senator Ronaldson made some gratuitous comment about our bona fides on this side of the house with regard to rural and regional Australia. I can tell you I spent the last 11 years as a union official, and that involved travelling extensively in rural and regional Australia. When the people I was visiting in those areas found out that I had been preselected for the Senate, I can tell you one of the first things they said to me was: ‘What is your position going to be on the sale of Telstra? Because out here in the bush our services are not up to standard. Out here in the bush, we have to beg to have anything comparable with what you’ve got in the city, and we are very frightened about the privatisation of Telstra because we know that what’s going to happen to us is the same as what happened to us’—here in South Australia, they were talking about—‘when the state Liberal government privatised the energy industry in South Australia.’ That is the comparison that the people in rural and regional South Australia are drawing. I can tell you what happened when the energy industry got privatised.

Senator Boswell interjecting—

—I am telling you what happened when another essential service got privatised. That is, the cost to the consumer went up by 20 per cent. Not only did the cost to the consumer go up by 20 per cent but the services that were delivered in the bush went down. They plummeted down, down, down. People in the bush know what privatisation means; it means that they miss out big time.
I can tell you that travelling in the bush as a union official was a fraught experience, because you did not need to go too far out of Adelaide before you had no mobile phone coverage. It was rare that you could find somewhere to plug in your laptop and get broadband service. But I only had to be out there a few days. The people I talked to worked in local councils mainly, but often their partners were on farms or they also ran businesses in those rural and regional areas, and they complained bitterly about how they were unable to run their businesses successfully because they just did not have access to basic telecommunications services. So those people in the bush said to me, ‘For God’s sake, don’t support the sale of Telstra, and tell those people on the other side that they shouldn’t support the sale of Telstra either.’
I have spent a bit of time talking to Senator Barnaby Joyce. We are, as you know, in the class of 2004 together and we came into the Senate on 1 July 2005.
—Honour amongst thieves!

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

—Senator Ronaldson mentions thieves. We can talk about thieves; we can talk about private telecommunications companies. And, Senator Ronaldson, I have not seen much of Optus or Vodafone out in rural and regional Australia either. I have not seen them setting up offices in Port Augusta, Whyalla or Port Lincoln.
I was talking about Senator Joyce’s attitude to the sale of Telstra. I was impressed by the fact that he was going to represent Queenslanders. The Queenslanders put him into power. My mother was a Queenslander. They are great people. They have given us some intriguing and interesting politicians—that is for sure. The fact is that it seems Senator Joyce, unfortunately, is going soft. Somebody mentioned jelly or something before. I hope that has not happened to Senator Joyce and I hope he has not been bought off. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-08-16,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Australian Government to address the scourge of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities by implementing the comprehensive roll-out of Opal Fuel through the entire Central Desert Region.
I think that in my 10 years in this place this is only the second such motion I have brought before the Senate. It is a motion of the utmost urgency and importance. As a former doctor, a senator, a citizen and as an Australian, I feel deeply ashamed by the awesomely bad health statistics and other living standard statistics by which we can measure the fact that the rest of the community are having a much better time of it than the original Australians. When it comes to the scourge of petrol sniffing, the shame I feel is greatly compounded by the lack of action by the national government and, indeed, the Northern Territory government in rolling out Opal fuel throughout the entire Central Desert region as one way—but a mightily important way—of dealing with petrol sniffing.
If the statistics I have are correct, there are some 600 young Aboriginal people in that region who are already addicted to petrol sniffing. Last year, three died. Another 100 became or are seriously mentally or physically disabled. With petrol sniffing comes violence, a removal of sexual inhibition, destructive and antisocial behaviour, the destruction of the individual, a zone of incomprehensible distress in the family and the community, and loss to everybody involved. The unusual thing about petrol sniffing is that there is now an obvious option. It is Opal petrol, courtesy of BP, which is vapourless. In other words, it is sniffless. The problem is that it costs a few cents more per litre than conventional unleaded petrol.
In my, albeit brief, recent visit to Alice Springs, there seemed to be enormous community goodwill towards substituting conventional petrol with the sniffless variety. This is courtesy of BP, who have extended the formula to other petrol distributors. The question is: should we not have government action—and urgent government action—to put the $8 million or $10 million required behind a roll-out across Central Australia, given the community goodwill and the pleas for assistance from the Indigenous community and the people who work with them in this unspeakably desperate situation of petrol sniffing that overcomes families, kinships and societies? The answer is: yes, we should.
The government has put enormous amounts of money into trying to stop the supply of destructive and illicit drugs to the wider community. All that can be asked is that it puts a fraction of that money into this ready answer to stopping the supply of this destructive drug to Indigenous communities in Central Australia. Other drugs, not least marijuana and alcohol, are ravaging these communities as well. However, petrol sniffing is rapidly destroying young Aboriginal people in a burgeoning Aboriginal population—one-third of the Territory population and growing rapidly compared with the rest of the population. Half the kids in schools in the Northern Territory are now Indigenous kids. Are we not to move to get rid of this potent destroyer of those kids’ brains? Are we not to move to do much more to assist those who are affected? How can it be that a community has one man walking around today who has tried to kill himself four times in the last year? How can it be that we allow communities where young pregnant women can walk down the street sniffing a brain-destructive drug in full and open view of society? Where is the infrastructure to stop this and to back up those people who are urgently trying to do something to put an end to it within their communities?
At Mutitjulu, which is being talked about so much at the moment, it is not just a plea for ending the supply of petrol. This community is trying to design and implement youth development strategies to protect the kids and to get them back on the right track. It is engaging in governance training and reforming the community constitution to make more informed decisions about its future—such as running a child-care centre to protect the kids, and so on. But the community cannot handle the distress that has come upon them.
When I hear the Minister for Health and Ageing say that Indigenous people caught up in this seem hell-bent on self-destruction, I grieve that we have a minister who does not understand. People do not want to be hell-bent on self-destruction, but addiction cuts across the normal way in which we behave. And the destruction of cultures is a potent form of people looking for alternatives such as addiction. We all have a great responsibility here. Replacing petrol with sniffless petrol in Central Australia is one answer, but it is a ready, potent answer which we can know is going to save lives, is going to reduce disability and is going to have a potent, good impact in Central Australia, and, moreover, it is something we can do now. I appeal to the government, I appeal to the ministers involved, to take this step amongst the many others we must take, because that is what the people involved with this are crying out for the government to do.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2005-08-16,"—I rise today to speak to a motion that is very close to my heart and to the heart of Territorians. I have to question the timing of this motion, though. It is probably not for me to suggest political opportunism or cynicism in this matter, because of the importance of the matter, but the timing—during a coronial inquiry which is being conducted at this moment—is a surprise to me. That inquiry is looking into the deaths of people at both Mutitjulu and Willowra. I would have thought it would be better to look very carefully, in a considered manner, at the recommendations of Northern Territory Coroner Cavanagh in this matter; then we could perhaps pontificate on the matters with some evidence and some surety that we were talking about the facts.
It is very difficult to agree with this motion—not because we do not have a great deal of passion about this issue or because we do not think it is important. It is just that it really does not do justice to the complexity and the sophistication of the issue we are dealing with. There is no doubt that controlling the distribution of substances of this sort—in this context we can consider it a substance—has got to be part of a strategy. There is no one solution to this, and I know that the previous speaker effectively said that that is the case, but the very important work that has been done by the government must be recognised.
This motion says, ‘Let’s call on the government to roll out Opal.’ We have rolled out Opal in 42 communities so far. Comgas was an innovation of this government, and we are very proud of it. It is continuing to be rolled out. We have had an increase of something like 230 per cent in the budget towards the continued roll-out of what is now colloquially known as ‘Opal’ into these communities. From 42 communities to 65 communities is a tremendous outcome and a very practical one.
But we are not working only on those outcomes. We recognise that such a sophisticated challenge deserves a sophisticated answer. We deal not only with the substitution of petrol but also with prevention. We have got education, sport and recreational programs, and we have early intervention programs like Indigenous night patrols to ensure that we pick early those people who are most at risk. We have treatment approaches such as group work and counselling—mostly using some of the elders in the communities to help people understand that there are better ways than this.
We have a number of other innovations. The Department of Health and Ageing provides over $20 million per annum to support 67 Indigenous substance abuse services. Throughout government, we have a very strong approach to this. While the central premise of this motion is okay, I find it difficult to support because, if you drill a little deeper into it, the assertion that perhaps this government is not doing enough is simply unacceptable.
Petrol sniffing in the northern end of Australia has been around since about the early 1950s. One of the legacies of the US servicemen was that they could not get hold of beer so they used to sniff petrol. Unfortunately, it is one of those habits that is now a legacy. Petrol is one of the most incredibly destructive substances. We talked about three deaths last year from petrol sniffing. Between 1981 and 1991, 60 Aboriginal men and three women died from petrol sniffing. I have known some younger people—people I have grown up with over 20 years in Arnhem Land—who are now deceased. They were young people who used to work for me. They were vibrant young people with somewhere to go, and now they are dead. It is a great tragedy. We grope at a community level and a leadership level for some answers. But those answers are not simple; they are complex and sophisticated answers.
As I travel around my electorate people talk about Mutitjulu. Because it is right next to Ayers Rock, it comes into focus. But it is the rule, not the exception. This happens everywhere—Docker River, Papunya, Yuendumu, Mount Liebig, Kintore and Mount Allan. It causes anxiety in families and dysfunctionality within the community. It is like your worst nightmares—living in a community that is like something out of a horror story, where a number of people in the community behave like zombies. They cannot see where they are going, their bottom lips are distended and fall open, saliva falls from their mouths and they are sightless.
The physical damage of the disease is without peer. The range of problems include ammonia, asphyxiation and burns. When you are so out of it—I suppose that is the normal term—you do not recognise that it is not smart to smoke with a can of petrol around your neck. Horrific burns are suffered, always on the front of the face and people normally lose their hair. It is absolutely horrific. There is no community where you cannot point to people who have suffered from that. People go into comas or have seizures, and suffer from malnutrition and permanent brain damage. Young men who have worked for me and young women I have known are now permanently in wheelchairs as a consequence of this.
There are a lot of other problems associated with petrol sniffing. When you are not focusing on what you are doing, you can wander into a buffalo, get bitten by a dog or, particularly in Central Australia, simply get lost. You keep walking, because there are no trees in that area. Often, people do not die from petrol sniffing but from getting lost and dehydrating. We suspect that the numbers in terms of petrol sniffing are a lot higher.
Nobody with a real and informed interest in this matter would think that any solution that has been suggested in this motion is going to be the panacea for petrol sniffing. That would be absolutely wrong. I think anyone in the medical profession would agree that you cannot continue to treat the symptoms and expect somebody to get better. If someone has something wrong with them, you cannot just keep treating the symptoms. There is a greater issue—there is a general malaise in the community. That malaise is not unique to the community. It comes from high unemployment or no employment all. High unemployment causing high substance abuse is nothing new. Places like Kings Cross, St Kilda and everywhere around Australia where there seems to be a high level of substance abuse are also characterised by very high levels of unemployment. It is no different in these communities.
A lot of the communities in the Northern Territory have languished under a commonality—the regulations of the Northern Territory land rights act. There is no effective land tenure and little possibility of benefit, particularly in employment. I will be calling on support from those on the other side for amendments to the Northern Territory land rights act at some time in the future. The people and leaders of the communities say that the reason this is happening is because of sit-down money and a welfare system that does not demand a shared responsibility in regard to welfare payments. It has failed the people. This government is determined to provide a comprehensive suite of policy initiatives not only to combat petrol sniffing but also to take people out of the welfare cycle.
A good friend of mine, who was a policeman in that area for many years and was then a politician in the Northern Territory government, made an odd quote. He said, ‘The tie-dyed economy is trying to compete in the workplace with an Armani economy.’ That was said by John Elfrink. He was alluding to the fact that, unless we change these areas and provide some hope for these people by providing an economic background for them, these issues are not going to change.
Administration is a real issue. The administration is absolutely defunct in some of these communities. One community I was in recently was absolutely covered in rubbish. I was told the CDEP had 50 participants. I drove past their yard and there were 30 wheelie bins in there which had remained there for nearly three months. They had not been moved. They told me that between four and six people turned up for CDEP. We cannot just sit there and let that happen, because that is right at the heart of the malaise.
We have spent millions of dollars on preventing access to drugs. I do not believe this notion of prohibition will necessarily work on its own. Alcohol and cannabis are also a problem in these areas. The prohibition of alcohol has not worked. I can tell Senator Brown that, at $60 for a wine cask, grog runners, as he would be well aware, are alive and well in Central Australia. I do not think it is too hard to do the maths for aromatic fuel—at $30 a litre, without prohibition, 10 jerry cans is sufficient to make a trip from almost anywhere with a profitability of around $2,500. It is quite a lucrative business.
We have to ensure that the processes we put in place in terms of prohibition build upon it. Disappointingly, we need regulation. Disappointingly, the Northern Territory government, when introducing their Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Bill, said: ‘We are going to make it legal. We are not going to make petrol sniffing illegal,’ which failed comprehensively to recognise the successes in Warburton and South Australia. This is an issue that needs clear, strong legislation and leadership. Sadly, this has not been forthcoming from the Northern Territory government. This is a very important issue, and all governments need to work together. As I say, this is not a motion that I am inclined to support, principally because it does not address the complexity and sophistication of the problem.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-16,"—I support this motion as being an urgent matter that needs close attention. I only have four minutes to address it, and that will not allow me to do it justice. Even though it is urgent, it is certainly not new. It has gained renewed attention as a result of the current coroner’s inquiry that Senator Scullion referred to. I believe that it is appropriate to look to see what the recommendations of that inquiry are. I also hope that, when it does report, its recommendations are given urgent priority and consideration by federal, territory and state governments. That has been the problem, and it is something the Democrats have spoken about a number of times—the lack of priority given to Indigenous issues and Indigenous health issues.
Perhaps the biggest frustration in the last federal election campaign, and I can assure you there were plenty from my point of view, was the inability to get any interest in what I believed and said then was—and I still believe very passionately to be—perhaps the major issue of priority, particularly in the political and policy areas in Australia. I am talking not just about petrol sniffing specifically, of course, but about the whole gamut of disgraceful and completely unacceptable health statistics and the reality of the health environment that Indigenous Australians live with and die with.
It is simply outrageous that in an election campaign, or at any stage, we can have a situation where a section of our community have a life expectancy 20 years lower than the rest of us and that is not given a priority. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Leader of the Opposition even attended their party’s Indigenous policy launch during the election campaign. There was virtually no media interest in the subject until after the election, when it took someone like Michael Long to put it on the front page for a few days. And now it has taken a tragedy and a coroner’s inquiry to put it back on the front page. It has got to be a priority every day of the week for all of us here, and that is where I think we have all got to bear some responsibility. The petrol-sniffing aspect is something that the Democrats have spoken about many times in this place. I have just discovered speeches by former Senators Powell and Vigor in the 1980s talking about the issue. The Democrats specifically ensured that the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation that we negotiated and that was set up in 2001, with over $100 million, dealt not just with alcohol abuse but with other licit substance abuses, and we specifically ensured that they would include petrol sniffing.
It is a long-term problem, as I am sure that all speakers in the debate will acknowledge. It is a complex problem. It cannot be solved simply by one approach. Senator Brown has said that as well. I think the motion perhaps has an implication that it can be. We do need to take a whole range of approaches here and address the core issue of systemic disadvantage and the inability of communities to handle this themselves. There is a lack of sufficient capability and empowerment to handle the destructive nature of petrol sniffing at the community level.
We should all remind ourselves that this is not just a matter of urgency today; it has in effect been urgent for decades. It is a failure on all our parts that we have not given it the priority it deserves. All of us in this place who are involved in political and policy debate day after day should be continually reminding ourselves, regardless of whether it is on the front page or not, that the plight of Indigenous Australians is the major priority issue and, unless we give it priority day after day and follow through day after day rather than just making one-off announcements, we will still be here in 20 years time with another motion along the same lines. We will all bear responsibility if that is the case.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-16,"—I wish to speak in support of the motion moved by the Greens. I do not do so because I think it is a perfect motion, but because I think it is important that we have the debate. I think some of the concerns Senator Scullion raised are valid, but I think it is to Senator Brown’s credit that he has brought the issue before the parliament. We should have a debate about the most serious issue of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities. I indicate on behalf of Labor that we will be supporting the motion, but it is not the vote that matters—no-one pretends the resolution is going to achieve anything—it is about the debate and trying to focus public attention and government attention on what is a serious social problem.
I will start with a personal observation. I must admit that the first time I came across petrol sniffing, in the north-west of Western Australia, it shocked the hell out of me. There was a young bloke, about the same age as my son, walking around with a Coke can in his hand. It took me quite a while to work out what was going on. It was beyond my comprehension that someone would be sniffing petrol out of a Coke can. It certainly rocked me. I cannot do it justice in describing it, but it really did affect me quite deeply that a young person would feel they had so little in life that sniffing petrol was the only way out. It is a growing problem in Australia in Indigenous communities and it is something that we have got to try and focus on.
I do not support the motion because of any desire to point-score with the government—I think they have taken a number of measures in this area—but I do think we need to focus on whether enough has been done and whether we cannot get some more urgency into the required federal-state cooperation that is the key to this. Senator Scullion made a couple of points with which I agree. One was that there does need to be an effort by state and Commonwealth governments. There needs to be a coordinated effort on the issue. The other thing I want to stress is that it does need to be part of a broader strategy. There is no silver bullet for these social problems. Just as I do not think ‘Just say no’ was an answer in some other areas of social problems, I do not think the Opal solution is the sole one that will deal with petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities. But I think it is part of the solution and ought to be supported. I think there is a roll-out occurring. I think this motion seeks to get some urgency to that roll-out and to try and encourage people to redouble their efforts.
The facts are that petrol sniffing results in intoxication for three to six hours, with immediate effects including euphoria, numbness, dizziness and disassociation from surroundings—I think Senator Scullion called it ‘being out of it’. It can later on include hallucinations, loss of motor coordination, impaired judgment, nausea, coughing and sneezing and, of course, much more severe long-term health effects, including damage to the central nervous system, the respiratory system, the liver and the kidneys. There are a lot of people with serious brain damage suffering from seizures, asphyxiation, pneumonia and a whole range of ongoing disabilities. They bring not only personal tragedy but the ongoing health costs to the community of caring for people so badly affected by the effects of petrol sniffing.
People must not underestimate how devastating this practice is to individuals and to communities. As well as the health impacts, there are a whole range of other social impacts such as violence, violent crime, vandalism and the whole breakdown of communities. There are stories of old people leaving their homes because the smell of petrol and the behaviour of young people affected is such that they cannot continue to live in that environment.
As we all know, there is a coroner’s inquiry occurring in the Northern Territory which will help shed some light on these issues. The thing that struck me reading the reports into the deaths of the three males is that one was 14, one was 21 and one was 37. So we are talking about Aboriginal males across the age spectrum, from a very young man to a middle-aged man, who have lost their lives. I think a number of speakers have made the point that there are a lot of other people who have lost their lives in behaviour that may not have been attributed to petrol sniffing but was effectively caused by petrol sniffing. It is a huge problem and it is a problem that we do need to focus on as a parliament and as a community. There has been some progress made attempting to come to terms with the issue. We have had the Comgas Scheme and the petrol-sniffing diversion project, which I understand will be evaluated in the middle of next year. The Northern Territory government has implemented a range of measures to combat the problem and, in my own state, the Western Australian government has been working with communities as well.
Opal fuel does provide part of the solution in that it does not contain lead and has extremely low levels of the aromatic hydrocarbons which create the high that appeals to sniffers. Labor senators spent a great deal of time at the last estimates round questioning the Department of Health and Ageing about these issues and the progress being made with the introduction of Opal fuel. I think Labor senators reflect the concerns that Senator Brown has in regard to the lack of urgency about rolling out this program. I accept the government has taken some steps, but I think there is a general concern that more could be done quickly and more effectively. I do want to make the point that Senator Scullion made, and which I think Senator Brown acknowledged as well, that no motion ever adequately encompasses the complexity of a social problem like this.
Opal on its own is not the solution to the problem; it has to be a broader strategy. There has to be a health and community strategy that is much broader than Opal. But I do think Opal is part of the solution. The results so far with Opal are very encouraging. We urge the government to take a broader strategy but to speed up the roll-out and the evaluation and to make sure that that is part of a broader strategy dealing with these issues. One of my concerns about the government’s approach to Indigenous affairs is their own simplistic notion of getting people off welfare somehow being an answer to the social problems that confront Aboriginal communities. While the government urges us not to accept a simplistic solution in terms of Opal fuel, they say the answer is to build a swimming pool and all the social problems of the community will be fixed. I do not think that is the answer either. ‘No school, no swimming in the pool’ may be part of the solution in certain communities, but there has to be a much more holistic approach. What is not able to be discerned at the moment is what that holistic approach of the government is and what the broad strategy is other than these shared responsibility agreements that seem to be done mainly for media impact rather than as part of any broader strategy for dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage and the problems confronting Indigenous communities.
This is my first contribution to the parliament since taking over the Indigenous affairs portfolio from my colleague Senator Carr, and one thing I am conscious of is that too many white fellas go out into the Indigenous communities and come back claiming that they have the solutions to the problems facing Indigenous communities. I want to make clear that I am not one of those. I know enough about Indigenous communities, having been a Western Australian senator for the last 12 years, to know that there are no simplistic solutions and no easy fixes. We all, as a parliament, have to work as cooperatively as we can to empower Aboriginal communities in tackling the social issues that bedevil them. I think today’s debate helps in that it focuses attention on one of the issues. But, as I said, they are much broader than petrol sniffing and they need much broader responses.
Opal fuel is part of the solution. The government has taken some steps, which I commend it for, but more needs to be done and it needs to be part of a broader strategy. I think it is important that we give some urgency to that strategy, given the horror that is petrol sniffing and the fact that it seems at the moment that some impasse between state and federal governments is not allowing us to get maximum traction in the prevention of petrol sniffing and the contribution that Opal could provide. Senator Crossin will also speak for Labor and she is much more familiar with the issue in the Northern Territory than I. Certainly, Labor thinks it is important that we have the debate today and that we do try and focus. As much as possible we must try and find common ground in assisting Indigenous communities to address these very serious social problems, particularly that of petrol sniffing.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-08-16,"—In the few moments I have to speak on this very important national subject, I would like to commence by commending Senator Evans for the spirit and tone of his speech just delivered in this place. This issue is not one that should ever be about politics. I first came across the problem of solvent and spirit abuse with Indigenous people back in 1979 as a young lawyer in Kalgoorlie. Within a number of days of my arrival in that town, I heard of three Aboriginal men at Cundalee Mission dying as a result of drinking duplicating fluid from a gestetner machine. The problem with spirit based products, be they fuel or solvents, is that they are highly addictive.
Having been to a number of Aboriginal communities throughout Western Australia over the past 30 years, I have seen some absolutely sad, sorry, depressing and quite frightening circumstances where very young children have been exposed to petrol sniffing. These were the days where super petrol contained a large quotient of lead. A child of three or four in an Aboriginal community with a tin can tied around its neck, constantly sniffing these fumes, has absolutely no possibility of reaching the age of 5. The lead, of course, is highly toxic, and will kill the child, not to mention the brain damage caused by the hydrocarbon fumes of this scourge.
Opal and fuel substitutes deal with the petrol side of things but there are also methylated spirits and other spirits, be they hardware industrial cleaning solvents or other types of hydrocarbon, hallucinatory spirit that provide an addictive high to people, particularly Aboriginal people. Let us remember that this is not just an Aboriginal problem. There are a number of people around Perth whom I have observed over many years who abuse solvents. But this problem is endemic in the central reserve regions of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, to the best of my understanding and experience. I have seen young men in court who have been long-term solvent abusers and petrol sniffers. They will never recover from the brain damage that this practice causes.
I want to say to Senator Brown: thank you for raising this issue. We have known about it for a very long period of time. You can never raise this issue too often. It might get you some political points—I do not say that you do it for that reason—but the fact is you have raised it and we are discussing it in this place. It needs to be discussed and people need to understand it. So I thank you for raising it. I hope that you raised it in a legitimate, bona fide way, seeking to draw attention to what has been a very long-term problem that has perplexed state and indeed, may I say, federal governments for a long time. The solutions are not simple.
Opal is one of those solutions, as is the Comgas Scheme, which has been initiated for the last seven years, to my understanding, by the Commonwealth department that deals with Indigenous matters. As I see it, given the experience that I have—which I do not profess is greater than anybody’s in this place but I have been to the communities; I have seen what goes on and I have seen the damage that petrol sniffing does—education is the fundamental starting point, particularly with parents. Where parents are chronically addicted to alcohol, you obviously are starting from a very low base. That is the difficulty. Self-esteem issues and employment issues are at the base of parental capability and capacity to create the right sort of environment in an Aboriginal community for young and adolescent children, who are the most vulnerable and susceptible to this blight. Having parental awareness and having the community at one against substance abuse—by that I mean illicit drugs such as cannabis, alcohol and solvents—is the sort of comprehensive, broad community based program that you need.
These communities are extraordinarily isolated. The community members travel many miles. It is very difficult for government to get high-quality and regular medical and health services into these communities. The places I am talking about—Blackstone, Djurkula, Warburton, Giles, Balgo, Jigalong et cetera—are all literally 400, 500, 600, 700 kilometres from good reasonable services. Indeed, Laverton is the most easterly outpost in Western Australia before you hit the central reserve and all the communities out there. There are a hospital and medical facilities at Laverton, largely surviving by virtue of the mining industry because the town is a very small town.
To get these services into these communities requires a Herculean effort. One has to fly in because there are 600 or 700 kilometres of very bad roads. So this is what we are confronting in seeking to deal with these problems. The people in the communities move from place to place. They take their children with them, so getting a consistent level of medical service and a consistent level of education to the parents is very difficult. It is difficult for us to say, ‘Don’t leave the community.’ This is what the minister is trying to do with SRAs; this is where we can seek to educate the community that solvent abuse and petrol sniffing is fatal to their future. SRAs are a first step, I believe, in getting parents to get their children into schools so that we can give them a leg-up and an education into why they should not participate in sniffing.
In closing, I have seen very young children not just sniff petrol but actually drink it. This is absolutely traumatic to observe. I have for many years been saying to every politician who will listen to me, ‘You’ve got to do something about it.’",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-08-16,"—I do not think any of us think that this is the only step that we can take to address this problem, but we should acknowledge that this is an urgent step that we can take to start addressing what is an absolute tragedy for Indigenous communities in this country. I will return to some of the other strategies we think we should be taking a bit later.
The federal government subsidy on Opal fuel is a good first step by the government, and we are pleased to see it is being made. The problem with the current scheme, however, is that its coverage is patchy and it leaves many communities and other regional sources where sniffable petrol can be obtained, which undermines the very concept that we are trying to achieve by replacing existing sniffable fuel. Two of the three sniffing deaths that are the subject of the recent inquiry occurred in communities that are not covered by the scheme. This is a tragedy. It is within our power right now to prevent more of these deaths.
If the pure humanity of the situation does not count, let’s look at the economics of the situation. ANTaR recently reported on figures released by the Department of Health and Ageing that indicate that in the Northern Territory alone the cost of caring for the additional 120 sniffers likely to acquire irreversible brain damage is $24 million per year. Compare this to the additional $8 million to $9 million it will cost to extend the Opal subsidy across the central region and there is a predicted saving of $16 million to $17 million. Not only will this save lives, it will reduce the impact on families who are dealing with the consequences of losing children to sniffing—their morose withdrawal from family life, punctuated by episodes of unpredictable violence and destructive behaviour. This will improve the quality of life of communities and save us money on future health costs.
Taking the next step to solving these problems is within our powers as senators. I believe we have a moral obligation to act in the face of this suffering. Once we have made this first important step, however, we need to begin to address the causes of sniffing as have already been identified in the chamber today. We need to start addressing the underlying disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians. We believe we need to start to implement strategies that address petrol sniffing not just as an isolated substance abuse issue but as one part of the overall issue of substance abuse.
We must also support and continue the current youth link-up program, which we believe is very well placed to address petrol sniffers among young people in the Northern Territory. Funding should also be made available to communities to implement a range of complementary interventions as considered appropriate by each community. We should be encouraging fuel companies to support these initiatives, both financially and in kind. Until we take these steps to stop the sniffing, our efforts to improve the plight of families in remote communities will be hampered by the problems caused by the sniffers. I urge the Senate to support this motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Health</title>,Matters of Urgency,12,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-08-16,"—I am pleased to rise in the Senate chamber this afternoon to talk about this issue. I have to say that if it takes the drastic picture on the front page of the Australian for the rest of this country to realise that this is an endemic problem in Aboriginal communities then it is a sorry state that we find ourselves in. But if that is what it is going to take to make the rest of this country realise that something has to happen in Aboriginal communities and if that is what it is going to take to get this federal government to do something about it, well, so be it.
In 1981 I arrived at an Aboriginal remote community called Yirrkala. I have actually taught Aboriginal students who sat in front of me with petrol poured onto their T-shirt, which they sniffed through the day in order to cope. In 1984 my husband was responsible for trying to rehabilitate a group of post-primary kids off petrol. I remember a well-known excursion on which he took them to Bali, but we will not go into the story about the missing bimo in the streets of Bali or we might be here all day. The point I am trying to make is that this has been a problem that I have known of and experienced for 25 years. For more than two decades this has been a problem amongst Aboriginal kids in the Northern Territory, and very little has been done about it.
With all due respect to Senator Scullion—and I agree with some of the sentiments of his speech—for him to stand up here and tell me that the Clare Martin government have done very little about this is an atrocious statement given that the Country Liberal Party was in power in the Northern Territory for 27 years and did absolutely nothing about this. At least the Clare Martin government have moved on this in a big way. They have introduced new legislation to parliament that does ban petrol sniffing in the Northern Territory. It might not make petrol sniffing illegal—I am not sure if you can actually make illegal a substance such as petrol that is readily available to everyone—but they have now committed an extra $10 million over five years to implement the recommendations of their parliamentary committee inquiry into substance abuse. At least Clare Martin’s government set up a committee to look at substance abuse. They are implementing the recommendations, they have committed an extra $10 million to put the recommendations in place and they have now put in place legislation that bans petrol sniffing and a program that will rehabilitate many of the sniffers, in consultation with communities and with the assistance of the police. So for Senator Scullion to stand up here and say that the Martin government have done nothing about this is grossly misleading the Senate when his party had 27 years in which to do this.
I also want to draw the Senate’s attention to a committee report, Reconciliation: off-track. It was tabled by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in October 2003. That was about the time of the tragic death in South Australia. This is recommendation 20 of that report from nearly two years ago now:
The Committee recommends that during the Spring sittings 2004 the Senate refer to it an inquiry on progress in addressing the problems surrounding petrol sniffing in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Lands, including progress as it relates to the COAG whole of government trial being conducted there.
Let’s not forget this: Tony Abbott’s department, the Department of Health and Ageing, is actually responsible for the COAG trial in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands. Let’s ask that minister what is happening about petrol sniffing in that part of this country. This is a recommendation from a Senate committee that is nearly two years old. I have not seen that acted on. I have not even seen the government’s response to this recommendation. When we stand up here and seek to have a debate about supporting BP in their attempt to develop Opal fuel and roll it out in Central Australia, I would have thought that $10 million was a drop in the bucket for the expenditure that this government has before it.
Opal fuel is a major breakthrough in providing a fuel that does not produce the high that petrol sniffers crave. The introduction of Opal and schemes to divert youth in remote communities from the scourge of petrol sniffing are a major investment in their future and in our future as well, because there are some terrific kids out there who get hooked on this stuff for a whole range of reasons. My view is that it is mainly because they are bored and they have nothing else to do. It is a complex problem. It is a bit like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. If this is going to be one element of the jigsaw that we can address by making this petrol not readily available, then let’s do it. We should do it today. It should have been done yesterday, but today would be a good start.
It will cost an estimated $8 million to $10 million a year to roll out Opal fuel throughout Central Australia, including Alice Springs. Let me really emphasise that: it must be rolled out in Alice Springs. Why is that? Commonsense will tell you that Indigenous kids hooked on sniffing who cannot get the fuel in their communities will go to Alice Springs or, alternatively, Alice Springs tourists, visitors, government people or whoever who fill up at Alice Springs and go out bush will take the fuel out there and the petrol-sniffing kids will then be able to get at it. So it has got to be rolled out right across the board, not just in communities but in the major cities. The many billions of dollars that we pay in law enforcement costs to keep a range of illicit drugs off the streets of the capital cities put the cost of the Opal subsidy into perspective.
Can I say, Senator Brown, that I heard your interview on the radio last Friday in the Northern Territory, and your comments were spot-on. This is a government that puts a lot of effort into stopping illegal drugs from coming into this country, and we support that. This is a government that puts a lot of effort into ensuring that ecstasy and heroin are not available for drug users in this country. Why is the same effort not being put into making sure that petrol is not around for petrol sniffers? Senator Brown was right in his comments last Friday when he spoke to Daryl Manzie and people in the Territory. He was correct. I think that $10 million is a small price to pay to ensure that there is some relief for those Indigenous kids—at least in that part of the country.
The current subsidy the Commonwealth is putting out for Opal is about 30c per litre but, with the economies of scale delivered through wider usage of the fuel, this could drop to 15c per litre. Compare this to the subsidy that is paid in the form of the diesel fuel rebate each year, which is worth over $2 billion. We are asking for up to $10 million here—a very small price to pay. It will go a long way to ensuring that we at least start to address this problem. The diesel fuel rebate is a direct subsidy to industry, with economic spin-offs, we are told. The Opal subsidy is a mere fraction of the diesel fuel rebate and the government already enjoys a higher GST take from fuel in Central Australia because it is 10 per cent of the higher cost of fuel in that area.
The costs of doing nothing about petrol sniffing are horrendous in terms of damaged lives, broken families and dysfunctional communities. Petrol sniffers that do not die from the habit can suffer acquired brain damage. I have seen it amongst kids—after they have sniffed petrol for a very long period of time, they are very seriously damaged in terms of how they function. There are already petrol sniffers in full-time care in Central Australia and it is estimated that over 120 young people in that region will suffer serious brain damage over the next few years. The figures for the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands of South Australia are similar. The cost of caring for these young people as they grow older—and the damage progresses over the years—ranges from $200,000 to $750,000 per person per year for every year of their lives. Let us just cost that. If we have 120 young people in the Central Australia region alone costing us a minimum of $200,000 per year, and that cost is increasing, I would have thought that $8 million to $10 million would have been a good investment in the future of those young kids.
The federal government and the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian governments are already working together and planning special facilities to cater for the influx of brain damaged petrol sniffers needing permanent care. But we cannot afford to wait for the roll-out of Opal fuel and we cannot afford to keep reviewing what the effects of it will be. The effectiveness of the current scheme of using avgas in select remote communities is diminishing as its octane level is being gradually increased to meet the demands of the aviation industry. That is why BP have moved on this and that is why people like Alison Anderson, the newly elected member for Macdonnell, have been backing BP, supporting them and encouraging them to roll out this alternative fuel.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2005-08-16,"—Today Senator Brown has moved as an urgency motion that the Australian government address the scourge of petrol sniffing. I do not think there is a person in this chamber, whether or not they are here sitting in their places today, who would not agree that this is a tragedy, and a priority not only for the federal government but also for state government. I also do not believe that today is the day for political point scoring, particularly on an issue like this. I have seen this tragedy on the AP lands in South Australia and I saw it during a drive to Darwin several years ago, when I went out with the Indigenous night patrols in Katherine, Tennant Creek, Darwin and Coober Pedy to collect substance abusers—whether they were using alcohol or other drugs, or sniffing petrol.
I spent time talking to these people at the ‘spin dry’ centre in Darwin. I know this issue too; I have seen it at first-hand and it is a tragedy wherever it occurs. It is not true to say that the federal government is doing nothing—any more than it is true to say that the state governments are doing nothing. There is a priority for this, and I know that Senator Brown is aware of that. Can I just give a couple of figures. In the current budget, which the federal government brought down just a couple of months ago, $9.6 million was provided to expand the number of communities participating in the Comgas Scheme. The federal government has implemented this and the number of communities participating has grown significantly. This year there will be an expenditure of $3.3 million, which is a 230 per cent increase on previous years, and 65 communities are now participating in the scheme. There are data collection issues and other issues being addressed within that funding. But the problem goes on.
Earlier this year, we had an inquest—and Senator Brown would probably be aware of this—where the South Australia coroner, Wayne Chivell, again highlighted some new priorities that the Rann government in South Australia needs to set to address this issue on the AP lands. It is not fair or true to say that Premier Rann has not also had this as a priority. In fact, he has been to the lands. He has established committees and task forces. He appointed former senator Bob Collins, Mrs Lowitja O’Donoghue and the Reverend Tim Costello to put together strategies to try to deal with this problem on the lands. Whether people got support or not depended on what was recommended. I think Mrs O’Donoghue decided to resign from the committee because she felt that there was not enough activity.
In fact, the coroner found that in retrospect it had been a mistake for responsibilities to have been taken away from the lands and given to the state department of Aboriginal affairs in South Australia. It is fair to say that it is only when the communities are assisted to take on this problem—to provide the leadership and to provide the opportunities for young people—that we truly see the effect of the millions of dollars that are now being set aside and spent.
In relation to the AP lands in South Australia, the federal and state governments are working in quite close partnership with the communities on the lands. This is an issue that goes beyond party politics. It has to. There is no point in trying to point-score in relation to this issue. There are too many young people affected by it. We also have people in care in South Australia—young people; children—who have been tragically affected for life or who are effectively brain dead because of the injuries they have suffered as a result of petrol sniffing over a long period of time.
In South Australia we have established a new regional forum, the TKP. This forum is a significant step forward for both the communities and the governments in working together. We have supported new service coordination arrangements and contributed $1.4 million towards the service costs involved in that work. We also announced three pools. I was interested to hear Senator Crossin say that in her view part of the problem was caused by young people being bored in these small communities. I can understand that. Having spent time on the AP lands over a long period of time, it is very easy to see that young people could find life there lacking in excitement and might seek forms of substance abuse as a result of that. It is very sad but it is probably true. I imagine Senator Crossin has very wide experience of that as well.
As I said, we have announced that there will be three swimming pools built on the lands in South Australia. These pools will be included in the ‘no school, no pool’ program, to try to get young people to see that there is an alternative to substance abuse and that there is an alternative to petrol sniffing—that there is no need to endanger and in fact effectively cut short their lives simply because after school they do not have enough to do. We believe that providing them with the opportunities of learning to swim and visiting the pool with their friends—doing things that children do in all other areas of Australia, with safety and security—is one answer. It is not the only answer to the tragedy of petrol sniffing. This a tragedy that all of us understand and I do not believe any of us have tried to score political points in seeking to find the solution to this problem.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-08-16,"—Yesterday, as everybody in this place and millions and millions of Australians know, was the observation of the 60th anniversary of VP Day. For a number of reasons, I was unfortunately unable to attend VP Day observations, but I do want to make some remarks in the chamber tonight. I think it is appropriate, in reflecting on the nature of this particular commemoration, to quote the words of WS Kent Hughes from the dedication in his work Slaves of the Samurai. He wrote: ‘Dedicated to my comrades who still live and will live even though they are not alive.’ For anyone who has cast an eye over Slaves of the Samurai, the creation, but most particularly the preservation, of his verses is fascinating in itself. The pictures in the work by Major-General De Fremery, similarly so, but I find that dedication particularly compelling. Not everybody would choose to reflect on an occasion such as VP Day with poetry but, for many reasons, I have chosen to do so. I grew up in a World War II veteran’s family. I was particularly encouraged to pursue my own interest in the arts by my father—a veteran of World War II. So the 60th anniversary of VP Day particularly resonates for me.
On 15 August 1945 the war had finally reached its end and, in very simple terms, the then Prime Minister began his announcement with the words: ‘Fellow citizens, the war is over.’ It was a time of elation for all Australians but also a time of sadness for the many lives lost. But, through it all, the Australian spirit shone, and we have been repeatedly reminded of this in recent days, with the iconic images of Australians dancing in the streets and celebrating the freedom that had been defended at such great cost.
Yesterday I shared my mother’s reminiscences of VP Day. She was at school on VP Day—in fact, the same school that I attended. The part of the school which in my day we called ‘the field’ in her day was filled with trenches where they practised for eventualities that hopefully would never come. On this anniversary of VP Day, she reminisced about being allowed out of school late morning, making her way with hundreds of other girls to Strathfield Station in Sydney’s inner west and fighting the crowds at the station. When the trains from the city finally arrived, they were absolutely jam-packed—you could not get on the trains—but somehow, for some reason, the people of Sydney made way for these groups of schoolgirls dressed in the navy blue uniforms so that they could go home to their families to celebrate the end of World War II.
Sixty years later those images still resonate with us. Now, when we understand that freedom is something to be won and to be cherished, those images remind us in many ways of a time when our way of life was not so assured. I think with that comes a great sense of humility and gratitude for the thousands of Australians who perished to defend their nation, our people and our way of life. More than 900,000 Australian men and women enlisted in the armed forces between 1939 and 1945 from a population of barely seven million. Of that figure, 550,000 service men and women served outside Australia in one of the services during the war. That was one in 12 people of the total population—and my father was one of those.
Twenty-seven men from the small New South Wales village of Burrawang enlisted for World War II, but my father had already moved to Sydney so was recorded as enlisted from Undercliff. The Sydney Sun on the day of his enlistment carried a pictorial story sporting my then—and in fact always—very handsome father moving from civilian to private in the space of one day. It is a news clipping which I of course cherish. The list of surnames of those who enrolled from the village of Burrawang is a history of that small community and, in many ways, the history of my family—names that I remember my father speaking of on many occasions.
My father’s service record has him enlisting on 9 March 1941 and being discharged on 14 March 1946—a very long time in a young life to spend in the service of your nation—with a total effective service period of 1,831 days, which included active service in Australia for 1,292 days and outside Australia for 327 days. He left the Army as a lieutenant. That time in the Second AIF changed my father’s life—as it did for so many Australians. His service and his pride had an extraordinary impact on my life and our upbringing.
Australia had earned the respect of the world for the actions of our troops in various theatres of war, and that was solidly and effectively reinforced by World War II. Australia’s identity of mateship—many would say—of bravery and determination was forged even more strongly by the events of World War II. Victory in the Pacific was extraordinarily hard won.
In discussing Australia’s commemoration of VP Day, I think it would be remiss to not make reference to the horrendous weapons that did indeed bring the world to a standstill and force the surrender of Japan. I am of course referring to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945. We all listened with interest to the reminiscences and the stories of those experiences in recent weeks as well. I have visited the memorial and the park in Hiroshima. It is an extraordinarily compelling and confronting experience, particularly for one who grew up in an Australian World War II veteran’s family with a very interesting perspective of our engagement against the Japanese. It is one of the most impressive memorials I have ever seen. Its commemoration is, I think, a very important part of the modern world.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has used the 60th anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the commemoration of VP Day to urge all nations to abandon their nuclear weapons program. The nuclear non-proliferation program is really one of the most important projects of the 21st century and one that Australia pursues with great energy and seriousness in tackling what is an enormous challenge for us in this century. This is so particularly in light of the changes in the interaction between nations and the intervention of non-state players in those interactions. This makes for a very different landscape from what was perhaps 60 years ago a more predictable environment in terms of battle and confrontation, upon which to draw a picture for the future of conflict and, in fact, the prevention of conflict.
I hope that I am forgiven by the Senate for personalising my observations about VP Day, but when we come to this place we come with the influence of our families and their histories and we bring the experiences that they visited upon us. I began by making reference to WS Kent Hughes and his extraordinarily evocative writings in Slaves of the Samurai and how very compelling it is to read those. But there are many other war poets who have made an extraordinary contribution throughout not just Australia’s history but also internationally in terms of the recording of experience, of horror in many cases, of humour in so many Australian cases and of emotion generally about war.
There is a wonderful anthology of poetry of the Australian Army which contains many interesting reminiscences of the south-west Pacific area, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Bougainville and Borneo from 1942 to 1945. Some of the poets’ work contained therein bring a wry smile, some are positively horrific and terrifying and some are just so emotionally draining that they are hard to read at length. I did want to make another brief reference to a poem called Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels which was dedicated to Sapper Victor Cook from the Royal Australian Engineers. The last few lines sum up some of the things that my father often said about fighting in Papua New Guinea. It says:
May the Mothers in Australia,
When they offer up a prayer,
Mention those impromptu Angels,
With the Fuzzy Wuzzy hair.
An amusing observation about the saving of so many of our soldiers by so many dedicated members in Papua New Guinea at the time, and one I think that it is entirely appropriate to conclude upon this evening.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>VP Day</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-08-16," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 23 February 2005:
With reference to page 39 of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) Annual report for 2003-04:
What steps have been taken to assess the effectiveness of CASA safety seminars?
What research has been undertaken to determine the reason for the overall reduction of 14.8 per cent in attendance at CASA safety seminars?
Would the Minister provide a copy of the results of any research undertaken; if not, why not.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Safety Seminars</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-08-16,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
In 2004, CASA began surveying course participants in order to determine the effectiveness of its safety seminars. Results from the March 2005 quarterly report indicate that 38% of those participants surveyed considered their knowledge of safety responsibilities to be good to extremely good. Upon completion of a CASA safety seminar, this figure had increased to 88%. A copy of these results is attached for information.
        CASA anticipates that by December 2005, all course participants will be routinely surveyed.
Although no formal research has been undertaken to determine the reason for the overall reduction in attendance at safety seminars, I am advised that CASA is currently planning a series of focus groups with pilots and engineers from capital cities and regional locations to identify the motivational factors that affect attendance. CASA will also use the focus groups to discuss such issues as seminar content and location.
        Additionally, in the March/April edition of Flight Safety Australia, CASA distributed a safety seminar questionnaire aimed at obtaining information on preferred timing, format and location of seminars in order to improve attendance figures.
As noted earlier, the Authority has not undertaken any formal research to determine the reason for the overall reduction in attendance at safety seminars. Accordingly, no results are available.
ASP Program Delivery Seminars Evaluation: 2004/05.
A total of 149 participants completed evaluation sheets provided at three locations where the seminars were held: Sydney (78), Adelaide (30) and Albury (41). This analysis summarises the participants’ views on the usefulness of the Seminars.
Pre and Post - Seminar Knowledge
. 28% rated their pre-course knowledge as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ while 38% thought it was ‘good’ to ‘extremely good’ (see Fig 1).
. 3% rated their post seminar knowledge as ‘poor’ while 88% described it as ‘good’ to ‘extremely good’; furthermore, over 54% rated the Seminars as ‘ very good’ (cf Fig 2).
. Comparison of pre - and post- seminar ratings suggest a positive shift in knowledge acquisition.

Relevance and ability to apply knowledge

. Regarding participants view about relevance of the Seminars, 83% thought they were ‘very relevant’ or ‘extremely relevant’.
. Of the 83% of the participants who indicated the course was ‘relevant’ to ‘extremely relevant’ the majority (over 90%) felt confident they could apply the knowledge gained to their aviation related jobs. (see Table 2 Appendix 1). This pattern is the same in all three cities.
. Again almost 89% of these participants said they will be more effective in their aviation activities as a result of attending the Seminars (see Table 3 Appendix 1.)
Relevance and Repeated and Attendance
. 74% of respondents has had at least one previous attendance at the Seminars. For the majority of these participants (90%), the relevance of the Seminars to their aviation work ranged from ‘good’ to ‘extremely good’ perhaps explaining their repeated attendance (see Table 1)

. Also of those who claimed to have attended one or more of the Seminars in the past, 70 per cent expressed the desire to attend future Seminars (cf Table.1, Appendix 1).
. Finally, 5 out of the 6 who attended for the first time said they will attend future ones.

Some Concluding Remarks

. Over all there is significant evidence based on the participants’ evaluation to indicate usefulness of the Seminars.
. However, the relatively small proportion of participants (about 5%) indicating first time attendance could imply that there is a greater need for efforts to reach targets who have not participated before. Note too, that many of the first timers have expressed the desire to attend future Seminars.
