Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (12:31):  The opposition will be supporting the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2015. Digital Radio has been a part of the communication landscape in Australia since the Labor government implemented it in 2009. On 1July 2009, the Labor government delivered commercial digital radio licences to Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Designated community radio broadcasters started broadcasting from these areas in May 2011. Adding to these services, digital radio trials in Canberra and Darwin mean that around 64 per cent of the Australian population live in areas currently covered by digital radio transmissions.


The legislation that regulates these broadcasts, namely section 215B of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and section 313B of the Radio Communications Act 1992, need to be constantly reviewed to ensure the rules and standards that govern digital radio are working as intended. To this end, the Minister for Communications is required to initiate a statutory review process and, over the last couple of years, has done that. The process has been a consultative one and subsequently a discussion paper has been developed.


In July 2015, the government released the report that emerged from these reviews and the bill we are considering today draws on the recommendations of that report. Whilst the matters in this bill are uncontroversial and will attract the opposition's support, we note that this bill has not enacted a number of the other recommendations that may require a greater level of scrutiny before we agree to support them. We look forward to the early engagement of the government as they prepare any further amendments to the regulatory structure for digital radio. This bill contains the more non-controversial elements arising from the report and has been widely supported by industry.


The bill makes a number of minor amendments to the regulatory structure around digital radio in Australia. Specifically, the bill proposes to: repeal the restricted datacasting licence category; remove the minister's role in setting a 'start-up day' in regional licence areas; remove the requirement for a six-year moratorium on the allocation of additional digital commercial radio broadcasting licences in a licence area; define amendments to 'non-foundation digital radio multiplex transmitter licence'; and make minor consequential amendments to both acts. These amendments reflect redundant provisions in the act or remove the parts of the act that have proven unnecessary since digital radio services commenced in 2009.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:34):  The Australian Greens support the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2015 for much the same reasons that Senator Gallagher has just outlined. In fact, the Greens had agreed to let this bill go through in non-contro so it is interesting to see at sneaking into government business. Nonetheless, it is a sensible bill. It is housekeeping but it does underline the importance of digital radio broadcasts in the Australian market. I did want to take the opportunity while we are here to underline—as I have done over quite a number of times going back years under several different governments—the importance of the community radio sector and community radio broadcasters in particular. It is good that Senator Fifield is here for the debate because this is a pretty serious fight really that can actually be avoided or a disaster that can be avoided. There is a certain feeling of Groundhog Day here because I have gone through this process and probably delivered a nearly identical speech when Senator Stephen Conroy was the communications minister. The situation was eventually fixed, as I suggest Senator Fifield is going to be able to do is well.


It relates to the DRP, a three-letter acronym that stands for the Digital Radio Program, which supports community radio broadcasters to actually stay in the mix as the sector transmissions across to digital. Nobody is suggesting the analogue radio broadcast services are about to be ripped out from under them. This is a pretty slow burn. It is very different to the way the TV broadcasters switched over. Nonetheless, digital transmitters are becoming much more prevalent as are, much more importantly, receivers.


As cars get upgraded to play digital radio and people invest in digital radio handsets in their homes and businesses, it is essential that our community radio stations around the country are there at the outset and are not playing catch up, are not traipsing along after people have already found their favourite stations or worse that they are simply blacked out and are not there when people switch over to digital radio spectrums. We must ensure that the community broadcasters are in their rightful place alongside the commercial radio broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS. I hope that this proposition is non-controversial—that they belong there and that they perform an immensely valuable public service. They are, in fact, a key component of media diversity.


From rumours and reporting, this is a debate that is about to be reignited again—I have not seen any formal announcements yet—that the government is actually going to rip open the debate again about media ownership and media concentration in this country. What more important role could community broadcasters play at this time? When we talk about media diversity, that is whom we are talking about: independent voices, non-English-speaking backgrounds, people with a diversity of political views, people coming from a variety of different cultural perspectives on our airwaves, telling unique Australian stories that will not be heard on the big public broadcasters, ABC and SBS, and will not be heard on the commercial stations.


Here is the problem: the Digital Radio Program, the DRP, was underfunded under the previous government and it took, from recollection, more than a year to get this tiny amount of money put back into the budget. As this was a program that was started by Senator Coonan in 2005 as a broader part of the media reform packages pursued by the former Howard government, it is non-controversial. There is cross-party support in this place for supporting our valuable community broadcasters to do what they do, and so what we see here, I am assuming, is an oversight rather than malice. But what has occurred is that the indexation pause that took place in the 2014 federal budget—that unloved, friendless, hated budget that attacked nearly every corner of society and ultimately, you could argue, cost the former Prime Minister his job—which obviously hits a number of portfolios, created a gap between the costs of digital radio and the amount of public funding support that accumulates over time, and so a gap is opening up; a wedge is opening up. This happened under Senator Conroy—obviously in a different political context but with the same outcome. It forces the community broadcasters around the country into this rather appalling 'hunger games' scenario, where they are asked to decide which of them will go off the air. It is that bad. It is which stations will no longer be heard on the public airwaves.


I do not assume that that is the outcome that Senator Fifield is seeking. In fact, we have not heard from him or given him the opportunity to hear directly what the government's position is, but I am going to assume in good faith that you are not hoping, through the indexation pause from 2014, to knock community broadcasters off the air in our cities and regions. I do not think that is what you are proposing. But, as the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia has made abundantly clear, when you froze the indexation it opened up a gap. What the sector is asking for is for the 2015-16 levels to be maintained but to be indexed, so that they travel upwards at the same pace as costs travel gently upwards over time. And that means $3.686 million-plus indexation. It is not going to allow them to employ any more staff. It is not going to allow them to create new and unique creative and diverse content. It is simply going to allow them to keep the doors open and to stay on air. As the Labor Party fixed this when they were in government, when Senator Conroy was minister, in the context where the broadcasters were running a campaign on air against the government, seeking base funding to stay alive, I hope that it does not come to that again. I believe that this is an oversight rather than malice. That indexation pause needs to lift in the context of the size of the Commonwealth budget and, more importantly, the services that community broadcasters provide: services to media diversity, services in terms of training up volunteers in the next generation of broadcasters, across all those different skill sets. We need to express our support rather than just pay it lip-service—pay them the $3.8 million that they are going to need and lift that indexation pause so that they do not have to feel like they need to engage in some kind of broadcast campaign to alert their audiences to the threat that is looming and, more importantly, do not have to go campaigning behind the scenes to the Expenditure Review Committee and lobby. That is the last thing they should be doing. They should be producing great content and supporting the health of the community broadcast sector.


I hope Senator Fifield, whom I tipped off—and I tipped off his advisers over the last couple of days that I was going to bring this issue to the chamber—will have something good to say for us so that we can all stand down, get on with the process of passing this bill and let our community broadcast sector do what it does best. I thank the chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:42):  I thank colleagues for their contribution to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2015. I will come to the point that Senator Ludlam raised in his contribution at the outset in relation to community radio. Community radio will continue to receive funding. The particular measure that Senator Ludlam was referring to was actually a terminated program of the previous government, so the reason that funding is reducing is as a result of the decision by the previous government—just for the record. Senator Ludlam has, indeed, raised the concerns of community radio with me. I have met with representatives of community radio and I have undertaken, in the context of the budget, to look at the concerns that they have raised. Obviously, I cannot indicate what may be the result of the budget process but, nevertheless, I have met with them and have undertaken to look at their concerns.


I should also, as we are talking about radio here, indicate that I for one think that radio in the broad, in all its different forms, has a very good future. The most recent data on audience listenership shows that radio is, indeed, very strong. I think one of the reasons for that is that there is a certain intimacy and immediacy to radio, which is not necessarily easily replicated by other mediums.


I think all of us, certainly when it comes to music, are in demographic lock. We are all stuck in particular musical periods, which tend to relate to what was on radio between the ages of about 16 and 21. It is hard for any of us to break out of what I refer to as a 'demographic lock'. In my case, that tends to be eighties music, and I know that there are others in this place who are similarly afflicted. I am very much in that situation. But also, just as we have that collective and common experience of hearing music at the same time on radio across the airwaves, if we hear a particular song it reminds us of a particular summer, what we were doing and where we were. Likewise, it is often radio that brings us news of a significant event in the life of a nation or the world.


That is something that radio does: it allows us to continue to have those sorts of collective and shared experiences. As people are increasingly consuming media through applications at a time of their own choosing, I have had a bit of a worry that we might not have so many of those shared experiences, but I am confident that we will because radio is in an extremely strong situation. I can only hazard, Mr Deputy President, what demographic lock you might be in in terms of your musical tastes. You might share that with us a little later—no, I am sure you have strong musical preferences, Mr Deputy President. I digress, but I just did want to take this opportunity to talk about the ongoing importance of radio.


As colleagues have canvassed, this bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. It contains a package of measures which are designed to reduce regulatory complexity and deliver a simpler, more flexible process for the planning and licensing of digital radio services in regional Australia. In July 2015, the Australian government released a report, called the Digital radio report, on the statutory review of digital radio issues which was conducted by the Department of Communications in accordance with section 215B of the Broadcasting Services Act and section 313B of the Radiocommunications Act. The bill's measures are largely drawn from the recommendations of the Digital radio report and propose to amend the BSA and the Radiocommunications Act to deliver a simpler, more flexible process for the planning and licensing of digital radio in regional Australia.


The bill's measures include, as some colleagues have touched upon, repealing the restricted datacasting licence category; removing the minister's role in the setting of the digital radio start-up day for regional licence areas; removing the requirement for a six-year moratorium on the allocation of additional digital commercial radio broadcasting licences in a licence area following the commencement of digital radio services in that area; amending the definition of 'non-foundation digital radio multiplex transmitter licence' to ensure that the definition operates in a manner consistent with the relevant policy objective; and making minor amendments to the BSA and the Radiocommunications Act to repeal spent digital radio provisions.


The restricted datacasting licence category was introduced in 2007, but no licences under this category have ever been issued. Removing this category will simplify the digital radio regulatory framework.


Removing the minister from the setting of digital radio start-up days will streamline the process and remove unnecessary government intervention in the commencement of digital radio services in regional areas.


The moratorium period was intended to provide encumbered commercial radio broadcasters with a level of stability and certainty during their digital radio investment phase. However, the prospect of a moratorium period has not provided sufficient incentive for commercial radio broadcasters to establish permanent digital radio services in regional licence areas. Removing the moratorium period implements a recommendation of the Digital radio report.


The measures in this bill are supported by digital radio stakeholders in the commercial, community and public broadcasting sectors. Passage of this bill will simplify and streamline Australia's digital radio regulatory regime. With these amendments, the government is further delivering on its commitment to cut red tape, so I commend this bill to my colleagues.


A couple of weeks ago, Commercial Radio Australia had a function in this building. I raced from the ABC Showcase, which I had been speaking at beforehand, to get to the Commercial Radio function. I recounted there that initially I myself had wanted to go into radio, back when I was, I guess, in the middle of my university studies. I had a connection indirectly with the owner of what was then radio station 2UE. I was fortunate to go along to 2UE and spend the day there to see what life in radio or as a journalist might be like. I spent some time with Rod Spargo, who was the general manager of the station, who is a legend in the commercial radio industry.


I was spellbound by the stories of the challenges of managing on-air radio talent, sitting in the newsroom as the clock was ticking down to a bulletin, seeing the journalists playing basketball with a bin, throwing paper in—all sorts of things—as they were 10 seconds then five seconds to the on-air broadcast. I thought: 'This is fabulous! I'd love to be in this environment!' I sat down at the end of the day with the proprietor of the station, hoping to be told, 'This is the industry for you,' and I was really crestfallen when the proprietor said to me: 'Young man, don't go into radio. Do something useful with your life.' It is arguable whether I have or have not, but, anyway, what could have been a brilliant radio career was cut down in its prime!


As I said, I do think radio does have a good future. I also recounted to that particular Commercial Radio conference that I am pleased that my relationship with their industry has been regularised. I am no longer the Minister representing the Minister for Communications; I am now the Minister for Communications in this place. I likened in a parliamentary sense the role of being a minister representing a minister to really being the parliamentary equivalent of being in a not entirely committed relationship. Anyway, I am pleased that now that has been regularised. As I said, I commend this bill to my colleagues.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister, for that interesting contribution.

Senator URQUHART

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  I can absolutely confirm the accuracy of what the Prime Minister said yesterday. I can confirm to the chamber that the government will not implement anything as rushed, distorting and potentially destructive as the Labor Party's anti-investment capital gains tax plans. There will be no change to the 50 per cent CGT discount for individuals. The government is still carefully considering some other changes. That is how tax policy—



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Aha! Come in spinner, Senator Wong! Of course, that is the way that tax policy is developed—not the way in which it was developed during that unlamented period when you were the minister for finance, Senator Wong. Remember the Henry tax review, in which every proposal but one was abandoned and the one that was chosen was a tax that raised no revenue? The government is developing tax policy the way it ought to be developed: carefully, methodically, paying due attention to the complexities of the system. The Labor Party in government commissioned a major review, the Henry tax review. It abandoned every single recommendation of the Henry tax review except one. It selected one recommendation from some 150, and that was the worst recommendation—the recommendation for a mining tax. So that is not the way that we are going to go about reform of the tax system. We are considering some changes, but those changes will not include a change to the 50 per cent discount for individuals.

  Well, Senator Cormann, that is true, but I was not going to be so unchivalrous as to point that out!

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (14:10):  What is part of the Treasurer's thinking and what is part of the government's thinking is, every single day, how we can strengthen growth, create more jobs and improve our tax system to make it more growth friendly, more efficient and less distorting in the economy, and how we can facilitate stronger growth and do it in a way that is fair.


Unlike the Labor Party, which came up with a massive tax hit on an important industry for Australia, which did not raise any money, when they had already spent all the money they thought it would raise and more, this government actually goes through an orderly policy-development process, and we make our announcements when they are ready to be made. The Australian people will know in good time before the next election—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Pause the clock. Order on my left!



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  On my left!




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I raise a point of order on direct relevance. The particular question was about increased capital gains tax 'in the Treasurer's thinking'. So far we have not got to that term. We have gone to some general area but we have not had anything about increased capital gains tax.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! I believe the minister has been relevant to the question. It was related broadly to: 'Is it within the Treasurer's thinking?'—even though I think it is difficult for the minister to answer what is in the Treasurer's thinking. So the minister is in order.




Senator CORMANN:
  As much as I am tempted to provide a running commentary, I will not. What the government is focused on is reforms to strengthen growth and create more jobs to ensure people across Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. That is why in last year's budget we delivered tax cuts for small business. That is why we got rid of Labor's disastrous mining tax and Labor's disastrous carbon tax, which made us less competitive internationally, cost jobs and reduced the level of investment into very important industries here in Australia. That is why we are looking right across the whole tax system for opportunities to make the tax system more growth friendly into the future.


That, of course, is only one part of our comprehensive plan for stronger growth and more jobs, which also includes an ambitious free trade agenda, an ambitious deregulation agenda, an ambitious innovation agenda, an ambitious infrastructure investment program—all efforts of the government to strengthen growth and create better opportunities for people across Australia to get ahead.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (14:13):  I think I have explained what the Treasurer's thinking is, in some detail, in answer to the first question. The Treasurer's thinking and the Treasurer's focus is on how we can best strengthen growth to create more jobs and create better opportunities for people across Australia to get ahead.


As part of our overall plan for stronger growth and more jobs, on top of what we are doing in terms of helping Australian businesses get better access to new markets overseas and on top of what we are doing in the infrastructure space and on top of what we are doing in terms of deregulation to reduce the cost of doing business in Australia, we are also continuing to look at how our tax system can be improved.


In last year's budget we reduced taxes for small business to help them be more successful in the future and to help them employ more Australians. In this year's budget there will be a series of initiatives and measures on the revenue and on the spending side of the budget to strengthen growth, create better opportunities and deliver them in a way that is affordable.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:15): My question is to the Minister for Finance, representing whoever is in charge of developing the coalition's tax policies today. Minister, there are 44,000 young people and children who are homeless in this country today. Last night it was reported that there are children as young as two weeks old sleeping rough on Perth's city streets and there are more than 200,000 people on the social housing waiting list. An entire generation has been priced out of housing affordability. Last year the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that the combined loss of revenue from negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions over the forward estimates was more than $22 billion. How does the government justify leaving these massive incentives for property speculation in place when housing affordability is at such crisis levels for so many Australians?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:18): Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. According to Moody's ratings agency and respected economists such as Saul Eslake, estimates are in the public domain that negative gearing adds nine per cent or around $44,000 to the price of a home. Could you explain, as finance minister, how it is economically or socially defensible to leave negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions in place when it is so well understood that these huge taxpayer funded incentives for property speculation are artificially inflating home prices?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:20):  Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. This is extremely instructive. Does the minister propose to engage in a rational and fact based way with proposals to transfer the huge taxpayer funded incentives for property speculation into genuinely affordable housing supply, whether it be emergency accommodation for the homeless, a rebooted rental affordability scheme, a housing supply bonds issue or direct investment in the community and public housing sectors? Do you intend to bring any such policies to the public debate, or will you continue to leave it up to the Greens? (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,6,1,question
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-02-23,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (14:16):  I thank Senator Ludlam for that question. The Australian government wants every Australian to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, and that is of course why we are working so hard to strengthen growth, to create more jobs and to create the best possible opportunity for every single Australian to get ahead. When it comes to housing affordability that is a very important issue, and of course we want all young Australians to be able to afford their own home—of course we do. The way to ensure housing affordability at a time when prices go up because there is stronger demand than supply in the market is by increasing the level of supply. And there are a whole range of things that will need to be done in relation to this, and the Commonwealth and state and territory governments are focused on these areas of public policy. 


To suggest, as Senator Ludlam seems to be suggesting, that the sort of approach that Labor is proposing would be the way to address it is entirely false. We reject that. To make the sort of change to negative gearing so called that Labor is suggesting would push up the cost of rental accommodation, it would push up the cost of rentals, and it would drive down property values in the established property market and it would drive down property values across the board, and that is not a policy that we support. 


The Greens are quite entitled as part of their longstanding coalition with Labor to pursue increased taxes on middle-income earners across Australia—on the police officers, nurses and teachers that are taking advantage of the opportunity to invest in residential property and to deduct the cost incurred in generating income from that investment from that income before it is taxed. That is the way the system currently works. If Labor and the Greens want to go to the Australian people in their usual coalition and sell that sort of policy, good luck to you.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (14:18):  I do not accept the premise of the question that Senator Ludlam puts there. What is colloquially described as negative gearing is a very simple and very important principle in our tax system, and that is when you generate an income you are able to deduct the costs in generating that income from that gross income in order to determine your taxable income.

The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. The minister did say he rejected the premise of the question upfront and did address some of the elements of the question. Minister.




Senator CORMANN:
  Thank you very much, Mr President. Obviously, if tax arrangements were changed in the way that Senator Ludlam seems to be suggesting, it would make investment in private rental accommodation less attractive. It would reduce the supply of private rental accommodation. It would increase the cost of private rental accommodation along the way, and that is not something that we consider to be in the public interest.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (15:02):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the statement. 


This explanation by the minister is not satisfactory. This report is a report that was commissioned by the former government back in 2012 as to the economic benefits of building submarines locally, taking into account the experiences of the Collins class program. Initially, in my various toing and froing with the minister's office and through the Information Commissioner and the Department of Defence, it was indicated that there was nothing there, that there was not a report, but we now know that there has been a report. 


I want to pay tribute to Senator McEwen, who has also assiduously pursued this issue in the estimates process. On 10 February 2016, in answer to a question from Senator McEwen, Rear Admiral Sammut said:


There have been some further payments to refine the model, but not through Macroeconomics, who are no longer involved. Their work has been completed in developing the model to a certain point. 


In other words, the work has been completed; the modelling has been provided. I also note that Senator Conroy, as shadow minister, has been assiduously pursuing this issue. We need to see the modelling. Taxpayers have paid close to half a million dollars for this. 


I note that the 2012 Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report in respect of procurement procedures contained a recommendation that there be openness and transparency in the process of procurement, and the government effectively said in response, 'We support that.' I am suggesting that the department has made a separate FOI based claim that the document is exempt on the basis that the document in question was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of briefing a minister on a cabinet submission. That claim is currently subject to a challenge with the Information Commissioner. Noting my detailed knowledge of the claim made by Defence, I am not inclined to simply acquiesce to the claim now being made almost certainly on the advice of the same people making the FOI claim inside the department.


In 1975 the Senate laid out by resolution its position with respect to public interest immunity claims. Paragraph 4 of that resolution makes it clear that, while the Senate may permit claims of public interest immunity to be advanced, it reserves the right to determine whether any particular claim will be accepted. As such, and as a courtesy, I advise the minister that I will be putting a motion to the Senate in the coming days in order to request production of any independent legal advice that supports the minister's claim.


This is an issue of great public importance not just in my home state of South Australia but in terms of the Future Submarine program and the importance of this Macroeconomics report's impact on the program. We ought to see it. Taxpayers have paid for it. If the government says now that there is a public interest immunity or that it is cabinet-in-confidence, we ought to see the basis of that claim.

Last week at the Treasurer's Press Club address, we found out that the government's highly-anticipated plan for tax reform consists of nothing but a big, blank page. We got 46 minutes of waffle and not one single policy proposal. This week we have seen Mr Turnbull channel his inner Tony Abbott with a hysterical and completely baseless scare campaign about Labor's proposal to save billions of dollars, to create jobs and to put home ownership back in reach for young Australians through moderate housing concession reforms. Honestly, I expected—as I know the Australian people did—better from the man who promised to lead a rational national debate that respected the intelligence of the Australian people. 


The current system is not working. Negative gearing and capital gains concessions cost the federal budget more than $10 billion a year, and this is more than we spend on either higher education or child care. It is shameful. They are not increasing the supply of new housing, they are not creating jobs and they are not boosting construction. They are certainly not helping young people to buy their first homes. Not only that, but half of all negative gearing benefits go to those in the top 20 per cent of income earners and 70 per cent of the capital gains tax discount is used by the top 10 per cent of income earners. Despite the hysterical rantings of those opposite, these facts are indisputable. Clearly, something needs to change.


The Liberals do not want to see it become easier for young Australians to compete on a level playing field with investors to buy their first home. Instead, as we found out yesterday, the Liberals are planning on going after the nest eggs of Australian retirees by reducing capital gain concessions on superannuation. We did not find this out from the Treasurer, we did not find out from the Minister for Finance and we certainly did not find it out from the Prime Minister. In fact, the Prime Minister himself ruled out any changes to capital gains tax in question time yesterday. On this matter, the Prime Minister was very clear when he said:


I can say to the honourable member opposite that increasing capital gains tax is no part of our thinking whatsoever.


Despite this clear and unequivocal statement from Mr Turnbull, a few hours later we learnt that it was not true. 


In fact, senior Liberals soon briefed media outlets that halving the capital gains tax discount on superannuation was very much part of the government's plan. It is no small issue to mislead the parliament and it is especially concerning for the person who holds the highest office in the land. It is either a matter of competence—did the Prime Minister truly not know what was going on as his own inner circle hatched plans to plunder the retirement incomes of older Australians?—or, alternatively, it is a matter of character and integrity—did the Prime Minister knowingly mislead the parliament? Either way, it points to a very serious issue of trust.




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President. That is plainly a reflection on the Prime Minister by innuendo.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Urquhart, any adverse reflection on a member of the other place is in fact disorderly. I would ask you to keep that in mind for the rest of your contribution, to which I will be listening carefully.




Senator URQUHART:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. So the Australian people have every right to ask themselves just what does our Prime Minister stand for. When he arrived, people thought he would back in marriage equality, fight for meaningful action on climate change and support increased investment in science and innovation. Since then we have seen no change. Marriage equality is further away than it was under Mr Abbott, our climate targets put us at the back of the pack and the CSIRO are laying off scientists, and now, it seems, the Liberals have absolutely no plan for tax reform in this country that does not involve a great big tax that would hit those on low incomes the hardest and a plan to plunder the nest eggs of Australian retirees.


So what options do remain on the table? Will the government continue to go after retirees' nest eggs? It is time for Mr Turnbull to come clean with the Australian people about what the Liberals' real plans for tax are. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2016-02-23,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:15):  Senator Urquhart talks about affordable housing. How soon we forget! I have not forgotten the days of the so-called world's greatest Treasurer, the days of Mr Keating, when I was paying a 25.25 per cent interest rate. Many Australians had 17 per cent home loans. Lucky they were regulated—they could have been 25 per cent as well. We talk about investment, and we discussed it recently especially in relation to buying farms. On 1 January 2013, the Labor Party brought in a regulation about investment. If you earned more than $250,000 a year, gross—your wage, in our case our travel allowance, and superannuation—and you bought a business it was not tax-deductible but if you bought a house it was. If any one of the 226 politicians in this building went and bought a house, they could get a tax deduction for. But if anybody wanted to buy a farm, no, they did not want that—let the foreigners buy them. I discovered this the hard way—




Senator Urquhart:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on relevance to the questions asked.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I am getting to it.




Senator Urquhart:
  He is getting to it. I draw the chair's attention to his comments.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: the motion is not that we take note of questions; we take note of answers. The answers canvassed the issues raised in Senator Williams's speech.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  And also, as senators contribute to the debate, generally information is added, and that brings it within order.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Those opposite have a plan to take to the people of Australia at the next election—they have a plan to raise taxes, to bring in a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. I wonder what that will do for costs in the cement industry, the brick industry, the timber industry and the building industry as a whole?




Senator Conroy:
  Even Senator Brandis is struggling to see the relevance of this.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I think even Senator Conroy would realise that. I know he is a climate change sceptic—I think he is, anyway. So housing affordability means let's go to the next election with a plan to put a tax on everything in our building industry. How is that go to make houses cheaper? How are people in the cities ever going to afford a house? That is why I keep telling them to come out to the country towns—$250,000 will buy a lovely three-bedroom, brick veneer home in a nice area where I am fortunate enough to live, in Inverell in northern New South Wales. It is a real problem. When it comes to affordability and tax, those opposite have one plan—raise taxes and spend more. What have they announced so far? About $8 billion worth of increases in taxes and some $26 billion or $30 billion of extra spending. So tax more but spend even more to bring the budget further into the red and mortgage our children's futures away.


I do not know when the election will be—it might be sooner than we expect, though it is due in August-September-October, as the Prime Minister has pointed out. It may be sooner depending on some bills that come to this place. Those opposite, in the Labor Party and the Greens, will oppose the ABCC legislation because they want to look after the CFMEU and see that they are protected while they disrupt the building industry. When the election comes we will get back to this whole issue of taxation and our plans for the future of Australia. Our plans will be spelt out and costed—there is no doubt about that. We will keep continuing to try and clean up the financial mess we inherited. 


If you go back to 2008-09, we had a huge terms of trade surplus. Iron ore was worth a fortune, coal was worth a fortune and we were exporting huge surpluses each month. The government was raking in a fortune in taxes from those big companies. But of course they spent more than they brought in and the debt continued to grow and grow. And that was during good times. If we do not think the good times have gone, the loss announced by BHP today is enough to scare everyone—a $5.7 billion loss. That indicates exactly how the resources sector is going and how tough the budget will be. Of course those in the Labor Party and the Greens will oppose us getting the budget in order. They have even opposed their own savings plan in this place. Labor opposed some $6 billion worth of budget cuts that they had planned to make themselves. When we won government, they opposed them. We will see it all come out before the election, and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:21):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate on the motion that the Senate take note of the answers given by Senator Cormann and Senator Brandis. At the outset, it is important that the facts here are on the table. Revenue for 2015-16 is expected to be $405.4 billion—an increase of 5.5 per cent of the estimated revenue of 2014-15. Total expenses for 2015-16 are expected to be $434.5 billion, an increase of 3.4 per cent on estimated expenses in 2014-15. It is important that those figures be on the table.


It is also important to understand where those amounts of money come from. Forty-seven-odd per cent, or $194.3 billion, comes from PAYE taxpayers Company and resource rent taxes account for about 17.6 per cent of that revenue. Sales taxes, GST and the like represent 15.2 per cent, fuel excise is 4.4 per cent and there are a lot of other much smaller items. The picture is very clear. Through the finance minister, we are asking the Treasurer the specific question: what is in his thinking? The answer that is coming back is prevarication, with no clear vision and no clear, authoritative response to the questions we are legitimately asking. In the interview that the Treasurer did on 3AW on 19 February 2016, Mr Mitchell, the interviewer, said:




… 
I am looking for this vision that I heard about five months ago. Is this a five year vision or a six months vision? 



The Treasurer's response was:


Our vision is of an economy that is innovative, modern for the 21st century, one where people are paying less tax over time, not more tax over time, where the economy is not run by the tax and spend higher tax club who seem to think the answer to every prayer is to raise a tax. When you hear Labor saying they have announced policies all they have done is announce higher taxes fuelling higher spending.


I am still waiting for the clarity that a Treasurer, a few months out from a budget, should have in his mind. He should know what he is going to address. Is he going to address bracket creep, if that is an economic deterrent? If 48 per cent of the revenue raised is from individuals' PAYE tax earnings and bracket creep is going to be drag on GDP, how is he going to address that? If company taxes are a drain on employment—if they are causing employers not to employ enough people—how is he going to address that? Is he looking at capital gains tax? Is he looking at negative gearing?


He has ruled out changes to the GST, but I might say this: one other very famous Liberal Prime Minister ruled out the GST, saying it was dead, gone and never to be reinstated. Four years later, he actually prosecuted the case and got it in place. The GST is the area that the Liberal government will come back to. They have ruled it out for now because the focus groups tell them it is not popular, but they have to go back to it. You cannot get any more out of the workers. You will not get any more out of the companies. The next biggest item is a 15 per cent GST. They walked away from it because they are gutless. They walk away from anything. This Prime Minister walks away from anything that threatens his position in the Lodge and anything that requires real conviction, real prosecution and real arguing of the case. Negative gearing, capital gains tax and the GST—they walked away from all those debates.


So what are they going to do in the budget? Will they even have a budget? Will they just say, 'Look, let's go the polls before the budget because we can't actually construct a rational, logical view to take to the electorate. We'll just blame the ABCC or the CFMEU for all the woes in Australia—bag it all up and say it's the Labor Party's problem and the crossbenchers' problem. They are why we can't be the government we want to be.' And they will not even address the fact that they do not have the intestinal fortitude to articulate their case in a clear and unequivocal manner in all of the forums that are available to them while they are in government. They are prevaricating. It is embarrassing that Senator Cormann—he of the 'cigar and glass of wine' fame—on the best day of his life, the 2014 budget—(Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-02-23,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:26):  'There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.' I remind Senator Gallacher, through you Mr Deputy President, that to start quoting Liberal prime ministers of the past will come home to bite him, and come home it did. I also congratulate Senate Gallacher on very accurately and astutely quoting the Treasurer of this country's vision. What is a vision? A vision is where you see the country being in the long term. Then, from that vision, you work backwards. You work through strategies, you work through tactics, you work through consultation, you work through the whole process and you deliver your vision over time. I have to say that Senator Brandis and, indeed, Senator Cormann exercised a high degree of grace and courtesy in their responses to the question by Senators Urquhart and Gallacher, because the answers could have been given very shortly and, needless to say, they were that the government is not changing the 50 per cent CGT discount for individuals. They could have just said that and then sat down.


It is amazing. I heard in this place from Labor senators today reference to changes to negative gearing. And what do you think came across my mind? It was the live export trade, where that crowd, in government, with reference to nobody and against the advice of a Liberal senator who actually knew something about the trade, came in overnight and cut the guts out of the live export trade—and they now plan to do it, if they have their way, which they will not, with negative gearing. What would we see if Labor policies were introduced for negative gearing? We would see one-third, 33 per cent, of the housing market immediately dissipate. It would not be the eight or 10 per cent that happened to the cattle industry in the live export trade; it would be more than one-third. We hear about the white-shoe brigade from Senator Cameron. Was he talking about Senator O'Neill, an investor in negative gearing? Was he talking about me? I am not a member of the white-shoe brigade, but I certainly am a participant in negative gearing, let me assure you. I challenge the Labor Party to go out there—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Back, I was actually going to ask you to resume your seat so that I could bring the Senate to order, but Senator Conroy is looking to raise a point of order.




Senator Conroy:
  On a point of order, I think, when there is a clear conflict of interest being declared like that, it is only incumbent on the good senator to declare how many homes he has negatively geared.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator BACK:
  There is no point of order, and there is no conflict either. This is a convergence of interests, because I am like many other Australians, like many on the Labor side, who have the common sense to avail themselves of the opportunities that are available to them through the taxation system in this country—as many on your side do.


Senator Conroy—through you, Mr Deputy President—do you know what happens when you invest wisely over time in negatively geared property? It actually becomes positively geared. We have positively geared investments, and they contribute to the Australian tax system. Isn't that an amazing notion for the shadow minister—that negatively geared property could in fact become positively geared and become a positive contributor! 


There is a very clear distinction between this government and the other mob when they were in government. We have heard Senator Cormann say that all our policies are associated with cutting tax for small business, free trade agreements which are now stimulating so much export income in the services and in the commodity sectors, and the $50 billion infrastructure fund. There is an allegation and accusation that we are not rushing into things. What did Labor do in government? You rushed into the 'Gillard memorial halls', many of which are now falling down. You rushed into pink batts, and we all know the outcome there. You rushed into the $900 and the $1,200 cheques that largely ended up in poker machines, alcohol and drugs. Go and ask the people who work in accident and emergency departments of hospitals where those moneys went. 


This government will not be rushing into its final decisions associated with policy development. There is a budget coming up in May. It will be presented on the basis of careful thought, careful consideration, of the implications—not the pink batts analogy but on the basis of clear and careful persuasion—which will be of the greatest benefit and, as Senator Cormann said, to develop strength in our economy and more jobs in a fair fashion.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:31):  I too rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann and Senator Brandis to questions asked by Labor regarding taxation. It is really hard to keep up with the daily flip-flopping of the Turnbull government. Its approach to tax has been nothing short of shambolic. Look at the rhetoric and rubbish we have heard from those opposite today. They must think that, if they yell really loudly, suddenly that makes it all right or that it is so loud we cannot hear anything. We heard ancient history from the Nationals in relation to tax, and do you know why that is? Because they have absolutely nothing to say—nothing to say. 


The government are busily contradicting themselves all over the place—left, right, centre. They have no idea what is going on in terms of tax, and we have caught them napping. When Labor came out with its very sensible negative gearing policy, they were caught napping, because they have nothing left in their tax portfolio because one minister or another has ruled it out, although some have ruled things back in. But those opposite, the members of the Turnbull government, seriously think the Australian dream is to negatively gear your seventh house! Labor knows that actually the dream is being able to afford your first house. Sure, Senator Back might go on and on about those who negatively gear, and I put it on the record here today that I am one of them. But that does not mean that I do not think the system needs change. Of course it needs change. I am certainly more than willing to pay my fair share of tax and I do not resile from that. I want to see housing at an affordable level in this country. But those opposite do not see that. As usual, they are looking after the big end of town. 


The best we have heard from the Treasurer was talk about unicorns! That is really what we heard from the Treasurer. Yesterday we saw Mr Abbott—sorry, Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister. Actually, they are interchangeable these days, so who would know? Mr Turnbull was channelling his inner Mr Abbott, as within just 48 hours we saw the government consider making the superannuation guarantee an opt-out for low-income Australians, and then, last night, reports revealed the government has a secret plan to halve the current 33 per cent capital gains tax discount for super funds. 


This latest leak comes after the Prime Minister yesterday in question time channelled his inner Mr Abbott and attacked our policy—Labor's sensible policy—of halving the capital gains tax discount for individuals and trusts. What Mr Turnbull said in question time yesterday was:


… I can say to the honourable member opposite that increasing capital gains tax is no part of our thinking whatsoever.


That is what is in the Hansard. He cannot get away from that statement. It is clear as anything: it is no part of their thinking whatsoever. But what happened then? Senator Cormann quickly came to the Prime Minister's defence, when he said:


… the Prime Minister never just makes comments on the fly, there are very carefully considered judgments …


Well, they caught everyone out, because later on yesterday afternoon we had the bizarre occurrence of the Prime Minister's office—his own office—briefing newspapers that, despite Mr Turnbull's declaration on capital gains tax, the government was in fact looking at options to change the capital gains tax. Australians are not fooled by this, and voters have quite rightly started to see Mr Turnbull in his true light, as he channels Mr Abbott. 


What happened yesterday was, again, an attack on workers by the Turnbull government. They have done a lot of things to hurt workers. They want to scrap penalty rates, they froze the super benefits for workers with the help of the crossbenches and they took away the superannuation low-income guarantee. So you have to wonder, when the Prime Minister is contradicted not just by his own ministers but by his own office: is he going to be replaced? Seriously, is he going to be the Prime Minister that leads us to the next election? Who would know. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On the same matter, Senator Ludlam?




Senator Ludlam:
  Who can tell, Mr Deputy President? I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann on the question of housing affordability.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Asked by the opposition?




Senator Ludlam:
  If you consider us as such, then yes. I asked a question to Senator Cormann on housing affordability.

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:05):  Almost a year ago this Senate passed a motion welcoming the diversity of voices represented by minor parties and Independents in the Senate. The motion passed unanimously. Yesterday the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens and Nick Xenophon issued that same crossbench with a death warrant. Our days are now numbered. When we arrived here, what on earth were we thinking? Was it that we crossbenchers, with policies, loyal supporters and vision for the future, had the audacity to get elected and present a different point of view? No, you now need a big party machine and the nerve to shut the gate after you have got yourself in.


I came into this place with a policy priority of 'every family, a job and a house'. But it seems that none of this matters to a good number of people in this place as much as having the numbers and stitching up deals. There are no relationships, just transactions. I get it—this is what will happen from here on. We and the many allies we have outside this unholy Liberal-National-Greens-Xenophon alliance will tell the Australian public the truth. It is the truth about the cartel that now exists to disenfranchise millions of voters in the Senate. The Australian public will see this for what it is and will not be impressed.

I have the greatest respect for Senator Day and for many of my crossbench colleagues and indeed for some in the opposition, but I want to make a few points.


What is fundamentally wrong with the system at the moment is not who was elected at the last election, nor fundamentally even how many primary votes they got—though I will comment on that. What is fundamentally wrong with our system at the moment is that the people do not deliberately choose who represents them. The people do not choose where their preferences go, because the vast, vast bulk of Australians do not know where their preferences go.




Senator Day:
  They are delegated.




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, they do not know where their preferences go, and this is the fundamental problem. What the Labor Party and some on the crossbench are saying to us today is that the Australian people cannot be trusted to choose where their preferences go. I take a different view. I think the Australian people should have the choice to vote for whomever they choose, and it should not be a system that makes it virtually impossible for them to choose that, and it certainly should not be a system that leads to a virtual lottery as to who is actually elected.


I will give an example. A lot has been made of Senator Muir and the low primary vote. Well, I do not care about the low primary vote. I think Senator Muir is a decent bloke. But I say that the voting system that got Senator Muir elected is a lot like a lottery. Senator Muir happens to be a decent fellow, who I think does his best to represent his state, but it could just as easily have been, when you look at the list of votes at that election, the Australian Sex Party; it could have been The WikiLeaks Party, the Shooters and Fishers Party, the Animal Justice Party or the Help End Marijuana Prohibition party, all of whom got more primary votes. Going down the list, it could have been Katter's Australia's Party, the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party, the Australian Independents, the Senator On-Line, the No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics, Bullet Train For Australia or Drug Law Reform Australia, all of whom were getting half a per cent or less. If they were to get half a per cent and get preferences from people deliberately, in a preferential system there would be nothing fundamentally wrong with that. But what happens at the moment in our system is that people who voted for the Australian Stable Population Party do not know whether their preferences are going to elect the Sex Party or the Family First Party or the Pirate Party. They should have that choice. It should not be a lottery. It should not be the luck of the draw on the ballot paper and where you end up when the preferences start being distributed.


There was stuff put out, I think, before the last election saying: 'If you vote for the WikiLeaks party there is a good chance that you can end up voting for the Nationals,' and 'Vote for the Palmer United Party and there is a good chance that your vote can end up electing the Greens,' and that is true. Many people who voted for Palmer would not have known that he was preferencing the Greens. Many people who voted for Bob Katter would not have known that he was preferencing the Greens and vice versa. People who were voting for the Greens would not have known that their votes were helping to elect someone who, on the face of it, would have been significantly ideologically different. What I say to the Senate and to the Australian people is that I want to see a system where Australian people choose who represents them in a genuine way, and at the moment that is not what is happening.


The Labor Party are particularly hypocritical and conflicted on this. We heard from Senator Dastyari, arguing against this and saying that it will disenfranchise people. This is a backroom dealer who is arguing for backroom deals. Let us be clear about that. These are backroom deals where no voter would know—even the most diligent voter who spends hours trying to get across it probably would not really know—where their preferences might end up. And, when we are talking about 20, 30, 50 or 100 preferences, they have absolutely no chance. Under the current system, if you are given the opportunity to vote below the line and you have to fill out 100, the fear, of course, is that there is a good chance that you will get it wrong—you will not order them all properly—and then your vote will not count. So most people—I think it is about 97 per cent—choose to vote above the line, and Senator Day says, 'That means you are delegating your preferences.' Well, yes: you are handing over control because you do not have much choice—you are not really given much choice—and then the deals get done, and you do not know where your preference goes.




Senator Day:
  Then change below the line!




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, Senator Day, this is the issue here. We had a parliamentary committee that looked at this in detail.




Senator Day:
  Not the minor parties.




Senator SESELJA:
  It looked at it in detail—and this goes again to the Labor Party. The Labor Party are coming in here and saying—




Senator Dastyari:
  This is not the joint parliamentary report.




Senator SESELJA:
  I think the Labor Party actually made a submission to that which is very, very similar to the legislation that is coming before the parliament. It is very, very similar. You know, optional preferential voting above the line is taking place in New South Wales and the sky has not fallen in. We have still seen people have their choices. What the Labor Party and some of the crossbenchers are saying is one of two things: either they think the Australian people cannot be trusted to choose their own preferences, or the Australian people simply are not smart enough and we should leave it to the political players to choose their preferences for them. I say: let us leave it to the wisdom of the Australian people.


People say this is about favouring one party or another. That is absolute rubbish because if it was about favouring one party then why was the Labor Party, and why were people like Gary Gray, so in favour of it, if it was about favouring one side of politics over another? In three years, or six years, or in future elections, who knows what the dynamics will be in relation to the party structure in this country? Who knows what parties of the left will arise? Who knows what parties of the rights will arise? From time to time it will benefit one party; it will diminish another. That is democracy. But fundamentally when you are looking at these kinds of reforms you should always err on the side of giving voters the choice rather than the backroom players. Fundamentally that is what Labor are going to be arguing against today and no doubt when the legislation comes to the parliament. They are going to be saying to the Australian people, 'No, you can't be trusted to choose where your second, third, fourth, 10th or 15th preference goes.'


I think people should be able to choose. I do not think they should have to preference every party. I think if there are 100 parties you should not have to. There are a lot of parties I have a fundamental opposition to, and I do not want to give them my preferences. I do not want my preferences to go anywhere near them. I could name some parties here, but I am not going to do that today. The reality is that Australians should be given that choice. If there is a party that you have an absolute objection to, they should not be getting any of your preferences.


That is the other great thing about a Senate voting reform which allows people not to preference certain parties whose views they might find obnoxious and objectionable. Under our current system, eventually they get some of those preferences at some point. You will be preferencing them. The best you can do is put them last, but you have to put another obnoxious one second last and another one third last. What I find particularly appealing about this reform is that you would not have to give any of those parties that you have a fundamental objection to a preference. You can preference just the one party. You can preference 10 parties, and it will be the parties that match your philosophy and that you believe are doing a good job.


The Labor Party and some of the crossbenchers are going to say to us that the lottery that we have at the moment where Australians do not know where their preferences go is better. They are going to say that the current system is better and that the Australian people cannot be trusted to do the right thing. We have heard that it will lead to all sorts of informal voting. The reality with the way that this has been structured is that it will not lead to informal voting because, if people vote the same way they always have, it will still count. 


But Australians can also follow the instructions that they will be given by the Electoral Commission which will encourage them to number from one to six. In that case, at least the top six choices of that individual will be preferenced. Surely that is fair. The Labor Party and some of the crossbenchers seem to have no confidence in the Australian people's judgement. I have confidence that sometimes they will favour the coalition and sometimes they will reject our policies when they believe we have gotten it wrong. That is democracy, and this reform would actually improve our democracy.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:17):  I have fundamental issues with the legislation as it has been proposed. My issues with it stem from the fact that, frankly, from what I can see, what we have here is an electoral gerrymander masquerading as transparency and reform. It is a predetermined outcome with a model built and retrofitted to achieve that. Let's be clear: the coalition and the Greens got into bed together and asked, 'How do we wipe out the minor parties?' Then they built a model to achieve that. Then they created a set of arguments to justify that. If this was real, serious reform, if this was actually about what it purports to be about, we would not be having a one-week inquiry to look at the biggest changes in Senate voting structures since 1984. These would be the biggest changes in 31 years.


I believe the Senate is a better place because of its diversity of views. I believe the Senate is a better place because there are so many different views being expressed here. A lot of them are views that I do not agree with. Someone like Senate Day and I have little to nothing in common when it comes to policy positions, but the fact that there is someone advocating positions that are different to my own I do not think weakens this institution. I believe it strengthens it.


Fundamentally when you have this type of system, these kinds of changes mean—and let's not pussyfoot around this; let's be honest about what this is going to result in—there will be only three parties in this chamber and perhaps occasionally a Senator Xenophon. This is the behaviour of a bunch of schoolyard bullies getting to turn around and say what kids do and do not get to participate and who does and does not get to play.


The hypocrisy of this coming from the Greens party is that it is a party that grew from being a very, very small minor party with a very, very small vote that over a period of time used this system to build its support. To turn around and try to shut the trapdoor behind them is, I think, deplorable. I think it is disgusting. I think it is a terrible development. If the Greens political party decides that it is going to spend the rest of its time being the lap-dog of the coalition parties that is a matter for it—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, on all the big legislation I have been involved with in the past year all I have seen, time after time, is this new coalition between the Greens, the Libs and the National Party. That is a matter for other political parties—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order! Senator Dastyari, just take your seat for a moment, please. I will remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly and that other senators will have their turn to talk shortly. Senator Dastyari, please continue.




Senator DASTYARI:
  At the end of the day, what is it that we want to achieve in the Senate? I believe a more diverse and more open Senate with a range of different views is a better outcome. I believe that these proposals that have been put forward are going to result in a narrowing of the divergent views. The government wants this because it wants a more compliant Senate. That is what this is about achieving. It is not about transparency. If there were a more compliant Senate then what worries me is what would happen with a situation like the 2014 budget. A more compliant Senate would not be prepared to stand up to the government. A more compliant Senate would have fewer and fewer different voices. We as an institution are better and stronger because of the different views held here.


This proposal will result in a giant exhaustion of up to one-quarter of the vote. Let us talk about what this proposal would actually do. This is the introduction of optional preferential voting.



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, this is the introduction—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Dastyari, please address the chair when you are speaking.




Senator DASTYARI:
  This is the introduction of an optional preferential system, which will result in a massive exhaustion of votes. This is about making sure that the votes of those people who choose to vote for a minor party will go nowhere. That is what this proposal will result in—that is what the modelling itself says it will do. This is an electoral fix. This is a rort. This is a set of rules, a structure and a system that have been created with the sole purpose of wiping out a handful of crossbench senators and locking in a handful of Greens senators. This is bad policy, this is bad law and it is being done for the wrong reasons.


If we are serious about electoral reform, why aren't we looking at how we can reform below-the-line voting? Why aren't we using a lengthier process? This has been rushed in for a double dissolution election and the Greens should be appalled. You should be appalled.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-02-23,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:23):  When it comes to Senate voting reform, we have a choice: do we back voters deciding on their preferences or do we allow group voting tickets to continue and the backroom deals to flourish, with the likes of Senator Sam Dastyari out there doing these backroom deals and trying to wield and retain power? Do you back democracy or do you back manipulation? That is what is before us now.


Let us remember that we are actually talking about democracy here. Senate voting reform is in the context of how we enhance our democracy, who represents us and how we are governed. We need to ensure our electoral system cannot be manipulated. These reforms are coming before parliament because, in recent years, we have seen levels of manipulation increase. People have become aware of how they can 'rort' or 'game' the system—whatever word you want to use. Voting has become a lottery. I agree with the idea of diversity. All my colleagues in the Greens are very proud that we sit on a rich crossbench. That is part of how this Senate operates, and I hope there always is a strong crossbench, but, as we have seen attacks from the Labor Party suggesting that this will hand power to the Liberal Party, the Labor Party need to look into the mirror at themselves. If they think it will end up handing power to the Liberal Party, it means that they are not doing their job. Why aren't they out there winning more votes and standing up for what matters to people? Why are they doing the wrong thing by refugee rights? Why do they have a weak foreign affairs policy? Why are they failing to clean up political donations? There are issues around national security—so much of this has to do with Labor's failings here.


Coming back to the issue before us, it is worth remembering that Senator Dastyari spoke about the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report. The JSCEM report was important. It was where the parties came together. The submission from Labor set out their position very clearly. Labor's submission said:


Senators who … rely principally on preference arrangements to get elected do not reflect genuine voter intention and need to be addressed.


There we had the Labor Party submission supporting reform. We had Labor, the Liberals, the Nationals, the Greens and Senator Xenophon signing off on very clear recommendations. At the time, Bill Shorten was the Leader of the Opposition. He is still the Leader of the Opposition, but now Labor are not on board. We should have unity on electoral reform, but we do not. The Leader of the Opposition is failing to give that incredibly vital leadership that is needed on these sorts of issues. We are seeing weak leadership. It is resulting in people like Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari leading Labor into oblivion on this issue. They are locking themselves into a position of supporting backroom deals.


There is no question about it: there is a problem with the Senate voting system at the moment. The voter goes in to vote on election day and can only cast one vote, in one box, above the line. By far the majority of people have no idea where their preferences end up because backroom deals have already worked that out. Labor have said they will vote against the bill. They are still back in the last century, when that was how they operated. They urgently need to change their own image, their own principles and their own way of working, but here they are illustrating to the public how bankrupt they are, even when it comes to such an important thing as voting reform.


They are also going against the advice of their former Special Minister of State, Gary Gray, who worked on JSCEM, worked on this issue and gave very solid advice. The committee was consistent, where all parties, having worked through many issues, came to the same conclusion. Mr Gray commented that Senate voting reform:


… is as important to Labor as one-vote-one-value and it is as important as the franchise.


That says it so clearly, but here we have Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari leading Labor down a path of embarrassment and oblivion instead of standing up for what is right. Mr Gray also spoke about how these measures uphold the integrity of section 7 of the Constitution.


With regard to the actual plan as it will be set out in the legislation, it has gone another stage from JSCEM, but the essence is still the same. What JSCEM recommended is that it should be the voters who determine their preferences. Under the proposed legislation, voters will be able to do that. They can determine their own preferences if they vote above or below the line. If they vote above the line, they will be required to number at least six squares. This is where, again, Labor and, unfortunately, some of the minor parties are being highly inaccurate in how they are representing this. By requiring at least six boxes to be allocated, preferences will be distributed. Many of the parties are already negotiating preferences. The difference will be that this will not be done in backroom deals; it will be a recommendation to the voter. It will be on the how-to-vote cards given out on election day and on our websites et cetera. But, again, the decision rests with voters.


I feel very strongly about this issue because I saw how damaging these rorters were in the 1999 New South Wales election, when there were 264 candidates for 81 parties. At that time, the Outdoor Recreation Party, with only one-fifth of one per cent of primary votes, won a seat. They won the same number of seats as the Democrats. But the Democrats at the time had about 20 times as many votes as they did. So, again, when you look into the detail here, how can anybody say that this is democratic? That experience in New South Wales has very much informed how the Greens have taken this forward at a federal level. I spoke many times to former Greens senator and leader Bob Brown about this very issue. He realised that the reforms we achieved in New South Wales could bring benefits to Senate voting reform federally. He introduced a bill in 2004 and again in 2008. He and former senator Christine Milne spoke on this issue many times. These reforms are urgently needed, and the merits of Senate voting reform are really very clear. This issue has been muddied by misinformation, but it is something that we need to address, and address urgently.


I want to return to the idea—which many on the Labor side are sprouting and thereby misinforming many in the social movement—that the Liberals will control the Senate forever and a day. Ben Raue, a psephologist who runs a website called The Tally Room, said, 'It’s a brave call to assume the coalition could pull its entire two-party-preferred vote in a Senate race.' Seats can be taken from the conservatives. Again I remind Labor: look at yourselves. Look at what you stand for. When you are saying that the conservatives are going to control this Senate for the rest of time, what you are saying is that you are giving up. You are satisfied with the weak policies that you are taking out on the environment, on climate change, on people's rights. Every election we have a different result. When we become candidates, it is up to us as public representatives to work with our members and our supporters to represent what we stand for. If the Labor people have the courage of their convictions to stand up for what matters, there is no reason the conservatives should ever control this place. I have found the scare tactics on this issue deeply appalling. 


I think we need to remind ourselves what is going on here with the way in which a few factional operators have gained their power. Let us be very frank about this. Senator Dastyari and Senator Conroy have driven this issue within Labor. As I have indicated, the Labor Party submission to the JSCEM was supportive of these reforms, and the committee's recommendations had total backing from Labor, including from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten, who was also leader at the time. There was solid support. Then it started to be derailed. Senator Dastyari and Senator Conroy, through their political careers, have gained so much of their power by doing backroom deals. 




Senator Wong:
  Coming from you now—that's good!




Senator RHIANNON:
  I acknowledge the laughter. I acknowledge the interjection from Senator Wong. Labor needs to look into what is going on here. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2016-02-23,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:34):  I rise today to speak on this matter of public importance because I believe the issue of Senate voting reform is truly a matter of public importance—not for the reasons outlined in this motion but for the integrity of our democracy itself. There is absolutely no-one in this place more aware of the imperfections of our Senate voting system and the AEC processes than me, having had to contest two Senate elections within seven months because of these very imperfections. 


The current system is clearly broken and needs urgent reform before the next federal election. As so clearly articulated by Senator Rhiannon—in fact, I almost thought she had done the job for me and that I would have to sit down—one of her previous colleagues, former Greens senator Christine Milne, in an op-ed yesterday, very adroitly described the urgency of the need for reform. She said:


Leaving things the way they are now, without the proposed reforms, means voting 1 above the line on your Senate ballot paper is like putting a ping pong ball in the mouth of a fibreglass clown at the Easter Show. 


How right she is.


It is a fundamental tenet of democracy that Australians have the right to know exactly where their vote is going when they fill out their ballot paper. It is very clear from the bipartisan reports on the last federal election that up to 97 per cent of Australian voters who voted above the line on the Senate ballot paper had little or no control over where their vote ended up and who it assisted to get elected. That is not democracy.


The proposed changes to our very broken Senate voting system are neither new nor something that has been hurried, as suggested in this MPI. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters did an extensive inquiry into the 2013 election and, in May 2014, almost two years ago, issued the Interim report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 federal election. That report on Senate voting practices has been in the public arena for nearly two years. The bipartisan committee, which included highly respected members of the ALP—Senator Faulkner, Alan Griffin MP and Gary Gray MP—unanimously concluded that the current system of Senate voting let voters down at the 2013 election and that the status quo is simply not an option.


The report also found that voters in the 2013 election felt their votes had been devalued by preference deals and that voters had been disenfranchised by being forced to prefer un-preferred candidates. That is not the coalition speaking; that is a bipartisan committee which found our system is fundamentally undemocratic. In the same report, which, again, was delivered almost two years ago—and not out of the blue, as is now being suggested—the committee made six key recommendations which they believed were urgent to improve the Senate voting system for the 2016 election.


It is also important in this current debate to put Senate reform into historical context. Since Federation, the Australian Parliament has never shied away from reform to progressively improve our electoral system, in particular the vexatious Senate voting system. Our current electoral systems have evolved over the past century and, while the House of Representatives method of voting system was largely settled by 1918 with several small changes since then, voting for the Senate has continued to be the subject of debate and progressive reforms over the last century. This demonstrates that we do not have to be wedded to the system, which we inherited and which clearly has problems, simply for history's sake.


The introduction of the committee's bipartisan report delivered a very compelling rationale for these changes. It said these changes were necessary—to provide simplicity, integrity, transparency and clarity in the Senate voting system. The changes would also provide the people with the power to express and to have their voting intent upheld; they would also restore confidence that the system of Senate voting actually reflects the will of the Australian people. The report very clearly said that the system that has evolved is inherently undemocratic and that urgent change was required.


The report also provided a number of tangible examples of just how broken the current system is. The first example was the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party of Victoria, which received only 0.51 per cent, or just over 17,000 formal first preference votes in Victoria, equalling just 0.0354 of a quota. The party was elected to the final seat with a transfer of 143,118 votes from the Sex Party—many of whom would probably have been very surprised to find that their vote got the Motoring Enthusiast Party elected—but whose transferred votes had been transferred from over 20 other parties, arguably coming from voters who had no idea that their vote would elect a candidate from an unrelated party that had 0.0354 of a quota. The second example is from Western Australia, which, as I said, I recall all too well. There was a 14-vote difference between two candidates at one exclusion point and a 12-vote difference at the same exclusion point during the recount. It again demonstrates that there are very serious problems.


Based on these recommendations and the extensive public debate that has occurred now for nearly two years, the government is proposing reforms to empower voters to take back control of their votes in a Senate election. As Senator Rhiannon said, that is exactly what the Labor Party put in its submission two years ago, but, as we have just heard from Senator Dastyari and no doubt we will hear from Senator Cameron, the Labor Party is now starting to unleash confusing misinformation about these reforms. The latest we heard from Senator Dastyari was that these changes would lead to 800,000 additional informal votes. That is clearly false, clearly without substance and clearly insulting to Australian voters who absolutely can mark a ballot paper one to six above the line with their own preferences. It is outrageous to suggest that Australian people cannot number one to six.


In contrast to this approach, however, the Hon. Gary Gray, who was a member of the committee, is on the record both then and now as strongly supporting the changes. So what did Mr Gray have to say this month in an opinion piece in the Weekend West? He said that the measures 'significantly strengthen our democratic process and restore transparency'. He had the courage to stand up for what the Labor Party actually said two years ago to say: 'This system sucks. It is not democratic and I will stand on principle to support what I believe is right.' Mr Gray went on to urge 'the government should act now without delay and before the next election'.


Why now? We have been discussing these proposals for nearly two years and we need to do it soon. The Australian Electoral Commission needs at least three months to implement the changes ahead of the next general election, which, as we know is scheduled for the second half of this year. What are these so-called rushed reforms that have been discussed publicly for nearly two years? One is the abolition of group-voting tickets and the provision of above-the-line voting for up to six boxes so that people can clearly choose the parties of their preference. They can vote for any of the independents or minor parties, but, instead of their votes being subject to backroom deals for group-voting tickets, they will get to choose—independents, minor parties, the Greens, Labor or Liberal. I think that is a fabulous outcome.


Another important change is the reduced opportunity for people to game and become registrars of multiple parties. Another change, which will be important for new Australians and for Australians who cannot read, is printing party logos on the ballot paper. That is a huge step forward in enfranchising such people in a more meaningful way.


In conclusion, Labor senators are under-estimating the ability of Australians to vote for the people of their choice. (Time expired)'

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:44):  I want to raise some issues different from those we have heard in this debate so far. Senator Day has raised a matter of public importance about extinguishing Senate diversity. I find it interesting that Senator Day would be talking about diversity when Senator Day trots around like a faithful puppy every time the Liberals call a vote. If you want to know where Senator Day is voting, you just have to look at where the Liberals are sitting. There is no diversity. Senator Day has been turned on by his so-called mates in the Liberal Party, and he is going to get kicked out after being such a sycophantic follower of the Liberal Party for the last couple of years. His sycophancy is being repaid with his getting kicked out early because of these changes arrived at behind the scenes by the Greens, by Senator Xenophon and by the Liberal Party. There is quite a strong case of hypocrisy with Senator Day. How must he be feeling when he wakes up every day knowing that his constant voting, following the Libs around every time, has meant absolutely nothing?


Senator Rhiannon speaks about embarrassment and oblivion. I am not embarrassed to say that I do not mind a bit of diversity. I appreciate having people in here who understand the working class of this country, who have come from working class backgrounds—not like the coalition, who have never worked a hard day in their lives; they do not know what it is like to have to battle to put food on the table, do not know what it is like to have to battle to live day by day. The problem we have here goes even deeper than the stupidity of the Greens in doing this deal. If they were going to do a deal, at least the Greens could have tried to get something out of it. But they are the real mugs of this parliament—they never get anything for the deals that they do. They just roll over. They are even worse than the National Party. The Libs call them in, give them a cup of tea or a chardonnay, and they roll over—they say 'tickle my neck' and away they go. They get a tickle on the neck and that is it. They do a deal but they get nothing out of the deal. Surely if they were a progressive party they would be going after the rorts that have taken place under the donation laws in this country. They would be doing something about it. The Greens had an opportunity to do something now, and what did they do? They rolled over—they absolutely rolled over. They are the biggest mugs this parliament has ever seen in terms of carrying out negotiations. They rolled over on multinationals tax and they have now rolled over on this. A progressive party would at least have enough guts to stand up and get something out of the backroom deals they do.


This is what we really need to be dealing with: we need to be dealing with the Liberal Party in New South Wales, who are getting handed brown paper bags with $10,000 in them in the front seat of a Bentley. What does that do for democracy in this country? We hear a lot about democracy but you will not hear the Liberals or the Greens in this debate talking about the rorts that are the real problem for democracy—the big business donations. The Greens had an opportunity this time round to stand up and say to the Liberals, if you want us to make changes then we want changes to the electoral laws in this country so that you cannot hide donations, so that you cannot get donations made  nationally sent to New South Wales; you cannot get donations laundered federally to come back into New South Wales. We know what happened in ICAC with the Liberal Party; we know that four of their MPs in New South Wales had to resign because of the electoral deals they were doing. Senator Sinodinos was the chairman of Australian Water Holdings at the time they gave $180,000 to a company called Eight by Five.

You tell me why a company that could not pay their workers superannuation, with Senator Sinodinos in a senior position in the company, was giving $180,000 to Eight by Five—




Senator Smith:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a further point of order: I think the standing orders make it very clear that relevance is an important element and Senator Cameron should get back to the topic of the motion.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I do believe Senator Cameron is being relevant.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Smith, you are an absolutely pathetic joke.




Senator Smith:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, even from Senator Cameron that was a very unnecessary contribution.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  If you have such a glass chin you should not be in here. Eight by Five got about $400,000, and even Bill Heffernan did not know about it—and he was up there on the Central Coast of New South Wales looking at all these rorts going on. The Liberal Party is continuing the rorts. The Greens made a deal with them, and they say they stand up against rorts but what did they do? Absolutely nothing. They did nothing. Again they rolled over.




Senator Rhiannon:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: for consistency, could Senator Cameron tell us about the rorts—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Rhiannon, that is a debating point.




Senator Rhiannon:
  There were the appearances—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Rhiannon, do not dissent from the chair. Resume your seat. That is a debating point.




Senator CAMERON:
  So the Greens have been arguing about backroom deals, and they did the backroom deal— and they got nothing out of it. They are the worst negotiators that have ever appeared in this Senate. They are pathetic, they are hypocrites, they stand here talking about democracy but when they had a chance to do something about electoral rorts they did not do it. The Libs are off the hook and the Greens have rolled over again. Absolutely pathetic. (Time expired)

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-02-23,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:52):  Many Australians feel the major parties do not represent them. Their elected representatives often have good intentions at the outset, but the constraints imposed by their parties soon kick in. They end up defending the status quo, talking in generalities and platitudes, and seeking at all turns not to offend a soul. So one-quarter of Australian voters cast their vote in the Senate for minor parties—parties other than the coalition, Labor and the Greens. That is more than three million Australians. Their votes only led to 11 per cent of Senate seats going to minor parties, but at least there are voices in the Senate raising issues of concern to them. They get a conservative senator like Bob Day, a small-government senator like me and an everyday, decent man like John Madigan. The intended change to Senate voting will smother these voices. People who vote for minor parties will see their votes exhaust. They will have no say in the make-up of the Senate and they will be effectively disenfranchised.


The Greens support this because it will remove competitors and deliver them the balance of power. I do not understand why the coalition support it—perhaps because it will wipe out any alternative voices for smaller government, like the Liberal Democrats, and any alternative voices for conservative values, like Family First. We regularly point out how the Liberals and Nationals are addicted to big spending and high taxing. Perhaps they think they are securing their base, and empowering the Greens is a price they are willing to pay. Perhaps they do not really mind if government spending and taxation rise and for Australia to slowly turn into Greece, as long as they are in government while it happens.


What we know is that Malcolm Turnbull dabbled with joining the Labor Party in the past. Perhaps he really is the Manchurian candidate for the Greens. Should we be surprised if a member for Wentworth hands the balance of power to the Greens? But what is surprising is that the small-government and conservative elements in the Liberal and National parties have not woken up to what is going on.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:54):  I rise to support the resolution because, frankly, I have been shocked that the Greens have done another dirty deal to support the Liberal government. That is exactly what they have done. They have decided that 10 green bums on seats in the Senate is more important than any principle. It is more important than the principle of donation reform; it is more important that the principle of ensuring that we have a fair voting system—because that is what you have all done. You have been led by a senator who is in absolute panic that they will not be able to get a quota in their own rights in the upcoming Senate election in New South Wales. They stared at the last New South Wales election and no green was elected. So we have to change the system to make sure that that person can get elected in New South Wales.


This is a deal, as Senator Leyonhjelm has stated, that is going to effectively exclude 3.2 or 3.3 million Australian voters—25 per cent of Australian voters—who do not want to vote for Labor, the coalition, the Greens or the Xenophon party. Everybody who does not want to vote for them will not count anymore. Let us be very clear about this: the government and the Greens have stated they want to wipe out the crossbenchers. That is the stated purpose of the bill. It has no other purpose. Who will come in and replace them? We know it is not going to be any of the minor parties. It is not going to be a new Nick Xenophon, who started off getting two per cent of the votes when he first ran for parliament, because he is locked out. He has turned the key, slammed the door and pulled up the ladder—no new Nick Xenophons can ever emerge. I do not have to agree with Family First, but they have a right to be part of the process. I have worked with Family First in Victoria through Senator Fielding. He voted against me more than he ever voted for me, but, let me tell you, they built their way up.


Now you want to slam the door and ensure that nobody else can get up but a member of the Labor Party, the coalition or the Greens. That is what you have done. When you wipe out those minor parties, you will be replacing them with the three, and the Xenophon party will be there as well. That is why Senator Xenophon is in it. I watched Senator Xenophon on TV throwing his tantrum—'I got 1.7 quotas; I should've got two.' Here is a hint: you get two when you get two quotas. If every other minor party in South Australia said, 'We don't want to give preferences to Senator Xenophon to elect a second Xenophon candidate,' that is how the ball rolls. If you cannot get the preferences, tough. He says, 'I got 1.7 and I deserve to get two because I got so close'—what a pathetic little tantrum and what revenge he is taking on everybody by supporting this deal.


So the Greens have 10 bums on seats locked in. That is what this deal does—10 green bums on seats are absolutely locked in as a part of this deal, because that is what you will get. Your reward will be to lock your jobs in. Everybody else in the country who is not part of a major party gets locked out, but you get locked in. You have closed the door and you are on the inside. You have given up all principle here.


If you really cared about electoral reform in this country, this deal would include electoral donation reform. The government were desperate for this deal. You had them over a barrel again and you rolled over. You could have said, 'We will only vote for this package if we get meaningful donation reform in this country.' So you had a choice: pursue your principles or pursue bums on seats. And we all know what you have done. You know what you have done. You have taken bums on seats over principles. I do not want to hear any more lectures from any of the Greens saying, 'We're principled and you're unprincipled. We're a political movement; you're just a filthy political party.' Let me be very clear about this: you are now a filthy political party. You have advanced yourselves at the expense of everybody else in this chamber.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  There are your new friends! Get used to them. You will be cuddling up to them more and more often. This was a time for you to fight for your principles or fight for your seats, and you sold out your principles. You sold out your principles on a whole range of things that you have campaigned for and that we have campaigned for. 


But what is worse than just selling out your principles is that you are putting in place a system that will probably lead, over time, to the Liberals having 38 senators permanently. Once Nick Xenophon retires—once the Xenophon party disintegrates after the departure of Nick Xenophon—the Liberals will regain their missing votes and become 38, and then not one policy, not one principle, that you believe in will ever again pass this chamber. You will have delivered that to those opposite. You are propping up the Liberal coalition government. You are giving them an opportunity to make their health cuts, education cuts and GST changes. All of that is what you are risking through this filthy deal just to make sure you can all keep your own bums on the seats in that corner. That is what has happened here. (Time expired)

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",GLT,2016-02-23,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (17:01):  The Senate is the final stop for the consideration and debate of bills which impact on the people of Australia. As a senator for Queensland I consider every bill on the basis of whether it will benefit the people of Queensland, and if it does not I will not support it. If it does but it needs improvement, I will amend it. In my time in this house, I have acted with honesty and diligence, I have done the hard yards for the people of Queensland and, despite the threats of a double dissolution by Malcolm Turnbull, I will not change my approach. The people of Australia come first, not multinational mining companies, not the Chinese government, not the big end of town—the people of Australia. If the Turnbull government wants to get bills through the Senate, my advice to Malcolm and his colleagues is: start writing better bills. Start writing better bills which benefit the people of Australia, not the rest of the world. 


Yes, I agree voting needs to be reformed, but the dirty deal done by the coalition and the Greens delivers extreme reform which will wipe out any chance of everyday Australians being able to enter politics through the Senate in the future. That is not what I call a democratic process. This delivers a system whereby only the rich will be able to enter politics, by buying their way in through advertising and publicity. Malcolm Turnbull wants to turn Australia into America.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator LAZARUS:
  I see the bully in the pack there at the back. Wucka wocka wacka! Malcolm Turnbull wants to turn Australia into America. Heaven forbid. He wants to deregulate higher education, he wants to privatise Medicare and now he wants to limit access to politics to the wealthy. Everyday Australians are going to miss out because of this dirty deal. 


Once the new voting reforms have been rammed through the Senate, the Turnbull government will go to an early election, through a double dissolution, because they are scared that, if they wait, they may lose too many seats due to their waning popularity.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:03):  I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance proposed by Family First senator Bob Day, who suggested the topic of discussion be 'the rushed changes to voting laws that will extinguish Senate diversity.' 


This rushed change to our voting laws is a distraction from the important business of this place. This change is not being driven by the people of Australia. In the time I have been a Tasmanian senator, I have not had one person, not one, come into my office and ask for a change to the Senate voting system. They wanted positive changes and improvements to health, education, social services, veterans' conditions and diggers' pay, and they wanted jobs. It is self-interest which is motivating the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens. We should be discussing the government's plan to make $650 million worth of cuts to Medicare bulk-billing and all the women's lives that will be endangered by these cuts. That is the issue that everyone who contacts my office is concerned about today, not Senate voting reform.


Just as this Senate voting change has been done by a dirty backroom deal between the Liberals, Greens and Nationals, it is clear that the Liberals, Greens and Nationals will be doing preference deals at the next federal election. A vote for the Liberals and the Nationals will be a vote for the Greens, and a vote for the Greens will be a vote for the Liberals and the Nationals. Who would ever have thought that the political married bliss of the Liberals and Nationals would be disrupted by the Greens climbing into their electoral bed and sneaking under the sheets! Just when Barnaby Joyce thinks he will be Deputy Prime Minister when the Libs win the next election, he finds out that he has competition from the Greens leader. Poor old Barnaby will not know where to sleep—in the middle, on the top or on the bottom! I guess Barnaby will sleep wherever Richard tells him to sleep from here on in! 


One of the reasons that the government gives to justify the rushed decision to change Senate voting is the alleged chaos in this chamber. They whine that we stopped $30 billion of government savings. Let us get a few things clear right now. It is not $30 billion of government savings that I have proudly stopped. It was $30 billion of theft by the Liberal-National Party from poor and struggling Australian workers, pensioners and families.


Parliamentary Library research shown to me proves that the total value of cuts in 63 bills presented by the government to this Senate was $62 billion. Of that $62 billion, $30 billion was blocked, as it took money away from poor Australians and struggling families and pensioners. After consultation with crossbench senators, $32 billion of sensible government savings were passed. Of those 63 government bills presented, 73 per cent passed this Senate and 23 per cent were stopped.


This diverse Senate has protected the Tasmanian people from the horrors of the Liberal-National budgets. The people of Tasmania can be protected from the worst excesses of the major parties and get more by voting for the JLN Senate candidates— (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I rise to speak on the Australian government's response to the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee report, Regional telecommunications review 2015.


My office, which is based in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, receives calls—as many senators' offices do—from not only New South Wales but around the country, complaining about problems with telecommunications and, specifically, the lack of a decent NBN system around the country. Many people are appalled. The promises that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made about how the mixed technology would suddenly deliver all these great things on telecommunications for people around the country have not materialised. None of that has materialised—none of it.


In my local area—the lower Blue Mountains—people are being told that a 1.5-megabit uptake is okay. That is almost dial-up. It is just a bit better than dial-up, and they are being told that that is acceptable. They are having to pay $40, $50, $60 a month to get a miserable 1.5 megabits. This is pathetic! Prior to the election, over three years ago, we were told by the Prime Minister that the NBN would be rolled out and everyone would have access to good telecommunications. Yet what has happened? Telecommunications is still an absolute disgrace. The government is going for a system that is based on old technology. It is going for a system that is based on corroding copper.


I had a problem with my own ADSL2 connection at home. They checked it over the phone, as they do. They tried to make adjustments over the phone, remotely. They said, 'No, there's a problem; we'll come out.' They opened the pit. The pit was absolutely full of water. The connections were being kept together by cling wrap and tape, to try and keep them from corroding even further. This is a system that is not fit for purpose for a modern country trying to deal with modern technology.


The current Prime Minister has conned the Australian public, because the system that he is proposing is a second-rate system that will not deliver. It is a system that he said would be in place by now at a reasonable cost to the public. Well, the cost has blown out. We still have a poor system. We still have a system that you cannot operate. We are talking about putting in a second city airport at Badgerys Creek and how it will create all these business opportunities. Well, it will not create home business opportunities in the Blue Mountains, because you cannot run a business with no decent internet connection.


This government has been an abject failure in a whole range of areas. Its first budget epitomised what this government is about. It is about austerity. It is about austerity policies that harm working-class people in this country. When working-class people want to try and get on a bit and run a small business from their own home, they cannot do it because the technology is so bad and the promises that the Prime Minister made have not been delivered.


This is another failure from this government. It is another failure from a Prime Minister who the public are seeing day after day as being totally incapable of running the country and making a decision. All he knew was that he wanted to get into the Lodge and he was going to do whatever he could to get into the Lodge. This is a government that cannot deliver for working- and middle-class families in this country. This is a government that promised much on telecommunications and has delivered nothing.

Senator CAMERON:
  The doormat, Senator O'Sullivan, from the National Party has piped up. You should be ashamed of yourself!

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:12):  I always love hearing Senator Cameron ranting and raving on, because I was one of the ones who sat here for six years and watched the most dysfunctional government that this country has ever seen—six years of Labor. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was supported by the Greens political party in all those six years. Now we hear Senator Cameron lecturing us about good governance!


In taking note of this document, which is the Australian government's response to the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee's report, Regional telecommunications review 2015, can I say, again, that I can only be amused at Senator Cameron's defence of his colleague Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy wrote out the policy for the NBN on the back of a beer coaster in a VIP plane, travelling, I think, somewhere between Cairns and Sydney. This was the Labor Party's famous NBN proposal. If you looked at the proposal that Senator Conroy put forward—and I did: I sat on many a committee trying to help Senator Conroy make something out of it—you would realise that the policy had no thought, nothing for Australians, in particular, and certainly nothing for regional Australians.


By contrast, Mr Turnbull, when he was the communications minister, tried to fix Senator Conroy's NBN mess, and he did a great job in doing that. Senator Fifield, as the minister, is getting the NBN doing what is needed by Australia. 


I draw the Senate's attention to the work we have done in rural and regional Australia in telecommunications. In particular, I am very, very pleased to highlight an announcement made by the government only a couple of weeks ago where money was provided to the Burke Shire Council way up there in the corner of north-west Queensland. The coalition government provided millions of dollars to build a fibre-optic cable between Doomadgee, an Aboriginal community up in the north-west, and the town of Burketown. That will make such a difference to everybody in that particular locality. 


The new satellite is about to come on stream. The NBN is being rolled out in a sensible way and is achieving things for regional Australia. To have to sit here and listen to a lecture from Senator Conroy's colleague on the NBN is just ludicrous. I was not going to participate in this debate, but as soon as I see Senator Cameron get to his feet, I think: 'This will be good entertainment; it will be good humour.' There will not be a skerrick of truth in it, but it is always good to come along for a laugh. Occasionally, we need laughs in this joint. When Senator Cameron speaks, you are always sure to have a good laugh. What Labor did with the NBN in telecommunications in Sydney sort of stopped at parliament house—that is about as far as Labor was concerned. 


The coalition government has made real advances in telecommunications, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia—parts of Australia that the Labor Party do not even know exist. I do not think they have a member anywhere in rural and remote Australia. They used to have a senator up in the north of Australia in Senator McLucas, but she has been done over by the factional bosses in the Labor Party and has been replaced by a male candidate, a union hack, from Brisbane. I cannot think of anyone from Labor in the north of Australia these days. It just shows the Labor Party's interest in the north and in regional, rural and remote Australia. 


Congratulations to Malcolm Turnbull when he was the communications minister. Congratulations to Senator Fifield. Now it is double congratulations because not only are they making things work but they had to pick up the pieces from the Labor Party and turn it into something sensible. I am pleased to say they have done it, and they deserve the Senate's congratulations.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2016 AUTUMN SITTINGS





OFFSHORE PETROLEUM AND GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE AMENDMENT BILL





Purpose of the Bill



Amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGS Act) are required to clarify the status of certain petroleum titles under the Act.




Reasons for Urgency



The bill is urgently required to resolve uncertainty as to the status of certain petroleum titles purported to be renewed or extended by Joint Authorities under the OPGGS Act without all required approvals in place. This uncertainty as to the status of the titles has potential associated risks to titleholders' investments.




STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2016 AUTUMN SITTINGS





TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS RESTRUCTURE ROLL-OVER) BILL





Purpose of the Bill



This bill will allow small businesses to change their entity structure without incurring a capital gains tax liability at that time.




Reasons for Urgency



As this measure is to commence on 1 July 2016, introduction and passage of the bill during the 2016 Autumn sittings is required to give taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office sufficient time to put in place systems and processes to allow for the efficient administration of the tax system and a smooth roll-out of Tax Time 2016.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:44):  I move:


That Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area – Ceduna and Surrounding Region) Determination 2015 be disallowed.


The determination I am seeking to disallow is the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—Ceduna and Surrounding Region) Determination. This is the measure that puts in place the cashless debit card or, as it is probably more commonly known, the cashless welfare card in Ceduna. This is a measure that I and the Greens opposed when the legislation was introduced and debated and we opposed it largely for the same reasons that we oppose income management—income management is a poor policy and it has failed in its stated objectives. We opposed the cashless welfare card from the introduction of the bill that established the operation of the welfare card and set up the provisions for the trials. We opposed it through multiple rounds of estimates where I asked questions about it and now it is regulation. I am trying to disallow it because we do not think this is good public policy.


We want good policies that genuinely help people. We do not support harsh and ineffective policies that do not help people and that, in fact, can harm people. The fundamental ideology that underlies this policy is flawed. It is a belief that strict, harsh control measures by government can solve deep rooted social issues, social problems and substance abuse problems. It is harmful, it is paternalistic and it will not address the issues.


As Nicholas Rothwell wrote on Saturday in The Australian, the approach:


… embodies the hope that direct control over spending patterns can change the behaviour and the attitudes of families and entire communities: that the mind can be modified by a rein on the purse.


I believe that the approach of believing that you can influence the mind, that it can be modified by a rein on the purse is fundamentally mistaken. The Northern Territory intervention has shown this. Some problems cannot be solved by supposedly simple approaches that are strict and that put in place harsh controls. For a start, people will find a way around those harsh controls.


When I look at the evaluation of the Northern Territory intervention, it has had detrimental impacts. Some problems require care and support for people who are in fact vulnerable. They require the addressing of the underlying causes of disadvantage and of substance abuse. We need a multifaceted approach that deals with a multifaceted problem. We have consistently seen that this policy of income management does not work and there have been numerous assessments that show this, particularly for compulsory income management. This is not a new innovative approach; it is a continuation, another form of income management, and, as is often said, income management on steroids. It is a failed approach and has been shown not to work.



I would now like to quote from a very useful report entitled Evaluating New Income Management in the Northern Territory: Final Evaluation Report. I suspect that many people today who will be voting on this motion will not have read that report. For those of you who have read the report, what the heck are you doing supporting this approach and not supporting the disallowance of this determination?


The final NT evaluation said:




A substantial group of people subject to income management felt that income management is unfair, embarrassing and


discriminatory.



The evaluation could not find any substantive evidence of the program having significant changes relative to its key policy objectives, including changing people’s behaviours.


There was no evidence of changes in spending patterns, including food and alcohol sales, other than a slight possible improvement in the incidence of running out of money for food by those on Voluntary Income Management, but no change for those on compulsory income management. The data show that spending on BasicsCard on fruit and vegetables is very low.



There was no evidence of any overall improvement in financial wellbeing, including reductions in financial harassment or improved financial management skills.


More general measures of wellbeing at the community level show no evidence of improvement, including for children.


… … …


The evaluation found that, rather than building capacity and independence, for many the program has acted to make people more dependent on welfare.


… … …


The evaluation data does not provide evidence of income management having improve the outcomes that it was intended to have an impact upon.


They are the findings of the evaluation of income management in the Northern Territory—failed on virtually every count. Yet he we have a government, and I predict an opposition, that are going to vote down my motion to disallow what is a failed approach. There is still time for the opposition to change their minds. I am not confident the government are going to. This is a very important point: this is failed measure. We have had this evidence for nearly two years yet somehow the government still want to proceed with this flawed approach—let's just amp it up a little more; keep amping it up instead of looking at the evidence. The government already know this approach does not work but they still keep pushing ahead.


I had someone ask: why don't you trial this? We have had a trial since 2007. That is more than a trial, folks. That is why we should not be having this trial, because it is just a continuation of a failed approach. It is a dead end. Nicholas Rothwell, in his article on income management, said:


When income management was first introduced in the Northern Territory in 2007, it was seen by the Howard government as a stopgap measure, a 'short, sharp shock', a way-stage en route to further economic reform rather than the long-term destination it has become.


What we are debating here is the long-term destination of continuing income management. He we are years later and income management is a dead end that hurts Aboriginal people and communities.


The idea that this policy is a trial is a sham for a number of reasons. To have a trial, you have to have comparison sites. There is no comparison site. This lies at the heart of whether it is really a trial, to look at whether it would work compared to other policies, or it is just an attempt by the coalition to push their ideology.


The coalition, thank goodness, is providing an additional $1 million in services to the communities in the area affected by the trial. I, for one, welcome any additional funding that provides good quality services. But, a year from now, when they are measuring some of these outcomes, we will not know whether it is those services or the cashless welfare card that have led to any changes that are found. In her submission and evidence to the Senate inquiry into the bill, academic Eva Cox put it well when she said:


This agreement for including services locally creates serious issues for the trial’s claimed intentions. How can any form of research determine whether any improvements that may occur over 12 months are the result of the card or of the services, or a mix of both?


…   …   …


How do you separate the card’s effects from the benefits from the services?


I have been asking about this and trying to find out where the comparison sites will be. People may recall that when we were debating this bill in the chamber I asked a lot of questions. I did not get a lot of answers, but I asked a lot of questions. I asked the minister about this particular issue, and I would like to go through his response at the time. Minister Fifield, who was the minister dealing with this bill in the chamber, said:


I guess there are two broad elements to an evaluation. One is comparing the circumstances in the given community, looking at what the baseline was and how things have improved or otherwise. The other is comparing a trial site to a similar community, and that will be part of the trial. There are other communities that would be receiving some equivalent forms of community support and that is what the evaluation will look at.


Let's skip forward from the debate that we had on that last year, when the bill went through, and go to Senate estimates from the week before last. When I asked, in Senate estimates, about this issue and where the other comparison site was going to be, the departmental officials told me they wanted an effective baseline both in the trial communities and in comparable communities that do not have the services and will not be having the services in place. What is the point of that? You are not comparing like with like. You are not separating out the effect the cashless welfare card will have.


So the government is welshing, before the trial even starts, on their commitment to have a proper evaluation, a proper comparison, and makes a mockery of calling this process a trial. It is not a fair trial. It is not a trial. It cannot prove that the cashless welfare card works for people struggling with issues of substance abuse, alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling. I do not want anybody to mistake the fact that the Greens are absolutely supportive of addressing alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling. We absolutely and fundamentally agree that it needs addressing. We fundamentally disagree with the approach that this government consistently takes and has been proven not to work. We still, in the Northern Territory, have significant drug and alcohol problems, and gambling problems.


Regardless of the outcome, members of the government have already been talking about the rollout of the cashless welfare card or the cashless debit card—whatever you choose to call it—across regional Australia. We already know from the report that Andrew Forrest did that he was advocating rolling out the cashless welfare card, 100 per cent, across all of Australia. It appears that it does not matter to the coalition that it works, and it is obvious from their response to the Northern Territory evaluation that they do not actually look at the evidence. They do not care whether it has worked or not. The evidence conflicts with their ideology, so why would they change their ideology? You have to limit these tough approaches that do not work. This is not a trial.


The coalition is targeting communities with very high numbers of Aboriginal people. We are very clear about that. The only two communities that have signed up at the moment are, largely, Aboriginal communities. I understand from media reports that Laverton has now said no to the card, joining Halls Creek saying no to the card, and I understand from estimates that the government is trying to convince Geraldton to have a go. I urge people in Geraldton to look at the evidence about this. It does not work. Do not condemn yourselves and your community to being another so-called trial site for this failed ideological approach. This policy has been criticised by Aboriginal leaders and Aboriginal community members. Not everybody supports this trial. I will get to the issues about consultation later.


Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, has written about this in both his 2014 and his 2015 report. He also wrote in The Australian that the welfare card is not the solution to alcohol abuse. He said:


Any possible benefit of the card must be weighed against the sense of disempowerment our people already face. It must be weighed against the stigma our people continue to face, and the restrictions placed on our basic rights and freedoms we fought so hard for.


He went on to say:


The hardest part of this proposal to accept is that yet again the treatment of our people will be different to mainstream Australia, and it is this differentiation of treatment that we have fought so hard to bring into the open.


As I said, the Shire of Halls Creek in my home state of Western Australia has decided to reject this card and this approach. They did that because their Aboriginal Advisory Committee voted against the card. The shire president said:


We've got an Aboriginal advisory committee. If we're not going to take any notice of them, then why do we have them?


Importantly, before the trial has rolled out, there have been many problems with the consultation. I know there are ongoing issues in Ceduna, because I am getting lots of emails and communication from community members. I understand that some signatories to the memorandum of understanding in Ceduna have very strong concerns about the manner in which the card is being implemented. In fact, they say it was not their understanding that it was going to be rolled out to everybody. I understand that one of the original signatories to the MOU wants to see elements of the MOU dissolved. I understand that is an ongoing discussion.


As well as this fundamentally flawed approach to the card, I have been asking a series of questions in this chamber and in estimates for months about the operation of this card. In the last round of estimates, we found out that it looks like some sort of loophole is already being built into the card, where people can transfer over $1,000 to somebody else's account, particularly if they are out of town and loose their card. The government did not volunteer this information. It came out when I was asking about what happens with a lost card. I would have thought there were some ongoing issues with that if the government says this is all about stopping people being able to access cash to buy grog.


I have been through in this place many times the impact that this card will have on vulnerable community members, but I want to go through some of the specific points in relation to the card in the time I have remaining. There are ongoing questions around what will happen in terms of merchant charges and what is happening with the status of the community body. I have spent some time trying to find out online about the community panel. This is the panel that you go to to ask to get the 80 per cent restriction on being able to access cash—in other words, you are going to get 20 per cent—down to 50 per cent.


I have not been able to find that online, but I am going to quote from a letter that I have just been sent about this card and that raises some questions about this card. The letter is from Mr Simon Schrapel, who is the Chief Executive of Uniting Communities. He has written this letter, which has gone to the minister, and I have been given a copy. He has cced it to me. He has written it on behalf of the 'keep income management accountable network'. One of the issues that he raises in the letter to the minister is the appointment and funding of the community panel. He says: 'Appointments to the community panel are a matter of ministerial discretion, but for the first trial site in Ceduna it is anticipated to include the local mayor and/or the council chief executive, among other local residents. We have raised concerns with departmental staff about these arrangements, including the disclosure of highly personal information to others living in a small community'—a small community, I might add, that is quite divided over this card. These are my words now; I am not quoting Mr Schrapel. This raises very serious concerns about the release of information. It also goes to the issue of privacy rights, which Mr Schrapel also addresses in the letter to the minister.


But there are other fundamental issues around the terms and conditions of the Indue accounts and the cashless welfare card. Indue is the financial institution—and I am being careful to say 'financial institution' because it is not a bank—but there are questions unanswered. They are implementing this on 15 March, folks. The department could not answer in estimates the week before last about very important issues around some of these financial arrangements, such as whether they are signing up to the ePayments Code and the Code of Banking Practice, and other issues. To date, they have not been able to provide the relevant terms and conditions under which the card will be operating.


The letter says: 'There are now only four weeks until the first trial is due to commence, and the documents are not available. We have been informed that they are commercial-in-confidence. The terms of reference do not, in our view, play a significant role in negotiations between the government and Indue but are critical in defining the relationship between the participant consumers and the financial service provider the government has mandated.' This is particularly important because the people who are subject to this measure do not get a say on which financial institution will be handling their money, but they are not being given some of the most basic understandings about how this is going to work.


We still do not have the resolution of who is going to pay the merchant charges that people will be required to pay when they are using this card. We confirmed in estimates that—contrary to what the government said in the chamber in the debate on this legislation, which is that they were working with the merchants in Ceduna that have merchant charges to see if they can get them waived—they have failed. They told us in estimates that that has failed. They have no answer for the issue for those merchants outside the trial areas. They are not negotiating with them. They cannot, because it is just too big an issue, so people will have to be paying merchant charges.


I repeat again: every dollar counts when you are trying to survive on income support, particularly when the government is making it even harder for you to manage your money under this card. That is unacceptable. This card will not work. It disproportionately impacts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is discriminatory in that respect. I believe it breaches their human rights. This is a failed experiment that started in 2007, and it should be put to bed. I urge the Senate to support this disallowance.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:04):  Labor will not be supporting the disallowance of the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—Ceduna and Surrounding Region) Determination 2015. As we said when we had the debate earlier this year about the original plan around the Ceduna trials, we are concentrating on looking at how we could work effectively with community to respond to very serious questions. Having said that, I agree with Senator Siewert on a lot of the content that she put into her contribution. We continue to ask the questions at Senate estimates, and consistently at every opportunity we can get, to try to work out exactly how we can best respond to serious issues in community.


The major reason that Labor are supporting the Ceduna trial and not accepting the disallowance this afternoon is that we believe that there has been significant acceptance and even passionate support in elements of the Ceduna community of having this intervention. I use the term, and I know it has a lot of history around it, but this trial—and it is a trial—in Ceduna is an intervention into a community which has openly cried out for support and for help. In terms of the process, we believe that the trial must be evaluated as strongly and as openly as it possibly can be. But, in terms of the way it operates, one of the really solid aspects is that the trial has support by local, state and federal governments.


No-one can claim anywhere that any process has 100 per cent support. In fact, one of the things that worried me most about the evidence we had in the community affairs committee about the Ceduna program was, I think, an overstatement by some people about the degree of support that they had in their community. I think that is one of the elements that Senator Siewert has pointed out in her contribution: when something is being changed or something new is brought into a community, it is really important to ensure that you listen to all the concerns raised and you actually put out as much information as you possibly can. I do note that the department and also Minister Tudge have worked very hard in this process to provide a large amount of information to the community, but it must be understood that there will always be people who will not be happy. There can be no way that you can have 100 per cent of support in any area, and to claim that you do actually underestimates the role and the range of opinion in a community. Having said that, we are actually heartened by the degree of support that has been raised by a number of the Aboriginal communities in the area surrounding Ceduna and the local government area of Ceduna. The mayor has been a very strong supporter of this program and has, in fact, begged that Ceduna be put in the trial.


Also we have information from the state government that, whilst there was a memorandum of understanding signed at the time we had the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, there was little indication about exactly what would be the engagement of the state government in the process. We understand there has been significant discussion subsequently and there is now very positive engagement from the state government about what they can put into the area.


Again, Senator Siewert, I totally agree with your comments about it being a multifaceted problem that demands a multifaceted response. That is one of the reasons that we are showing support for this trial in Ceduna. One of the core elements we raised during the original discussion was the fact that there is no single element that can make change in a community. Originally you need to have the full engagement of the community—and Ceduna has made statements that it wants to be part of this process—and, secondly, you need to have effective wraparound services so people using the card have within their community the necessary services to address their needs around drug and alcohol, gambling and building effective communities and families in their area. 


Mr Tudge has forwarded a copy of all of the support services that have now been promised to the Ceduna community for the period of this trial. We believe any evaluation must take into account the effectiveness of the whole program: the use of the debit card and the wraparound services that have been injected into the community. Senator Siewert is absolutely right—any evaluation must not fail to look at the full responses in the area and must ensure that any outcomes are listed and evaluated against how the community has worked together using all the services that have been provided.


It always worries me when we talk about a trial that it will be compared to another community. The injection of support in Ceduna for the time of the trial should not be at the expense of other communities that would not be receiving similar services. If you have identified in your community, as Ceduna has done, serious crises around drug addiction and violence, you should be able to expect governments to make responses that will be able to work effectively with you to make sure you can mend your community and ensure your citizens are safe and healthy. While Senator Siewert pointed out the issue with trying to make a comparison, I am personally not as convinced around that element. In fact, I do not want to see another community that has an identified crisis being starved of resources to make some kind of effective comparison.


I think we have the ability and experience in our government departments—state, federal and local—to look effectively and with transparency at exactly what is working in our community and what is not. Any trial that sets off without having that commitment and that structure will not succeed. In terms of our support for the trial, we want to see exactly what the monitoring process is going to be. The details of that have not been released yet. We will continue to ask questions about how the community of Ceduna is being supported. The citizens of Ceduna have had a great deal of suffering. It was identified at our committee inquiry that this community have had suffering. They were able to identify at the committee hearing the loss that has been suffered in their community in terms of violence, suicide and the horrors of drug and alcohol addiction and that has led to their request to be part of the trial.


We believe this is a trial that is for this process. We do not think and have never accepted that there should be a blanket approach to any form of community work or the way welfare payments are done. Just because something works in Ceduna should not mean that you have an identical thing rolled out across every community. One of the attractions of this process is that the whole process is being linked to the community itself so they can shape and make this trial work as best suits them. They are not going to be directed from outside as to what should happen. They will be able to identify what works best for their own community and also what does not work.


Senator Siewert also raised some concerns about the information we do not have. Detail needs to be known about the way the debit card will operate, the terms and conditions of the relationship between the financial institution and the people themselves, and how the account will work. At the recent Senate estimates committee there was not that form of detail available for people to see. With the trial due to commence next month, we hope that that information will be shared as quickly as possible so that the trial will be able to work as quickly as possible. 


We understand that these things take time to implement and we understand that there will be things that have to be worked out, as there will be things that will work and things that will not work, but we expect that the core elements of the way the Indue organisation will operate, the rights and conditions around using their services and how this card will operate would be available now if this trial is going to start in the first or second week of March. People will have their welfare payments transferred into that process and that needs to be fully in place so people can have confidence that they will not be without the money they need to have to exist. As we all know, people who are reliant on welfare payments do not have large reserves of cash. So, if they do not have income coming in, they will not be able to support either themselves or their families. That was the kind of information that we were told when we had our inquiry last year would be in place in good time before the trial commenced, so I would really like to get more information from the department or from the minister about how well advanced and how completely effective those financial arrangements are now with the way the actual card will work.


Labor will be watching and ensuring that the monitoring of the process will be done, including people in this place who are deeply interested in how this will operate. We do not want to have issues and concerns raised after the event; we want to know how the monitoring is going to operate. If people are concerned, we do not want their voices silenced. We know that, when people are worried or fearful, sometimes it is very easy to increase that fear and to raise issues now that possibly people had thought had been fully discussed earlier. So in many ways it is going to be the responsibility of the department to ensure that that communication is maintained effectively in the local community. If people are genuinely disgruntled, their voices should be heard so that they will not feel as though they have been forgotten by the people who should most be looking after their welfare.


I know that the concerns are in the community, and that has been made clear through emails that people have received. There have also been concerns raised by people whom I deeply respect—people like Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. I take his comments about the disempowerment of people very seriously, and that is something that I know the department will be considering.


We know that people who live on very reduced incomes such as welfare payments work very effectively with the money they have, so their worth and their ability to budget and run their own lives should not be in question. What we are seeing, and what we have been told that this trial is focused on, is a community which has been ravaged by the impact of alcohol and drugs, so we think that there has been a need identified. We think that there has been consultation with community. We were reassured only last week of the fact that some of the major Aboriginal and Islander communities in the region are fully committed to ensuring that they give the trial a chance. We think that now it is up to us as a parliament to ensure that, through the process of this trial, there will not be secrecy or isolation and people's views will be heard. So, in this sense, we are not supporting the disallowance, and we look forward to seeing how this trial operates and whether there is an effective intervention to stop the ravages in this community.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:17):  Obviously we do not support the disallowance motion that has been put forward by Senator Siewert. The Senate passed this legislation to trial a cashless debit card for Centrelink recipients in communities that have significant—and I underline the word 'significant'—alcohol, drug and/or gambling problems. The locations have been chosen on the basis of the openness of the community to participate in the program, where the community wishes to actively address the welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug and gambling abuse that exists within the community.


In my home state of South Australia, Ceduna has been selected as the first community, and can I state that there is overwhelming support by the entire community for this trial to take place in that town. Ceduna is only a little town; it has about 4,500 people. I have spent a lot of time in Ceduna, and I have spent a lot of time in the communities, going out to places like 18 Tank. I am sure that many of the people who have made a contribution to this debate have never been out to 18 Tank to see the kind of devastation that is created in a community by, particularly, the alcohol impacts on that community.


The community leaders in Ceduna actually approached the government to explore the idea of this cashless debit card, and they are absolutely supporting the introduction of it. The community sees this in a very positive way, as an opportunity to try to overcome some of the problems that the community currently suffers. There are some horrific statistics just on that one community alone. In a community of, as I said, only about 4,500 people, in 2013-14, for example, they had in excess of 4,600 admissions into the sobering-up centre. When you consider the size of the community, that is pretty horrendous. Hospitalisations due to assault were 68 times the national average. So, as you can see, the community had every right to be concerned, and I think that we as a government have a responsibility to respond to the request by that community for help, because you can see the problem is extraordinarily significant.


The disallowance motion is basically seeking to overturn a decision of the Senate, which passed this legislation overwhelmingly, with the support of seven of the crossbenchers as well as the ALP—and I am delighted that the ALP, the opposition, are prepared to stick with this particular program. Obviously they understand the importance not just to the Ceduna community but to many other communities around Australia where alcohol, drug and gambling abuse is having a significant impact on the members of those communities. Senator Siewert's disallowance motion also ignores the calls from the community to try to get on top of this issue, which is really disappointing. It seems really quite ironic that somebody who purports to be supporting and looking after the interests of the community is actually in this place seeking to disallow an instrument that the communities have asked for themselves.


Obviously the government is vehemently opposed to this particular disallowance motion, because we believe it not only robs the Ceduna community of the opportunity to try out a new idea to try to address an issue that is really significant in that community but also denies the opportunity for other communities to be able to benefit from the trial that is run in this community and the trials that, I understand, are to be rolled out in Wyndham and Kununurra in the East Kimberley, subject to the outcome of this trial in Ceduna. I am really proud to be part of a government that is actively supporting a community in my state—a community that is crying out in need.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:21):  I do not think there are any other speakers, so I will make a final contribution and wrap up this debate. I am extremely disappointed that the opposition are not taking up the opportunity provided by this debate to re-evaluate their approach to this so-called trial. The reason I am bringing this back is that I am using the parliamentary process that is put in place for delegated legislation to enable us to consider the fine detail of regulation under acts of parliament. The government are, in fact, using more and more delegated instruments. If I were them, I would be a little bit careful about having a go at senators who use the parliamentary process to look at the regulations that the government are relying on to implement large swathes of their acts. This process is there for us to look at the checks and balances of legislation and the implementation of legislation. It is so important because there are so many unanswered questions about this process that the government have still not been able to answer. As I said during my first contribution, as late as the week before last the government still could not answer the questions I was asking in Senate estimates, and yet this so-called trial is due to start on 15 March.


In her contribution, the minister said that we are not prepared to try a new idea. It is not a new idea. That is the fundamental problem. Income management is a failed experiment. I went through the final evaluation from the Northern Territory intervention, which confirmed many of the preliminary findings. There is no substantive evidence that the program has had significant changes relative to the key policy objectives, including changing people's behaviour. There were a whole lot of other objectives. There has not been an overall improvement in financial wellbeing, as you heard from the contribution before. So it is not a new idea; let's put that to bed. It is not a trial because we are not comparing like with like. I point out that, in the Northern Territory intervention, there were a lot of services provided, but they were provided in a top-down, paternalistic approach; they were not working with the community. There were many other problems, including things that we know from debating the Closing the Gap statement in this place last night. We know that many of the measures have not worked because of the flawed nature of those measures. It is not a new idea that providing services, if they are quality services, works as well. Even then, in the NT, where there were some limited services, we have not seen significant improvements.


It is not a trial. There are many ongoing issues. It is not a new idea. Yes, the statistics are appalling. Unfortunately, I can quote appalling statistics for many other communities. I quoted appalling statistics in the Northern Territory. Unfortunately, we have not seen any improvement due to income management in the Northern Territory either. There are still appalling statistics there. They are awful, which is why we need to be doing something about it. Yesterday, in our responses to the latest Closing the Gap report and the Close the Gap Campaign Steering Committee progress report, we went through a long list of things that we need to do. People seem to think this is a silver bullet approach to dealing with very complex problems. There is no silver bullet approach. There are many people in the community who do not support this trial. We are now hearing from the people who were included in the consultation. They said that the rollout to everybody is not what they understood the government would be proposing.


Some of the other issues that were brought up by the community in the letter from Mr Schrapel that I referred to before were about seeking fundamental information, which is why these questions are needed before the trial starts on 15 March and why I have sought to disallow it. Indue is not a signatory to either the voluntary ePayments Code overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The government could not tell us that during Senate estimates last week, but I am now told that, in fact, they are not. I have not been told that by the government. I have been told by the community that they understand they are not signatories to that ePayments Code. They are not signatories to the relevant industry codes that apply to retail banks and credit unions—most notably, the Code of Banking Practice and the Customer Owned Banking Code of Practice. These codes provide for important protections, including setting out the rules for determining who pays for unauthorised transactions—that is pretty important—establishing a regime for recovering mistaken internet payments—again, really important—rights around cancelling direct debit arrangements and obligations on providers for facilitating chargebacks. The government also could not tell me, during Senate estimates in the week before last, what is happening with some of the hire-purchase payments.


Departmental officials have apparently assured people in the community that participants in the trial will have 'substantially the same protections in their relationship with Indue as normal banking customers enjoy'. In their letter, the community members of the 'keep income management accountable network', go on to say that they think this confidence is misplaced. They would be happy to make some more specific comments, but, at first instance, 'an assessment of the ways in which Indue's offerings may fall below industry standards will be best informed by a detailed review of the terms and conditions for both the savings account and the cashless welfare card'. That is why they want to see the terms and conditions that will apply. It is absolutely essential. This card is going to apply to every person in this trial area who is on a working-age payment. If you are on Newstart, youth allowance, the single parent payment or the disability support payment, you are going to be subject to these measures. They are not being given a choice of which bank they can go to. They have to go to an organisation that is not a bank. It is a financial institution, and it is not signed up to those codes. These are just some of the unanswered questions: who is on the community panel, how are you going to find the community panel and how are you going to ensure privacy of the people who are subject to these measures? You cannot just start this trial without knowing these things. In a small, divided community, how are you going to get a person who is independent to make the decisions about someone's personal finances? Again, we do not know. The government may have already decided who is on that panel. It has not been released. As I said, I have tried to find out further information but have not been able to. That is another question the community is asking.


This is not a trial. The government obviously has an ideological approach to this. I am disappointed that the opposition are still going along with supporting the flawed approach that income management is. They have had plenty of opportunity to look at the evidence as well. They cannot call this a new trial. It is a continuation of the same misguided approach that has not worked.


There is some evidence that shows that in some limited circumstances voluntary income management has been successful in some communities. Voluntary income management is a very different proposition. People actually get to make a choice. They are not dictated to. They do not have the same feeling of lack of control. They do not have the feeling of that process necessarily being unfair, embarrassing and discriminatory, because they have made a choice.


People in Ceduna are about to be subjected to this process. They have not got a choice. I am sure the government are not saying that everybody who is on income support abuses alcohol and drugs and gambles. I am sure they are not saying that. But by taking that approach that is the message you send. It is not appropriate. We should be learning from our mistakes. We should be working with Aboriginal communities on support for community delivered programs that work.


This is a flawed mechanism. This is why I urge the Senate—I am giving you another chance!—to say no to this flawed approach that has deeply divided communities. You are dividing communities for a flawed approach. You have heard all the unanswered questions. Support the disallowance and let's have the opportunity for a rethink about how we can actually address this huge problem. No-one is denying there is a problem. There is no use just quoting statistics to try to justify a measure that does not work. I urge the Senate to support this disallowance.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-02-23,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:44):  I move:


That Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area – Ceduna and Surrounding Region) Determination 2015 be disallowed.


The determination I am seeking to disallow is the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—Ceduna and Surrounding Region) Determination. This is the measure that puts in place the cashless debit card or, as it is probably more commonly known, the cashless welfare card in Ceduna. This is a measure that I and the Greens opposed when the legislation was introduced and debated and we opposed it largely for the same reasons that we oppose income management—income management is a poor policy and it has failed in its stated objectives. We opposed the cashless welfare card from the introduction of the bill that established the operation of the welfare card and set up the provisions for the trials. We opposed it through multiple rounds of estimates where I asked questions about it and now it is regulation. I am trying to disallow it because we do not think this is good public policy.


We want good policies that genuinely help people. We do not support harsh and ineffective policies that do not help people and that, in fact, can harm people. The fundamental ideology that underlies this policy is flawed. It is a belief that strict, harsh control measures by government can solve deep rooted social issues, social problems and substance abuse problems. It is harmful, it is paternalistic and it will not address the issues.


As Nicholas Rothwell wrote on Saturday in The Australian, the approach:


… embodies the hope that direct control over spending patterns can change the behaviour and the attitudes of families and entire communities: that the mind can be modified by a rein on the purse.


I believe that the approach of believing that you can influence the mind, that it can be modified by a rein on the purse is fundamentally mistaken. The Northern Territory intervention has shown this. Some problems cannot be solved by supposedly simple approaches that are strict and that put in place harsh controls. For a start, people will find a way around those harsh controls.


When I look at the evaluation of the Northern Territory intervention, it has had detrimental impacts. Some problems require care and support for people who are in fact vulnerable. They require the addressing of the underlying causes of disadvantage and of substance abuse. We need a multifaceted approach that deals with a multifaceted problem. We have consistently seen that this policy of income management does not work and there have been numerous assessments that show this, particularly for compulsory income management. This is not a new innovative approach; it is a continuation, another form of income management, and, as is often said, income management on steroids. It is a failed approach and has been shown not to work.



I would now like to quote from a very useful report entitled Evaluating New Income Management in the Northern Territory: Final Evaluation Report. I suspect that many people today who will be voting on this motion will not have read that report. For those of you who have read the report, what the heck are you doing supporting this approach and not supporting the disallowance of this determination?


The final NT evaluation said:




A substantial group of people subject to income management felt that income management is unfair, embarrassing and


discriminatory.



The evaluation could not find any substantive evidence of the program having significant changes relative to its key policy objectives, including changing people’s behaviours.


There was no evidence of changes in spending patterns, including food and alcohol sales, other than a slight possible improvement in the incidence of running out of money for food by those on Voluntary Income Management, but no change for those on compulsory income management. The data show that spending on BasicsCard on fruit and vegetables is very low.



There was no evidence of any overall improvement in financial wellbeing, including reductions in financial harassment or improved financial management skills.


More general measures of wellbeing at the community level show no evidence of improvement, including for children.


… … …


The evaluation found that, rather than building capacity and independence, for many the program has acted to make people more dependent on welfare.


… … …


The evaluation data does not provide evidence of income management having improve the outcomes that it was intended to have an impact upon.


They are the findings of the evaluation of income management in the Northern Territory—failed on virtually every count. Yet he we have a government, and I predict an opposition, that are going to vote down my motion to disallow what is a failed approach. There is still time for the opposition to change their minds. I am not confident the government are going to. This is a very important point: this is failed measure. We have had this evidence for nearly two years yet somehow the government still want to proceed with this flawed approach—let's just amp it up a little more; keep amping it up instead of looking at the evidence. The government already know this approach does not work but they still keep pushing ahead.


I had someone ask: why don't you trial this? We have had a trial since 2007. That is more than a trial, folks. That is why we should not be having this trial, because it is just a continuation of a failed approach. It is a dead end. Nicholas Rothwell, in his article on income management, said:


When income management was first introduced in the Northern Territory in 2007, it was seen by the Howard government as a stopgap measure, a 'short, sharp shock', a way-stage en route to further economic reform rather than the long-term destination it has become.


What we are debating here is the long-term destination of continuing income management. He we are years later and income management is a dead end that hurts Aboriginal people and communities.


The idea that this policy is a trial is a sham for a number of reasons. To have a trial, you have to have comparison sites. There is no comparison site. This lies at the heart of whether it is really a trial, to look at whether it would work compared to other policies, or it is just an attempt by the coalition to push their ideology.


The coalition, thank goodness, is providing an additional $1 million in services to the communities in the area affected by the trial. I, for one, welcome any additional funding that provides good quality services. But, a year from now, when they are measuring some of these outcomes, we will not know whether it is those services or the cashless welfare card that have led to any changes that are found. In her submission and evidence to the Senate inquiry into the bill, academic Eva Cox put it well when she said:


This agreement for including services locally creates serious issues for the trial’s claimed intentions. How can any form of research determine whether any improvements that may occur over 12 months are the result of the card or of the services, or a mix of both?


…   …   …


How do you separate the card’s effects from the benefits from the services?


I have been asking about this and trying to find out where the comparison sites will be. People may recall that when we were debating this bill in the chamber I asked a lot of questions. I did not get a lot of answers, but I asked a lot of questions. I asked the minister about this particular issue, and I would like to go through his response at the time. Minister Fifield, who was the minister dealing with this bill in the chamber, said:


I guess there are two broad elements to an evaluation. One is comparing the circumstances in the given community, looking at what the baseline was and how things have improved or otherwise. The other is comparing a trial site to a similar community, and that will be part of the trial. There are other communities that would be receiving some equivalent forms of community support and that is what the evaluation will look at.


Let's skip forward from the debate that we had on that last year, when the bill went through, and go to Senate estimates from the week before last. When I asked, in Senate estimates, about this issue and where the other comparison site was going to be, the departmental officials told me they wanted an effective baseline both in the trial communities and in comparable communities that do not have the services and will not be having the services in place. What is the point of that? You are not comparing like with like. You are not separating out the effect the cashless welfare card will have.


So the government is welshing, before the trial even starts, on their commitment to have a proper evaluation, a proper comparison, and makes a mockery of calling this process a trial. It is not a fair trial. It is not a trial. It cannot prove that the cashless welfare card works for people struggling with issues of substance abuse, alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling. I do not want anybody to mistake the fact that the Greens are absolutely supportive of addressing alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling. We absolutely and fundamentally agree that it needs addressing. We fundamentally disagree with the approach that this government consistently takes and has been proven not to work. We still, in the Northern Territory, have significant drug and alcohol problems, and gambling problems.


Regardless of the outcome, members of the government have already been talking about the rollout of the cashless welfare card or the cashless debit card—whatever you choose to call it—across regional Australia. We already know from the report that Andrew Forrest did that he was advocating rolling out the cashless welfare card, 100 per cent, across all of Australia. It appears that it does not matter to the coalition that it works, and it is obvious from their response to the Northern Territory evaluation that they do not actually look at the evidence. They do not care whether it has worked or not. The evidence conflicts with their ideology, so why would they change their ideology? You have to limit these tough approaches that do not work. This is not a trial.


The coalition is targeting communities with very high numbers of Aboriginal people. We are very clear about that. The only two communities that have signed up at the moment are, largely, Aboriginal communities. I understand from media reports that Laverton has now said no to the card, joining Halls Creek saying no to the card, and I understand from estimates that the government is trying to convince Geraldton to have a go. I urge people in Geraldton to look at the evidence about this. It does not work. Do not condemn yourselves and your community to being another so-called trial site for this failed ideological approach. This policy has been criticised by Aboriginal leaders and Aboriginal community members. Not everybody supports this trial. I will get to the issues about consultation later.


Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, has written about this in both his 2014 and his 2015 report. He also wrote in The Australian that the welfare card is not the solution to alcohol abuse. He said:


Any possible benefit of the card must be weighed against the sense of disempowerment our people already face. It must be weighed against the stigma our people continue to face, and the restrictions placed on our basic rights and freedoms we fought so hard for.


He went on to say:


The hardest part of this proposal to accept is that yet again the treatment of our people will be different to mainstream Australia, and it is this differentiation of treatment that we have fought so hard to bring into the open.


As I said, the Shire of Halls Creek in my home state of Western Australia has decided to reject this card and this approach. They did that because their Aboriginal Advisory Committee voted against the card. The shire president said:


We've got an Aboriginal advisory committee. If we're not going to take any notice of them, then why do we have them?


Importantly, before the trial has rolled out, there have been many problems with the consultation. I know there are ongoing issues in Ceduna, because I am getting lots of emails and communication from community members. I understand that some signatories to the memorandum of understanding in Ceduna have very strong concerns about the manner in which the card is being implemented. In fact, they say it was not their understanding that it was going to be rolled out to everybody. I understand that one of the original signatories to the MOU wants to see elements of the MOU dissolved. I understand that is an ongoing discussion.


As well as this fundamentally flawed approach to the card, I have been asking a series of questions in this chamber and in estimates for months about the operation of this card. In the last round of estimates, we found out that it looks like some sort of loophole is already being built into the card, where people can transfer over $1,000 to somebody else's account, particularly if they are out of town and loose their card. The government did not volunteer this information. It came out when I was asking about what happens with a lost card. I would have thought there were some ongoing issues with that if the government says this is all about stopping people being able to access cash to buy grog.


I have been through in this place many times the impact that this card will have on vulnerable community members, but I want to go through some of the specific points in relation to the card in the time I have remaining. There are ongoing questions around what will happen in terms of merchant charges and what is happening with the status of the community body. I have spent some time trying to find out online about the community panel. This is the panel that you go to to ask to get the 80 per cent restriction on being able to access cash—in other words, you are going to get 20 per cent—down to 50 per cent.


I have not been able to find that online, but I am going to quote from a letter that I have just been sent about this card and that raises some questions about this card. The letter is from Mr Simon Schrapel, who is the Chief Executive of Uniting Communities. He has written this letter, which has gone to the minister, and I have been given a copy. He has cced it to me. He has written it on behalf of the 'keep income management accountable network'. One of the issues that he raises in the letter to the minister is the appointment and funding of the community panel. He says: 'Appointments to the community panel are a matter of ministerial discretion, but for the first trial site in Ceduna it is anticipated to include the local mayor and/or the council chief executive, among other local residents. We have raised concerns with departmental staff about these arrangements, including the disclosure of highly personal information to others living in a small community'—a small community, I might add, that is quite divided over this card. These are my words now; I am not quoting Mr Schrapel. This raises very serious concerns about the release of information. It also goes to the issue of privacy rights, which Mr Schrapel also addresses in the letter to the minister.


But there are other fundamental issues around the terms and conditions of the Indue accounts and the cashless welfare card. Indue is the financial institution—and I am being careful to say 'financial institution' because it is not a bank—but there are questions unanswered. They are implementing this on 15 March, folks. The department could not answer in estimates the week before last about very important issues around some of these financial arrangements, such as whether they are signing up to the ePayments Code and the Code of Banking Practice, and other issues. To date, they have not been able to provide the relevant terms and conditions under which the card will be operating.


The letter says: 'There are now only four weeks until the first trial is due to commence, and the documents are not available. We have been informed that they are commercial-in-confidence. The terms of reference do not, in our view, play a significant role in negotiations between the government and Indue but are critical in defining the relationship between the participant consumers and the financial service provider the government has mandated.' This is particularly important because the people who are subject to this measure do not get a say on which financial institution will be handling their money, but they are not being given some of the most basic understandings about how this is going to work.


We still do not have the resolution of who is going to pay the merchant charges that people will be required to pay when they are using this card. We confirmed in estimates that—contrary to what the government said in the chamber in the debate on this legislation, which is that they were working with the merchants in Ceduna that have merchant charges to see if they can get them waived—they have failed. They told us in estimates that that has failed. They have no answer for the issue for those merchants outside the trial areas. They are not negotiating with them. They cannot, because it is just too big an issue, so people will have to be paying merchant charges.


I repeat again: every dollar counts when you are trying to survive on income support, particularly when the government is making it even harder for you to manage your money under this card. That is unacceptable. This card will not work. It disproportionately impacts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is discriminatory in that respect. I believe it breaches their human rights. This is a failed experiment that started in 2007, and it should be put to bed. I urge the Senate to support this disallowance.

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,23,2,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:04):  Labor will not be supporting the disallowance of the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—Ceduna and Surrounding Region) Determination 2015. As we said when we had the debate earlier this year about the original plan around the Ceduna trials, we are concentrating on looking at how we could work effectively with community to respond to very serious questions. Having said that, I agree with Senator Siewert on a lot of the content that she put into her contribution. We continue to ask the questions at Senate estimates, and consistently at every opportunity we can get, to try to work out exactly how we can best respond to serious issues in community.


The major reason that Labor are supporting the Ceduna trial and not accepting the disallowance this afternoon is that we believe that there has been significant acceptance and even passionate support in elements of the Ceduna community of having this intervention. I use the term, and I know it has a lot of history around it, but this trial—and it is a trial—in Ceduna is an intervention into a community which has openly cried out for support and for help. In terms of the process, we believe that the trial must be evaluated as strongly and as openly as it possibly can be. But, in terms of the way it operates, one of the really solid aspects is that the trial has support by local, state and federal governments.


No-one can claim anywhere that any process has 100 per cent support. In fact, one of the things that worried me most about the evidence we had in the community affairs committee about the Ceduna program was, I think, an overstatement by some people about the degree of support that they had in their community. I think that is one of the elements that Senator Siewert has pointed out in her contribution: when something is being changed or something new is brought into a community, it is really important to ensure that you listen to all the concerns raised and you actually put out as much information as you possibly can. I do note that the department and also Minister Tudge have worked very hard in this process to provide a large amount of information to the community, but it must be understood that there will always be people who will not be happy. There can be no way that you can have 100 per cent of support in any area, and to claim that you do actually underestimates the role and the range of opinion in a community. Having said that, we are actually heartened by the degree of support that has been raised by a number of the Aboriginal communities in the area surrounding Ceduna and the local government area of Ceduna. The mayor has been a very strong supporter of this program and has, in fact, begged that Ceduna be put in the trial.


Also we have information from the state government that, whilst there was a memorandum of understanding signed at the time we had the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, there was little indication about exactly what would be the engagement of the state government in the process. We understand there has been significant discussion subsequently and there is now very positive engagement from the state government about what they can put into the area.


Again, Senator Siewert, I totally agree with your comments about it being a multifaceted problem that demands a multifaceted response. That is one of the reasons that we are showing support for this trial in Ceduna. One of the core elements we raised during the original discussion was the fact that there is no single element that can make change in a community. Originally you need to have the full engagement of the community—and Ceduna has made statements that it wants to be part of this process—and, secondly, you need to have effective wraparound services so people using the card have within their community the necessary services to address their needs around drug and alcohol, gambling and building effective communities and families in their area. 


Mr Tudge has forwarded a copy of all of the support services that have now been promised to the Ceduna community for the period of this trial. We believe any evaluation must take into account the effectiveness of the whole program: the use of the debit card and the wraparound services that have been injected into the community. Senator Siewert is absolutely right—any evaluation must not fail to look at the full responses in the area and must ensure that any outcomes are listed and evaluated against how the community has worked together using all the services that have been provided.


It always worries me when we talk about a trial that it will be compared to another community. The injection of support in Ceduna for the time of the trial should not be at the expense of other communities that would not be receiving similar services. If you have identified in your community, as Ceduna has done, serious crises around drug addiction and violence, you should be able to expect governments to make responses that will be able to work effectively with you to make sure you can mend your community and ensure your citizens are safe and healthy. While Senator Siewert pointed out the issue with trying to make a comparison, I am personally not as convinced around that element. In fact, I do not want to see another community that has an identified crisis being starved of resources to make some kind of effective comparison.


I think we have the ability and experience in our government departments—state, federal and local—to look effectively and with transparency at exactly what is working in our community and what is not. Any trial that sets off without having that commitment and that structure will not succeed. In terms of our support for the trial, we want to see exactly what the monitoring process is going to be. The details of that have not been released yet. We will continue to ask questions about how the community of Ceduna is being supported. The citizens of Ceduna have had a great deal of suffering. It was identified at our committee inquiry that this community have had suffering. They were able to identify at the committee hearing the loss that has been suffered in their community in terms of violence, suicide and the horrors of drug and alcohol addiction and that has led to their request to be part of the trial.


We believe this is a trial that is for this process. We do not think and have never accepted that there should be a blanket approach to any form of community work or the way welfare payments are done. Just because something works in Ceduna should not mean that you have an identical thing rolled out across every community. One of the attractions of this process is that the whole process is being linked to the community itself so they can shape and make this trial work as best suits them. They are not going to be directed from outside as to what should happen. They will be able to identify what works best for their own community and also what does not work.


Senator Siewert also raised some concerns about the information we do not have. Detail needs to be known about the way the debit card will operate, the terms and conditions of the relationship between the financial institution and the people themselves, and how the account will work. At the recent Senate estimates committee there was not that form of detail available for people to see. With the trial due to commence next month, we hope that that information will be shared as quickly as possible so that the trial will be able to work as quickly as possible. 


We understand that these things take time to implement and we understand that there will be things that have to be worked out, as there will be things that will work and things that will not work, but we expect that the core elements of the way the Indue organisation will operate, the rights and conditions around using their services and how this card will operate would be available now if this trial is going to start in the first or second week of March. People will have their welfare payments transferred into that process and that needs to be fully in place so people can have confidence that they will not be without the money they need to have to exist. As we all know, people who are reliant on welfare payments do not have large reserves of cash. So, if they do not have income coming in, they will not be able to support either themselves or their families. That was the kind of information that we were told when we had our inquiry last year would be in place in good time before the trial commenced, so I would really like to get more information from the department or from the minister about how well advanced and how completely effective those financial arrangements are now with the way the actual card will work.


Labor will be watching and ensuring that the monitoring of the process will be done, including people in this place who are deeply interested in how this will operate. We do not want to have issues and concerns raised after the event; we want to know how the monitoring is going to operate. If people are concerned, we do not want their voices silenced. We know that, when people are worried or fearful, sometimes it is very easy to increase that fear and to raise issues now that possibly people had thought had been fully discussed earlier. So in many ways it is going to be the responsibility of the department to ensure that that communication is maintained effectively in the local community. If people are genuinely disgruntled, their voices should be heard so that they will not feel as though they have been forgotten by the people who should most be looking after their welfare.


I know that the concerns are in the community, and that has been made clear through emails that people have received. There have also been concerns raised by people whom I deeply respect—people like Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. I take his comments about the disempowerment of people very seriously, and that is something that I know the department will be considering.


We know that people who live on very reduced incomes such as welfare payments work very effectively with the money they have, so their worth and their ability to budget and run their own lives should not be in question. What we are seeing, and what we have been told that this trial is focused on, is a community which has been ravaged by the impact of alcohol and drugs, so we think that there has been a need identified. We think that there has been consultation with community. We were reassured only last week of the fact that some of the major Aboriginal and Islander communities in the region are fully committed to ensuring that they give the trial a chance. We think that now it is up to us as a parliament to ensure that, through the process of this trial, there will not be secrecy or isolation and people's views will be heard. So, in this sense, we are not supporting the disallowance, and we look forward to seeing how this trial operates and whether there is an effective intervention to stop the ravages in this community.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:17):  Obviously we do not support the disallowance motion that has been put forward by Senator Siewert. The Senate passed this legislation to trial a cashless debit card for Centrelink recipients in communities that have significant—and I underline the word 'significant'—alcohol, drug and/or gambling problems. The locations have been chosen on the basis of the openness of the community to participate in the program, where the community wishes to actively address the welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug and gambling abuse that exists within the community.


In my home state of South Australia, Ceduna has been selected as the first community, and can I state that there is overwhelming support by the entire community for this trial to take place in that town. Ceduna is only a little town; it has about 4,500 people. I have spent a lot of time in Ceduna, and I have spent a lot of time in the communities, going out to places like 18 Tank. I am sure that many of the people who have made a contribution to this debate have never been out to 18 Tank to see the kind of devastation that is created in a community by, particularly, the alcohol impacts on that community.


The community leaders in Ceduna actually approached the government to explore the idea of this cashless debit card, and they are absolutely supporting the introduction of it. The community sees this in a very positive way, as an opportunity to try to overcome some of the problems that the community currently suffers. There are some horrific statistics just on that one community alone. In a community of, as I said, only about 4,500 people, in 2013-14, for example, they had in excess of 4,600 admissions into the sobering-up centre. When you consider the size of the community, that is pretty horrendous. Hospitalisations due to assault were 68 times the national average. So, as you can see, the community had every right to be concerned, and I think that we as a government have a responsibility to respond to the request by that community for help, because you can see the problem is extraordinarily significant.


The disallowance motion is basically seeking to overturn a decision of the Senate, which passed this legislation overwhelmingly, with the support of seven of the crossbenchers as well as the ALP—and I am delighted that the ALP, the opposition, are prepared to stick with this particular program. Obviously they understand the importance not just to the Ceduna community but to many other communities around Australia where alcohol, drug and gambling abuse is having a significant impact on the members of those communities. Senator Siewert's disallowance motion also ignores the calls from the community to try to get on top of this issue, which is really disappointing. It seems really quite ironic that somebody who purports to be supporting and looking after the interests of the community is actually in this place seeking to disallow an instrument that the communities have asked for themselves.


Obviously the government is vehemently opposed to this particular disallowance motion, because we believe it not only robs the Ceduna community of the opportunity to try out a new idea to try to address an issue that is really significant in that community but also denies the opportunity for other communities to be able to benefit from the trial that is run in this community and the trials that, I understand, are to be rolled out in Wyndham and Kununurra in the East Kimberley, subject to the outcome of this trial in Ceduna. I am really proud to be part of a government that is actively supporting a community in my state—a community that is crying out in need.

I am extremely disappointed that the opposition are not taking up the opportunity provided by this debate to re-evaluate their approach to this so-called trial. The reason I am bringing this back is that I am using the parliamentary process that is put in place for delegated legislation to enable us to consider the fine detail of regulation under acts of parliament. The government are, in fact, using more and more delegated instruments. If I were them, I would be a little bit careful about having a go at senators who use the parliamentary process to look at the regulations that the government are relying on to implement large swathes of their acts. This process is there for us to look at the checks and balances of legislation and the implementation of legislation. It is so important because there are so many unanswered questions about this process that the government have still not been able to answer. As I said during my first contribution, as late as the week before last the government still could not answer the questions I was asking in Senate estimates, and yet this so-called trial is due to start on 15 March.


In her contribution, the minister said that we are not prepared to try a new idea. It is not a new idea. That is the fundamental problem. Income management is a failed experiment. I went through the final evaluation from the Northern Territory intervention, which confirmed many of the preliminary findings. There is no substantive evidence that the program has had significant changes relative to the key policy objectives, including changing people's behaviour. There were a whole lot of other objectives. There has not been an overall improvement in financial wellbeing, as you heard from the contribution before. So it is not a new idea; let's put that to bed. It is not a trial because we are not comparing like with like. I point out that, in the Northern Territory intervention, there were a lot of services provided, but they were provided in a top-down, paternalistic approach; they were not working with the community. There were many other problems, including things that we know from debating the Closing the Gap statement in this place last night. We know that many of the measures have not worked because of the flawed nature of those measures. It is not a new idea that providing services, if they are quality services, works as well. Even then, in the NT, where there were some limited services, we have not seen significant improvements.


It is not a trial. There are many ongoing issues. It is not a new idea. Yes, the statistics are appalling. Unfortunately, I can quote appalling statistics for many other communities. I quoted appalling statistics in the Northern Territory. Unfortunately, we have not seen any improvement due to income management in the Northern Territory either. There are still appalling statistics there. They are awful, which is why we need to be doing something about it. Yesterday, in our responses to the latest Closing the Gap report and the Close the Gap Campaign Steering Committee progress report, we went through a long list of things that we need to do. People seem to think this is a silver bullet approach to dealing with very complex problems. There is no silver bullet approach. There are many people in the community who do not support this trial. We are now hearing from the people who were included in the consultation. They said that the rollout to everybody is not what they understood the government would be proposing.


Some of the other issues that were brought up by the community in the letter from Mr Schrapel that I referred to before were about seeking fundamental information, which is why these questions are needed before the trial starts on 15 March and why I have sought to disallow it. Indue is not a signatory to either the voluntary ePayments Code overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The government could not tell us that during Senate estimates last week, but I am now told that, in fact, they are not. I have not been told that by the government. I have been told by the community that they understand they are not signatories to that ePayments Code. They are not signatories to the relevant industry codes that apply to retail banks and credit unions—most notably, the Code of Banking Practice and the Customer Owned Banking Code of Practice. These codes provide for important protections, including setting out the rules for determining who pays for unauthorised transactions—that is pretty important—establishing a regime for recovering mistaken internet payments—again, really important—rights around cancelling direct debit arrangements and obligations on providers for facilitating chargebacks. The government also could not tell me, during Senate estimates in the week before last, what is happening with some of the hire-purchase payments.


Departmental officials have apparently assured people in the community that participants in the trial will have 'substantially the same protections in their relationship with Indue as normal banking customers enjoy'. In their letter, the community members of the 'keep income management accountable network', go on to say that they think this confidence is misplaced. They would be happy to make some more specific comments, but, at first instance, 'an assessment of the ways in which Indue's offerings may fall below industry standards will be best informed by a detailed review of the terms and conditions for both the savings account and the cashless welfare card'. That is why they want to see the terms and conditions that will apply. It is absolutely essential. This card is going to apply to every person in this trial area who is on a working-age payment. If you are on Newstart, youth allowance, the single parent payment or the disability support payment, you are going to be subject to these measures. They are not being given a choice of which bank they can go to. They have to go to an organisation that is not a bank. It is a financial institution, and it is not signed up to those codes. These are just some of the unanswered questions: who is on the community panel, how are you going to find the community panel and how are you going to ensure privacy of the people who are subject to these measures? You cannot just start this trial without knowing these things. In a small, divided community, how are you going to get a person who is independent to make the decisions about someone's personal finances? Again, we do not know. The government may have already decided who is on that panel. It has not been released. As I said, I have tried to find out further information but have not been able to. That is another question the community is asking.


This is not a trial. The government obviously has an ideological approach to this. I am disappointed that the opposition are still going along with supporting the flawed approach that income management is. They have had plenty of opportunity to look at the evidence as well. They cannot call this a new trial. It is a continuation of the same misguided approach that has not worked.


There is some evidence that shows that in some limited circumstances voluntary income management has been successful in some communities. Voluntary income management is a very different proposition. People actually get to make a choice. They are not dictated to. They do not have the same feeling of lack of control. They do not have the feeling of that process necessarily being unfair, embarrassing and discriminatory, because they have made a choice.


People in Ceduna are about to be subjected to this process. They have not got a choice. I am sure the government are not saying that everybody who is on income support abuses alcohol and drugs and gambles. I am sure they are not saying that. But by taking that approach that is the message you send. It is not appropriate. We should be learning from our mistakes. We should be working with Aboriginal communities on support for community delivered programs that work.


This is a flawed mechanism. This is why I urge the Senate—I am giving you another chance!—to say no to this flawed approach that has deeply divided communities. You are dividing communities for a flawed approach. You have heard all the unanswered questions. Support the disallowance and let's have the opportunity for a rethink about how we can actually address this huge problem. No-one is denying there is a problem. There is no use just quoting statistics to try to justify a measure that does not work. I urge the Senate to support this disallowance.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:39):  I am speaking in continuation on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015. I did digress a little before the start of question time. We were discussing the fact that this is more work that has been done by the parliament, and by all political parties, to try to progress the issue of tax transparency and multinational tax avoidance, and to provide the ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, with better laws and information to tackle the problem. I was congratulating Labor for being constructive and working with the government and the Greens to deliver something on multinational tax avoidance.


I did not get a chance to talk to the amendments that Labor will be putting to the chamber in the committee stage, but I will leave that until then. I commend Labor for putting up amendments, although earlier they voted some Greens amendments down on the principle that we did not follow due process, which I find very interesting considering they were excellent amendments. We worked hard with tax transparency stakeholders to try to improve that legislation, and there was nothing particularly controversial about it.


I would also like to take this opportunity to especially thank the tax transparency network, who I know have worked with Labor to develop the amendments that we are going to hear about shortly. I also congratulate Dr Andrew Leigh's office on the work that they have done in helping to present these amendments. The Greens will be supporting the bill. Of course, we support the intention of the bill to provide new laws and powers to the Australian Taxation Office to help crack down on multinational tax avoidance. We will be working constructively and as adults, supporting the amendments, which improve this legislation and actually deliver an outcome for Australians on multinational tax avoidance. Good on you, Labor, for doing something constructive on this issue.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2016-02-23,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:44):  Tonight I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015. The Common Reporting Standard is an important measure to combat international tax avoidance, and Labor have strongly supported this measure, just like we support cracking down on multinational tax avoidance. The Common Reporting Standard is a multilateral policy initiative of the G20 and the OECD. This initiative will allow financial account information to be exchanged between tax authorities in participating countries. With over 90 countries participating in this exchange of information, there will be far fewer places for tax avoiders to hide. It is important to note that the sharing of this type of information is crucial to make sure those individuals and companies pay their fair share of tax and to stop the money-shuffling operations. It follows on from other efforts in attacking money laundering. If you can achieve across-the-board agreement with countries to address this issue with appropriate laws then you will succeed in minimising these operations. 


Labor want this well-coordinated system to come into effect as soon as possible. However, once again we see Mr Turnbull's government say one thing but do something else when it comes to tax avoidance. The government, in this bill, has proposed delaying the reporting on accounts held by corporate entities until 2019. This means that Australia will be lagging behind most OECD and other advanced economies. There are more than 40 countries which will begin this information exchange from next year. These countries include the UK, France, Germany, India, Argentina and Mexico as well as numerous European Union member states. Under the Turnbull government, Australia makes it glaringly obvious that it is not serious about tax avoidance by delaying this implementation for years. I do hope that in the second reading debate the government can outline cogent and relevant reasons for the delay and not just say that it is because they think industry needs time to adjust. If we wait this number of years, we will be in the same category as Russia, the United Arab Emirates and the Bahamas. This country has led the world in many areas, particularly in seeking to effect agreements across countries to stamp out money laundering, but instead we have now found ourselves at the bottom of the heap, dragging our feet. It does not speak highly of this government. What is more concerning is that this government will make individual reporting mandatory from 2018 while delaying corporate reporting for an extra year, until 2019, giving their mates in big business even more time. During this debate I encourage the coalition to provide a good rationale for the significant delay in making these changes. 


The government have form when it comes to avoiding action on tax avoidance. They have cut 4,700 jobs from the Australian Taxation Office. They  have  done a dirty deal with the Greens to wind back tax transparency. Their multinational tax plan, if you can call it that, is so vague that Treasury could not even cost it. It is important to highlight the point about the multinational tax avoidance legislation, because it shows the government's complete insincerity when it comes to this important tax reform. After the Senate had already amended the government's bill so that companies at the lower threshold of $100 million in earnings had to pay their fair share of tax, the coalition made an agreement with the Greens at the last minute to keep the reporting threshold at $200 million. You have to put it in the frame of this government not being about transparency. It is not about ensuring that it can sign up to a multinational agreement to shed some light in this area to ensure that big business reports. Because of the last-minute deal they signed, instead of information being released about 900 companies, we will end up with information being released for only about 300 companies, and the rest will be kept out of sight, in the shadows. We would expect this type of manoeuvre from the coalition, but it just shows how deeply ingrained the Greens are in trying to move towards the coalition. Worse still, I can see—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  It's the pot calling the kettle black on that one, mate!




Senator LUDWIG:
  Of course, the Greens complain about it. But you did it. Do not hide from it. Own it and defend it if you will—but I do not think you can defend it. You certainly do not want to talk about it now. We could be here all day talking about the self-serving, hypocritical, narrow-minded and perpetually outraged little clique that is the Greens, but there is the business of actually holding this government to account. 


A report by the ATO in December last year confirmed that one in four companies earning more than $100 million paid no tax in Australia in 2014—not one jot. Anyone would think that is unacceptable, and that is why Labor's $7.2 billion plan would further tighten the tax net by putting in place a measure such as the Common Reporting Standard and making sure it is up and running as soon as possible.


We would also address the practice of shifting money from different parts of the company's global corporate structure to its Australian arm, thereby sending their money overseas as repayment of these artificial loans and at the same time claiming tax deductions. Our plan would see companies only be able to claim tax deductions against the average amount of debt that they owe banks around the world. These plans are detailed, costed and responsible measures that Labor has outlined to make sure that companies which do business here pay their fair share of tax.


The bill, as it stands, does not require that information collected through the common reporting standard to be public. Labor believes in greater tax transparency, and we have proposed that the Commissioner of Taxation make this information public in an annual report by providing aggregated and, importantly, the identified information about the financial account holdings of foreign nationals. The government continues to oppose measures to bring the time line for the common reporting standard forward. It, along with the Greens, has clearly opposed greater transparency and it has only been forced to take any action on multinational tax avoidance by the work done by the Senate economics committee, particularly the Labor senators on that committee. 


This government clearly has the wrong priorities when it comes to tax avoidance. But speaking of tax avoidance, there is another kind of avoidance occurring to the great detriment of our country and our economy. It is something that has emerged gradually—it is the policy avoidance that we have seen from the Turnbull government and the Treasurer. While Labor has announced tax policies to counter the fiscal vandalism that those opposite have wreaked on the budget, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison have actively avoided the debate on tax reform. I have never seen in this place a government that has avoided so many debates about tax. It trumpeted in the early stages that it would be a government that would have tax reform at its centre—it would have a white paper on tax reform; it would set out an economic plan on tax reform. To date there has not been a squeak from this government. I would be embarrassed if I were a backbencher for the coalition at this point in this debate. Not only have they avoided making any proposals to reform our tax system, they have actually gone out of their way to rule out everything and anything possible. In fact, they created their own scare campaign around the GST and then ruled it out. That is hilarious! I have never seen a government create its own scare campaign so that it could rule it out. It is unique, let me say.


Let me throw-out a policy for those opposite which I could announce—a national policy avoidance scheme. It seems germane to this government which has no big ideas. Its only idea is how to create a national policy avoidance scheme, which could be independently analysed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. Those opposite could figure out a way at least to have fines for not complying with the national policy avoidance scheme, because to date this government has failed to deliver an economic plan for this country. The shame of that is that it has been in government for 2½ years and its only explanation is: 'We'll get to that budget and we'll have our economic plan.' What are we going to do between now and the budget? What have we done between the last budget and now? This government does not have an economic plan and it does not seem to be prepared to have the wherewithal to put its shoulder to the wheel and develop one. It wants to wait for a budget. Budgets come and go, but I am concerned that the plan that this government might produce will never materialise.


In all seriousness, this is not good governance by a coalition which leaves ordinary Australians hanging and waiting for a plan which has not materialised. Announcing that it will have a plan is not a plan—that is not a plan that sells. That is not economic leadership. Mr Morrison, at the Press Club the other day, did not display economic leadership, and I would say the media thrashed him for not being able to articulate an economic plan to this country when he had the opportunity to do so. This was on display for all to see. At the end of the day, Mr Turnbull did not want to become Prime Minister because he had a grand vision he wanted to set out for this country on how we would move from here into a way forward. Really he just wanted to be Prime Minister. Why? Perhaps he thought he deserved to be Prime Minister. The day that Mr Turnbull challenged Mr Abbott, he said: 


Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs.


That is what Mr Turnbull said when he challenged Mr Abbott. He set him down as a failure.




Senator Smith:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am enjoying Senator Ludwig's contribution, but I do recall standing order 194 requires that senators not digress from the topic in question.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Senator Ludwig, we are discussing the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill, and I would ask you to be relevant to that bill. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  On the point of order, there is broad latitude given by the chair to allow us to cross areas such as those I am talking about. I am talking about tax and tax avoidance and I am talking about this government's lack of ability to hold a proper tax debate. But I am happy to listen to your ruling and come back to the point.


We have been talking about this government not having a plan for how they are going to implement the Common Reporting Standard. Today they want us to pass legislation and wait this huge time for the changes to be delivered. The reason they want to wait this huge time is that ultimately Mr Turnbull likes jetting around the world rather than putting his shoulder to the wheel to come up with a vision for Australia. The same can be said about Mr Morrison. The Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill is a good example of where they just want to kick the can down the road and hope that it is implemented in three or four years time. It is the same plan Mr Morrison has—he does not have a plan today, I think he said at the Press Club; he said he would show us a few graphs and kick the can down the road, and 'Trust me, we will come up with a plan in due course.' 


The rubber hits the road between now and the budget. It is remiss of this government not to consider how they are going to explain to the public what their plan is or is not. They have a steering wheel but the engine is not even running. This government does not have a purpose, apart from it apparently being the most exciting time to be an Australian, which is just a slightly longer catchphrase than Mr Abbott's 'stop the boats'. This government continues to be devoid of ideas, including how it is going to implement its tax policy. I think it is even devoid of a plan to implement the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill. When you look around the world, it is evident that this government has completely failed to explain, in a succinct and sensible way, why it can take so long for the implementation of tax administration in this country.


The Common Reporting Standard for the automatic exchange of financial accounting information is ultimately a good thing. It will ensure the collection of financial account information, it will ensure the reporting of that information to the jurisdiction's tax authority, and it will ensure the exchange of that information with the respective tax authorities of the nonresidents. All in all, it is beneficial. What is concerning are the time frames for implementation, as I have outlined, but ultimately this legislation underpins this government's inability to act quickly, decisively and with purpose. This bill highlights the inadequacy of this government to deliver anything. It concerns me that, when you look at their phrases, they will have a tax plan but they will rule out everything and anything they can possibly think is contentious. Ultimately, at the end of the day, they will not have a plan and they will simply use catchphrases such as Australia is a great place to live and why shouldn't you vote for the coalition. This bill highlights exactly the reason you would not vote for the coalition, why you would not continue to support the coalition. They do not have a plan for how to implement the international legal framework underpinning the CRS and countries covered by it. With the completion of those few words, I will allow the government time to answer the earlier questions I raised.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:04):  I am conscious of the time and I am conscious of what has already been said. I want to make sure the government has the opportunity to have its say on this. The Common Reporting Standard is a multilateral policy initiative that has been led by the G20 and the OECD. This bill continues with what has been a lot of work that has already taken place and a lot of initiatives over the past period. It is important that we not look at the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill in isolation but understand that it is part of what has really been a series of bills and a series of initiatives in this chamber to address some of these taxation issues. I point out that while there has been quite a bit of political disagreement and a bit of rancour about certain aspects of legislation, the Senate itself, all parties in this place, have come at it from a series of genuine but different views that are largely supportive of one another. 


It is important to understand that the initiatives here are largely being supported, but there are some differences. Those of us on this side of the chamber want to see the government go further. We would like to see the government go harder. We think there are other initiatives and other steps that can and should be taken that have not been taken. We feel there are good things that can and should be done that have not been done, and in fact there is more low-hanging fruit in terms of legislation. That being said, there are a lot of good intentions and goodwill in this bill, and when we get to the committee stage I will propose some amendments which will go a long way towards improving it. With that, being very conscious of the time, I do want to give the government the proper opportunity to wind up.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (19:06):  I am delighted, almost brimming with surprise and delight, to be able to provide the summing-up speech for the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015 and to warmly thank all of those senators who, I have no doubt, have made extremely valuable, thoughtful and detailed contributions to this debate that I have been studying very closely.


This bill implements the Common Reporting Standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information. Globalisation and technological advances have made it easier for taxpayers to hold investments in financial institutions outside of their jurisdiction of residence, increasing the opportunities for international tax evasion. The standard tackles this type of tax evasion, improving the integrity of the tax system. Financial institutions will be required to collect financial account information of foreign residents and report it to the Australian Taxation Office for transmission to other jurisdictions' tax authorities. In exchange, the Australian Taxation Office will receive information on Australians with offshore accounts. It will use the information to ensure that they are complying with their domestic tax obligations. Over 95 jurisdictions have committed to implement the standard, including former tax secrecy jurisdictions such as Luxembourg, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey. I commend this bill to the Senate and look forward to its passage.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:09):  Senator Birmingham, I note that you are only the minister acting in this portfolio at the moment, so there will be elements of this which I understand you may have to check in and get back to us on, and I note that we have only 10 minutes left until the adjournment debate. Perhaps we will not get the opportunity to get to the end of a lot of these matters, and I suspect that Senator Cormann will be dealing with this for a little while longer.


One of the criticisms that has been made is that the Abbott-Turnbull governments committed us to a timetable which sees Australia lag behind most of the OECD and other advanced economies. More than 40 countries will begin exchanging information on individuals in 2017. Is my understanding correct that this legislation does not bring this system into effect until after those countries have already begun reporting?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (19:10):  I can advise Senator Dastyari that I understand his understanding is correct and that the reason relates to the differences in financial year timings between Australia and other jurisdictions—ours, of course, being a July-to-June financial year time frame and other jurisdictions having calendar year time frames.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:11):  Our time frame starts in 2018. My understanding is that the financial institutions will be required to report on the high-value accounts held by individuals to the ATO by the middle of 2018 and report high-value accounts held by corporate entities by 2019. There has been no rationale given for delaying the reporting on corporate entity accounts by 12 months. The real question is: why is there one deadline, in the middle of 2018, for individuals and another for high-value accounts held by corporate entities in 2019? I want to flag that this may perhaps form the basis of an amendment—which, being conscious of time, I suspect will not be moved this evening.


The world is moving in a particular direction on this front. We have a situation where 40 like-minded OECD nations will already have begun the process of sharing this type of information, and what worries me is that Australia is going to fall behind. While there have been many disagreements in this chamber about the nature of the bill and amendments to different parts of the bill, I think former Treasurer Joe Hockey and the tax commissioner have done an incredible job on the international stage and played a very important role in making Australia world leaders in some of these areas. Again, that does not mean I think all the legislation has been perfect. The criticism that people like me have made is not that the laws that this government has tried to pass have necessarily been bad or ineffective laws; the criticism has largely been that the laws they passed have not gone far enough—and that really has been where the debate here has gone. The question is: why do you have two separate dates for reporting, one for individuals by the middle of 2018 and another for corporate entities by 2019? Why doesn't this bill bring those two dates together?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (19:14):  The short answer for Senator Dastyari in terms of the proposal as I understand—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am giving the short answer first! It is a multipronged approach that I am taking and I will do my utmost to assist you in the undertaking that you have here, Senator Dastyari, to move us forward in a constructive manner, but one that takes us, appropriately, to 7.20 pm! The short answer is that the different time frames, I am advised, relate to the OECD agreement that was struck and that the legislation introduced, which provides for the different time frames, is consistent with the terms of those OECD discussions and arose out of that agreement.


Obviously, the government has seen the amendment that you propose to move in that regard during the committee stage of this debate. I am advised that that amendment is similar in form to one that was tabled by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Dr Leigh, during the debate in the House of Representatives. The government has sought some clarification of the purpose of that amendment, as it was not clear from Dr Leigh's speech in the second reading debate exactly what the intention of that was. However, having had the chance to reflect upon that and understand the intent behind it—and the substitution of '2019' with '2018' that is proposed—it is the government's intention to agree to the Labor Party's amendment to bring forward the deadline from 31 July 2019 to the new date of 31 July 2018 for the reviewing of entity accounts to be finalised. That will of course, as you outlined in your question, bring this into line with the time frame in the bill for high-value individual accounts.


It may also be of use to the chamber at this time if I give a quick understanding of the government amendments for which I tabled the explanatory memorandum previously. We are introducing those amendments to ensure that the provisions operate as intended upon the introduction of this bill. In particular, the amendments will correct a technical anomaly in the original bill so that statements relating to pre-existing individual accounts that are high-value accounts as of 30 June 2017 must be reported to the tax commissioner by 31 July 2018. These amendments help to ensure that this deadline is met, regardless of whether the reporting financial institution conducts its due diligence procedures on these accounts between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017 or between 1 January 2018 and 31 July 2018. 


While I am by no means pretending to be an expert on these processes, I assume that that distinction between those two six-monthly periods has some relationship to the question you asked previously, Senator Dastyari, about some of the approaches to time frames under the legislation and that it will hopefully provide additional clarity in that regard.


It is important to appreciate that the timing provisions in the bill have been carefully crafted to ensure that they are aligned with OECD guidance on collection, review and exchange of information. The government are certainly eager to see this legislation successfully passed, which is why we have brought to the chamber some of these amendments that will aid in its operation and why, perhaps more importantly, we are cooperating with the opposition in relation to some of their amendments, which we have now had time to properly consider and reflect upon and which, overall, we believe will help to achieve and enhance the implementation of the common reporting standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:18):  Thank you for that, Minister Birmingham. It is very positive to hear that the opposition amendments that have been foreshadowed but not yet moved have a decent chance of government support. Again, I think it is quite effective when there is a bipartisan approach to and bipartisan support for these matters. 


I want to note the work of the Senate Economics References Committee, which I chaired and which Senator Ketter now chairs, in this space. I think it has been really important to have that public debate raising a lot of this information. There is a lot more transparency and people understand what really goes on with multinational tax minimisation, or avoidance, or whatever you want to call it. The reality is that every dollar 'minimised' is a dollar that is not going to a hospital, to a school or to a service that is required. That is why it is so important that we get the legislative framework right: so that we can tackle this increasing issue.


Progress reported.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:39):  I am speaking in continuation on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015. I did digress a little before the start of question time. We were discussing the fact that this is more work that has been done by the parliament, and by all political parties, to try to progress the issue of tax transparency and multinational tax avoidance, and to provide the ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, with better laws and information to tackle the problem. I was congratulating Labor for being constructive and working with the government and the Greens to deliver something on multinational tax avoidance.


I did not get a chance to talk to the amendments that Labor will be putting to the chamber in the committee stage, but I will leave that until then. I commend Labor for putting up amendments, although earlier they voted some Greens amendments down on the principle that we did not follow due process, which I find very interesting considering they were excellent amendments. We worked hard with tax transparency stakeholders to try to improve that legislation, and there was nothing particularly controversial about it.


I would also like to take this opportunity to especially thank the tax transparency network, who I know have worked with Labor to develop the amendments that we are going to hear about shortly. I also congratulate Dr Andrew Leigh's office on the work that they have done in helping to present these amendments. The Greens will be supporting the bill. Of course, we support the intention of the bill to provide new laws and powers to the Australian Taxation Office to help crack down on multinational tax avoidance. We will be working constructively and as adults, supporting the amendments, which improve this legislation and actually deliver an outcome for Australians on multinational tax avoidance. Good on you, Labor, for doing something constructive on this issue.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:44):  Tonight I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015. The Common Reporting Standard is an important measure to combat international tax avoidance, and Labor have strongly supported this measure, just like we support cracking down on multinational tax avoidance. The Common Reporting Standard is a multilateral policy initiative of the G20 and the OECD. This initiative will allow financial account information to be exchanged between tax authorities in participating countries. With over 90 countries participating in this exchange of information, there will be far fewer places for tax avoiders to hide. It is important to note that the sharing of this type of information is crucial to make sure those individuals and companies pay their fair share of tax and to stop the money-shuffling operations. It follows on from other efforts in attacking money laundering. If you can achieve across-the-board agreement with countries to address this issue with appropriate laws then you will succeed in minimising these operations. 


Labor want this well-coordinated system to come into effect as soon as possible. However, once again we see Mr Turnbull's government say one thing but do something else when it comes to tax avoidance. The government, in this bill, has proposed delaying the reporting on accounts held by corporate entities until 2019. This means that Australia will be lagging behind most OECD and other advanced economies. There are more than 40 countries which will begin this information exchange from next year. These countries include the UK, France, Germany, India, Argentina and Mexico as well as numerous European Union member states. Under the Turnbull government, Australia makes it glaringly obvious that it is not serious about tax avoidance by delaying this implementation for years. I do hope that in the second reading debate the government can outline cogent and relevant reasons for the delay and not just say that it is because they think industry needs time to adjust. If we wait this number of years, we will be in the same category as Russia, the United Arab Emirates and the Bahamas. This country has led the world in many areas, particularly in seeking to effect agreements across countries to stamp out money laundering, but instead we have now found ourselves at the bottom of the heap, dragging our feet. It does not speak highly of this government. What is more concerning is that this government will make individual reporting mandatory from 2018 while delaying corporate reporting for an extra year, until 2019, giving their mates in big business even more time. During this debate I encourage the coalition to provide a good rationale for the significant delay in making these changes. 


The government have form when it comes to avoiding action on tax avoidance. They have cut 4,700 jobs from the Australian Taxation Office. They  have  done a dirty deal with the Greens to wind back tax transparency. Their multinational tax plan, if you can call it that, is so vague that Treasury could not even cost it. It is important to highlight the point about the multinational tax avoidance legislation, because it shows the government's complete insincerity when it comes to this important tax reform. After the Senate had already amended the government's bill so that companies at the lower threshold of $100 million in earnings had to pay their fair share of tax, the coalition made an agreement with the Greens at the last minute to keep the reporting threshold at $200 million. You have to put it in the frame of this government not being about transparency. It is not about ensuring that it can sign up to a multinational agreement to shed some light in this area to ensure that big business reports. Because of the last-minute deal they signed, instead of information being released about 900 companies, we will end up with information being released for only about 300 companies, and the rest will be kept out of sight, in the shadows. We would expect this type of manoeuvre from the coalition, but it just shows how deeply ingrained the Greens are in trying to move towards the coalition. Worse still, I can see—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  It's the pot calling the kettle black on that one, mate!




Senator LUDWIG:
  Of course, the Greens complain about it. But you did it. Do not hide from it. Own it and defend it if you will—but I do not think you can defend it. You certainly do not want to talk about it now. We could be here all day talking about the self-serving, hypocritical, narrow-minded and perpetually outraged little clique that is the Greens, but there is the business of actually holding this government to account. 


A report by the ATO in December last year confirmed that one in four companies earning more than $100 million paid no tax in Australia in 2014—not one jot. Anyone would think that is unacceptable, and that is why Labor's $7.2 billion plan would further tighten the tax net by putting in place a measure such as the Common Reporting Standard and making sure it is up and running as soon as possible.


We would also address the practice of shifting money from different parts of the company's global corporate structure to its Australian arm, thereby sending their money overseas as repayment of these artificial loans and at the same time claiming tax deductions. Our plan would see companies only be able to claim tax deductions against the average amount of debt that they owe banks around the world. These plans are detailed, costed and responsible measures that Labor has outlined to make sure that companies which do business here pay their fair share of tax.


The bill, as it stands, does not require that information collected through the common reporting standard to be public. Labor believes in greater tax transparency, and we have proposed that the Commissioner of Taxation make this information public in an annual report by providing aggregated and, importantly, the identified information about the financial account holdings of foreign nationals. The government continues to oppose measures to bring the time line for the common reporting standard forward. It, along with the Greens, has clearly opposed greater transparency and it has only been forced to take any action on multinational tax avoidance by the work done by the Senate economics committee, particularly the Labor senators on that committee. 


This government clearly has the wrong priorities when it comes to tax avoidance. But speaking of tax avoidance, there is another kind of avoidance occurring to the great detriment of our country and our economy. It is something that has emerged gradually—it is the policy avoidance that we have seen from the Turnbull government and the Treasurer. While Labor has announced tax policies to counter the fiscal vandalism that those opposite have wreaked on the budget, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison have actively avoided the debate on tax reform. I have never seen in this place a government that has avoided so many debates about tax. It trumpeted in the early stages that it would be a government that would have tax reform at its centre—it would have a white paper on tax reform; it would set out an economic plan on tax reform. To date there has not been a squeak from this government. I would be embarrassed if I were a backbencher for the coalition at this point in this debate. Not only have they avoided making any proposals to reform our tax system, they have actually gone out of their way to rule out everything and anything possible. In fact, they created their own scare campaign around the GST and then ruled it out. That is hilarious! I have never seen a government create its own scare campaign so that it could rule it out. It is unique, let me say.


Let me throw-out a policy for those opposite which I could announce—a national policy avoidance scheme. It seems germane to this government which has no big ideas. Its only idea is how to create a national policy avoidance scheme, which could be independently analysed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. Those opposite could figure out a way at least to have fines for not complying with the national policy avoidance scheme, because to date this government has failed to deliver an economic plan for this country. The shame of that is that it has been in government for 2½ years and its only explanation is: 'We'll get to that budget and we'll have our economic plan.' What are we going to do between now and the budget? What have we done between the last budget and now? This government does not have an economic plan and it does not seem to be prepared to have the wherewithal to put its shoulder to the wheel and develop one. It wants to wait for a budget. Budgets come and go, but I am concerned that the plan that this government might produce will never materialise.


In all seriousness, this is not good governance by a coalition which leaves ordinary Australians hanging and waiting for a plan which has not materialised. Announcing that it will have a plan is not a plan—that is not a plan that sells. That is not economic leadership. Mr Morrison, at the Press Club the other day, did not display economic leadership, and I would say the media thrashed him for not being able to articulate an economic plan to this country when he had the opportunity to do so. This was on display for all to see. At the end of the day, Mr Turnbull did not want to become Prime Minister because he had a grand vision he wanted to set out for this country on how we would move from here into a way forward. Really he just wanted to be Prime Minister. Why? Perhaps he thought he deserved to be Prime Minister. The day that Mr Turnbull challenged Mr Abbott, he said: 


Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs.


That is what Mr Turnbull said when he challenged Mr Abbott. He set him down as a failure.




Senator Smith:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am enjoying Senator Ludwig's contribution, but I do recall standing order 194 requires that senators not digress from the topic in question.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Senator Ludwig, we are discussing the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill, and I would ask you to be relevant to that bill. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  On the point of order, there is broad latitude given by the chair to allow us to cross areas such as those I am talking about. I am talking about tax and tax avoidance and I am talking about this government's lack of ability to hold a proper tax debate. But I am happy to listen to your ruling and come back to the point.


We have been talking about this government not having a plan for how they are going to implement the Common Reporting Standard. Today they want us to pass legislation and wait this huge time for the changes to be delivered. The reason they want to wait this huge time is that ultimately Mr Turnbull likes jetting around the world rather than putting his shoulder to the wheel to come up with a vision for Australia. The same can be said about Mr Morrison. The Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill is a good example of where they just want to kick the can down the road and hope that it is implemented in three or four years time. It is the same plan Mr Morrison has—he does not have a plan today, I think he said at the Press Club; he said he would show us a few graphs and kick the can down the road, and 'Trust me, we will come up with a plan in due course.' 


The rubber hits the road between now and the budget. It is remiss of this government not to consider how they are going to explain to the public what their plan is or is not. They have a steering wheel but the engine is not even running. This government does not have a purpose, apart from it apparently being the most exciting time to be an Australian, which is just a slightly longer catchphrase than Mr Abbott's 'stop the boats'. This government continues to be devoid of ideas, including how it is going to implement its tax policy. I think it is even devoid of a plan to implement the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill. When you look around the world, it is evident that this government has completely failed to explain, in a succinct and sensible way, why it can take so long for the implementation of tax administration in this country.


The Common Reporting Standard for the automatic exchange of financial accounting information is ultimately a good thing. It will ensure the collection of financial account information, it will ensure the reporting of that information to the jurisdiction's tax authority, and it will ensure the exchange of that information with the respective tax authorities of the nonresidents. All in all, it is beneficial. What is concerning are the time frames for implementation, as I have outlined, but ultimately this legislation underpins this government's inability to act quickly, decisively and with purpose. This bill highlights the inadequacy of this government to deliver anything. It concerns me that, when you look at their phrases, they will have a tax plan but they will rule out everything and anything they can possibly think is contentious. Ultimately, at the end of the day, they will not have a plan and they will simply use catchphrases such as Australia is a great place to live and why shouldn't you vote for the coalition. This bill highlights exactly the reason you would not vote for the coalition, why you would not continue to support the coalition. They do not have a plan for how to implement the international legal framework underpinning the CRS and countries covered by it. With the completion of those few words, I will allow the government time to answer the earlier questions I raised.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:04):  I am conscious of the time and I am conscious of what has already been said. I want to make sure the government has the opportunity to have its say on this. The Common Reporting Standard is a multilateral policy initiative that has been led by the G20 and the OECD. This bill continues with what has been a lot of work that has already taken place and a lot of initiatives over the past period. It is important that we not look at the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill in isolation but understand that it is part of what has really been a series of bills and a series of initiatives in this chamber to address some of these taxation issues. I point out that while there has been quite a bit of political disagreement and a bit of rancour about certain aspects of legislation, the Senate itself, all parties in this place, have come at it from a series of genuine but different views that are largely supportive of one another. 


It is important to understand that the initiatives here are largely being supported, but there are some differences. Those of us on this side of the chamber want to see the government go further. We would like to see the government go harder. We think there are other initiatives and other steps that can and should be taken that have not been taken. We feel there are good things that can and should be done that have not been done, and in fact there is more low-hanging fruit in terms of legislation. That being said, there are a lot of good intentions and goodwill in this bill, and when we get to the committee stage I will propose some amendments which will go a long way towards improving it. With that, being very conscious of the time, I do want to give the government the proper opportunity to wind up.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (19:06):  I am delighted, almost brimming with surprise and delight, to be able to provide the summing-up speech for the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015 and to warmly thank all of those senators who, I have no doubt, have made extremely valuable, thoughtful and detailed contributions to this debate that I have been studying very closely.


This bill implements the Common Reporting Standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information. Globalisation and technological advances have made it easier for taxpayers to hold investments in financial institutions outside of their jurisdiction of residence, increasing the opportunities for international tax evasion. The standard tackles this type of tax evasion, improving the integrity of the tax system. Financial institutions will be required to collect financial account information of foreign residents and report it to the Australian Taxation Office for transmission to other jurisdictions' tax authorities. In exchange, the Australian Taxation Office will receive information on Australians with offshore accounts. It will use the information to ensure that they are complying with their domestic tax obligations. Over 95 jurisdictions have committed to implement the standard, including former tax secrecy jurisdictions such as Luxembourg, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey. I commend this bill to the Senate and look forward to its passage.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  Last Sunday week, 14 February, I was honoured to be asked to represent the government at the opening of the Joan Nicoll Tennis Centre at Terranora, adjacent to Tweed Heads. Tennis Terranora started as an intraclub of the Terranora Lakes Country Club way back in 1978, growing to over 400 members, five courts, a clubhouse and a coach. With the unfortunate liquidation of Terranora Lakes Country Club in 1996 and the eventual sale of that club's land and buildings, the old tennis club was given notice to vacate. The club was re-established as a separate association with about 100 members and renamed Tennis Terranora Incorporated.


From 1996 to 2002, the tennis club continued to function using the same complex as before, which was under private ownership, on a week-to-week rental arrangement. Through media reports during 2002, members heard that the existing tennis complex would be redeveloped for other purposes, giving the club an uncertain future. In November 2002, Tennis Terranora set up a committee of eight members to oversee the relocation of the club to new premises, as it was clear a new home was needed. Funding was sought, and the club itself raised over $50,000. But in May 2005 Tweed Shire Council, a great supporter, was placed in administration.


Over the next four years Arkinstall Park at Tweed Heads was recommended as the venue for a regional tennis centre. Initially, Tennis Terranora was keen to relocate to the new centre, but they found the delay would be far too long and they were under pressure to vacate their existing site. Stage 1 of the Arkinstall Park sports complex was opened in May last year.


In late 2009, the council made an offer to Tennis Terranora to take up a site at Henry Lawson Drive and, shortly after, the council said it would contribute $145,000 towards the clubhouse amenities. Originally this $145,000 was for a separate amenities block. Thus began a long process of DAs and approvals, with club members rallying to help. The first sod was turned in August 2013. Then began a program of earthworks, laying of asphalt, fencing and painting and construction of the clubhouse.


The Nationals candidate for Richmond at the last federal election, Matthew Fraser, made an election commitment of $250,000—and it was duly delivered. As well, there was $30,000 from the New South Wales government, and it was good to have my Nationals state colleague, the member for Tweed, Geoff Provest, with us. There was $50,000 from Tennis Australia, and Ken Laffey represented Tennis Australia at the opening. As well, there was the $145,000 from Tweed Shire Council, led by Councillor Katie Milne, plus a couple of loans.


What struck me at the opening was the in-kind support Tennis Terranora received. It seemed like every husband, wife, brother and sister had rolled their sleeves up to dig a hole, use a paint brush, lay some tiles or plant a shrub. Many had put their hand in their pocket to pay for some of these. A conservative $255,000 worth of in-kind support from individuals and businesses resulted in a magnificent complex of five tennis courts, state-of-the-art clubrooms, an amenities block and lighting fixtures. The longer-term goal is for more courts, so that Tennis Terranora becomes the headquarters of junior tennis in the Tweed.


There are many people who can look back with pride on what they have contributed, but I want to mention a few: South East Excavations, run by Brian and Bruce Turner, who donated $120,000 worth of civil works, fencing materials and soil; the president of the club, Rob Nienhuis, who has been a tenacious leader, organiser and contributor in his own right and who will be knocking on doors again shortly looking for assistance for the next stage; and the lady after whom the Joan Nicoll Tennis Centre is named.


Joan Nicoll played in two Australian Open tournaments, as well as at Wimbledon, and has won titles in Denmark, Spain, England and Fiji. Joan recently retired after 30 years of dedicating her time and highly-regarded skills to coaching the junior tennis stars.


Thank you to the members of Tennis Terranora for your warm welcome and hospitality and, more importantly, for rolling your sleeves up and never giving up. Persistence is the key to success. The community has worked hard. They have a wonderful facility. It is a great legacy for Joan Nicoll for her years of contribution, expertise, talent and coaching of the young ones. I wish them all the best for the future.
