"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2001-06-19,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister confirm that ASIC figures show insolvencies are up nearly 20 per cent from 1999-2000 for the year to April; for March 2001 were up 15 per cent from last year; for April 2001 were up 30 per cent from last year; and the worst month so far this financial year was October 2000, with an increase of 101 per cent over the preceding year? What can the minister offer as an explanation for this large increase in business failures in a year-on-year comparison?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Insolvencies</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2001-06-19,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Four minutes and not a single mention of record insolvencies. Does the minister stand by the Treasurer's statement of 18 May 2000, when he said:
I don't think anybody will go to the wall as a consequence of GST ... I don't think that there will be businesses that will flounder because of GST.
Did not the Treasurer get it wrong in that statement? Do not the ASIC figures prove that more and more businesses are floundering as a direct result of the GST?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Insolvencies</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-06-19,"—It is always good to get a question from Senator Conroy, one of the most important and powerful men on the front bench of the Labor Party—and, I might say, one of the boldest men on the front bench of the Labor Party as well. Senator Conroy is the only person I know in this parliament who can make one statement, and Mr Beazley will change a major speech. He is a man of some moment. The question was not quite as good as a Carl Zimmermann question, I have to say, but I am trying to penetrate the point that Senator Conroy was making. What has clearly upset Senator Conroy is the fact that the national accounts figures have come out and shown that the Australian economy is one of the best performing economies in the world. That was what clearly upset the Labor Party. All of us in this chamber were aware that the expectation, the hope and the prayer of the Labor Party were that the national accounts figures would be bad. All of us recognised on that day when the national accounts figures came out that there was acute depression within the ranks of the Labor Party, and rightly so. People like Senator Sherry, Senator Cook, Senator Faulkner, Mr Beazley and Mr Crean have been running the line that the Australian economy was going through the floor.
—Don't mention the GST!
—Quite the contrary: the national accounts figures came out and proved that, when you contrast our performance in the March quarter with those of comparative countries, the Australian economy is in fact one of the better performing economies today. If the thrust of the question was that this economy is not going well, the fact of the matter, Senator Conroy, is that you are wrong, and the national accounts figures prove you comprehensively wrong.
Senator Sherry said, `Don't mention the GST.' I will mention the GST, Senator Sherry. The GST must be a pretty good tax reform, because not only have I mentioned the good news on the economic front but the Labor Party itself has endorsed the GST. As I have said, Senator Conroy is one of the brightest, most powerful men in the Labor Party—and one of the boldest. As Senator Conroy has said, the Labor Party, when it comes to government, will probably have to consider raising taxes. That is what Senator Conroy said. There was one very important bit of political news on the economy today—
—What about insolvencies?
—which, if Senator Conroy could be silent for one brief moment, I will share with him. I understand that some modelling was done on roll-back. The Labor Party will keep the GST, but they will roll it back. What this modelling discovered is that roll-back equals higher interest rates. That is what it showed, so it is a double whammy with the Labor Party.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-06-19,"—I may have said this before, but I think I will say it again: if, as Senator Conroy says, the GST is so bad, why is the Labor Party proposing to keep it? It is a very simple question. Senator Conroy says that business is floundering. I point out to Senator Conroy the national accounts. I show to Senator Conroy the performance of the Australian economy in the national accounts. Senator Conroy then talks down the economy, as they always do—that is the old Labor Party standard. The problem is that the national accounts gave the lie to the Labor Party position. The fact is, as I have said, if the GST had all these adverse effects, why are you bothering to keep it?

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-06-19,"—My question is to the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz. Will the minister inform the Senate of the importance of ensuring the integrity of our electoral roll? Have there been any comments regarding the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which might have the effect of misleading voters?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Ferris.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-06-19,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Does Senator Abetz have any further examples of where the electorate could have been misled in this way?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! That really is a hypothetical question. I call Senator Bishop.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. With the row coming from the other side, perhaps you did not hear the supplementary question.
—We heard it all right. It's out of order!
—Do you mind, Senator Carr?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left will cease shouting.
—Madam President, I thought you might prefer to reconsider your ruling on the basis that you probably did not hear the supplementary question, which was: what other facts and examples has this minister got?
—I would need to check the Hansard as to what was actually said compared with what I thought was said. I will allow the supplementary question only to the extent that it was as just worded.
—Madam President, I rise further on the point of order. In my view, you correctly ruled Senator Ferris's supplementary question out of order, and you called Senator Bishop to ask the next question. I do not believe you should be bullied out of a proper ruling, which was that the supplementary question asked by Senator Ferris was out of order because it was hypothetical. Surely, Madam President, you would stand by the judgment you made as the supplementary question was asked, and surely you would stand by the call you made to Senator Bishop to ask the next question. I think it was inappropriate and improper for Senator Newman to ask you to reconsider your ruling but, as she has done it, let me ask you to reconsider the fact that you have already made a ruling and you have called Senator Bishop and now, because of a spurious point of order raised by Senator Newman, you have decided to overturn it.
—Order! We will proceed. I will call Senator Abetz to offer any further facts, and Senator Bishop will have the next opportunity.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Electoral Roll: Integrity</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-06-19,"—I thank Senator Ferris for her question and for her contribution, along with that of Senator Mason, to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which, in recent times, has brought down a very important report. The integrity of the electoral roll is fundamental to Australian democracy. That is why the government steered important electoral reforms through the parliament and why we did that in the face of Labor opposition, which is still coming to us from the Labor states. Senator Faulkner opposed roll integrity every step of the way. Indeed, two years ago, he said about electoral fraud that it was all `paranoia on the part of the government'. I wonder whether it was that paranoia that led to the Labor operative Karen Ehrmann ending up in jail. I wonder whether it was our paranoia that led to a Labor deputy premier having to resign in Queensland, and two MLAs, Grant Musgrave and Mike Kaiser, having to resign. I suppose all that was part of the Liberal government's paranoia in relation to electoral fraud. Regrettably, the Labor Party has deliberately embarked—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There are far too many senators shouting. You are in breach of the standing orders.
—Thank you, Madam President. I can understand that the Labor Party does not want to hear this, but regrettably the Labor Party is now embarked on a campaign of misinformation to try to denigrate what is a very good report. One example, which is particularly disappointing, is Mr Beazley's comments on 6AR, a Perth radio station, when he said:
Forcing voters to carry around ID with them will cause considerable confusion on Election Day at polling places. 
In the 123 pages of this report, there is no mention, no recommendation, that people be required to carry around identification on polling day. So why did Mr Beazley engage in such a campaign of misinformation, which is false and fabricated? What is worse, what is Radio 6AR designed to do? Its demographics are that 65 per cent of its listening audience are young Aboriginal people under the age of 25. 6AR is a radio station designed to assist the Aboriginal community—the community for which Senator Faulkner and Mr Beazley profess so much concern in relation to the suggestion of integrity of the electoral roll. 
They cannot beat us on that fundamental issue of integrity at time of enrolment, so they had to fabricate a recommendation which does not exist and then, to compound his felony, Mr Beazley goes on to blame the Liberal Party for this fabricated recommendation. If Mr Beazley cannot even talk straight on these sorts of fundamental issues, it shows absolutely and clearly that this is part of his performance. We all remember when he told the Australian people the budget was in surplus, only to find out later that it was $10.3 billion in deficit. This is the sort of form that Mr Beazley is undertaking as a leader in this country. He will sink to the depths of deliberately misleading Aboriginal youth in this country so he can try to get a few votes—
—Order! Senator, you should rephrase that.
—In which way, Madam President?
—In terms of a reflection on the Leader of the Opposition.
—Madam President, did I say `deliberately misleading'?
—I believe so.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-06-19,"—I can understand why Senator Faulkner would not wish me to give any further examples of misinformation about the committee's report, because Senator Faulkner was the prime architect of a lot of the misinformation. Just as one example, he suggested that voter identification at the time of enrolment would somehow disenfranchise migrants. For migrants to become eligible for the electoral roll, they have to become Australian citizens. To become Australian citizens, they have to provide sufficient documentation—indeed, more documentation than would be required for them to get onto the electoral roll. This is another gross example of misrepresentation.

Can the minister confirm that a number of exemptions from the care standards, granted to 19 nursing homes by the Minister for Aged Care late last year, expire today and tomorrow? Why hasn't there been a public statement by the government to clarify the status of these 19 facilities?

Mrs Bishop has done an excellent job in this respect and is continuing to do so.
—Waffle, waffle.
—I note that Senator Faulkner interjects and says, `Waffle,' because he is not interested in anything that this government has to say. He knows full well the shortage of hospital beds before we came to government. He knows how many beds per thousand were available for people in aged care under the previous Labor government, and he knows what this government has done to improve that number.

I spent some considerable time in opposition, and I can assure the opposition that if they want to come in here every day and waste their time by asking about individual nursing homes, on which there may not be a brief provided by the minister, all they are doing is wasting a question, which of course stops some other senator asking a good question which has been knocked off by their questions committee.
If you want the more minute detail with respect to the vast number of homes and facilities that there might be in Australia, the sensible thing to do in opposition would be to ring up and say, `I'd like to ask about a certain nursing home.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by Senators Bolkus and Brown today relating to the Kyoto Protocol and climate change.
It became clear in question time today that this government's greenhouse policy—this government's global warming policy—is in tatters. It is failing domestically—we have evidence of that—and it is failing internationally. In a sense, you could say that it is schizophrenic. Senator Hill tells us that the Kyoto process continues but he also tells us that, regardless of what happens, the Australian government will not be party to it at the end of the day. They will not ratify it. It is a bit like building a road to nowhere: `We are going to go to the meetings. We might be involved in the processes.' But the government have said that they would not sign up; they would not ratify at the end.
Senator Hill wants us to believe that his going to the odd meeting in the next few months—and we know he likes to travel internationally—is a commitment to the process. But you have got to have a commitment to both the process and the outcome—unless, as I say, the government are essentially building a very expensive road to nowhere. Mr Downer tells us today that the government's position is not the same as the US. Senator Hill tells us the same. But already these very same ministers over recent weeks have declared the Kyoto process dead. Already they have stated on the public record that they would not be party to an outcome. 
We saw again today that this government has been involved in preparing the last rites for the Kyoto process. As I indicated in question time today, Mr Bruce Billson, a very close confidant of the minister, a trusted ally, let the cat out of the bag in a meeting in Hobart—the minister had been discussing this issue with EPA head, Todd Whitman; the minister had given the green light to the Bush plan; and ministerial colleagues publicly had already done that. But now we find out today that there have been secret discussions between this administration and the US, and the purport and the effect of those discussions have basically been to saddle up with the Bush agenda.
In light of this, in response to questions in question time today, the minister would not tell us when those discussions took place, would not tell us the degree of those discussions and would not tell us what expression of attitude was given to the US government—but Mr Billson did just a few weeks ago. The minister may hold his head in his hands at the mention of the name Billson, because Mr Billson is the person designated by this minister as his successor in this portfolio. We know that; Bruce has been telling the whole world that. We know how close he is to the minister. What we have here today, and what we had previously, is this government finding the alternative road to addressing climate change as more attractive. But in doing so, what is it doing? The government is junking a process which has gone on for some number of years and it is embarking upon a new process—and it is embarking upon that process with the sceptics, not with those who are committed to redressing global warming. The government is committed to a process on a road to nowhere with President Bush and those who are sceptical about the effect of global warming. It is linking itself to the US oil companies, to Dick Cheney and to President Bush.
The first thing this government can do in the light of all this is to drag those expensive ads that they are running night after night, day after day, in prime time involving, amongst others, Don Burke. There is $3.9 million of advertising basically showing that this government's position on this issue is schizophrenic and hypocritical. They want the public to believe that they care, but generally and effectively internationally they are telling the world community that they are not going to be part of an outcome. They do have a credibility problem, in particular this minister. He has private discussions with Todd Whitman on the one hand, though just a few weeks ago he was saying to the Australian public, `I'm keen to get the Kyoto protocol implemented.' 
The fact of the matter is that, despite what he has been saying domestically and despite what Don Burke tries to tell the Australian public, this government has pulled the plug on the Kyoto process. In doing so, it has pulled the plug on the international community. What a great strategy. Failing domestically, the 1999 national greenhouse gas inventory shows emissions at some 17.4 per cent over 1990 levels, and internationally what the government has done is sideline Australia from the debate, line us up with President Bush and turn our backs on the rest of the world. We are amongst a very small number of nations lined up with President Bush. The Labor Party is committed to seeing this process continue to an outcome and to trying to get the protocol ratified in the time line of 2002.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-06-19,"—Senator Bolkus said the Labor Party is committed to trying to get the protocol ratified within the time line of 2002. What does that mean? Does that mean that the Labor Party has a policy position to, come what may, ratify by 2002? If so, why won't Senator Bolkus say that clearly and unambiguously? He will not say that because there are not rules for the Kyoto protocol. There are not rules in relation to the extent to which the flexibility mechanisms can be utilised. There are not rules in relation to compliance. Senator Bolkus does not know the extent to which an incoming Labor government would be entitled to claim additional sinks under clause 3.4. In those circumstances, no responsible government would ratify.
So what is Senator Bolkus doing? He is trying again—as the Labor Party does so often—to send two messages. The first is a message to the Greens—and Senator Brown might listen to this—saying, `You should believe that we will ratify in 2002 although we have not really said that,' while at the same time he can go to industry, the aluminium manufacturers and so forth and say, `We didn't give a firm commitment to ratify come what may.' It is the same old doubletalk that we are hearing from Labor so often in this run-up to the next election.
I would have thought by now we ought to know what the Labor Party's policies are in relation to greenhouse gases—not only whether or not they will ratify the Kyoto protocol but whether they will issue a domestic cap and trade system without the Kyoto protocol. That was the issue that got Senator Bolkus into so much trouble at the last federal conference of the Labor Party when his recommended motion had to be gutted before being debated on the floor. So all sectors, both the Greens and industry, would like to know whether Labor are going to implement domestic binding constraints without there being an international trading arrangement. We know that Senator Faulkner, when he was the environment minister under Labor, took a proposal to government to introduce carbon taxes. Is that the unstated agenda of the Beazley alternative government? If that is their policy, why haven't they got the political courage to come out and say it?
What we do not know—what we have no idea of—is their alternative in relation to a domestic program. What we do know is that the government has put down a program of domestic reform, which we announced in detail in November 1997, which was backed up with dollars and which has been added to significantly since. That program covers all sectors that contribute to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. I mentioned in question time that power stations are going to have to meet new emission standards. We are requiring new motor vehicle emission standards matched by new fuel quality standards. We have already passed the legislation through this place. We have a huge investment in renewable energy, and not only the investment up front of putting dollars into the commercialisation of new products. In all, we have some $350 million invested in renewable energy, but we have also passed compulsory renewable legislation that is going to require a $2 billion investment from industry to be met.
So I could go on down the list: the Cities for Climate Change, which is the most successful local government program of its type in the world; the achievements that have already been put on the board through the Greenhouse Challenge program, which is our voluntary program for industry; and the role being played by the Australian Greenhouse Office, which is still the only dedicated government office of its type in the world. The government is implementing a comprehensive suite of actions, backed by a budget of approximately $1 billion, designed to enable Australia to achieve the target that we accepted in Kyoto that would require of Australia a fair share of the burden in reducing global greenhouse gases. So, on one side, the government has a clear and unambiguous program—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Environment: Global Warming</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-06-19,"—Again what we have heard is a milksop about what this government could be doing with the environment—not what it is doing. We have not heard from Senator Hill where he started, and perhaps it is worth while in this debate to go back to that. Senator Hill put out a press release on 29 April 1998. The headline reads `Hill Signs Historic Agreement to Fight Global Warming'. He regarded it as a war then, and it seems that he is losing the scrap badly. What he said back then was:
Today's signing will again send a strong signal to the international community that Australia is prepared to accept a fair share of the burden.
Senator Hill went on to say:
...Australia will now work constructively with the international community to resolve several outstanding issues before considering ratifying the protocol.
We are still at that point; we do not seem to have gone one step further. We do not seem to have sat down and addressed the issues that need to be addressed. We do not seem to have gone to the international community and said, with frankness, `We need to resolve these matters.' In fact, on 26 April 2000, Senator Hill put out a press release with the headline `Hill addresses key global warming forum'; this was a forum held in the United States. The telling phrase in that press release is at the end, where it states:
Senator Hill says Australia will continue to work with other nations to resolve the outstanding technical issues in time for the next Conference of the Parties in The Hague in November.
That has already gone past. What is more disturbing is that from 1998 to 2000 we have had two years of `we'll work through this, we'll negotiate and we'll see what the issues are and whether we can resolve them'—a lot of what perhaps is called `hot air'. This is about greenhouse gas emissions, and so perhaps the term is appropriate.
We also find that the transcript relating to the launch of the National Greenhouse Strategy talks about some of the very issues Senator Hill went to today. That transcript states:
One year on, at the meeting we've just completed in Buenos Aires, we had the challenge of trying to drive the Kyoto protocol further forward. And what we've done is that we've accepted that, all of the flexible mechanisms, joint implementation, emissions trading, the clean development mechanism, the rules under which they are to operate, which are designed to assist the developed world in meeting its commitment, must be settled within the next two years.
That was on 26 November 1998. We all know that they are words that surround greenhouse gas emissions; what we have not heard from Senator Hill are words addressing the international community about resolving some of these issues. Senator Hill needs to come clean. He needs to be able to tell the international community that he will meet them in Bonn; he will meet with a proactive drive forward, as he puts it in his launching statement, about how and where those issues will be resolved, rather than simply mouthing phrases about it. We then find on 19 May 2001 a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald that reads `Cancel Bonn meeting on Kyoto: Hill'. In that article it is stated:
Senator Hill said there seemed little point going ahead with the continuation of the Convention of the Parties (COP6) meeting in Bonn in July when COP7 was due for November anyway.
We have this backward step. But where has this backward step come from? Has it come from Senator Hill all on his own, or is it something that has come out of cabinet? Has Senator Hill been ruffled and rolled in cabinet? We will not know, unless Senator Hill comes clean. But, when we look at the evidence that is there, it can be seen that, in fact, that is what has happened; he is looking very ruffled about it. We then go forward to Monday 18 June where a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald reads `EU puts pressure on Australia in bid to revive Kyoto'. From Senator Hill's answer today, we heard that he is still blowing in the wind about what he might do. Senator Hill should tell the Senate what the position is.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-06-19,"—This question of greenhouse is one of the major issues facing us in the world today, and the Australian government continues to regard the threat posed by climate change as an issue of great importance. It is an issue of enormous importance, because it could change the climate of the world. That would result in a very different set of circumstances for countries such as the Pacific islands were the ocean levels to rise and flood those low-lying countries. And, of course, it would alter in many ways the lifestyle of people all over the world were the fears about climate change proved to be correct. So there is no question that the Australian government does regard climate change as a major issue to be addressed by the present government—and by any Australian government, no matter what its political colour, at any time in the future.
The Australian government indicated when they signed the Kyoto protocol in April 1998 that possible future ratification of the protocol was dependent upon satisfactory outcomes in four key outstanding areas. They were sinks, compliance, flexibility mechanisms and the involvement of developing countries. Australia has consistently argued that an effective international framework to address climate change needs to be economically manageable and to involve developing countries. There is very little point in the countries of Europe, the countries of North America and perhaps Australia and New Zealand signing on to the Kyoto agreement when vast areas of the world are not participating in any programs at all to reduce greenhouse emissions. In particular, one has to think about huge countries like China consuming huge amounts of hydrocarbon fuel and greatly adding to the level of greenhouse gas emissions around the world. If countries like China, the Russian Federation and the countries of South and East Asia are not involved, then the efforts by other countries to reduce greenhouse emissions become somewhat irrelevant because the net effect on the level of greenhouse emissions will be almost none at all. That is a matter which has concerned the Australian government and to which they have given a great deal of thought.
If you think about the principles underlying any new approach which might be described as a modified Kyoto approach, such an approach must deliver similar long-term climate change outcomes to those implied by the protocol but perhaps in a more equitable way. There must be a means of seeking to minimise harm to future generations, and it makes sense to minimise harm to this generation as well. The solution to anthropogenic climate change lies in developing new technologies, which requires both a reasonable time frame and international supply side policies to bring about results.
The Australia government has done a great deal to reduce greenhouse emissions in this country through its domestic greenhouse program. That program is supported by funding of almost a billion dollars over five years, and it embraces a wide range of strategies including investing $400 million over four years in projects that will provide cost-effective greenhouse emission abatement, substantial funding to develop the renewable energy industry complemented by the renewable energy fund which has provided funding for windmill power generators in the north of Western Australia and given a million dollars in showcase funding to the Derby tidal power project. The government has supported the increased use of efficient energy production mechanisms.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-19,"—All of us, I think, agree that global warming is one of the great issues that this parliament has to deal with and that action far beyond that which the international community is taking, as indicated by the Kyoto protocol, is going to have to be implemented very rapidly if we are to turn around the impact on the environment, the economy and the lifestyle of the next generation of Australians and people around the world that global warming threatens. It is not just supply side that is going to have to be looked at, as Senator Eggleston indicated, but demand side. We have to stop being a greedy, self-invested generation that do not think about the next generations. That is why it is so heartening when you get an international leader like the Prime Minister of Sweden Mr Goran Persson who, in the wake of President Bush's welching on the Kyoto protocol, said just last week at Gothenburg:
So it's not a problem for Japan, it's not a problem for Sweden or for Australia, it's a problem for all our children and that's a situation we have to address.
I was heartened to get the response from the minister for the environment at question time, hard as it was to extract, because for the first time we see a gap between the Bush administration's position and Mr Howard's position. When asked specifically, the minister said we don't have the same position as the United States when it comes to compliance with the treaty. The United States has withdrawn from its commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by five per cent. We stick with our commitment, which allows us to increase them by eight per cent. This is a very important difference, because just a week or two ago Mr Howard was saying he understands the Bush administration's position but now we have disapproval of the Bush administration's position. It is important because the Australian public disapproves of the Bush administration's position. There is a by-election coming up at Aston in Melbourne on 14 July and there is a national election coming up at the end of the year, and global warming and the environment are going to be on the agenda and are going to be in the minds of voters.
I do agree with Senator Hill that the opposition, the Labor Party, should make its position clear. It should take some advice from a past Labor minister for the environment Mr Graham Richardson, who said that Labor should get behind the Kyoto protocol. We know that Europe and Japan are going to sort out the fine print, but the objective of the Kyoto protocol is to implement a regime for reducing the output of greenhouse gases internationally by wealthy countries by five per cent come the year 2010.
It is a very modest target—five per cent—whereas scientists tell us that if we are to stop global warming by mid-century, we need to reduce greenhouse gases by 70 to 90 per cent. This is a very tiny step. If the Labor Party wants to win votes from the Australian people, it should put a difference between itself and the government, and it needs to be very explicit and say, `We will get behind the Kyoto protocol. When this European delegation comes to Australia, if we come to government at the end of this year, we will back the path you are setting in leading the world away from this global warming monstrosity that is stalking the lives of the next generation.'
On the matter of that top level EU delegation, the minister indicated that, if it is at ministerial level, he will meet them; if there is a prime minister there, the Prime Minister will meet them. That is very important, because I will use my green contacts in Sweden and Belgium to put on as much pressure as I can for their prime ministers to come on that delegation. They know a lot more about global warming than Prime Minister Howard. It would be instructive for him to hear from prime ministers who have the responsibility to at least bring onto their agenda the rights and interests of the next generation.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2001-06-19,"—On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Works, I present report No. 6 of 2001 relating to the proposed Commonwealth Law Courts, Adelaide, South Australia. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, this report relates to the construction of a purpose-built building to accommodate four Federal courts:
1.	the High Court;
2.	the Federal Court;
3.	the Family Court; and 
4.	the Federal Magistrates Service. 
Purpose-built Commonwealth law courts have already been completed in Hobart, Sydney and Parramatta, Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne.  Adelaide is the only State capital without its own purpose built premises.
The need
The Committee supports the proposed development in Adelaide and is of the view that the building is long overdue.
The need for the proposal arose from the deficiencies in the existing leased space.  A lack of space in the existing accommodation has significantly limited the number of people that can attend court trials. 
In the absence of the new building, future growth of the courts could only be met by leasing extra space at the Grenfell Centre, the current accommodation.  This situation would lead to extra leased space on non-contiguous floors.  The result would not only be inconvenient to court officials, but would compromise the level of security that could be provided.
Security
The question of ensuring security is a major concern and was a fundamental consideration in the implementation of the Commonwealth courts program. 
The current security arrangements in Adelaide are inadequate and below the standard set in other Commonwealth law court buildings.
Project cost
Madam President I would like to make a few comments about the cost of the project.  
On 8 February 2001, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration referred this project in the House to the Public Works Committee for consideration and report, the cost was $73.7 million. 
A few days before the public hearing, on 27 April 2001, this figure was revised upwards and the project is currently estimated at $76.6 million.
While the Committee accepts that the nature of design and construction for such projects may require some cost variation, the Committee expects that agencies proposing public works should ensure cost estimates meet three criteria when a work is referred to the Public Works Committee.  
The criteria are that cost estimates be:
1.	detailed;
2.	accurate; and
3.	current.
Public access - a State/Local government issue
During the Inquiry, the Committee was confronted with an issue that was of particular concern to the South Australian Government and the Adelaide City Council.  The issue related to the closure of a small public thoroughfare as part of the building site.  The public access road was identified as Nelson Street. 
The Committee views the question of access as one for resolution between the State and local governments.  However, the Committee urges the continuation of dialogue between all parties concerned in order that they may reach a satisfactory outcome.
Heritage issue
Madam President, the Committee is strongly of the view that major Commonwealth buildings, such as the proposed Commonwealth law courts in Adelaide should express our contemporary culture and form part of our national heritage. 
The proposed Commonwealth courts complex will be located in the Victoria Square conservation area in Adelaide, which is entered in the Register of the National Estate. As such, the proposed complex should accord with its surroundings. 
To this end, the Australian Heritage Commission and Heritage South Australia made a number of suggestions aimed at ensuring that the heritage values of the Victoria Square conservation area are maintained. They relate to the design of the building, a more subdued treatment of the facade and ongoing consultation about the proposed materials and finishes to be used.
The Committee supports these suggestions and is pleased that the Department of Finance an Administration has already incorporated elements of these proposals in their revised design plans. 
Recommendations
The Committee has recommended that the Department of Finance and Administration ensure ongoing consultation in relation to heritage and access matters are maintained with the Australian Heritage Commission and the Adelaide City Council.
The Committee has recommended that the proposed construction of  a Commonwealth law courts complex in Adelaide proceed at a cost of $76.60 million.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-19,"—I was part of the way through speaking on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2001 when the Senate moved to the adjournment last night. I will continue to put forward the Democrats' position on this bill. I was speaking about the government's use of this bill to exclude the funding provided through this grants bill being utilised by people wishing to export X-rated products. That is a part of the bill the Democrats are not opposing—indeed, we are not opposing any of the bill—but we draw attention to it to highlight that the government recognises that it is appropriate to shape funding schemes, subsidy schemes, grants and the like so that the government is not subsidising harmful products, whether they be socially harmful, environmentally harmful or whatever.
The Democrats are concerned about the ability of the scheme to allow the support of businesses that export products made from native forests. I have circulated a few amendments and that issue is addressed in one of them. I will speak to the amendments a little bit now to save me expanding on them at length in the committee stage of the bill. It is certainly not my intent to delay the legislation. I think it is important to put forward some of these issues. The scheme allows support and subsidisation of industries that export products made from native forests. It also allows the support of industries that develop, produce and export fossil fuels that will increase our greenhouse emissions.
In the Democrats view, we should not be using extra subsidies to encourage the development of these products. We are not trying to ban them overnight or anything like that. They are legal products and those industries continue to operate as industries. But providing extra taxpayer funds to subsidise the expansion and export of such industries is undesirable. In this case, the scheme offers $750 million, or $150 million over five years. That is a fair amount of public funds. In the Democrats view, it is quite appropriate to ensure that those subsidies do not help promote the expansion of industries that should not be expanded.
We have heard recently in this chamber of the need to change our approach and our attitude on climate change issues. Certainly, although there is no indication that fossil fuel exports or native forest products comprise a major part of the scheme, grants to the fossil fuel industry and to forest product industry people have occurred. We believe that that is not the best use of public funds. Currently, the scheme provides no ethical framework for assessing grant applications. Exporters of guns are as likely to be funded as exporters of educational software. We put forward an amendment as well that requires that applications for subsidies under this scheme be assessed against ethical criteria. The criteria are not contained in the amendment but would be developed in regulations and would ensure that Australian exports are not only moneymakers but ambassadors for the kind of society that we want to be.
We also have an amendment that relates to provisions in the current scheme that allow certain information to remain secret under the very broad tent of commercial-in-confidence. Again, this is not out of the ordinary, but it is a practice that the Democrats believe has grown out of control. We need to stop this continuing hiding of details in relation to expenditure of public funds under this very broad definition of commercial-in-confidence. If an activity represents a trade secret or a secret process that is not protected by other means, preventing the release of that information is legitimate. To prevent release of information about a product, a location or other data under the excuse of commercial-in-confidence should not be supported. The Democrat amendment seeks to ensure particularly that, when private businesses avail themselves of public money, their activities are appropriately open to public scrutiny and accountability.
These amendments are not comprehensive. They simply put forward a few areas that we believe need to be taken into account whenever we are looking at schemes that involve a significant expenditure of public funds and the subsidising of corporations and business activities. Again, it is not something the Democrats oppose per se. We strongly believe that it is appropriate in many circumstances to provide public assistance for the development of appropriate business activities and exports. Hence, we are supporting this bill, which provides for the continuation of the scheme. We do believe it is time we started to look at shaping more appropriately the expenditure of such significant amounts of public funds, whether it is on ethical grounds or in relation to environmental or other social grounds—as, indeed, the government has done in a very limited way in this bill in relation to X-rated material. 
There are a number of other issues that the Democrats believe could be considered. This bill provides for the scheme to be reviewed in about four years time, so they can be included then. There is an issue about whether the eight-year period of the scheme is too long and whether it could be shorter. Most of the evidence is that the majority of the benefits provided by the scheme occur in the earlier years of the scheme, rather than the later years in terms of when businesses first access it. Also, there may be more scope for an industry based rather than an individual business based approach as a target for export industry subsidies and we may be able to do more to use these schemes to promote the export of innovation in areas that have specific importance, such as alternative energy, education and other environmental areas. There may be other mechanisms and areas where the scheme should not be available and where we should not be encouraging further development of other industries, whether on environmental or social grounds.
The scheme has been operating for over 25 years now, and it has obviously been successful at many basic levels. But the Democrats believe it is time for such subsidy schemes to become smarter and more representative of community concerns and values and to not simply look at dollars and cents but also take into account the triple bottom line—economic, environmental and social values—and combine those rather than simply deal with things on a purely dollars and cents basis. We made a limited attempt to start in that direction with some of the amendments I put forward, which I will address in slightly more detail in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-06-19,"—I thank all the senators for their contributions. The EMDG Scheme has proven a success in assisting small business to export, and it is a key plank in the government's strategy for a robust, internationally competitive economy. The EMDG Scheme complements the government's other efforts to promote Australian trade and exports through reduced trade barriers and by improving our trade representation around the globe. The Labor Party—who did not support the new tax system and who now do not know whether they support it and how much they will roll it back—failed to acknowledge that since the introduction of the GST the new tax system has removed $3.5 billion in indirect taxes on exporters every year.
Wholesale sales tax, as it accumulated, had a trickle-down effect on items from the farm gate or from the manufacturer right through to export—they were riddled with trickle-down wholesale sales tax. Now those exports are free of the shackles of $3.5 billion in indirect taxes on exporters every year, and that makes Australian exports much more competitive, which has been reflected in our export record. Each year the EMDG Scheme assists about 3,000 businesses to get into export. These businesses generate $4.5 billion in exports. They employ an estimated 54,000 Australians to fill their export orders. Twenty-one per cent of these grants go to businesses in rural and regional Australia.
Senator Cook, in his speech during the second reading debate, suggested that the EMDG Scheme is no longer attractive to small business. He may be interested to note pages 26 and 27 of the report of the EMDG review, which point out that approximately 70 per cent of grant applicants have a turnover of less than $5 million, 65 per cent have fewer than 25 employees and approximately 90 per cent have annual export earnings under $5 million per annum. This makes it clear that the scheme is very well targeted to the small business sector. As well, the measures proposed in the current bill—such as the reduction in the entry threshold from 20,000 to 15,000 and the removal of compulsory registration for first time claimants—will make the scheme even more attractive to small business.
Senator Cook also described the bill as a snub to the Australian tourism sector. I suggest that Senator Cook go back and look at the record of EMDG under Labor. He will find that many of the things he said in his speech in the second reading debate were actually incorrect. They were myth making furphies, which is typical of the Labor Party: say whatever you think, say whatever it takes—it does not matter. Sacrifice the truth, and just say whatever you think.
So Senator Cook described this bill as a snub of the Australian tourism sector, but in fact the share of the EMDG going to the tourism industry has increased from 9.6 per cent in the 1995 grant year—and I might just remind people on the other side that is when they were in government—to 13.7 per cent in the 1999-2000 grant year. If the EMDG program neglects tourism, it neglected it even more under Labor. In fact, as I said, it has gone from 9.6 per cent to 13.7 per cent. Before 1996 the tourism industry's access to EMDG was limited because, while all other industries enjoyed a 50 per cent grant rate, tourism claimants—apart from inbound tourism operators—received only 25 per cent. The coalition government addressed this inequity in 1996 and gave all tourism claimants access to the full 50 per cent grant rate.
Previous speakers have highlighted the benefits of the scheme and given examples of the very broad range of firms representing all industry sectors that are building their exports with assistance from the EMDG Scheme. Senator Cook also stated:
Austrade's administration of the EMDG seems more focused on compliance than on export promotion ...
He says that is because:
... close to 20 percent of reimbursement claims are rejected by Austrade.
I ask Senator Cook to go back and check the facts. I have got these books I have published—two of them. Lies, damned lies and statistics, volume 1, was a whole lot of misrepresentations and myths put about by Labor members. Then I needed to have volume 2. I am working very assiduously on volume 2, edition 2, because we now have so many more that I can add to it.
So here is another one, that Austrade's administration of the EMDG seems more focused on compliance than on export promotion because close to 20 per cent of reimbursement claims are rejected by Austrade. Wrong, wrong, wrong. In fact, over the last 10 years, the average rejection rate—and here I refer to where claims are rejected in total and no grant is paid—has been just under 10 per cent.
Senator Cook needs to go back, check his facts and make sure he is not one of the regular myth makers on the Labor side. He could go back and check, but there was error after error in his second reading contribution. For example, for the grant year immediately passed—1999-2000—the rejection rate was 9.98 per cent. It is interesting to note that the highest rejection rates for the last 10 years occurred in relation to the 1992-93 and 1993-94 grant years when the figures were 10.66 and 11.95 per cent respectively when Labor was in government. They were nowhere near the 20 per cent that Senator Cook referred to, but they were still higher under Labor. Senator Cook, go back, check your facts and, when you come in to give a speech on the second reading, make sure you have got them clear.
To give certainty to industry concerning the future of the scheme, the government publicly committed to the continuation of the scheme in August 2000, soon after receiving the report of the review. The bill before the Senate delivers on that promise to extend the EMDG Scheme for another five years as recommended by the Austrade board after its comprehensive review of the scheme in 1999 and 2000. It makes a number of changes to the scheme that will be of great benefit to the small business sector. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-19,"—I rise to speak to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Bill 2001. In doing so I indicate that the opposition supports the legislation and will probably support many of the amendments that will be before the chamber this afternoon. We start from the position that we believe that Australia has an incredible diversity of ecosystems and species, many of which do not occur anywhere else. Our natural assets are indeed rich and extensive. Our landscapes have been changing over the millennia, but the rate of change is dramatically increasing. We are losing our biodiversity, and I think there is a growing awareness of this in the community. Since European settlement, there have been profound changes to our environment. We have lost an estimated 75 per cent of our rainforests and 40 per cent of our total forest area, and nearly 70 per cent of all native vegetation has been removed or significantly modified by human activity. Our record of mammal species extinctions is the worst for any country, having lost some 10 of 144 original marsupials and 8 of 54 native rodents, with 23 per cent currently listed as extinct, endangered or vulnerable. It has also been predicted that half of our land based bird species will become extinct during this century. The Australian Conservation Foundation noted in one of its most recent publications, A Natural Advantage:
While extinction is a natural part of the evolutionary process, the current rate of human-induced global extinctions is between 1,000 and 10,000 times the natural rate. Today's extinction rate has not been matched since the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago.
...	...	...
Although human-induced changes have affected the Australian landscape for 50,000 years or more, the changes in the 200 years since European colonisation have caused catastrophic loss of soil, vegetation and biodiversity.
Australia is not the only country in which biodiversity is at risk; global species extinctions continue at a frightening rate. In the 1996 state of the environment report, it was recognised that loss of biodiversity was perhaps our most serious environmental problem. It is under threat from habitat destruction, land clearing, inappropriate and ecologically insensitive developments, climate change and the apathy and lack of commitment of governments—in our case, the Howard government. 
It is also under threat from the global trade in endangered species. The illegal trade in wildlife is second only to the illegal trade in drugs. It is therefore not only important but also imperative that any illegal trade is strictly regulated. In the past, poor management and regulation have led to the extinction or near extinction of species. For a while, the koala population suffered a significant decrease in numbers as a result of the fur trade. Trade in fisheries has led to the near extinction of some species: the patagonian toothfish, the whale shark, the orange roughie and the blue shark. 
The gouldian finch has suffered enormously. Although there are less than 200 pairs of finch left in the wild, there are 50,000 to 100,000 currently in captivity around the world. Even the crocodile for a while was overhunted with trade in its skins. We have been lucky that its numbers have seen a dramatic recovery since it was protected. Let us hope that we do not lose to the cane toad what we managed to save from the skin trade. But it is not enough to merely stop extinction. Stopping it is one thing, but we must also stop these species from becoming endangered. The Labor Party feels that it is essential that the current ban on live commercial trade in native wildlife is maintained. 
The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Bill 2001 amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The objectives of this bill are to ensure that Australia complies with its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora—the CITES convention. Those obligations are to protect wildlife that may be adversely affected by trade, to promote the conservation of biodiversity in Australia and other countries, to ensure that any commercial utilisation of Australian native wildlife for the purpose of export is managed in an ecologically sustainable way, and to promote the humane treatment of wildlife. We support the objectives of this bill, although we remain concerned about the considerable shortcomings in the approach to the protection of biodiversity and the environment under this Howard government. 
As the government foreshadowed in its consultation process for the reform of Commonwealth environment legislation, this bill incorporates the Wildlife Protection Act into the EPBC Act. Many of the amendments in this bill represent either a continuation of current legislation or an improvement in both process and outcome. The bill incorporates the amended provisions of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982—the Wildlife Protection Act, as it is known—into the EPBC Act. The bill repeals the Wildlife Protection Act and provides for effective savings and transitional arrangements for decisions and processes under that act. It makes some minor consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation as a consequence of this incorporation and introduces three technical amendments to the EPBC legislation to improve the operation of the environmental assessment and approval processes of the EPBC Act. The legislation is designed to overcome some of the inefficiencies and enforcement difficulties of the current legislation and addresses some of the issues raised in the Senate inquiry into the commercial utilisation of Australian wildlife. 
As I said, we support the provisions of the bill, but we do recognise that it has quite a number of failings. One of those failings that we always find in this government's legislation is the failure to really recognise indigenous Australians and their role in environmental matters—and in broad matters generally. In this case, we have a bill that fails to recognise or respect the cultural property, attachments and the rights of indigenous Australians. It is one of those shortcomings which, I think, shows the mental block of this government when it comes to some of these issues. We believe that substantial revision of the EPBC legislation is required. As we indicated during the original EPBC debate, we are committed to overhaul that legislation if we are elected to government, and we are committed to overhauling it in an endeavour to restore Commonwealth responsibility and national leadership.
As a sign of this legislation's inadequacy, we have yet another attempt to fix some of the many shortcomings of the legislation. New amendments introduced by the government in this bill to the EPBC legislation include: the ability to make regulations to identify actions that are taken to have had a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance to provide greater certainty for stakeholders; the ability for the minister to issue an evidentiary certificate to prevent a person taking an action that would represent a breach of the EPBC Act prior to a decision being made on whether an approval will be granted for the action; and, where a person fails to respond to a request to make a referral, the ability for the minister to make a decision as to whether approval is required under the EPBC Act.
It is disappointing for us that we have to go through this process now. It is disappointing because these are some of the areas that we sought to amend when this legislation first came through the parliament. We were gazumped by that overnight deal between the government and the Australian Democrats. They did a deal not only on the final outcome of the legislation but also to gag the original debate on these issues. Some hundreds of amendments that were being floated at the time did not see the light of day because of the guillotine, the gag, that was imposed by the Democrat-government deal to fast-track the legislation. If they had listened then, if they had given the public some time to consult on the legislation and the amendments that they were pursuing at that particular time, we would not have to go through this process now. What we have now, some 15 months after the event, is this government stealing Labor Party initiatives that were to be moved during that previous debate—initiatives that were, in fact, circulated during that previous debate.
As I said, we find the source legislation inadequate and, as indicated previously, we will subject the EPBC legislation to a full-scale review. We will seek to broaden the scope of the legislation in accordance with the COAG agreement of 1992, introduce a greenhouse and land clearing trigger and include a national interest fall back provision to allow for Commonwealth involvement in matters of national environmental significance. We will seek to strengthen the public accountability and transparency of decision making provisions to ensure precision and fairness criteria for the exercise of ministerial discretion and limitation on the scope of delegation by the minister. We will seek to maintain adequate levels of enforcement provisions, including in some circumstances criminal penalties. We will also seek to ensure that state assessment processes and procedures are at least the same standard as for the Commonwealth. The legislation that we have in place now stands as an ongoing monument to a quick, secret and dirty deal conceived between the government and the Democrats. It is in major need of amendment. We are seeing some amendment now, but that amendment does not go anywhere near as far as we would like. 
I understand that the Democrats will be moving a significant number of amendments. As I said, we will seek to support as many of those as possible. In respect of some of them, we will see how the debate goes, but we are disposed to support those amendments in general. I said also that we will support the bill. It is a positive step towards the ongoing protection of biodiversity. However, we also recognise that, in itself, this bill does not guarantee the protection of our unique biological heritage.
There are a number of matters which could further be raised in this debate. We could look, for instance, at other critical steps that governments can take to address loss of biodiversity and protection of endangered species. The need, for instance, for an end to the ongoing decline in the quality and extent of native vegetation. We must bring land clearing under control. The only party that has actually come up with a comprehensive and cohesive policy to this effect has been the Labor Party, and Kim Beazley announced that policy a few weeks ago. There is a need to complete the national reserve system and to properly resource the management of existing reserves. We have had promise after promise from the Howard government. In 1996 they promised that they would commit $80 million over four years to the development of a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity, and they sought and promised to do so under the Natural Heritage Trust. After the first four years, they have only spent $25.9 million of that $80 million. Even after five years, that will be $58 million. This is, I suppose, symptomatic of this government's policy and practice in this area. They promise, they do not deliver; and when they spread the money that they initially promise over a number of extra years they claim that they are allocating new funds. I do not think the public is any longer conned by this sort of approach. 
The other example of direct concern in this area is the need to control weeds and feral animals. Once again, the Howard Government promised in 1996 that they would commit $16 million over four years. After the first four years of the NHT, only $10.9 million has been spent. In 1996 they promised, as I said, $19 million over five years towards the finalisation and implementation of the National Weeds Strategy. After that first five-year period, only $10 million has been spent. The practice has basically been to make commitments, not spend the money, and then claim, when they are spending the original resources over a longer period, that they are actually spending more. It is a con job; it is a pea and thimble trick. As I say, I think the public is tired of this minister and this government trying to manipulate the budgetary system in the way that they have under the NHT. This legislation goes some way to addressing the problem. We will support it. As I said earlier, we look positively disposed towards the Democrat amendments.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-19,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Bill 2001. I have a particular interest in this area of the use of Australia's wildlife, in particular wildlife trade and the import and export of wildlife. In many ways, it is worth noting that this bill has been many years in gestation and in part is a response to issues raised in a Senate committee inquiry into the commercial use of our native wildlife that was initiated in 1996, before I came into this chamber. This legislation is broader than simply commercial use and export; it also relates to import. It deals with the very significant issue of biodiversity but it also deals with other issues such as individual animal welfare. 
The bill proposes to bring into the general Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act wildlife trade provisions that are currently in the Wildlife Protection Act. In doing so, the bill makes some improvements on the existing act, in other places it simply transfers existing powers, and it does make some other modifications. The bill regulates the international movement of wildlife species and specimens through a mix of permits, approved plans and various exemptions. It enables Australia to meet its obligations as a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora—otherwise known as CITES. This convention has 154 countries as signatories who cooperate in the banning of international commercial trade in endangered species. 
The fact that this convention exists highlights some of the dangers in simply putting economic dollars and cents and immediate short-term market values on the use of our wildlife. It is an issue that, in a sense, is a specific example of what I was speaking about in relation to amendments the Democrats moved on a previous bill—that is, you cannot simply put a short-term dollars and cents, market driven viewpoint onto every transaction; you have to look at environmental consequences, particularly in terms of biodiversity and welfare issues. It is because that has not been done at all in most circumstances over the history of wildlife trade in animals and plant species that we have the need, unfortunately, for a convention such as CITES which is there to try to stop endangered species from becoming extinct. Unfortunately, it is often not successful. That is for reasons not just of trade, of course; but in as much as commercial trade generates that move towards extinction it needs to be halted and reversed. That is what the convention relates to and that is what this bill deals with.
The bill goes a step further than CITES requirements in some places by requiring import permits for CITES species listed in appendix 2 and by imposing strict live export bans on many native Australian species. The Democrats are on record, both before and after the last election, supporting the retention of the export ban on those native Australian species.
The bill makes some important changes to the wildlife protection act, which will now evolve to a higher species in the form of the EPBC Act. For instance, it requires that the impacts of invasive species be properly assessed before introduction, it introduces criteria in the consideration of permits that assess the impacts not only on individual species but also on habitats and ecosystems as well, and it introduces some extra consideration of animal welfare issues. There has been a great gap in the attention to animal welfare at the national level, and the Democrats believe that is an area that should get greater attention. Again, it is not one of those issues that should be just left to a patchwork of inadequate state regimes; it needs a national framework to ensure that we have proper standards of animal welfare, and not just relating to our wildlife—but this bill specifically relates to native wildlife.
Whilst the bill does reflect an improvement on current legislation, the Democrats are introducing a number of changes that will ensure that this bill reflects world's best practice for wildlife trade. Again, it is an example of where Australia can play an important role in being a world leader. As I was saying before in relation to CITES, it is because of the failure internationally around the globe to properly control trade in various forms of wildlife that we have a CITES convention and hundreds of species listed on it in various stages of endangerment. Clearly, there needs to be better control, better assessment and better regulation in trade in wildlife in general. We see stories regularly on the media about some animals—elephants, tigers, some of the other big cats and the great apes, about which there is great concern—but they are just the tip of the iceberg. They are the so-called charismatic mega fauna, the sexy animals that grab people's attention. It is appropriate that they are brought to our attention through the media, but that small number of animals that we see that are on the brink of extinction, often due in part or totally to trade and commercial pressures, are just the tip of the iceberg. Many other species that are not so charismatic are also facing the same fate and indeed are often more likely to meet that fate because it is harder to get direct attention. But we should not be trying to fight each individual battle species by species, trade by trade, industry by industry; we need some proper overall assessments, and that is something we need more of internationally as well as within Australia.
The Democrats have circulated a number of amendments. I recognise that they have been circulated fairly late in the piece, but the bill itself was only introduced fairly recently and that has meant that we have had to move fairly quickly on providing those amendments. Many of the amendments simply improve and tighten the language of the bill. For instance, the commercial component in personal use has been reduced from not primarily commercial to commercial use being only incidental to the personal use, therefore ensuring that when people call something non-commercial it is genuinely non-commercial. We have seen the loophole that has been used by the Japanese in particular to get around restrictions on whaling, by saying it is scientific rather than commercial when obviously the commercial aspects of it are what enable the ongoing and completely unjustifiable harvesting of whales from our oceans. We need to make sure that loophole is not contained in our own wildlife legislation. 
We have an amendment that explicitly recognises that any existing indigenous rights to plants and plant knowledge are not affected by the bill. The inherent indigenous rights in genetic knowledge in our native species form part of an area that still needs a lot more attention. We need to make sure that there is no inadvertent extinguishment of those rights as part of any legislation that we pass through this place.
The Democrats are putting forward several amendments that require the consideration of the welfare of the species being traded. These are reflected in proposed amendments to the object clause to require more specific attention to the welfare of the animals and in the creation of an Animal Welfare Advisory Council, which will advise the minister regarding welfare questions that arise under permits or plans. 
Assessment and permit criteria have been strengthened even more by including migratory birds protected under treaty within the ambit of the existing EPBC Act and also by ensuring that our obligations under the biodiversity convention are also part of wildlife trade considerations. We have also ensured that the precautionary principle is now taken into account in decision making under this bill. Also, amendments will broaden the prohibition on live exports to include terrestrial invertebrates and freshwater fish that are prescribed in the regulations. 
In order to reduce the number of species used for scientific research, the Democrat amendments create a scientific specimen exchange inventory that facilitates the exchange of research specimens. This is an important area. I think the Australian community would be surprised to be made aware of the number of animals—both wildlife as well as other animals—that are used in scientific research around the country as well as internationally. As someone who is a member of an animal welfare ethics committee at a university in Queensland that assesses applications for research—including in some cases native wildlife, particularly marine life and fish but also bird species from time to time—I know that the number of animals used in scientific research is quite considerable. Some of it is non-lethal and observational, but other research is lethal. Obviously, the ethics committees are there to ensure that that research is necessary, but one of the areas that often need greater attention is whether or not the research that is being done is simply duplicating something that has been done somewhere else. So having a scientific specimen exchange inventory is one mechanism to reduce the number of species and the number of individual animals, just as importantly, that are used for scientific research.
Many of the amendments regarding non-com-mercial uses—which include research, exhibition and household pets—close loopholes and better recognise the impact of personal use and the movement of wildlife. The Democrats aim to ensure that provision permitting the exhibition of wildlife in zoos is limited to genuine zoos that are public and that are primarily educational and scientific, and that they are not simply private zoos for some person's individual fancy. Under the Democrat amendments, cat and bear products and trophies would no longer be permitted to be imported. We also have proposed amendments to limit the number and type of native species that will be exempt from permit requirements.
In order to increase the efficiency of the bill, the bill provides for approved and accredited plans to become part of the fabric of wildlife movements. The Democrats have strengthened those provisions by amendments that improve the assessment criteria for plans and operations. For instance, in deciding whether to approve a wildlife operation, the minister must have regard to the significance of the impact of the proposed operation on the ecosystem. The public consultation provisions of the bill would be substantially improved by the Democrat amendments. All applications for permits would require public notification and listing on the Internet. Again this is not simply to enable public comment on every single application—although that is certainly desirable where people feel it necessary—but also to ensure greater public awareness of the number and nature of permit applications.
Again I think that Australians would be astonished at the huge volume of applications and permits that are provided for trade in some of our native wildlife. Certainly people would be aware of the kangaroo trade, a trade that has been condemned repeatedly by the RSPCA as being inhumane and unnecessarily cruel. It is a trade, and an export market in particular, that is expanding, despite the supposed motivation for it being purely environmental in reducing the impact on the land of kangaroo numbers. The industry is obviously driven again by dollars and cents, and not by environmental benefit. I think Australians are at least partly aware of the nature and size of that particular export industry in our native wildlife, but there are plenty of others out there—and crocodile is certainly one of which there is some awareness. Again, if people were aware of the numbers, the sheer volume, in terms of the species that are given permits, I think it would increase Australians' awareness about this trade and I think, hopefully, it would improve the level of public debate about the desirability of such a trade.
The Democrats also propose amendments to strengthen offence provisions relating to the possession of prohibited imported species to ensure humane treatment of animals. Again I think stronger action and controls at the national level in relation to humane treatment of individual animals is an area that we had been lacking in quite severely at the federal level, and this is certainly a welcome opportunity to try and improve Australia's record in that regard. Similarly, it should be noted that the bill helps to close some of those loopholes that make it harder to prosecute people who are suspected of being in possession of prohibited import species. There seems little point in putting in place a significant bureaucratic and regulatory regime relating to trade in wildlife if there is not an ability to ensure that people who breach those laws can be prosecuted. We certainly welcome the fact that, in relation to this bill, the loophole that has enabled people to escape prosecution will be significantly closed. The amendments being put forward by the Democrats will significantly improve a bill that is an already important bill. This bill will enable Australia to become a world leader by ensuring that world trade in wildlife will not harm biodiversity and the ecosystems upon which our native wildlife depend. We are taking measures that will significantly improve our assessment of imports into Australia, particularly of species that may threaten Australia's flora and fauna.
So this is not a prohibitionist approach but rather a regulatory approach—however, it is a regulatory approach that certainly requires the strong controls necessary to ensure that the economic rationalist obsession with pure dollars and cents that occurs in commercial activity does not overpower environmental biodiversity and social needs that also need to be taken into consideration. In a world like the one we live in today, those economic forces almost always get primacy, unless there is a strong regulatory regime in place to ensure that environmental values, biodiversity values and social values are able to be incorporated and exercised. Indeed, through this legislation and the amendments, we will ensure that there is a much stronger obligation—indeed, a requirement—on the government and the minister of the day to properly assess applications for the use of native wildlife, or imports and exports of wildlife, to make sure that those other values that are not simply dollars and cents values, those other environmental biodiversity values, are properly taken into account.
It is worth mentioning briefly that the bill as a whole incorporates, as I said at the start, the wildlife protection act into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. I think this again highlights why the Democrats were correct in passing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as significantly amended, because it provided the framework for significant future amendments. As we said at the time, it is not a perfect act, but it is a significant advance forward on the laws that were in place before. However, it is still not a perfect act, particularly when we have a far less than perfect government and minister implementing it. The best act in the world is only as good as the political will of the government of the day in ensuring that the act is implemented. Nonetheless, the Democrats will seek to make it the best act in the world. We said at the time that there was room for future improvements. This bill and particularly the amendments, not only those contained in the bill but also those that the Democrats are putting forward, will make significant improvements to the EPBC Act—improvements that could not be made were not the framework in place in the first place. If we had not had that bill passed nearly two years ago now, then we would not be able to be having this debate today.
Almost inevitably, in a legislative sense change does not occur in one huge, massive, enormous, single leap. It occurs through a range of improvements. It is important that those improvements are significant. When you add the ongoing improvements that are being made, they are significant beneficial improvements. The Democrats nonetheless say that significant improvements to the act can still be made, which we will endeavour to see made in future opportunities. We do not wish to hold up the positive gains we can achieve here by overdoing it in terms of trying to get them all at once, because that will not be successful and we will lose the benefits that we have here. But there are significant future beneficial amendments that can be made to the acts including the addition of triggers for areas such as greenhouse, pollution, land clearing, environmental flows, forests, genetically engineered organisms, endangered ecological communities and wetlands of national importance.
We can remove the capacity for the minister to delegate Commonwealth environmental approval powers. We can put in legislative targets for environmental outcomes, and repeal exemptions under regional forest agreements—which the ALP would not support at the time and have still not given support to. A range of improvements can still be made. Our support for the original bill and acts and our support for amendments being put forward here should not be misinterpreted as a position that we are happy with what we have achieved and that is all we need. The Democrats will continue to strive for more improvements in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. There is still plenty of room for improvement and we will continue to strive to do so.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-19,"—I noticed the minister was rising to make his contribution on this bill. I think this Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Bill 2001 has taken things forward and the minister needs to be acknowledged for doing that. As Senator Bartlett said, and Senator Bolkus said beforehand, the bill should go further but it is certainly a move in the right direction.
My father was born on 11 July 1894 at a place called Waratah in Tasmania. He had the same name as me, Barney Cooney. You would know Waratah, Senator Denman. My father has been dead many years—
—He left a great legacy.
—He did, Senator Forshaw. The point I make about that is that Waratah was the place where, not many decades after that, the last Tasmanian tiger or thylacine was captured in a snare. Although I was not born in Waratah, my cousin John Cooney was and he can remember the thylacine being brought out from the forest surrounding Waratah and being put in a coop. He remembers it as a hen coop but it may have been a pigeon coop. It was later taken to the Burnie show and then put into the Hobart zoo, where it died. That was either the last or very near the last thylacine captured in the wild. That species has now disappeared. The picture appears in many things to do with Tasmania still. 
The attachment to the thylacine in Tasmania and elsewhere indicates the sorrow that attaches to the passing of that particular species. It is a sad thing and we can get emotional about the fact that that native Australian animal should have disappeared because of the way it was treated, mainly by snares but also by being shot. Farmers at the time said that this was an animal that worried their stock and therefore should be put down. There was a bounty paid for it. Now it has disappeared and that is the end of that, although there is now an attempt talked about to get the species going again through material taken from the dead thylacines that are still preserved, to try to get the animal back on track and wandering through the Tasmanian forests. That attempt shows the great sorrow that has persisted as a result of that animal disappearing and the great desire to resurrect a species that has departed this planet. It is only proper and right that that sort of thing does not occur again and again, whether in Australia or overseas.
I think the desire arises from a veneration that has developed, that is more and more in the heart of people, for the creations of God if you believe in God or the creations of the great spirit or whatever you believe in. There is a veneration for creation which is more pronounced than it used to be. People in Australia want to do something about it. Not only people in Australia but people around the world do not want to see the wasting of animals and the plants that make this world as diverse a place as it is. For that reason the nations of the world have got together and have developed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, which has been mentioned in previous contributions to the debate.
The centrepiece of the bill is set out in clauses 303CC and 303CD. Clause 303CC reads:
A person is guilty of an offence if:
(a)	the person exports a specimen; and
(b)	the specimen is a CITES specimen.
That simply means that, if a person exports from Australia a specimen as defined in the bill and that specimen is within the descriptions set out in CITES, an offence has been committed. The penalty for that is imprisonment for 10 years, 1,000 penalty units or both. That indicates the seriousness with which this legislation deals with the offence of exporting from this country animals that should not be exported. Subclause 303CD(1) reads:
A person is guilty of an offence if:
(a)	the person imports a specimen; and
(b)	the specimen is a CITES specimen.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units, or both.
The central idea of the bill is to stop exports from and imports into Australia of wildlife. There are other provisions where the penalties are less. For example, clause 303GP is headed `Cruelty—export or import of animals' and it states that, if there is cruelty in exporting or importing live animals, the person can be imprisoned for up to two years. 
There are exceptions to the two central provisions for penalties for people who export and import specimens, and they relate to imports and exports under permit. The bill sets out how people are to apply for permits and what they are able to get permits for. It provides that permits may be issued in particular circumstances. For example, clause 303DG is headed `Minister may issue permits' and it sets out the grounds upon which permits may be issued. For example, subclause 303DG(4) states:
The Minister must not issue a permit unless the Minister is satisfied that:
(a)	the export of the specimen will not be detrimental to, or contribute to trade which is detrimental to:
(i)	the survival of any taxon to which the specimen belongs; or
(ii)	any relevant ecosystem (for example, detriment to habitat or biodiversity) ...
The scheme of the bill is supported across the chamber, although, as Senator Bolkus and Senator Bartlett have said, there are amendments that, hopefully, improve the bill, but the general thrust of the bill is accepted. That is a situation about which we ought to be very pleased.
The bill arises, as I have said before, from a convention that many countries have agreed to. It is a sign that the countries of the world are coming closer and closer together. We hear a lot of discussion in this chamber, and indeed elsewhere, about the global economy, the need for global trade and the need to free up that trade so that we all might benefit more in terms of the material goods that come to us. It is said that the more international we become in our thinking, particularly in the area of the economy, the better we will be rewarded with the material things of life.
The bill deals with the concept of globalisation, but it is the globalisation of a consciousness of the need to keep secure the varied wildlife that exists around the world so that generations ahead of ours will be able to enjoy and appreciate it and will be able to get a spiritual uplift from the diversity within the various countries around the world. That is something that we must and will approve of at the end of this debate.
Generally, there is a problem not only in Australia—and I think that, in many cases, Australia has a reasonable record in this area, although a bad record in other areas—but in places like Africa and Asia, for example, where the Asian tiger is in considerable danger. If you accept what is said on the news, and if you accept the sorts of things that you hear about, then there is a need for this act and for it to be as efficient and effective as possible. When we go into the committee stage, I hope that the amendments that are put forward will be accepted. The minister at the table is the sort of minister who will try to make this act as good an act as possible, and I hope that he will accept the amendments insofar as they help the act to be more effective than it would otherwise be, and that the good start he has made can be made even better by way of amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-06-19,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I heard the contribution from Senator Cooney so I particularly thank him and recognise his support for effective conservation measures for endangered species, and, as I interpret what he said, for all native wildlife. It is true that this legislation has within it the mechanisms to conserve Australian native wildlife, both endangered and that which is fortunately not endangered but which might be traded in some form. There is also a greater emphasis in the legislation now on animal welfare considerations. I thank honourable senators who contributed to the second reading debate and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-06-19,"—I want to speak briefly tonight about information that I have received from constituents of mine in New South Wales, regarding a petition that a number of men and women have sent to the Hon. Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, calling for the appointment of a special rapporteur for religious rights in Vietnam. The men and women who sent this petition to Kofi Annan were protesting about the religious persecution and intolerance that is under way against religious leaders in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. At the moment, there are three particular gentlemen who are being persecuted by that socialist regime.
You may be aware that the population in Vietnam is 80 million. Eighty per cent of the population is Buddhist, 10 per cent is Catholic, and the remainder belong to various other religions, including Protestantism and Hoa Hao. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its constitution allegedly guarantees freedom of expression, religion and association. However, if you look at the track record of this government, you will see that in the three particular instances that I want to highlight to the Senate tonight that is not the case.
The highest ranking leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, is currently under house arrest. He is an 80-year-old resident of Vietnam and since 1977 he has, on and off, been imprisoned or under house arrest for insisting upon the basic human right to practise his religion without fear or favour. Another man who is currently incarcerated and has been under house arrest since 1 June this year is the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, the secretary general of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. Since 1977 he has been, in one form another, obstructed in being able to perform or practise his religion: he has been tortured, he has been put into a position where they have tried to make him admit that he has worked for the CIA, and on a number of occasions he has been persecuted and put under house arrest. He is under house arrest at the moment, and has been since 1 June this year.
Another gentleman who is also incarcerated is the Reverend Nguyen Van Ly, a Catholic priest. Father Nguyen was ordained in 1974 and on many occasions since 1974 or 1975 he either has been in internal exile or has been punished for insisting upon the basic right to practise the religion that he holds close. He was arrested on 17 May this year for calling for greater freedom of religion in Vietnam. Father Nguyen is currently on a hunger strike. His life is in danger and he may die at any moment.
On 22 May a petition was made available to the Secretary General of the United Nations, calling upon him to appoint a special investigator to ensure that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which is a signatory to the Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, practises what it has signed up for. Unfortunately, that is not the case. These three religious gentlemen have only sought to practise the freedoms that the Vietnamese people sought when trying to rid themselves of their colonial oppressors. They are now oppressors themselves. Any number of us may recall the terrible conflict that occurred in that country. A number of Australians died—in fact, one of my old mates had a son killed in Vietnam. There were a number of Australians wounded both psychologically and physically. A number of those men and women have never recovered and may never recover.
It is with angst that I highlight to the Senate this evening this persecution of these quite honourable men because of the practise of their religion. The Vietnamese government, which is a signatory to those protocols I mentioned, is not living up to what it should do: allow these men and women in Vietnam to continue to practise their religion. In the case of the Unified Buddhist Church, they have been practising, obviously in one form or another, for nearly 2,000 years. In the case of Catholicism, I suppose it is a religion that they have practised since they converted as a result of French colonisation. With the other religions, I am not sure. I understand the Montagnard people are the most significant followers of the Protestant faith in Vietnam. They, too, are subject to internal discipline or internal exile.
At the moment, we have three honourable men who have been placed under house arrest: the secretary general on 1 June; Father Nguyen on 17 May; and, also in May, the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang. It is simply not good enough for us to have in our country a right that we hold dear and not at least advise and protest about what is happening in a country with which we have had a significant relationship—in one form another, whether adversarial or diplomatic—for many years. I am ashamed that this government continues to persecute its internal opponents because they are not following the party line. I would have thought that the raison d'etre for our presence in that country, and at some stage or another the protest about that presence, was the fact that we believed that those men and women had the right to determine their own future free of any interference from any foreign powers. We should have expected that they would allow the freedom of association, religion and speech that we hold dear and that we would fight for and die for if called upon.
As I said, this goonish government has hypocritically signed the Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and is yet not carrying out its obligations. I wanted to highlight that to the Senate this evening because there are a number of people of Vietnamese descent in Australia who are very annoyed, angry and upset that their fellow countrymen—maybe even their relatives—are now subject to this persecution, persecution that we would not put up with in our country.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Vietnam: Religious Rights</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
