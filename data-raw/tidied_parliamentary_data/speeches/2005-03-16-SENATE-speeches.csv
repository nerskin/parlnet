"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I had understood that this debate would be adjourned to a later hour. Let me explain the opposition’s position as to why that is the case. When this matter was drawn to my attention yesterday, we had not been consulted about this particular proposition and I sought information regarding the proposal. That information arrived at my office this morning. I have taken steps to initiate the necessary consultation that I believe I should undertake prior to simply dealing with the matter as expeditiously as possible. I would request that the government adjourn this matter to a later hour of the day, which would allow me to complete that process. I do not believe on the face of it that this matter is controversial, but I believe that I deserve the opportunity to undertake the necessary inquiries to ascertain that that is indeed the case. I do not wish to obstruct the progress of this matter unnecessarily, but it would be helpful if the debate on this proposal was adjourned.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ellison) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-16,"—The bill under consideration today is the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005. On the whole, Labor supports the measures in this bill but notes certain reservations which, in the case of schedule 1 of this bill, were sufficient to warrant further inquiry by a committee of the Senate. That committee has now reported, and I will address its findings shortly.
Schedule 1 creates the entrepreneurial tax concession announced in the election campaign by the Liberal government. Labor accepts the government can claim what is known as a mandate for the broad policy intent of the measure outlined in the election campaign. However, the announcement of an election commitment is not carte blanche to implement a bill that may have adverse and perhaps unintended consequences. Labor sees a potential threat to the tax base in this measure by unintentionally creating opportunities for tax avoidance.
Schedule 1 introduces a 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset on the income tax liability attributable to business income for small businesses in the simplified tax system that have an annual turnover of $75,000 or less. Where the simplified tax system, or STS, turnover is greater than $50,000, the offset will be phased out so that the offset ceases once the STS turnover reaches $75,000. In relation to this measure, the explanatory memorandum to the bill concedes that the taxpayer may be able to enjoy the concession more than once, as an individual or as a member of a partnership beneficiary to a trust or shareholder. The turnover threshold is low, at $50,000 to $75,000, apparently designed to restrict the concession to home based organisations. But the question can be asked whether a taxpayer might be able to split income in order to receive the concession on more than one occasion. Three hundred thousand persons are estimated to be affected, leading to an annual cost of some $400 million. If compliance issues resulted in tax avoidance by further income splitting, this cost could expand significantly.
This measure has been put together in haste. It appeared in the last session. There is a case for questioning Treasury further as to what safeguards exist to ensure that this concession will be effectively targeted to genuine small-scale entrepreneurs and will not be used as a tax loophole for higher income households. The safety mechanism in the bill against this occurring is that which applies to the simplified tax system—namely, in order to be eligible for the offset, the grouped activities of associated entities are aggregated for the purposes of consideration of the turnover threshold. Those grouping rules for schedule 1 are those that apply to the simplified tax system. Such rules have been designed to apply to a turnover threshold of $1 million. The question can be asked as to whether the same rules should also be applied to a much lower turnover threshold of income of $50,000 to $75,000—the government’s own identified area—or whether stricter rules should apply. The Labor Party is not presenting amendments to the Senate in this regard, but it is an issue about which we forewarn the Senate and the government in terms of any future activity problems that may arise.
In the debate in the other place, my colleague the member for Hunter and shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Fitzgibbon, invited the minister to address the question about whether the phase-out of the turnover threshold between $50,000 and $75,000 would also create a modest increase in the effective marginal tax rates. I would be seeking an assurance that this phasing out of the measure will entail no significant disincentives. I put on notice that in the minister’s reply to the second reading debate or in the committee stage we would like a response on that issue. The minister in the other place did not respond, in summing up, to the question posed by my colleague Mr Fitzgibbon. I would ask the minister to address this point.
The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Fitzgibbon, also asked the minister to consider whether certain further measures might be warranted to ensure that this measure is better targeted at activities that represent genuine innovation or entrepreneurial activity. On the face of it, this is not really an entrepreneurial offset but an offset for a certain class of taxpayers who may or may not be engaging in entrepreneurial activity. This brings us to the complexity of the system, as it has been proposed, which is aimed fairly and squarely at what are sometimes referred to as microbusinesses. Many of these home based businesses are owned by people who do their own business activity statements and their own tax returns to try to avoid the expense of using an accountant, for example. We have to remember that the limits of $50,000 at the beginning of the phase-out and $75,000 at the end are not profit figures but turnover figures.
This presents a set of complexities, problems and subsequent amendments that this parliament had to deal with in respect of the BAS, the business activity statement. Do we really think that people who previously were not using an accountant are going to be able to work their way through the formula proposed in this bill without having to seek formal professional advice? I would suggest that the chances of them needing to seek formal professional advice are much greater. Therefore, the costs to the entrepreneurial activity or business will be increased. How much net money will they receive, having consulted with an accountant? If they shift to an accountant for advice, how much of the end benefit will they receive in net terms? By and large, many of the businesses that are targeted by this measure could effectively miss out on the net benefit, or that benefit could be used to counterbalance accountants’ fees. So to a large extent this could effectively be a subsidy for accountants.
Eligibility for this system is based on turnover, which means that home based businesses with high input costs are put at a huge disadvantage when compared with home based businesses that are delivering a service. For example, if you are a retired executive and are consulting from home, there will be very few input costs. There will be very little difference between your turnover figure and the profit figure on which your taxable income is based. That means that, with the same profit margin, some people are going to find themselves ineligible at a much earlier stage than people who have a service based home business. We fail to understand why the government has decided that, if you are a home based business with very few input costs, you will effectively be given a much better tax advantage than if you are a home based business with high input costs.
I would now like to put forward Labor’s response to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee’s report on the bill. Firstly, Labor thanks the officials from Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office, whose cooperation and assistance to the committee was prompt and extremely useful. We do not in any way criticise those officials for the explanatory memorandum being removed from the web site before the committee hearing had begun. I find some of the abuses, frankly, that are being carried out by this government to reduce accountability quite extraordinary. We will see more of these after 1 July. Removing the explanatory memorandum makes it harder for members of the Labor opposition and presumably my colleague Senator Murray to effectively question and receive detailed, accountable responses. It is made much more difficult if the explanatory memorandum is taken out from under your nose and taken off the web site. We do not blame the public servants for that. The fault lies with the minister. This is just another example in a series of quite deliberate frustrations associated with Assistant Treasurer Brough’s handling of recent taxation legislation.
The committee considered evidence from Treasury and the ATO in relation to the compliance concerns that Labor raised with regard to this measure. As I have indicated, Labor remains concerned about the capacity to use this offset as an income splitting device to avoid tax. The evidence presented to the committee by Treasury and the ATO was not completely consistent. Mr O’Connor, from the Department of the Treasury, indicated that Treasury ‘does not anticipate this measure giving rise to people seeking to split businesses’. Mr O’Connor considered the STS grouping rules to be a robust and adequate defence against tax avoidance by income splitting. However, Mr Konza of the ATO—and I must say that the ATO are at the cutting edge of this sort of undesirable activity—indicated:
We also saw a risk that the same income might be split and people might try to claim the offset a couple of times.
Mr Konza noted that the ATO was developing computer testing software to identify such cases. So we had, on the one hand, Treasury appearing to show no great concern about—perhaps no great understanding of—the level of abuse that could occur. On the other hand, the ATO, obviously having a greater understanding because it is at the cutting edge of taxation avoidance and minimisation schemes, takes the matter more seriously.
I was disturbed during Senate estimates to hear evidence, in a number of other areas, about significant problems the ATO had with their computer software in delivering surveillance of a number of different, mainly noncontentious, programs. I do hope that the ATO, if they are relying on computer testing software to be a line of defence against this undesirable activity, actually get it right and ensure that the problems that have been experienced in the ATO—admitted by Mr Carmody, the head of the ATO, who was obviously very concerned and agitated about it—are addressed and that the computer testing software is effective in minimising abuse in this area. The bottom line is that these STS grouping rules are relatively recent compliance measures and their effectiveness has not really been evaluated.
Labor believes that the government should consider a review of the measure’s effectiveness after a two-year period. Again, I invite the minister to respond to this proposal. Labor agrees with the comments made by Democrat Senator Murray in the minority report of the legislation committee that an a priori case for a subsidy for entrepreneurs has not been made. Labor is concerned that this measure is not directed at effectively fostering entrepreneurial activity but is a tax cut promised in the heat of an election campaign for election purposes. However, Labor will not be seeking to amend the schedule, as I mentioned. A review of the effectiveness, or otherwise, of this legislation—and what it promises to deliver—is, Labor believes, an appropriate way to examine its long-term effectiveness and any issues relating to tax minimisation/avoidance.
Schedule 2 of the bill extends the simplified tax system by removing the requirement that taxpayers must use the STS accounting method—generally referred to as a cash basis of accounting. This is meritorious in that it eliminates the need for an entity to maintain two sets of accounts under different bases—cash and accrual. Schedule 3 provides for rollover of income for shareholders in employee share schemes where there has been a merger or consolidation of a business entity. It allows taxpayers who have deferred income tax liability on a discount received on shares or rights acquired under an employee share scheme to roll over a taxing point that would otherwise occur because of a corporate restructure. This is a useful mechanism to improve labour market flexibility in the case of corporate mergers where such schemes exist.
Schedule 4 allows a fringe benefits tax exemption threshold for long service award benefits. It increases the fringe benefits tax, FBT, exemption thresholds for long service award benefits. This concession is an anomaly that exists from the introduction of the FBT regime. Schedule 5 provides for a tax concession for petroleum exploration. It allows the minister to allocate up to 20 per cent of the annual offshore petroleum acreage release areas as designated frontier areas. It also applies a 150 per cent uplift to certain exploration expenditure conducted in the first term of an exploration permit in a designated frontier area. I might add that there is an issue of disclosure in relation to the costing of this measure. The newly released tax expenditure statement indicated a cost profile of this measure over each relevant year of the forward estimates. However, in the explanatory memorandum of the bill an aggregate is provided only over the four years. I ask the minister to explain this apparent oversight—or is the minister seeking to avoid disclosure of the cost of this measure in the explanatory memorandum?
Schedule 6 involves further finetuning of the consolidation regime. It ensures that certain liabilities taken into account when an entity leaves a consolidated group that correspond to liabilities brought into a consolidated group with a joining entity have the same value at the leaving time as at the joining time. Without this measure there would be potentially more than one basis for calculating liabilities. The schedule also ensures that there is no double reduction in cost base on consolidation, where an entity joins a consolidated group, by removing the requirement to reduce accrued undistributed profits to the extent that they have recouped particular sorts of losses. The schedule also ensures that the rollover relief available for partnerships under the standard capital depreciation allowances regime is available also to depreciating assets allocated to the simplified tax system.
Schedule 8 involves mere technical corrections and amendments. Schedule 9 involves a minor amendment to the refundable film tax offset to allow companies to apply for the tax offset where unused provisional certificates in respect of certain film projects remain in force. This allows companies who have applied for the special depreciation regime for domestic film production to apply for the foreign film tax offset. Although Labor understands that this measure is likely to apply to very few, if any, taxpayers, Labor does not oppose it. We would like responses to the three questions I have posed to the minister, either in the minister’s summing up or in the committee stage. I understand there will be a committee stage, because Senator Murray has flagged some amendments. With those comments, I indicate that Labor will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 7) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-16,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005 is largely a technical bill. It contains, however, 11 distinct schedules and another 120 pages of taxation law, coupled with 201 pages of explanatory memorandum. So although it is technical, it is certainly not simple. It is about the same size as the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Bill 2005 the Senate passed last week, adding to the piles of legislation in this field.
The Australian Democrats believe that the only really controversial schedules in this bill are schedules 1 and 5. These schedules were subject to the scrutiny of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee last month, which was very helpful. Before turning to those schedules and to prolong the suspense—as I am sure everybody is in suspense!—as to our position on these two schedules, I will briefly outline the merits of the other nine schedules.
Schedule 2 allows small business to use accrual accounting and the simplified tax system. The so-called ‘simplified tax system’ was introduced from 1 July 2001 as a measure to reduce compliance costs for small business. It allows application of a simplified depreciation system and simplified treatment of trading stock. Additionally, the simplified tax system required taxpayers to use the cash method of accounting. This schedule allows small business to use the accruals method if they consider it more appropriate for their business. The revenue cost of this proposal is estimated to be $125 million for the 2006-07 financial year and $130 million for the 2007-08 year, but obviously this is mostly a simple timing issue. Despite some reservations that this proposal overly complicates a supposedly simple regime, it will have Democrat support.
Schedule 3 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in the event of a corporate restructure to allow taxpayers who have deferred the income tax liability on a discount received on shares acquired under an employee share scheme to postpone their taxing point. The revenue cost of this measure is considered unquantifiable but likely to be small.
Schedule 4 amends a fringe benefits tax exemption for long service leave awards. The current exemption is for $500 for 15 years of service, and this amendment will double this to $1,000. The Democrats support this measure. We should be encouraging employees to stay with employers who do the right thing and encourage commitment. We should not be taxing employers who generously reward their long-term staff.
Schedule 6 contains yet another consolidation measure. It clarifies some of the consolidation laws and ensures that the regime interacts with other aspects of the income tax law. Schedule 7 is another measure aimed at the simplified tax system. This schedule ensures that the rollover relief available for partnerships under the uniform capital allowances regime is also available in relation to depreciation assets allocated to simplified tax system pools. Again I draw attention to how complex this simplified tax system is becoming. This measure has a cost to revenue of around $5 million a year.
Schedule 8 provides greater flexibility and reduces compliance costs and ongoing uncertainty surrounding family trust elections and interposed entity elections. This measure has no revenue impact. Schedule 9 corrects a minor technical defect in the treatment of non-commercial loans. Schedule 10 to this bill makes minor corrections and amendments to the taxation laws. The explanatory memorandum states:
These corrections and amendments are part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the taxation laws. They fix errors such as duplications of definitions, missing asterisks from defined terms, incorrect numbering and referencing and outdated guide material.
Those things are very helpful, but it is tempting to have some fun at their expense. There are pages of those sorts of amendments—maybe 20 pages—with some delightful components. For example, page 105 of the bill, at item 242, says:
Items 6 and 7 of Schedule 1
The items are taken never to have had effect.
You find items in the bill which say:
Omit “*company”, substitute “company”.
You find acres of statements about Australian residents which say:
Omit “not an Australian resident”, substitute “a foreign resident”.
This is the stuff of a technical draftsperson’s nightmares, to make sure that they have tidied up all the typos, mistakes, errors and contradictions that are in the law. But, I guess, behind making fun of that is the serious intent of pointing to the need to do the tidying up effort, and it has to be done.
Obviously, and I have long said so, the tax laws should be simplified. By broadening the base, by strengthening the anti-avoidance provisions and by reducing rates, you can achieve a greater simplification. But, unfortunately, simplification will require a complicated process. It is a disgrace that the income tax laws are still contained within two acts: the 1936 act and the 1997 act. These two acts overlap, interact and duplicate each other to determine a taxpayer’s final tax position. This may be fantastic for the accounting and taxation advisory industry, who earn a fortune off the back of it, but it does not give ordinary Australians much confidence in the system or much confidence that they are correctly meeting their tax liabilities.
Schedule 11 makes a minor technical amendment to the refundable film tax offset. The Democrats obviously welcome any attempts by the government to promote and encourage the Australian Film Industry, but this measure does not have any revenue impact.
As I mentioned earlier, the controversial aspects of this bill are schedules 1 and 5. Both schedules were subject to Senate Economics Legislation Committee scrutiny, and the evidence indicates why the Australian Democrats have decided to oppose schedule 1. Schedule 1 contains the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset. The evidence to the Senate committee showed that not only is the legislation overly complex and, in my opinion, somewhat badly drafted but most of all it is bad tax policy. There is no evidence whatsoever for its need. There is no evidence whatsoever that Australian micro and small business lack sufficient entrepreneur spirit or that their numbers have been held back by lack of entrepreneur spirit. In fact, the reverse is the case.
There is a shortage of workers in a number of trades—for example, plumbers, bricklayers, boilermakers and carpenters. No evidence was provided that the entrepreneurs tax offset would encourage workers into these areas, particularly due to the limitation of a $75,000 turnover threshold. Of course, to obtain the full tax offset, a business must have a turnover of less than $50,000. Evidence provided to the committee by the Australian Taxation Office indicated that less than a third of plumbers, bricklayers and carpenters would meet the $75,000 turnover limitation anyway, so there is no entrepreneurial motivation, apparently, for the remaining two-thirds of those small businesses. This is an untargeted measure, generated in the heat of an election campaign, that will apply equally to all classes of micro and small business—some 300,000 apparently—whether the goods and services they provide are in excess or in short supply.
As I asked in my Senate minority report: why is this incentive not just targeted at micro and small business areas that are in short supply? The answer is that this policy is not an incentive at all; it is a political gift. There is no evidence that schedule 1 will result in further entrepreneurial activity being encouraged, although, prima facie, it will make businesses that falls within the threshold more profitable. This measure creates yet another class of what Treasurer Costello calls rent seekers. The coalition’s entire income tax strategy seems at present to consist of parcelling out income tax concessions to targeted constituencies in an apparent attempt to secure their vote. That may be in the coalition’s political self-interest, but it is not in the national interest and it is certainly not in the interest of a simpler and more effective tax system.
Fortunately, some coalition backbenchers are starting to rebel against blatant political pork-barrelling and are focusing on the bigger policy issue. They include Mr Malcolm Turnbull, with his recent remarks, and what is becoming known as the ginger group—who I would hope recognise this legislation as bad law and bad policy. Unfortunately, I very much doubt that the Liberal backbench campaign for structural income tax reform would extend to crossing the floor on issues like these, and I also very much doubt that Labor will find the energy to really knock over bad policy like this.
Changes to the Income Tax Act such as this only serve to further complicate an already excessively complicated income tax system. This schedule may only be nine pages long, but it could only be followed by an accountant with a good understanding of taxation law and it is likely to result in additional compliance costs. No estimation has been made of the compliance costs for taxpayers or for the Taxation Office. I do not want to fully explain how the offset works in this short address but I would like to quote from the speech made in the second reading debate in the House by Labor’s Mr Tony Burke. I will just repeat a small portion of his explanation as to how the offset works:
You are then asked whether your STS group turnover equals $50,000. If the answer is yes, you multiply A by the STS percentage; if the answer is no, you calculate the STS phase-out fraction by subtracting the STS group turnover from $75,000 and then divide the result by $25,000. Having done that, if you went through the first path, where it was equal to $50,000—and you multiplied A by the STS percentage—then at that point you have the ‘entrepreneurs’ tax offset’. If you went through the other path, where you performed the fraction that divided by $25,000, you then finally multiply A by the STS percentage and by the STS phase-out fraction to get the entrepreneurs’ tax offset.
You can only think, ‘Phew!’ when you hear that. The House of Representatives Hansard records that at that point Mr Alan Cadman, the Liberal MP for Mitchell, interjected with the comment, ‘Mind numbing.’ I cannot help but concur with Mr Cadman’s comment about his own government’s legislation.
One journalist, Peter Switzer, reported on this bill in the Australian on 15 February 2005 under the heading ‘Accountants the victors in tax offset’. He quotes a chartered accountant who thinks it will take one to two hours to sit with a new client to determine their eligibility for the tax offset. The estimated cost of around $400 would be payable irrespective of whether the small business owner is actually eligible for the offset. All of this serves to again emphasise that what is needed in income tax reform is not these kinds of confusing and complex political gifts but major structural reform. Tinkering at the edges just will not do. The income tax system must be simplified and tax concessions that feed rent seekers and create inequities must be done away with, because this creates yet another class of privileged taxpayers who do not deserve that particular privilege and political gift.
The Democrats strongly support the comments of people like Mr Malcolm Turnbull with respect to the need for tax reform. In fact I cannot help but feel that he and other Liberal backbenchers have been not only reading our tax policy but following the campaign that I have been running for the last few years. It is gratifying that this is now starting to get the sort of attention that, in our view, has been needed for a long time. Simplifying the system and broadening the income tax base would free up money for genuine tax cuts and greater equity. Certainty and equity in income taxation are vital. Certainty and equity should be delivered by a three-part plan phased in over a number of years in order to ensure affordability.
With these objectives in mind, my priorities would be a $20,000 tax-free threshold, indexation to end bracket creep and possibly a $120,000 top rate threshold—all of which should be aimed at over a number of years and as they become affordable, but in that order. At the very least the government needs to accept that it is entirely inappropriate to tax income below $12,500, which is the estimated minimum subsistence income. In the meantime, the Democrats’ priority is to keep addressing the needs of low-income workers, to try and get their disposable income increased and their living standards improved, to reduce their cripplingly high effective tax rates and to help poorer Australians move from welfare to work. We would hope that one day the government will adopt that simple kind of approach to restoring equity to our tax system.
We think the best single way to restore equity and to deliver structural reform is to start by raising the tax-free threshold. This has a side benefit of flowing on to all Australian taxpayers, not just a favoured few, but it has the main benefit of having its principal effect on low-income and middle-income Australians. It is also a policy which is easily understood by taxpayers, which is a core need in any tax reform. I and others are well aware that there are alternative methods by which you can tackle tax reform, but we need to focus on the psychology of taxpayers, on their need for things that they can understand, that they understand to be fair, which are easily discussed and easily understood. Our income tax system is not easily understood. That is an important part of a tax system. If people think they are getting a fair go, if the psychology is attended to as well as the economics, then you are likely to have far less tax avoidance than we have at present and a far cleaner and easier to administer system.
The Democrats say that this bill’s complicated, unnecessary and unfair tax cut for a selectively limited group should be shared by all taxpayers. The evidence presented to the committee demonstrated that the entrepreneurs’ tax offset in schedule 1 is unduly complicated. Further, neither the Treasury nor Taxation Office representatives could demonstrate any measurable economic or social benefit from the proposal. Our preference is to redirect the $400 million a year Treasury estimated cost of this proposal to increase the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $6,260. At an estimated cost of $398 million a year, this would provide Australia’s nearly nine million taxpayers with a $44.20 a year tax cut, or around 85c a week. The 2003 budget tax cuts were referred to as the sandwich and milkshake tax cuts. Our redirection of this unnecessary, ill-conceived and badly targeted proposal would provide all Australians with a Freddo Frog tax cut.
We are also concerned about the possible tax avoidance opportunities, as the legislation makes it clear that taxpayers may claim more than one tax offset. Arguably a relatively well-off taxpayer could restructure their affairs so that they run a diverse range of businesses, each with a turnover under $75,000, and claim an entrepreneurs’ tax offset on each. It has often been stated that the three elements of an ideal tax system are efficiency, simplicity and equity. In our opinion the entrepreneurs’ tax offset meets none of these criteria and arguably makes all three worse. The Australian Democrats will be opposing schedule 1 and we will introduce an amendment, as I have outlined, to provide an income tax cut for all Australian taxpayers. The cost of both proposals is the same, so senators can choose between an ill-conceived, unnecessary and complex tax incentive for a small, exclusive group in the government proposal or the alternative, our proposal for a simple small tax cut for all Australian taxpayers. This would at least send a message as to the Senate’s views on priorities for future tax cuts.
In respect of schedule 5, the petroleum exploration incentive, I will not deal with that at length. I was surprised that the estimated cost of $17 million over three years would have any industry benefit. The evidence provided to the Senate was to the contrary. However, no consideration was made as to the degree to which Australia’s long-term greenhouse mitigation costs may or may not increase as a result of this $17 million additional investment in oil and gas exploration through the PRRT system, which, as we know, is offshore. The Australian Democrats have a history of supporting prospecting and research and development measures. We opposed the government’s cost-cutting in this area, and later data has proved us right. We do not oppose schedule 5, which allows a 150 per cent uplift to certain exploration expenditure conducted in the first term of an exploration permit in a designated frontier area. For my further views on that matter I refer the chamber to my minority report. Whilst I still have the time, I want to move my second reading amendment, which has been circulated in the chamber. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate calls on the Government to commit to further incentives for the renewable energy industry, as an even-handed offset to match the benefit provided to fossil fuel industries through the frontier areas exploration tax benefits established by this legislation”.
In conclusion, I return to schedule 5. I for one would like to see much more gas found, particularly as gas is a direct competitor to coal for electricity generation. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 7) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-03-16,"—Unfortunately, due to the whips’ time constraints I will have to limit my comments to schedule 5 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005. In doing so I wish to speak very positively about this initiative, which affects the tax incentive for petroleum exploration in designated frontier areas. Exploration expenditure within certain limitations will be, under this bill, uplifted to 150 per cent from 100 per cent, with this amount being deductible for the purposes of the petroleum resource rent tax.
Australia, as we all know, has extensive offshore basins with petroleum production potential but most of these areas have not been explored because they are often in deep water and distant from existing infrastructure. This makes exploration in such areas relatively expensive and risky. The bill contains an incentive for companies to explore in designated parts of such areas, which are known as designated frontier areas. Underlying the incentive in the bill are the broader issues of declining self-sufficiency—that is, the ratio of crude oil and condensate, including liquefied petroleum gas, to consumption—and concerns about the level of expenditure on exploration, especially offshore. With future indigenous crude oil and condensate production predicted to decline, the incentive is primarily aimed at boosting exploration, especially offshore.
The gap between imports and exports is expected to widen considerably in the next 15 years. Australia exports more refined petroleum products than it imports, but Australian refineries rely on imports for about 60 per cent of the crude oil they use. Increasing dependence on imported oil has the potential to place further pressure on Australia’s trade balance.
Exploring for oil and gas is expensive. Australia is also considered a risky place to explore and success rates are low compared to other countries. Nonetheless, substantial sums of money are being spent on exploration for oil and gas in this country. However, the overall trend for the last two decades has been for levels of exploration to decline. I believe this bill will help turn this situation around.
It is important to stress that there was no evidence before the committee to suggest, nor is there any reason to believe, that the bill would have any impact on the Great Barrier Reef, which certain opponents of this bill conjured up, or have any other environmental impact. It seems that criticisms made by certain members of the environmental movement about this bill are just plain wrong.
It was interesting to note that Mr Barry Jones of APPEA has pointed out that in discussing fossil fuels there is a need to distinguish between coal, oil and gas. He says the distinction is critical in the context of greenhouse policy since gas generally has considerably less emissions than coal and oil and is seen by many as the fuel of transition to a post greenhouse emission world. If nuclear energy is not an option, natural gas is the only low-emission supply option available for stationary energy uses. Government measures impacting on the fossil fuel sector differ significantly between petroleum and coal. For example, petroleum pays considerably more tax; diesel fuel rebates are generally not available to petroleum producers.
The taxation law allows exploration and prospecting expenditure as an immediate allowable deduction in the calculation of assessable income for company tax purposes. This reflects the nature of such activities as being a necessary pre-condition to future potential development and production related activities, which are generally not immediately deductible in other sections of the act. This type of activity, and therefore the cost, is largely unique to the resource sector and is treated in the appropriate manner. From a practical perspective, it would be difficult to contemplate any alternative method.
It is important to clarify some other aspects of the bill. Eighty per cent of marine pollution is land based. This figure is from the State of the environment report. For example, 80 per cent of oil in the ocean comes from onshore and most marine based oil pollution comes from shipping. The Sydney sewerage system discharges 16,000 tonnes of oil into the Sydney basin annually.
The committee concluded that the passage of the bill will not in any way heighten the risks to the environment and found that arguments to that effect were unsustainable. We noted that the measures in this bill are relatively modest but should not be viewed in isolation. It is actually part of a suite of initiatives, current and future, that are required to address the issue of Australia’s energy supplies.

I support the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 7) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-03-16,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005 introduces some 11 different schedules amending the tax acts across a range of issues, all of which are very welcome initiatives of the Howard government. Some of them were commitments made in the last budget; others were commitments made during the election period. As I say, they are all very welcome, including the introduction of the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset, the removal of the current requirement for small businesses to use the STS accounting method to enter the simplified tax system and, as Senator Watson has referred to in some detail, the incentive designed to encourage petroleum exploration in Australia’s remote offshore areas in relation to concessions regarding the resource rent tax.
Another very welcome initiative is that contained in schedule 8 of the bill, which provides greater flexibility, reduced compliance costs and ongoing certainty surrounding family trust elections and interposed entity elections. This was an announcement made in the 2004-05 federal budget and will allow family trust elections and interposed entity elections to be made at any time in relation to an earlier year of income. These are elections that are made under the trust loss rules in schedule 2F of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Generally speaking, a trust that makes a family trust election needs to pass a reduced number of tests in order to carry forward and/or recoup losses under the trust loss rules. Furthermore, family trust elections allow tracing for the purposes of applying the continuity of ownership test for the purposes of recouping losses in companies, and also allow franking credits attached to dividends received by a trust to be passed through to beneficiaries of that trust. It will allow entities that generally make interposed entity elections to receive distributions from trusts that have made family trust elections, also without the imposition of a penalty tax on such distributions.
The implementation of this very welcome initiative does give rise to the opportunity to address a number of other deficiencies and inappropriate income tax consequences that arise from the requirement for making family trust and interposed entity elections. They are unintended consequences, I believe, of a far too restrictive legislative framework. I have to say to the minister that I warned at the time that this legislation was being considered by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, I think way back in 1997, that these unintended consequences would arise.
This legislation was drafted far more widely than was needed to deal with the issues that it sought, quite legitimately, to prevent, such as trading in trust losses and trading in franking credits. Indeed, this legislation was a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I fear this is the case with a lot of tax legislation that comes before us these days—it is drafted far more widely than is necessary to deal with the perceived problem. I notice a nod from Senator Murray agreeing with me. Another example of that was the legislation which came before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee last year dealing with the payment of defined benefit pensions by self-managed superannuation funds. That legislation is currently under review.
I have had drawn to my attention a submission from the Institute of Chartered Accountants which has gone to the Minister for Revenue and which seeks certain other changes to the family trust election requirements to overcome some of these unintended consequences. As I understand it, the institute sought for those changes also to be incorporated in this legislation. I think it is a matter for regret that they have not been incorporated in this bill. I certainly hope they will receive positive and favourable consideration from the minister and be incorporated in future legislation.
One of the issues that that submission raises is the definition of a family group for the purposes of family trust election. Under the current legislation a family group includes any parent, grandparent, brother, sister, nephew, niece, child or grandchild of the so-called test individual; or the test individual’s spouse or the spouse of any of those people. There does not seem to be any policy rationale for placing a generational limit on the definition of a family, especially given that the typical life of a trust—certainly of those trusts that were set up in the 1960s and 1970s—is 80 years. The life of trusts that have been established more recently, since the abolition of the perpetuity laws by states, is perhaps infinite. Those trusts commonly extend into the fourth generation and beyond. The consequence of this under the current legislation is that many family trusts will eventually have to distribute outside this narrowly defined family group and then be subject to a penalty tax, the family trust distribution tax.
This issue of family definition also raises a much larger issue in relation to family trusts—what I would call the de facto death duties that apply to them under current legislation. As I said a moment ago, many family trusts were established in the 1960s or the 1970s before the states, either legislatively or in practical effect, abolished the laws against perpetuity; hence, trusts typically had a vesting date of 70 or 80 years, after which the assets would be distributed to beneficiaries, typically individuals or another trust.
However, I am advised that, following the introduction of capital gains tax in 1984, the ATO regards the vesting of a trust as a capital gains tax event—in effect, a death duty: the imposition of a substantial tax on what is in effect an intergenerational transfer of assets, when no such tax applies to similar transfers between individuals since the very welcome abolition of death and estate duties following widespread community pressure to eliminate this unfair tax about 30 years ago. Hence a problem does exist currently, although I guess it something of a sleeper because in most instances it will probably be another 20 years or so before many trusts start to reach their vesting dates.
The introduction of the family trust election requirement has worsened this situation. By applying a penalty tax rate to trust distributions to generations beyond grandchildren of the test person, the legislation effectively shortens the life of family trusts in many instances to less than the defined vesting date. It is highly likely that grandchildren will expire before the defined vesting date—effectively shortening the life of the trust. As I mentioned earlier, for more recent trusts, which do not have a vesting date, this requirement has the practical effect of applying one.
I believe the government must eliminate this de facto death duty on family trusts. To achieve this, the legislation should be amended to allow the family group relating to a family trust election to include any lineal ancestor or descendant of the test person. If it is regarded as essential to limit the extent of distributions in any particular year, then this provision could be supplemented by a provision that distributions can be made to no more than five successive generations in any particular year—that is, the number of generations which currently make up the family group. If, in a subsequent year, it was desired that a distribution be made to, for example, great-grandchildren, then it would not be possible to make a distribution to grandparents and so on. The second change required is that, for trusts that have not already taken advantage of the state’s abolition of laws against perpetuity, legislation should be initiated to allow trust deeds to be amended to achieve this without it being defined as a capital gains tax event. Alternatively, the law should be amended to provide that the vesting of a trust is not a capital gains tax event.
Other issues which are raised in the submission by the Institute of Chartered Accountants include the difficulty in revoking a family trust election. In general, family trust elections are irrevocable, except in relation to certain fixed trusts; however, this power to revoke family trust elections is never exercised because there are simply no, or very few, trusts that fall within the definition of a fixed trust for the purpose of trust loss rules. The definition of a fixed trust in relation to trust loss rules is much narrower than the general commercial view of what constitutes a fixed trust. In that context it would be appropriate to review and modify the definition of a fixed trust.
There is also no discretion allowed for the Commissioner of Taxation to allow the revocation of a family trust election. The Institute of Chartered Accountants have highlighted numerous examples of errors that have been made by both taxpayers and tax practitioners in the preparation of family trust elections, including the specification of incorrect test individuals and the making of family trust elections that were not required.
These errors are largely attributable to the excessive complexity of the trust loss rules and the legislation. Therefore it would be appropriate to provide the commissioner with a discretion to allow certain terms of a family trust election to be changed in the event of an inadvertent error or where a family trust election was made where it clearly was not necessary. That situation also applies with regard to the revocation of interposed entity elections.
The institute also suggests that a choice should be given to revoke elections after losses or debt deductions have been utilised. It was, as I understand it, the objective of the trust loss rules to ensure that only those who economically suffered a loss benefited from the eventual recoupment of that loss. If that is the case, then there is no need for the rules to continue to apply to trusts that have made family trust elections where the losses have already been fully recouped or that no longer have any debt reductions. Once there are no losses or debt reductions in a trust, there is no policy reason to continue to confine distributions to members of the test individual’s family group. The taxpayers should have the choice to revoke a family trust election if a trust no longer has losses or debt reductions.
The institute has also identified problems that relate to the death of a test individual. It has also raised the issue of extending the advantages of making a family trust election to interposed entity elections. Currently, interposed entities that make interposed entity elections suffer the same restrictions as family trusts making a family trust election but they do not enjoy the advantages that a family trust election provides. There are a number of other issues raised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in its submission to the Minister for Revenue that highlight the various ways in which the current legislation is commercially inhibiting, and they are areas that also require detailed examination and, I believe, a positive response.
As Senator Watson said, we do not want to delay this current legislation; however, I did want to raise those issues. I think they are issues on which the government should take the initiative and respond positively, particularly the issues highlighted in the submission from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the issue of what I believe is very much an unintended consequence of this legislation, which is the de facto capital gains tax or death duty that, in effect, currently applies to family trusts.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 7) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-16,"—I wish to speak about schedule 5 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005, the petroleum exploration incentive to allow a 150 per cent deduction for exploration expenditure in designated frontier areas. I have two concerns about this proposal. The first is the environmental implications and the second is that this constitutes yet another handout that shows that the government has not understood the need for shifting from the view that the future is with fossil fuels to a view of a future with more sustainable alternative fuels and renewable energy. On the first point, the frontier areas include areas just off the Great Barrier Reef. I note that the ALP still have not decided whether they will join the Democrats to renew our bill to prevent oil drilling and exploration in areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. I hope that they do so and commit to their previous strong position on this matter and, in the meantime, oppose this incentive that may result in active explorative drilling off the reef.
While there is evidence to suggest that the incentive will benefit prospecting for gas as well as other fossil fuels—and we welcome that because gas is less damaging as an energy source—the Democrats still do not see the need for exponential expansion of prospecting in remote areas for oil. There would appear to be little need for further subsidy of what is an already highly lucrative oil industry, particularly as the price of a barrel of oil continues to rise and oil production, as was noted in the media this week, is likely to peak within the next 10 years. After that time, the price of oil will significantly increase, which means that providing subsidies for exploration probably will not be necessary.
Given the minimal support that is provided to renewable energy in this country, it is worth making some comments about what this great benefit to the oil companies might have meant had it been extended to renewable energy. The government introduced the mandated renewable energy target some years ago, but we now know that 70 per cent of that target has already been taken up by hydro—by far the biggest contributor to the MRET scheme; that is existing hydro, not even new hydro—deemed solar hot water services and landfill gas. So two-thirds of the measure has been taken up, I think, by renewable energy, which was not anticipated to be the way that the mix, the diversity, of energy sources would turn out. It is 36 per cent hydro up to the present time—it might be higher than that this year. Because of the baseline, we are seeing a very lucrative awarding of renewable energy certificates to hydro. Whilst hydro, particularly in Tasmania, has put some of that money into wind farms—and that is a fine thing to do—and improved the efficiency of their hydro schemes, I am sure it was not what was anticipated in this place when the legislation was passed. So wind makes up only 11 per cent of the total.
The review panel, in looking at MRET, recommended that by 2020 wind should make up 41 per cent, but that is highly unlikely when very little assistance is given to the renewable energy sector. Imagine if there were a 150 per cent deduction for wind exploration—not that wind exploration is as difficult as oil exploration; I recognise that—and you extended it to developing proposals, searching out sites and so forth. This would be very helpful. Searching for geothermal opportunities is a very expensive process, which is similar to exploring for oil in that you are looking underground for opportunities to tap into energy sources, but it is not addressed in this bill, which is a great pity.
Going back to the reef, we are firmly of the view that areas such as those adjacent to the reef are critically important for tourism income. They may be permanently and irreversibly damaged by large-scale petroleum exploration. The government, I think, just on that theme of not paying much attention to a sustainable energy future, has had a minimalist approach to encouraging renewable energy generally. Its energy white paper, which the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee will look at further on Friday, provides excise cuts worth an astonishing $1.5 billion to diesel users. The greenhouse cost of this kind of policy, or lack of it with regard to renewable energy, is going to be paid for by our children and our grandchildren.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 7) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-03-16,"—It is now my pleasure to sum up the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005. Firstly, I would like to thank all senators for their contributions to this debate. I would also like to thank the opposition for their support of this bill. I appreciate that Senator Sherry has asked a number of questions, which I will come to at the end of my summing up remarks.
The bill recognises the importance of the small business sector by introducing a number of measures that will be of particular assistance to small business. The other parts of the bill benefit businesses across the board. Small business is set to benefit from the entrepreneur’s discount. As has been discussed before, the discount amounts to 25 per cent of tax attributable to small business activities when annual turnover is up to $50,000 and the business is in the simplified tax system. It phases out when turnover is between $50,000 and $75,000.
I do note Senator Murray’s comments on the discount in the minority report of the Economics Legislation Committee’s review of this bill. The government, however, does not agree with those conclusions. There are a number of reasons for this, and I will mention them briefly. Firstly, the discount is aimed at fostering the entrepreneurial spirit in the smallest businesses—microbusinesses—and often those run from home. It is an incentive to small businesses either to get started or to keep going. If the discount does help fledgling businesses to grow and be successful, its value will be more than recouped in the future, not just in terms of economic growth but because a vibrant small business sector is an important part of a vibrant community.
A lot of people who use this provision will not be particularly well off. Many have bought themselves a job, in effect, but many people will be looking to build a successful business from the ground up and will benefit from a helping hand to get going. When I refer to a helping hand, I think I can characterise it as a hand up, not a handout. Many of the businesses which will qualify for the discount are run from home and of course many are run by women as being the most appropriate way to fit in with their work and family responsibilities.
On another point, it is not correct, in my view, to say that the provisions will be abused by rich taxpayers restructuring to bring themselves within the concessions. The antigrouping provisions will stop the kind of restructuring that I think Senator Murray has raised, and about which I know Senator Sherry has asked some questions, which I will deal with shortly.
Senator Murray also foreshadowed an amendment to cut income tax, and there are some points I would like to make in that regard. Firstly, this government does have a strong record when it comes to cutting income tax. Since tax reform began, there have been three rounds of cuts to income tax. The tax cuts provided in the 2004-05 budget were the third stage of the government’s reform to income tax, which commenced on 1 July 2000 and included a second instalment on 1 July 2003. The cumulative effect of these changes was to apply the 30 per cent tax rate over a broad range of income. The tax cuts announced in the 2004-05 budget mean that the 30 per cent rate will apply to incomes over the range $21,600 to $58,000 from 1 July 2004. This will be further extended from 1 July 2005 so that taxpayers will remain in the 30 per cent tax bracket for incomes up to $63,000. More than 80 per cent of taxpayers will remain in or below the 30 per cent tax bracket over the forward estimates period—that is, the four-year period for which estimates are forecast in the budget. Looking at it perhaps another way, less than 20 per cent of taxpayers will be in the top tax bracket and less than 11 per cent of taxpayers will pay the top marginal tax rate.
At the same time, there has been a substantial expansion in the government’s program of family benefits. Taken together—and I think this is a very interesting figure—total assistance to families has increased by more than $6 billion since 1996. Secondly, I do question the wisdom of a tax cut which takes the form of an increase in the tax-free threshold. It is not the way to ensure that the benefit goes to those who need it most. An increase in the tax-free threshold applies, of course, across the board to all taxpayers whatever their incomes—not very well targeted, we think.
The other measures in the bill are all aimed at business. Several of them form part of the package of measures announced in last year’s budget, which were aimed at reducing compliance costs for small business and providing greater flexibility to taxpayers in managing their affairs. These include an extension of the simplified tax system to otherwise qualifying businesses using accruals accounting. The other change to the simplified tax system relates to the depreciation provisions governing the disposal of assets and will put people in the simplified tax system in the same position as other taxpayers when it comes to a change in the constitution of a partnership. As has been noted, the law is being amended to allow more flexibility as to when a family trust election or interposed entity election can be lodged. Lodgement will now be accepted at any time after the relevant return has been lodged.
Similarly, the changes to the non-commercial loans rules provide more flexibility for businesses, especially small ones. The changes will give companies more time in which to put a loan to a shareholder or beneficiary on a commercial footing or to repay it. Now companies will have up until when they lodge their income tax returns for the year, possibly December or even later.
Other measures in the bill concern employers and employees. There is a measure to improve the effectiveness of the employee share regime by ensuring that a company restructure is not necessarily enough to trigger the imposition of tax on the shares and double the fringe benefits tax exemptions for long service awards.
I also note the important measure aimed at encouraging explorations for new petroleum deposits that has been the subject of some of the contributions this morning. Australia has approximately 40 offshore basins that display signs of petroleum potential, but half remain unexplored due to the cost and high-risk nature of exploration in remote frontier areas.
Returning, for the purpose of these concluding remarks, to income tax, there is a further tranche of consolidation amendments, this time with the focus on corrections to the cost setting rules, bad debts and life insurance companies. The last main change removes an anomaly from the film tax offset rules. The law will now be changed so that the division 10BA certificate can be revoked and producers can have access to the new offset if they decide to seek foreign finance which is excluded from division 10BA.
Having made those comments by way of summing up, I turn now to some specific issues that were raised in the course of the second reading debate. Senator Sherry was at the Senate committee hearing where Treasury apparently maintained that the grouping rules were robust, while the Australian Taxation Office said that it would be developing compliance programs aimed at taxpayers attempting to split income to obtain the benefit of more than one offset. I have sought some advice in that respect and can say that the government is confident that the grouping rules address the splitting of income between entities to inappropriately claim more than one offset. It is appropriate for the ATO to develop compliance programs to detect taxpayers who may attempt to claim multiple offsets beyond their entitlement under the law. I am advised that both Treasury and the ATO will monitor the implementation of the offset to identify any unintended outcomes.
With respect to another issue raised by Senator Sherry relating to the effect of the entrepreneurs’ tax offset on effective marginal tax rates, I am advised that eligibility for the entrepreneurs’ tax offset phases out for every dollar of turnover between $50,000 and $75,000. It is a generous phase-out range which ensures that it will not have a significant impact on effective marginal tax rates. Further to that, basing eligibility for the offset on turnover and not profit will ensure that the offset is appropriately targeted at genuinely very small, micro and home based businesses, as is the policy intent. Basing eligibility for the offset on profit would allow much larger businesses with up to a $1 million annual turnover but with small profit margins to be eligible for the offset. Indeed, the calculation for the offset is certainly not complicated. While the ATO is still determining the information taxpayers will need to provide to claim the offset, it is likely that simple, small microbusinesses will only need to provide readily available business information that is already required for income tax purposes. It is certainly not the intention to make compliance difficult. Senator Sherry also asked for a year-by-year breakdown of the costing on petroleum resource rent tax. I am advised that the figures are as follows: firstly, nothing for 2004-05; $2 million in 2005-06; $6 million in 2006-07; and $9 million in 2007-08, which is $70 million over the forward estimates period.
Finally, in relation to Senator Allison’s comments on the petroleum resource rent tax, I want to put on record a couple of comments about renewable energy and the government’s action in that regard. The concession for the petroleum industry is worth $17 million, as I have just indicated in response to Senator Sherry. This government has committed to expenditure of many times that amount in relation to renewable energy. However, in the energy white paper Securing Australia’s energy future, the government committed to a range of measures, including $75 million for solar city trials in urban areas, $134 million to remove impediments to the commercial development of renewable technologies, $20.4 million for the development of advanced storage systems for electricity from wind power and other intermittent generation systems and $14 million to develop a wind forecasting system for Australian conditions. Furthermore, the government will provide $100 million over seven years to the renewable energy development initiative to support renewable energy initiatives with strong commercial and emissions reduction potential. I want to place that on record because there was an inference that the government had not otherwise addressed what of course is a very important matter—trying to look at making renewable energy sustainable. With those remarks, I trust I have dealt with the queries that were raised in debate. I apologise if I have missed any, but no doubt it will be brought up if I have. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I am pleased to be able to join the discussion about why we need to join together the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority. I have over many years had an interest in the role of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and their monitoring of regional television licences. As the Acting Deputy President would be aware, on behalf of the people of North Queensland I have, with others, advocated that there be a change to the licences provided to television broadcasters in regional Australia.
Through the advocacy of many of us in North Queensland we did get change to the licence provisions of regional television licensees. I think the jury is still out as to whether or not they have been successful in delivering greater local content in their news bulletins. Certainly from my perspective there have been some licensees who have gone along not only with the intent of the changed licence provisions but also with the spirit of those provisions. I commend those licensees for that action.
In estimates recently I spoke with ABA officials and asked them if they thought there was compliance with the new licence provisions. As I said, I think the jury is still out on that matter. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I will continue to monitor these changed licence provisions to ensure that the ABA—whether or not it is amalgamated with the ACA or in whatever form it may be—continues to do the job to make sure that regional Australians do get to see themselves on television and that they know what the weather is like in Cairns or western Queensland. I recall a constituent telling me that they were pretty well tired of knowing what the tide times were in Sydney Harbour when they lived in Hughenden. Let us hope that the work that we have done for the coastal communities can extend to those people in western Queensland. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make those brief comments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA AUTHORITY BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-03-16,"—I thank Senator McLucas for that contribution. It was very much appreciated by the duty minister and also the minister responsible for this legislation and the former bill. I want to conclude the debate on the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004. The formation of ACMA will be an administrative merger of the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, and the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA. The ACMA will therefore be responsible for the combined functions of the ABA and the ACA.
The government considers the case for an administrative merger to be a sound one. In particular, a combined regulator will be better placed to make coordinated responses to convergence issues. It is important to note that convergence does not dispense with the distinct policy objectives the government has for the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors. The government therefore rejects the assertion that has been made that the formation of the ACMA is a wasted opportunity. The formation of the ACMA will see the creation of a combined regulator which is simply better placed to make coordinated responses to convergence issues. It is an important and, we believe, entirely appropriate step that has received wide support.
The foreshadowed amendments to the ACMA Bill go beyond the formation of the ACMA. They propose fundamental changes to regulation. They risk seriously delaying the passage of the ACMA legislation and the formation of the new regulator. Amongst the recommendations of the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee is a recommendation that the ACMA be requested to conduct a comprehensive review of all communications regulation. I note that this is supported by both the opposition and the Democrats in the form of a proposed amendment to the ACMA Bill.
I wish to say that the government will continue to review the need for reform of the communications regulatory environment. As I have said in other contexts over the past few days, this kind of regulation is not the kind you can set and forget; it is something that needs to be kept under consideration. So the government will continue to review the need for reform of the communications regulatory environment. In fact, a number of reviews are currently being undertaken—for example, involving consideration of the future framework for digital broadcasting, the most appropriate media ownership rules and a range of matters relating to telecommunications. A major review is therefore unnecessary and potentially extremely disruptive to the processes that are already in place.
The Senate committee also recommended that consumer protection measures be added to the ACMA Bill. Senator Cherry has spoken further about this during the debate, as I understand it. The ACMA Bill establishes the ACMA, which will administer relevant acts which themselves contain consumer protection measures. If further consumer protection measures are considered desirable, it is a matter for the legislation administered by the ACMA and not the ACMA Bill. The government has already put in place a range of consumer protection safeguards across the sectors to be regulated by the ACMA, and these appear to be working well.
I think Senator Conroy has raised the issue of cost savings again as a result of the merger. As the government has said on a number of occasions, there will be no significant savings to government as a result of the merger because all of the regulatory and reporting functions of the ACMA will be the same as those that currently exist for the ACA and ABA respectively. There will be no cost to industry as a result of the merger since there will be no change to the regulatory frameworks or regulatory functions. On that basis, the desire to generate savings from this move must be based on either job cuts or reductions in services by the merged regulator. It is difficult to see how you can have it both ways. Obviously, the government does not wish to see it go either way. It wants to make sure that the regulator is a merged regulator of the existing functions, and that will mean there will be no significant savings. This demonstrates, shall I say, the opposition’s lack of understanding of the media sector and, dare I say it, an inability to come to grips with the appropriate policy frameworks—and it is complex—which will enable the sector to thrive and grow in the future.
In line with the administrative nature of this merger, the government has also retained the appointment process that is currently followed for the ABA and the ACA. Each member will therefore be appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the government. Both the ACA and ABA have a number of acting appointments as a transitional arrangement prior to the establishment of the ACMA. On passage of the legislation, the ACMA members will be able to be reappointed. The establishment date for the ACMA is 1 July 2005 or an earlier date set by proclamation. Much work has already been done to enable this time frame to be met. The agencies are well advanced in planning for the merger. It is, in this context, important that the ACMA is formed by the planned date. I want to impress upon my Senate colleagues that the uncertainty generated by any delay will be disruptive to the regulators, the industry and the smooth functioning of the combined regulators. For all those reasons, I am very hopeful that the amendments that have been foreshadowed can be talked through in such a way that this bill will pass without amendments. I commend the bill, its purpose and policy objectives, and the legislation that relates to it, to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-03-16,"—Talk is cheap, tears are not enough, and being sorry will get you nowhere. Compassion—unless expressed through real, practical and tangible action and assistance—is often useless. Worse than that, it might be self-indulgent and, quite often, harmful. Recently, writer and journalist Patrick West wrote a book titled Conspicuous Compassion: Why sometimes it really is cruel to be kind. West has identified a relatively new phenomenon in our Western culture: ostentatious displays of emotion substituting for sensible action. He calls the phenomenon ‘conspicuous compassion’. Conspicuous compassion elevates public statements, petitions, badges, protests and rallies above practical measures; that is, conspicuous compassion elevates feeling and saying above doing. This is not a harmless development. As West writes:
Such displays of empathy do not change the world for the better: they do not help the poor, diseased, dispossessed or bereaved. Our culture of ostentatious caring concerns, rather, projecting one’s ego, and informing others what a deeply caring individual you are. It is about feeling good, not doing good, and illustrates not how altruistic we have become, but how selfish.
Sadly, conspicuous compassion is ever-present—whether in the big questions of global affairs where the lives, health and wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people are at stake, or in the more mundane matters of domestic social policy. All too often, we fiddle while cities burn, sometimes literally. But many of the challenges facing us, from genocide and global poverty to environmental problems, do have solutions. They are not the trendy and fashionable solutions we hear so much about, but they have one definite advantage: they work. Let us see how we can make a difference.
Faced with the horror of the Holocaust some 60 years ago, we distilled our revulsion into two words: Never again. Sadly, it has proved to be an empty slogan. It has been far easier, and morally far less expensive, to publicly proclaim to the world one’s compassion and sensitivity by denouncing the crimes of the past than to try to do something to stop the crimes of the present. We have recently witnessed 800,000 people slaughtered in Rwanda, while the world did nothing. In Sudan, two million people have died over the last two decades in the conflict between the north and the south—mostly out of the international spotlight. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, up to three million people have died since 1998. That is 300 times more than the number of civilians who died in Iraq after the liberation—with 300 times less international indignation.
These numbers make the crisis in Darfur almost pale into insignificance with its 170,000 dead. Here once again, the international community struggles to come up with a magic formula that would end the crisis without the outside world having to dirty its hands with north African dust. As Mark Steyn, one of the shrewdest of commentators, wrote recently:
After months of expressing deep concern, grave concern, deep concern over the graves and deep grave concern over whether the graves were deep enough, Kofi Annan managed to persuade the UN to set up a committee to look into what’s going on in Darfur. They’ve just reported back that it’s not genocide.
That is great news, isn’t it? For, as yet another Annan-appointed UN committee boldly declared in December: ‘Genocide anywhere is a threat to the security of all and should never be tolerated.’ So thank goodness this isn’t genocide. Instead, it is just 70,000 corpses which happen to all be from the same ethnic group—which means the UN can go on tolerating it until everyone is dead.
Sadly, over the years, the standard response of the international community to genocide, mass violence and gross violations of human rights has been to substitute words for action. This seemingly endless talk, posturing, meetings, committees, commissions, resolutions and summits have all been well meaning and very sincere, but ignore the reality that words do not stop bullets; in most cases, good intentions are not enough to stop killing; and right must be backed with might if it wants to prevail.
The very brutal truth is that genocide is only ever stopped by the force of arms—or not at all. Of themselves, diplomacy, the United Nations and the very best of intentions are not enough. If moral outrage and concern were the only weapons in the arsenal of democracies those 60 years ago, there would be no Jews left alive today at all. The slaughter in Bangladesh was only stopped by India, the killing fields of Cambodia by a Vietnamese intervention and Idi Amin’s reign of terror by Tanzanian troops. In the Balkans the killing was only stopped by an armed intervention, arguably a few years too late.
In Hotel Rwanda, which is screening in cinemas throughout Australia right now, the main character, a hotel owner in the capital, Kigali, assures his wife that everything is fine because ‘they are preparing an intervention force’. ‘They’, meaning us, never did. There is evidence that even a small force of a few thousand soldiers, if inserted into Rwanda early enough in the conflict, could have stopped the genocide. Instead we have Kofi Annan’s mea culpa standing rather feebly against the backdrop of 800,000 white crosses and President Clinton’s admission: ‘Rwanda’s tragedies became one of the greatest regrets of my presidency.’ As Janet Albrechtsen notes, in his 957-page autobiography, Mr Clinton ‘devoted just two paragraphs to that greatest of regrets’. Unless the international community is ready to fortify its concern with armed force, it would be far better for everyone to shut up and greet the dying with mournful silence instead of throwing them an illusory lifeline made up of empty words. Conspicuous compassion kills because it distracts us from the harsh realities of the world outside.
The response to mass violence throughout the developing world is, alas, no different to the response to all other challenges facing the developing world: talk rather than action. Also, if there is to be action, it too often takes the form of symbolic gestures as opposed to practical solutions—and the consequences can be just as dire. Debt forgiveness and foreign aid generally have been two international causes most prominently hijacked by the conspicuously compassionate crowd. The arguments about lending a helping hand to the developing world are fine and reasonable. In practice, however, all too often this results in throwing money at the problem. We can feel better about ourselves because we are so compassionate and so giving, but the problems we are trying to eliminate throughout the developing world show no sign of disappearing.
Poverty is a symptom of dysfunctional political, economic and social systems throughout the developing world. Simply giving more money—either indirectly, by forgiving debts, or directly, through foreign aid—might show others how compassionate and generous we are, but it will prove useless unless we can fix the systemic problems of the developing world. Corruption, lack of transparency, cronyism, nepotism, stunted civil societies, closed socialist economies, overregulation and statism mean that, however much money we give, most of it is likely to end up misappropriated, stolen or wasted. The real solution is democratic reform, opening up the economy, freeing up trade and creating robust social institutions. As the Treasurer said last year:
It is not aid, but trade and economic reform that has delivered these millions out of poverty.
But pursuing that is very tough—it is difficult, it is not sexy and it requires a lot of work. The international community’s approach to global environmental problems is no different from its approach to violence and poverty. All too often we misallocate our limited resources towards trying to tackle prominent and exciting problems such as global warming when the money would be far better and more effectively spent on eliminating problems that simply do not capture our imagination, are not trendy and are not fashionable. It has become a mission of Bjorn Lomborg, ‘the sceptical environmentalist’, and a group of experts known as the Copenhagen Consensus to suggest the best allocation of our resources. The results are quite startling. As Lomborg writes:
... we can do enormous good for the money we spend. The expert panel of economists found that HIV-AIDS, hunger, free trade and malaria should be the world’s top priorities. More than 28 million cases of HIV-AIDS could be prevented by 2010. The cost would be $US27 billion ... with benefits almost 40 times as high.
He goes on to say:
Providing micronutrients missing from more than half the world’s diet would dramatically reduce diseases caused by iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A deficiencies. This would have an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to cost. The expense of establishing free trade would be dwarfed by benefits of up to $US2400 billion a year. Mosquito nets and effective medication could halve the incidence of malaria and would cost $US13 billion, with benefits at least five times the outlay.
Not trendy, not fashionable, but practical. By contrast, under the current popular proposal to solve problems such as global warming, the enormous costs are likely to far exceed the benefits. Unfortunately, the international community will keep on pursuing initiatives like the Kyoto protocol, while for a fraction of the cost we could go a very long way towards improving the lives of billions of people around the world. Battling against the apocalyptic scenarios of The Day After Tomorrow, however, seems far more exciting, fashionable and interesting than fixing sewerage somewhere in Botswana or providing mosquito nets in Sri Lanka. Plus, in the good conspicuous compassion tradition, you can agitate for the Kyoto protocol from the comfort of the armchair in your living room without having to dirty your hands with actual hard work.
Australian society, sadly, is not free of tokenism, symbolism and conspicuous compassion. There are sections of our society which hold a belief that a UN resolution will depose a tyrant or restore peace, that aid and debt forgiveness will transform the developing world or that saying sorry will increase the life expectancy of Australian Aboriginals and stop domestic violence. They are wrong. The Howard government has been consistently resistant to this sort of make-believe social, economic and foreign policy, which is why it has championed initiatives and philosophies such as mutual obligation, practical reconciliation and tied aid.
There is always scope for more. Our approach to tackling international and domestic problems should be simple: think before you speak, prefer actions to words, spend wisely. Further, if it has not worked in the past, it is not likely to work in the future and if it sounds like magic, it probably is. My mother used to always say, ‘If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything.’ I would extend this principle even further: even if you have something nice to say, do not say anything unless you are also prepared to do something.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,4,1,speech

Is the minister aware that the Westpac industrial trends survey for the March quarter showed a 19 per cent jump in the number of businesses finding it more difficult to hire skilled workers? Is the minister further aware that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey for the March quarter showed skill shortages were the biggest barrier to new investment by small and medium sized businesses?

Is the minister aware of the Prime Minister’s comments that skills shortages are a consequence of low unemployment? Is the minister further aware that ABS data released over the last week shows that there are two million Australians who either are unemployed or want more work? Minister, isn’t the Howard government’s quick fix of more skilled migrants an admission of its failure to invest in these two million Australians so they get the skills they need to fill Australian jobs?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skills Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-16,"—I thank Senator Marshall for a question which in fact covers two portfolio areas. I am more than willing to take the question under either of the portfolios that I represent. The government, of course, are aware of the skills shortage that is facing this country. That is why we have put in place a number of policy initiatives. Unlike those opposite, we have actually worked on this problem. We have got a wonderful scheme of setting up technical colleges right around Australia to assist in that area. Unfortunately, state Labor governments have not done that which they should have done in this important area.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—


Senator Forshaw interjecting—

—Order! Senator George Campbell and Senator Forshaw, this is an early warning.
—Indeed, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education issued a media release recently, which just shows how importantly the government is treating this issue. There are currently almost 394,000 people undertaking a new apprenticeship, an increase of almost 200,000 since 1998. With the opening of technical colleges across the country, this number will only get higher. Wouldn’t it be nice, Mr President, to have an opposition who actually contributed to the issues rather than carping from the sidelines? As the Prime Minister so eloquently noted, these shortages are ‘a problem of success’.
The Howard government are focused on tackling the shortage of skilled workers across the country. We are providing solutions and options. The Labor Party provide the carping from the sidelines without an alternative. Our responsibility is to find ways of increasing participation in the work force. The government are currently looking at ways to encourage parents and people on disability support pensions back into the work force by providing relevant assistance and work experience opportunities. Another initiative is the new pilot encouraging parents to volunteer to participate in Work for the Dole to update their skills and gain valuable experience that may lead to work or contribute to building the self-confidence needed to apply for jobs.
We need to look at ways of increasing participation if we are to address our labour shortages. Assisting people on benefits back into work is not a cost-cutting exercise; it is giving people an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity, support their families and contribute to the community. We are about assisting those in most need and providing opportunities for those who can work. The Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged the need for reform in these areas, but all he does is criticise our proposals without coming forward with concrete proposals of his own. We as a government have a good record on increasing employment in this country. We have a burgeoning economy, and when that happens there will, from time to time, be skill shortages. We as a government are addressing this in a way that will assist the economy—with good policies, starting with increasing training and looking at a whole host of other areas—whereas all Labor can do is carp from the sidelines.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by Senators Marshall and Bolkus today relating to skills shortages.
I make the obvious point at the outset that the economy of my home state of Western Australia is built on the bedrock of resources and, to some extent, on value-adding to those resources within that state. Indeed, if one asks the basic question ‘Why does the city of Perth exist?’ one will find that the answer is simple: it exists as a service industry city based on mining, extractive, oil and gas industries. Whilst it is not the sole source of wealth in that city and that state, the resources industry is certainly a major contributor to employment, to growth, to wealth creation and to continuing rising standards of living both in Perth and in Western Australia.
What are the elements that are so critical to that ongoing wealth creation and growth? There are three: resources, infrastructure and a skilled work force. With all these in place, Western Australia and the city of Perth stand on the cusp of a resources boom which not only will benefit that state but also will bring immense wealth and progress to the entire Australian economy. Unfortunately, due to the continuing and now longstanding inaction of the Howard government, that boom stands to be doomed before it starts.
Recently in the media it was revealed that plans to reopen Western Australia’s Bronzewing goldmine, one of the largest in Australia, have been abandoned, for one simple reason: ongoing acute skills shortages in Western Australia. The mine, north of Kalgoorlie, I am advised, would have produced up to 140,000 ounces of gold a year and generated annual revenue of almost $80 million. But the chief executive officer of the mine’s owner, View Resources, recently told the Australian that his company for some time had been unable to hire and retain skilled workers—fitters, electricians, mechanics and plant operators—and was even unable to attract and retain relatively less skilled workers like truck drivers. According to a reputable employer organisation in Western Australia, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, up to 29,000 extra skilled workers will be needed for the construction phase alone of additional mining projects on the plans and committed to in the state of Western Australia.
These skills shortages can be sheeted home to one reason, and one reason only: the results of the Howard government’s policy complacency in the area of skills and training over the last five years. Despite years and years of repeated warnings, the Howard government continues to allow a skills shortage to develop. This skills shortage is threatening over $10 billion worth of Australian resource projects, and at least $6 billion of those resource projects are located in the state of Western Australia. Worse still, the flow-on effect is that those labour shortages are now causing additional and consequential labour shortages and disruptions throughout the entire Western Australian economy. For example, farmhands are reportedly leaving the land for higher paying jobs in mining. Of course, that then leaves an employment vacuum in their remote areas.
Why is this? The government’s own report, Skills for work, which was released last week, helps provide the answer. That report by the Department of Education, Science and Training shows that the number of people starting a trade apprenticeship actually declined—you cannot believe it in this day and age—by 2,300 persons between the years 2000 and 2003. That is an average decline per year of 700 jobs that are not filled by apprenticeships in critical trades in critical states. Now the Howard government are running scared and making policies whilst they are at it. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-16,"—We have just witnessed five minutes of negativity from the Australian Labor Party. Not a single solution was offered. In fact, during question time today, I asked the Australian Labor Party what their alternative policy might be. They sit on the sidelines and carp and criticise, but what is their alternative? There was not a single mention of an alternative in that five-minute speech from Senator Bishop. Indeed, if I can borrow a phrase from my friend and colleague the Treasurer, if we were to start listening to Labor on employment policy we might start listening to Elizabeth Taylor about marriage guidance counselling as well, because there would be no less qualified group of individuals to try to hector and lecture this government about employment policy than the Labor Party.
Let us just have a look at some of the good news that Labor refuse to acknowledge. Australia’s unemployment rate is now 5.1 per cent—the equal lowest level since November 1976. Today there are over 9,889,700 Australians in employment—the highest number on record. There are now over seven million people in full-time employment. The unemployment rate is less than six per cent in every state. Since we have come to government, over 1½ million jobs have been created and 814,300 of those have been full time. Unemployment has fallen by 207,200. The employment rate—that is, the proportion of Australians of working age in employment—has increased by 3.9 percentage points to 71.8 per cent.
Contrast that with Labor’s record when they were at the levers of the Australian economy for 13 years. The recession of the early 1990s resulted in the loss of 313,500 jobs between July 1990 and February 1993 and a 61.6 per cent increase in the number of unemployed people. The total number of unemployed people increased by 455,000 between October 1989 and July 1992.
We as a government have worked hard to reform the Australian economy, be it through tax reform, industrial reform or welfare reform. Whenever the Australian Labor Party were in government and sought to undertake important structural reforms, their job was made so much easier because we as an opposition always put the national interest first, unlike the group opposite today. When we tried tax reform they opposed it, saying it was going to mug the economy and drive up unemployment. When we wanted industrial reform, there was exactly the same condemnation from the Labor Party. They were the prophets of doom, the Jeremiahs of the Australian economy.
But what have we actually seen? Despite their opposition, we were able to undertake some of those reforms. Today, we see the lowest rate of unemployment in a generation, a real increase in wages and the lowest rate of industrial disputation since records were first kept in 1910. They are some of the wonderful employment statistics that we have. Having driven the economy, as we have been able to with the assistance of the private sector and especially small business, we are now in a situation where there is a skills shortage. We as a government have sought to overcome that skills shortage by some imaginative policies, such as federally funded technical and further education colleges right around Australia. I would like to pay tribute to the good work of people like Michael Ferguson, the member for Bass, and Mark Baker, the member for Braddon, in my home state of Tasmania, who have done a wonderful job in promoting that possibility in their part of Tasmania, which will really assist in getting rid of the skills shortage.
We are looking at other ways of achieving outcomes to reduce the skills shortage, but this skills shortage is a result of the Australian economy humming along. The only area where success cannot be used as an explanation for the skills shortage is, of course, in the Australian Labor Party, who suffer a lack of success because of their lack of skills.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-03-16,"—In answering my question today with respect to the skills shortage crisis that we are facing in this country, Senator Abetz put to me a very simple proposition, and he has just repeated it in his contribution. He put to us that the skills shortage is a direct result of the success of the Australian economy. If we want to accept that proposition, we have to accept that the success of the Australian economy is purely accidental, because the fundamental principles underlying any successful economy are all the other things that go to sustaining that successful economy—things such as forward planning for the skills to underpin future growth and forward planning to enable the economy to continue to grow and be sustainable.
If the government are saying that the skills shortage that we are now facing took us by surprise, that we are victims of our economic success, we can only conclude that they had no idea where the economy was going because they were not planning for any growth. They were not putting the necessary instruments, policies, procedures and money into the training that was needed in order to build the skills base of this country so we could maintain economic growth and continue to move forward. The other proposition the government want us to accept is that, all of a sudden, this is a surprise to them: they have only just realised it and they have been putting money into training—albeit in the wrong areas—over a long period of time.
These shortages have been well known for a long time. All the government had to do was to pick up some very well respected reports that they have relied on for other things in the past. For instance, they could have picked up a report put out in July 2003 by the Australian Expert Group in Industry Studies from the University of Western Australia. The government would not have had to read the whole report; they could have referred to the 1½ page conclusion. If they had picked this up back in 2003, maybe we would not be in the crisis we are in now. The report says:
Declining training rates have also reduced a source of full time job opportunities offering good career paths for young people. Had the training rate not declined nearly 19,000 additional job opportunities for young people aged 15-24 would be available.
This government, through their absolute inactivity in this area and their failure to see the signs or to put in place the proper planning to underpin constant economic growth in this country, have denied 19,000 young Australians a good career path—a high skilled, high paying career path. They ought to stand condemned for ignoring the signs and ignoring what all the experts were saying about skills shortages.
It was not only academics who were saying there were going to be skills shortages. The industry training boards, which are set up in every state and are nationally coordinated, have been saying this for many years. Back in the late 1990s they were saying that we were going to run into skills shortages in the second half of this decade. But was the government listening? Absolutely not. People were not just standing around doing nothing like the government was. Unions, for instance, could see the signs. They were reading the reports and listening to what the industry training boards were saying. They were setting up skills training centres and group apprenticeship training schemes, and they were driving skilled apprenticeship training across the country. But the government was doing nothing.
I want to give an example which I know a lot about, and that is the area of electrotechnology. In the year 2000, the Electrical Trades Union in Victoria negotiated with employers in the contracting industry a binding ratio in the certified agreements of one apprentice to be employed for every four tradespeople. They knew what was happening in terms of the skills shortage; but the government’s response was to make those clauses unallowable in certified agreements, so they could not be implemented. So it is not only through the government’s inactivity that we have a skills shortage; they actually impeded those who were trying to do something about it back in 2000. The government wanted to ignore it, they have ignored it, and now the economy is suffering. The brakes have been put on the economy because we do not have the skills capacity for it to continue to grow. This government ought to take complete responsibility for it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Skills Shortages</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,10,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-03-16,"—That speech by Senator Marshall was straight out of the union handbook. It is to be dismissed out of hand. What is more, Senator Abetz has begged him on several occasions to come into this chamber and give us the Labor Party’s policy and solution. We do not hear it from the other side. It is quite pitiful. We have had all week to hear what their policy might be. They have at least kept a focus on this issue all week. For once, they have kept a focus on an issue all week. They have had all week to tell us what their alternative is. What an embarrassment! We have been in government more than nine years now. Are we going to wait right up until the next election to hear what their solution is going to be? They have had all week to tell us, and we have not heard it.
The truth of the matter, as Senator Abetz put to the chamber, is that the government acknowledge the skills problem that the nation has. I can tell Senator Marshall that we acknowledged this back in 1996 when we upped the policy of the former government with the New Apprenticeships scheme. We poured more money into that, and we utterly acknowledged that this was a growing concern. We introduced the New Apprenticeships scheme, which has been highly successful—and I will come back to that later. The point is that the skills shortage is a product of the employment rate. It is something to be proud of. As others have said in the chamber, we have not only a skills shortage but also an unskills shortage. We have an employment problem across the board.
Do not just go and ask the trades about the problems in the skills area but go and ask the fruit-pickers up in Shepparton or Mildura and go and ask the citrus growers. They have an unskilled problem too. The fact is we have an unskilled problem; we have a problem with regard to employment. We ought to be proud of the employment rate in this country that means that everyone, if they want to, can get a job. We have an unemployment rate of around 5.2 per cent, the lowest in 30 years. The male and female full employment rates are at record highs, the number of teenagers unemployed and looking for full-time work is lower than it has been for 30 years, and there are over seven million people in full-time employment, so naturally you are going to have a squeeze on the pool of skilled labour in this country.
It is a good time to be a plumber; it is a good time to be an electrician. And good luck to them. What Senator Marshall did not acknowledge when he gave his union speech in this chamber was that many of those that he claimed the union were trying to sign up have left the union to be self-employed skilled labourers such as carpenters, electricians and plumbers. They are all out of the union; they want nothing to do with union agreements or with being stitched up by the union. They are all self-employed skilled labourers now. There is a whole market out there avoiding the union movement. So it is foolish of you to come in here and suggest that the union could bridge the gap.
What will bridge the gap are the long-term policies of this government and, of course, the marketplace itself. In the time I have left to speak I would like to address the long-term, the medium-term and the short-term policies that this government has in place. But let us make no mistake: the marketplace itself will adjust to the skills shortage we have. So I reject Senator Bishop’s statement that a whole mining company shut down on the basis that they could not get skilled labour. It is utter rubbish. The minerals and energy sector has boom times ahead of it. I would like to look a little deeper into Senator Bishop’s assertion today—go further than what he presented to this chamber.
As I said, in 1996 the government introduced the New Apprenticeships scheme, and we have seen the number of apprenticeships jump, both in trades and out of trades. But more can be done, and we seek to do more. One of the big long-term policies that you ought to look out for on the other side of the chamber, one that you have dismissed and refuse to engage in, concerns the technical schools that this government will be establishing. It is an exciting new policy. We are going back to the old tech schools that were abolished in the seventies and eighties.
—Run properly.
—They will be run properly and specifically focused. There are 24 of them, and they will be run as trade training schools. To me that is the best solution. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-03-16,"—Before I make a few comments on these amendments, I would like to acknowledge the significant number of Indigenous people in the Gallery who have come here to watch these proceedings. It is somewhat ironic that a matter of this importance has to be observed in this way. No, I suppose it is not ironic; it is symbolic. It is symbolic of the circumstances surrounding consideration of this legislation, where it is the Indigenous people who must sit as silent witnesses to the destruction of ATSIC. The policy position that the government has taken is very much in that line, whereby people sit silently trying to make sense of what the government is unilaterally doing and has unilaterally undertaken.
It is a profound disappointment to me that members of the government have pursued the policy position that they have and that the government has reinforced its reneging on the arrangements it made with regard to the commitments for the extension of regional councils. It is also of profound disappointment to me that the Prime Minister’s overriding of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs on this matter has been upheld by the House of Representatives and that the government has chosen to oppose Labor’s very sensible amendments to extend the life of regional councils by six months. Labor’s reasoning on this matter remains. As I have stated before, it is sound and it is moderate. It reflects the agreement that we had reached with the government on these issues. It is practical and it provides the right of Indigenous peoples to genuine representation and genuine determination, at least in the transitional period. It may well be that that in itself was grossly inadequately, but at least there was a provision to allow for some transitional arrangements to be made.
The success of the government’s so-called shared responsibility approach depends entirely on the capacity to which they are able to develop genuine partnerships and genuine agreements and of course the extent to which they have genuine credibility amongst Indigenous people. It is my view that regional councils in so many areas are precisely the bodies that have enabled that credibility to be developed. Much of what the government say they are doing is founded upon the principles that ATSIC itself developed in regard to its regional service agreements. Of course, the government have distorted them and taken an ideological twitch to them in such a way as to reinforce their obsession with changing the power balance that occurs between the Commonwealth and Indigenous people. The government are aiming to secure some 50 SRAs by the end of June and they are seeking some 80 SRAs by the end of 2005. I look with interest to the development of those and the extent to which people on the ground have genuinely been able to make informed decisions and are genuinely able to participate in the process of negotiation rather than being required to sign up to these propositions.
The Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs found that the pressure of bureaucrats inthe ICCs to negotiate SRAs meant that regional agreements will necessarily have to take a back seat. That was evidence given to the committee, and it has become increasingly clear what that means. The committee expressed concern in its report that the process is running in the wrong order, and that is a view I strongly endorse. The process should have been around the other way; there should have been an emphasis on developing regional agreements to allow people to participate to provide the framework in which people could understand the directions that governments were actually taking. The committee report states:
In prior reports such as the ATSIC Review, it was concluded that to gain maximum effectiveness from government spending, individual programs need to be set within a structure of integrated regional planning. Thus, the RPAs should be established first to enable prioritising of regional needs and advise the Ministerial Taskforce on regional funding requirements. Only then should the SRAs be negotiated with communities and families.
We heard many times evidence presented to the select committee inquiry highlighting the confusion and indeed the serious concerns in Indigenous communities about how these new arrangements are going to work, simply because there are not the necessary legal administrative arrangements in place around the regional representative structures. The Murdi Paaki Regional Council is one of the most successful regional councils and it was one that pressed us, through the Senate committee, to ensure that its work was able to be completed. It drew to the Senate’s attention the need for the ongoing framework. Sam Jefferies from the Murdi Paaki Regional Council expressed serious concern based on his own direct experiences of the processes so far. He said:
The Murdi Paaki experience demonstrates that the best way to connect government service delivery for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is through institutions of Indigenous representation, advocacy and participation which have legislative endorsement and accountability. Regional and community governance are the leadership tools that return responsibility to us, lift us out of the poverty trap and break the generational cycle that has handed down a legacy of social dysfunction.
It is in that light that the government’s approach of waiting for new structures to somehow or other organically ‘emerge’—and I understand that is the term they are now using—is a matter of very deep concern, because this provides the fig leaf for the real policy intent that the government are now pursuing, and that is to pick and choose who they wish to deal with, to actually redistribute the power in the already dominant relationship. The Commonwealth already have enormous power and now Indigenous people will lose the capacity to argue their case on a fair and equal basis.
The government’s assurances about pouring resources into communities to support the development of new representative and consultative processes are yet to be demonstrated in practice. That is why we say that the amendments that we moved are so important. That is why we say that the government’s recalcitrance on this issue demonstrates their lack of good faith in policy terms. They have a fundamental commitment to redistributing the power to make an already unequal situation even more unfair. The new arrangements in Indigenous communities will see that there is very little real support being provided to adjust to the new environment.
The government has failed to provide any evidence that the mainstreaming of policy programs in terms of service delivery for Indigenous communities will lead to better outcomes. All the evidence points in the opposite direction. We have just seen this with the education debate in the Northern Territory. When 40 per cent of the Northern Territory’s student population is Indigenous, what is the government doing? It is withdrawing support. It is withdrawing specific Indigenous programs to the point where it is actually mainstreaming those. That is the mechanism by which problems will be swept under the carpet. That is the mechanism by which questions of inequality won’t be faced up to by the Commonwealth. It is a mechanism by which inequality will in fact be exacerbated.
Dr Shergold told us in his evidence to the select committee that the new mainstreaming arrangements would overcome problems that have been highlighted in the mainstreaming of the past. Unfortunately, no evidence has ever been presented to justify the government’s optimism in this regard. There is no evidence to support the assessment that the new way of doing business represents a major cultural adjustment within the Commonwealth Public Service. For instance, the employment practices within the Australian Commonwealth Public Service are actually going backwards when it comes to Indigenous employment. Some departments have only two people from an Indigenous background working in them.
It is quite apparent that the stories we have been hearing from people on the ground indicate that the new arrangements so far are not working well at all. It appears to be little short of a bureaucratic nightmare. It is quite apparent to me that regional councils are an appropriate mechanism to provide people with real capacity to engage the Commonwealth on a realistic basis, but this government seems totally uninterested in undertaking such a provision as that.
The government has made very clear what its attitude is in regard to Indigenous affairs. It will talk big; it will use lots of flourishing rhetoric. It will do very little when it comes to genuinely engaging Indigenous people. I am very concerned about the direction that this government’s policies are taking. I am very concerned that the capacity of this parliament to undertake its effective function in monitoring the implementation of government policies will be seriously handicapped. It is only a matter of time before the latest fashion—the fad—that the government is pursuing will move on. We will see Indigenous programs swept through the bureaucracy in such a way that will see the old problems reinforced. That is why we recommended that there be a serious committee structure to actually try to deal with the problem of improving the capacity of this parliament to monitor the actions of the Public Service. I trust the government takes those recommendations seriously and does engage at least with the parliament, if not with Indigenous people, about the directions that will be taken in that regard.
The real issue here, though, is whether or not Indigenous people are able to get a better deal under the new arrangements. I have seen no evidence to support that contention. I have seen, however, what I think is a genuine commitment by some ministers to actually try to improve the circumstances. The fact remains, though, that the dominant sentiment within the government is one of pursuing a policy aimed at the humiliation of Indigenous people. It is a policy of humiliation—it is a policy which will see Indigenous people’s power in this country diminished. It will see their capacity to engage in society diminished and their capacity to engage in the economy diminished.
It is very clear where we are going now. The new policy direction will not only see a diminution of the capacity for Indigenous people to participate but also see a move by the government on land rights—they will take away those fundamental commitments. The new Senate structure will provide an extraordinary opportunity for some of the darkest and ugliest political sentiments within conservative politics in this country to emerge. It is only a question of time before the fundamental land rights gains made in recent years and the legislative changes that have been made will be undermined by this new direction within the government. They may not be able to overturn High Court decisions but they will be able to move on the legislative structures. I look forward with some trepidation to that prospect.
What we can assure the government of is that we will fight that tooth and nail throughout the country. In my opinion, there will be an overwhelming rejection of the government’s position by Australians at large because they will not want to see a return to the 1960s. They will not want to see a return to the dismal policy positions that have been so characteristic of conservative thinking on these issues throughout recent times and of course throughout the period prior to the fundamental shift in attitudes that occurred from the 1970s onwards.
It is with some regret that I say that the government’s position is such that we are not able to press these issues, and we will not be insisting on our amendments. The government is the loser in that—the government might well have had a situation where it could have actually had a much better way of involving Indigenous people and provided an opportunity for Indigenous people to have a real say about the future directions of government policy. I have no doubt that these questions will be taken up, but they will be taken up on the street. They will be taken up in a whole range of areas in which the government has yet to begin, because there is only one option when people are cast out of the political system, and that is to establish their own political system and their own appeals directly to the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2005-03-16,"—I also want to speak on the message from the House and the position that has been arrived at by the government in rejecting the amendments put forward by the Democrats and by the ALP. I am not surprised on this occasion that this is the point at which we have arrived. Most of all, I would have to describe it as being both indecent and immoral. There has been a lot of truth missing in relation to the picture that has been painted about whether ATSIC has been a failure or a success. Given the debate that we had earlier this week and have had over the course of the last two weeks on Indigenous affairs more broadly, there are going to be some tough times ahead in terms of expecting that the right sort of truth and information is going to be put out there to deal with what is a blind spot in the Australian psyche: issues concerning Indigenous affairs. We all know that they do not garner broad community support, and so it is easy for anyone in a position of leadership to, if you like, stroke a prejudice that exists as opposed to standing up for what is morally correct.
I want to take issue with some of the deliberately misleading statements that are being made by the government to the Australian public about the interest or otherwise of Indigenous people in this particular debate. The fact that there are Indigenous people here sitting in the public gallery is testament to that fact. But, most of all, it is not good enough for the government to keep saying that Indigenous people are not interested or that they are complaining about ATSIC or the like. The reality is that if you speak to people in communities and ask them a question about whether they are happy with the local land council or the local housing company or any local organisation you will invariably get a complaint—most of that in relation to dissatisfaction with services. That does not mean that we decide to get out the bulldozer or the broom and sweep it completely clean. It comes back to the reality that people are saying that they are putting up a challenge to make sure that services are delivered better.
I want to acknowledge particular people in the public gallery today, because they have demonstrated their commitment to and passion for being heard in Canberra. The consequence of this bill disappearing on this day and the position that is being taken by the opposition in supporting the government is that there is no effective national voice for Indigenous people to have their say. I want to acknowledge Commissioner Cliff Foley, the commissioner for the Sydney region. He has come here at his expense, most of all because of the passion that he feels for this particular issue. Another person who it is important to point out is someone the government engaged to give them advice about what the future ought to be for ATSIC—Ms Jackie Huggins. She was part of the review panel with Mr Hannaford and Mr Collins. We spent $1.4 million of taxpayers’ money to come up with recommendations that have, by and large, been ignored by this government. Of course, there is also Pastor Geoffrey Stokes and the mob that has come across from Kalgoorlie—if there is no passion there then why jump on a bus and drive all the way from Kalgoorlie? That has got to demonstrate something. Why go down to the park and camp there? That has got to demonstrate something about their commitment to being heard.
I think it is a shame that we have arrived at this point and I am sure that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will have a very different view, as she always does on this particular issue. But I think that what we keep forgetting in this whole process are three fundamental principles. The first principle is about truth—about truth being put forward in such a way as to provide the basis on which change ought to occur in the first instance.
The second principle is about universality—making sure that Indigenous people in this country are treated no differently from anyone else. I put a challenge out on this occasion, since we are coming up to the May budget: we live in a country where we still have Third World and Fourth World health conditions within Indigenous communities, where many communities are still not even connected to the electricity grid and where water quality is so low. But we do not hear anything coming from the government, who keep talking about surplus amounts of money. It would take a measly $450 million—even half of that would make a big difference—just to bring us up to par with the rest of the nation. So it is no longer sustainable to keep peddling this rhetoric and saying that all of a sudden we can ignore it and that we might put in an additional $10 million and that will be fine.
The third principle is about basic citizenship rights. In the last two weeks I have spoken about many of those. This morning I spoke about the passing of the late Judge Bob Bellear, who could not even get a taxi in his home town of Sydney. That is about citizenship rights. It is about anyone walking out on the street being able to hail a taxi. It is about a bus driver letting you on the bus if you have a ticket. It is about going into a real estate agent and being treated the same as any other person—the books are open and you can access housing accommodation. That is why problems are so bad within this country: because the government has this blind spot in its thinking. The government is perpetuating the blind spot style of thinking right across the Australian psyche and no-one is prepared to stand up and do something about it.
I heard the minister on the radio this morning talking again about why ATSIC was such a failure. Two reasons came up. The first was the fact that only 20 per cent of people voted in ATSIC elections in 2002. I have read the same reports from the Australian National University that talk about what has happened over the years since ATSIC has been in place. I think that it is a misrepresentation of the situation entirely—again, truth gone missing. The turnout of 21.6 per cent in 2002 was in fact an increase from 1999, despite the fact that there are other shock jocks and pundits out there who will say again that this is a complete failure—a failure and an experiment of some mythical separation that has occurred in this country. This indicates to me that some things take time and that eventually you do get there, but I think what we forgot to mention is that, in other countries where non-compulsory voting exists, you get similar results. It is a very significant point that the minister has neglected to mention this fact when peddling the message that ATSIC has failed because only 20 per cent of Indigenous people voted.
In addition to that, there are many other factors which should be taken into account when we comment on how representative an elected body is. I would advise the minister to perhaps go back and have a look at the ANU report and see more broadly the other things that are determining factors, if you like, in relation to why people participate or not. But one of the key things to point out in this report is that 30 per cent of the elected members of regional councils across the country—they are the ones that are being kicked in this particular case—are women. I do not see that same sort representation in the national parliament or in the state or territory parliaments. Yet we have got one success there that says that women are getting a chance to have a voice in a formal way on behalf of their communities in regional councils. It seems to me that when you look at it as being better than the representation of women in the Australian parliament, that says a lot. I would have thought that the government would have come on board and supported that right from the very start.
Regarding the statement that regional councils are non-Indigenous structures—the other message that is being put out there—the minister is also being very disingenuous when she pretends that regional councils should go because they do not represent traditional Indigenous structures. This is something that she has latched onto in an attempt to portray the government as supportive of Indigenous self-determination as the alternative. You have got to ask the question: where is self-determination in the decision that is about to be taken by the government? Where is self-determination in what is happening out there on the ground, where shared responsibility agreements arise largely because of an unequal power relationship between those that negotiate and the government? They do not get a choice. It is not a real choice if there is no alternative but to take the money and run.
Mulan is the classic example of that. And yet we do not deal with the broader issues of trachoma or about fixing up the roads, housing and the circumstances of water quality within communities—let alone whether water is available. We all know, and the government have stated many times, that they are opposed to Indigenous self-determination, and I think the government should stop curtailing genuine debate by pretending otherwise. If there were real care about Indigenous people being represented, the first thing they would have done would be to sit down and look at the ATSIC review report and at least make an attempt to adhere to some of the recommendations that have been put forward.
The review report outlined a system by which Indigenous people would have the flexibility to design more traditionally representative structures if they desire and would have a capacity to do so. Yet we are being told on this day, when we come to the final vote on whether ATSIC remains or not, that somehow the government have achieved this revelation, that they have now just discovered traditional structures for governance of Indigenous communities. That is what Indigenous people said as a result of the review that took place across the country. They said that over two years ago, but there has been no response to that particular fact or acknowledgment that it even occurred.
We recognise as well that the ATSIC act and the way that it works does have problems. Indeed, the ATSIC review report did consult widely and address this very issue back in 2003. In the Senate committee we heard discussion about the varying community opinions on preferred representative structures, which are more reflective of traditional representative structures. That is what regional councils like Murdi Paaki in my home state of New South Wales were saying to us and that is what is happening in other parts of the country.
It must be emphasised that, before the ATSIC elections, there were years of consultation on how it should work. Many options were presented to Indigenous people. This government has done no consultation at all in putting forward its alternative policy and vision for dealing with Indigenous affairs in this country. It is not enough to create the National Indigenous Council, as much as I respect the people who have been chosen to sit on that. Every one of those people is credible and respected for the work they do out there in the communities. But they know, like I do, that there is a limit to what can be achieved if you have no authority and lack the legitimacy of being there representing your community, whether that is regionally or locally. It is simply not there. There is no guarantee that the government is even going to listen to them in any instance.
We should also remember in these debates that the regional councils as a whole have been extremely effective. They have delivered services of quality and they have done that with limited resources over the past 15 years. I want to remind the Senate that the problem of different traditional representative structures is not a new one that has been recently discovered. This was realised and grappled with when ATSIC was being established. It is something that the communities have spoken about over many years. The election system, of course, is based on a Western understanding but it is also well accepted in many areas, not just in relation to ATSIC. Let us not forget that.
What will the government do when it comes to community councils that exist out there in communities and function like local government bodies? What will the government do to the various community organisations that have been established under laws akin to the Corporations Law in this country which are not traditional but based on a Western system? How will they respond to that? Will they abolish all of these organisations such as legal services, land councils and housing companies and so on? There are organisations out there doing a pretty damned good job and they need to be supported. That message is not coming from this parliament.
I am going to ask the minister some questions to get a better explanation, at least in Hansard and certainly to the Indigenous people here, about why the government does not agree with the amendments that have been put forward by the Democrats and the ALP. I want to put it on the record because there has been so much confusion, chaos and mixed information coming from government, even through the Senate select committee process, about whether the government has a clue about what it is doing in Indigenous affairs. What I do say about the changes in this country is that Indigenous people have to be responsible for their ideas and the things that happen within their communities. What we have is the government telling them from the top down that it will be in charge of deciding what is good and how that is going to occur within a community. That is not good enough. The government and especially the minister ought to explain the rationale behind and reasons for the decisions that are being put forward, why the government has taken the path that it has and why it has ignored the review committee.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-16,"—I want to acknowledge the Indigenous voices in this debate. Unfortunately, only one of them is able to speak in the chamber, but there are many people in the public gallery who are all voices in and part of this debate even though they do not have the opportunity to speak in this chamber.
It is sad that, in what we are doing, the amendments for the extension of the regional councils are not being supported. What is far sadder is that there is going to be a vote in this chamber and both of the major parties will vote together to abolish ATSIC. That is sad, but not because everything about ATSIC is great. Others have talked about the ATSIC review, in which a whole range of proposals for improving the structure of ATSIC were put forward. Indeed, four different options were put forward. None of those involved the abolition of ATSIC. ATSIC has done many great things in its time. It has stood up against the government when it has been arguing on Indigenous issues. It has run great programs such as CDEP and CHIP.
What makes it so sad that ATSIC will be abolished as a result of the vote that we are going to see here today is that that is an indication of the view of the government and the opposition about self-determination. For all of its flaws, ATSIC was set up as a mechanism by which Indigenous people could have control of Indigenous affairs. That is at the heart of the concept of self-determination. How many more reports do people need to see from overseas about the better practical outcomes that occur for Indigenous people when they are in control of their own affairs? Research has been carried out recently comparing the diversity and indigenous policy outcomes from four different nations—Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The report states:
With regard to income, education, health and life expectancy, Indigenous people in Australia are worse off than other people in Australia, and worse off than Canadian, New Zealand, and American Indigenous peoples with respect to key indicators ...
The report points out things like the rate of Indigenous overrepresentation in our prison system. The Indigenous rate of incarceration is 1.4 times that of the non-indigenous population in America. It is six times that of non-indigenous incarceration in Canada. It is eight times that rate in New Zealand and 14 times that rate in Australia. North American indigenous people live about six years less than the national average of the population. In New Zealand there is a nine-year gap and in Australia there is a 20-year gap between the average life expectancy of Indigenous people and the national average life expectancy. The report goes into this issue in a bit more detail. It states:
Australian Indigenous people are at great risk from 35 to 54 years of age. Three quarters of deaths are due to circulatory diseases, injury, cancer, respiratory and endocrine diseases, just as for other Australians, but among Indigenous Australians, deaths occur at three to five times the rate. Australian Indigenous death rates for men and women are higher than Maori death rates, and much higher than Native American death rates.
                  …         …         …
The total life expectancy of Australian Aborigines is similar to life expectancy in third world countries. Unlike these countries, low Aboriginal life expectancy in Australia in the main is caused by high early adult mortality. Patterns of mortality among Indigenous Australians are markedly different to those of most other populations ... In Australia low life expectancy is caused by low employment, high tobacco and alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, stress, shortcomings in the available health care and educational systems ...
New Zealand shows that much can be achieved over a nine-year period with twin policies of education and economic development. North America shows that treaty rights linked with negotiated employment rights and educational investment produce positive outcomes, and broadly-understood diversity policies have assisted many Indigenous people achieve their potential. During the past ten years, Native American infant mortality and heavy drinking rates have continued to decrease. Their employment in large firms has grown.
Canadian policies have assisted Aboriginal Canadians extend their life-spans since 1991, and New Zealand Maori people, assisted by enlightened national policies, have made very strong educational, employment and economic progress since 1991.
The Greens come from a place where we stand up for self-determination because we stand up for Indigenous rights. If you come at this argument seeking practical, measurable outcomes for the benefit of not just Indigenous Australians but the whole of the community you find that there is research after research from so many different countries that take a different approach in the way which they deal with Indigenous people. It shows that, for all those people who commit to a genuine process of self-determination, the practical outcomes are better. How much more simply do we need to put these arguments? How much more overseas research needs to be carried out for the government to accept that, for the practical outcomes that it talks about, the path it needs to take is self-determination. Others of us have a different reason for putting up arguments to support self-determination, but even within the government’s framework for practical outcomes, how many more reports do you need?
Part of the abolition of ATSIC is about a removal of the recognised voice of Indigenous Australians in an international arena. Throughout the committee process that I have been part of, suggestions have been made that national Indigenous bodies can represent themselves in international fora. They can apply to the United Nations for NGO status in order to speak at a range of different international fora but they will not have the same legitimacy as a body like ATSIC, which the government recognises as the national voice for Indigenous people in those international fora. I cannot remember the terminology that Senator Carr used to describe the way in which the government thought other representative bodies would be brought to bear. Was it ‘organically arise’?
—It was ‘organically emerge’.
—The government thinks there will be organically emerging representative bodies for Indigenous Australians. There are many Indigenous representative organisations that are organically arising or that have organically arisen for a long time, but what is needed and what the government has not committed to is the support and funding for such national representative Indigenous organisations to exist. This occurs in the places overseas that I have talked about, like Canada. I believe it is appropriate for Indigenous people to determine the structures that they want. Many Indigenous people all across this country are doing exactly that. They are working out what structures they want, what form of representation they want from traditional owners and elders and what form of election they want. Everyone has a different model. The government has acknowledged that, but what the government has not acknowledged is that it needs to support and financially support those representative structures to bring them to bear.
This is so that Indigenous people can have a voice that is supported by the government at national, community and local levels. The government is dismantling the one that exists. It is saying: ‘Great! You can have your voice over there, but we’re not going to support you. We’re not going to help you to be a voice for Indigenous Australians in putting arguments to the federal government, in stating views in an international arena.’ The government has no intention, as far as we are aware, of providing the support and resources for those national bodies to exist. That is the great shame today. The great shame today is a vote against self-determination. I will say it again: how many more bits of overseas research do we need to tell us that when Indigenous people have control over Indigenous affairs the best outcomes are achieved?",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2005-03-16,"—I flagged that I wanted to ask a number of questions of the minister to get some explanation of what the government is proposing. In particular, I asked the minister for an answer on what is going on with the replacements for regional councils—where that process is up to. I asked for one particular reason. The minister would be aware that she described arrangements for new regional structures as ‘a blank page’ in a meeting with Western Australian regional councillors. She has repeatedly said that the government is consulting regional councils for plans on replacement bodies. I am told that, at least in Western Australia, none of the regional councils have been spoken to. I am further informed that there has been no consultation—not just with the regional councillors but with the people themselves.
Indigenous people in that part of the country are saying that they have not been part of the process. Frankly, when you consider that Indigenous people are the ones who have been working themselves into the ground to have structures ready to propose on 1 July this year, the government do not appear to be doing anything to assist or, if they are, that has not been proclaimed anywhere that I know of. I would be interested in what the government have put on this blank page or what has emerged from consultations that are supposedly occurring. I am told that there are no consultations.
We cannot get the amendments up. As an alternative, what the government are putting up should have some explanation, particularly as state governments are now supposedly committing themselves to supporting new structures. How is that happening? Where is that happening in the country? I am not familiar with that and whether or not any Commonwealth government resources have been put into the representative structures. How is all this—this organic emergence, I think it was described as—going to occur? It sounds to me a little bit like tofu from the health food shop. The reality is that I would be interested to hear from the government about what they are proposing to do, what answers they have on the replacements for regional councils and where that process is up to.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-03-16,"—I will come to Senator Ridgeway’s questions, but first I will make the contribution I was going to make before he put his question and I will respond to the preliminary remarks made in the committee stage. I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed and disillusioned with the debate we have had to this point today. I often make the joke about this house not being called the upper house without good reason or, put another way, that the lower house is not called the lower house without good reason. I usually follow that up, if someone does not understand what that means, by saying that, while all of us who get elected have a portion of parliamentarian and a portion of politician in us, I think the parliamentarian portion in senators is usually higher. Yet I have sat through a debate today on an issue that is important to many people, and one person from the party that proposed the abolition of ATSIC came in and professed to regret its passing.
Forgive me but I am confused about how someone from the Labor Party, who sought to make an issue of it first up and said they wanted to get rid of ATSIC, could come in here—and I do not suggest simply because we have some First Australians in the gallery—and put forward that proposition. It is a profound disappointment. It is not only that aspect of Senator Carr’s speech that I find profoundly disappointing, because I had thought—and I still do think, except for a couple of the contributions here today—that there is a tremendous amount of goodwill around Australia, at all levels of government and across political lines, to make more successful improvements than we have made to the lives of Indigenous Australians.
I mistakenly thought that goodwill was represented here and that we could have a civilised debate about differences of opinion on how to get to a particular place. Yet I find that Senator Carr feels free to come in here and allege that it is Australian government policy to humiliate Indigenous Australians. He feels happy in making that statement. I know that is not the case. I know that thousands of Indigenous Australians know that is not the case. What is worse, I think Senator Carr knows that is not the case. Yes, there is a difference of opinion between Senator Carr and me, but at the moment it seems to be limited to whether regional councils should stay, in this aspect at least, for a further six months. I do not allege bad faith on Senator Carr’s behalf because he has a different view; nor do I do that to you, Senator Ridgeway, because you have a different view. Nonetheless, let me continue with my response to these contributions.
As I said, around Australia I sense a willingness, which I have never seen in any other portfolio, to put day-to-day politics aside and get on with the job of working together, and we are doing that effectively with state and territory Labor governments. There is no better example of why we need to put that aside and work together, irrespective of our political persuasion, than the Lockhart River example that I have used before. The Lockhart River has 51 contracts with 17 different government agencies across the Australian government and the Queensland government—that is, 51 sets of guidelines, 51 applications, 51 contracts and 51 acquittals—in what is still a small community, relatively speaking.
Thankfully we have made an agreement with the Queensland government that we will sit down, make a better agreement with Lockhart River and bring it down to one contract. But we will do more than that: we will make sure that Lockhart River is a part of that. We can have a three-way partnership and listen to those people directly on the ground. In fact, I recently had a video conference with the people of Lockhart. They already have one form of agreement, but they still have the 51 complicated agreements to reduce. Unless state and federal people and Liberal and Labor are prepared to put those differences aside, make that change and make that contribution, we will continue to have the higgledy-piggledy mess that has inhibited better developments for Indigenous Australians.
I turn to the suggestion put by Senator Ridgeway. With respect, Senator Ridgeway, you came in here and said that three things have been forgotten, and one of them was the truth. The statement that you are wanting to make, but for one reason or another are not prepared to make it directly and front up to it, is that you think that the government is lying, that you think I have been lying and that other ministers have been lying. I disagree with you but I do not call you a liar. I ask you to reflect on your remarks in that respect. The second point you raised is one of universality: that we all should have the same opportunities. I agree with that; I do not know anyone who does not. But by raising it and saying that it has been forgotten, you want to imply that others do not agree with you. You want to say it without really saying it, which is not, with respect, the most courageous contribution you could have made.
 (Senator Bolkus)—Order! Senator Vanstone, could you address your remarks through the chair, please?
—Yes, Mr Temporary Chairman, I certainly can. It is not the most courageous contribution that Senator Ridgeway could have made.
—We heard it the first time.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman, for your assistance in this respect. Senator Ridgeway then went to the question of basic citizenship. I am sorry to interrupt your photo session, Mr Temporary Chairman.
—You do not know what it is.
—It is obviously very good if you cannot be distracted from looking at photographs when an important debate is going on. Nonetheless, I am happy to talk through you while you look at photographs.
—Senator Vanstone I am tuned in to you very well. Please address the issue before the chair.
—The other issue is basic citizenship. I remember the story that Senator Ridgeway told the other day. I did not hear the one he referred to this morning but it obviously related to someone being unable to hail a taxi. The contribution he made the other day was with respect to someone not being able to get on a bus. He raises the issues of real estate agents, taxis and buses. Senator Ridgeway, nobody disagrees with you. I say again that you sought to say that these three issues have been forgotten, as if it were only you who somehow thought that these things were special. With respect, that is a terribly egocentric contribution to make.
Nonetheless, senators have also referred to the good job being done by a number of regional councils. I am pleased that people referred in particular to Murdi Paaki, because I think they have done a great job. In particular, I single out Sam Jeffries for whom I have great respect, as do other members of the government. Murdi Paaki might be a bit sick of being cited as the regional council that is doing so well. It is my view that if you speak to Sam Jeffries he will acknowledge to you, as he has to me in my office, that there are regional councils that are not doing a good job and that all the Murdi Paaki people want to do is just get on with it and get better outcomes. I think that it is important to put that on the record as well.
I go back to where I perhaps should have started. Even with my glasses on, I cannot recognise everybody in the gallery; perhaps I have not met everyone in the gallery. I recognise Jackie Huggins, ATSIC Commissioner Clifford Foley, Pastor Stokes and some of the people from Kalgoorlie whom I met the other day and who came over on the bus. I have heard various statements by various people about the government’s unwillingness to meet these guys and listen to them. I think: ‘Where do people get that from? Why do they say that?’ I had what I thought was a very friendly and useful meeting with those people on a range of issues which I have agreed to follow up. I just say that for the record in case other people did not realise what the situation was.
I go back to Senator Ridgeway, who raised the health issue. Senator Ridgeway might have substantially added to the breadth of his contribution if he had mentioned in passing that this government that Senator Carr says is so determined to humiliate Indigenous Australians has in fact doubled health funding since 1996 in real terms. It is an odd thing to do, if you want to humiliate people, isn’t it, to double the funding in real terms? It just seems inexplicable to me. Be that as it may. Incidentally, I do not mean that I think the health situation is anywhere near what it should be. But I think it is worth just making the point.
Senator Nettle went on to make the point about self-determination—controlling people’s own affairs—to which I say to Senator Nettle that the government seeks to deal directly with individual Indigenous communities and let the people in those communities have a real say about the choices for their future. If self-determination means anything, it means individual people, Indigenous or non-Indigenous, having the chance to have a say about the future of their individual lives in their individual communities. I reject the proposition completely—lock, stock and barrel—that having a structure called ATSIC somehow gave people in individual communities a voice, because I do not believe that it did. So if you want to talk about self-determination, go to the individual and ask them if they have a chance to have a say about how their life is run, because that is what this government is determined to achieve by going directly to individual communities. But the senator raised Canada, New Zealand and the United States and suggested that if we followed their management of indigenous affairs we would be better off. That was the assumption that was put
I remind Senator Nettle that Canada, New Zealand and the United States have nothing like ATSIC—that is, a structure set up by the government. People should be aware that Australia was—I think it is about to be the case—the international exception in legislating to establish its peak Indigenous advocacy organisation. The affairs of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada or the National Congress of American Indians, for example, are not regulated and governed by the parliament in Ottawa or the congress in Washington. The governments of most other countries, unlike Australia, do not supervise elections for their indigenous elders and leaders, nor do they exercise the power to suspend the chairpersons or members of such organisations. I think that is worth mentioning, Senator.
There are some other points that I want to make and I will progressively go about making them since I feel strongly about the contributions that you have made. The point has been made that somehow we cannot trust mainstream agencies. The point has not been made by Labor or Democrat spokespeople that that is what most of the states do. That point has not been made, because the states are of a Labor persuasion. What does that tell you? The complaint about mainstreaming made against the federal government by senators opposite and down that end is a political one; otherwise, it would have been made against their own governments for what they are doing in the states and the territories.
But it might be of interest to know the advice I have on some of the achievements we have made—which, while not limited to mainstream departments, are substantially contributed to by them. One example is death rates. These are still nowhere near good enough. My advice is these figures are collected in the states that do appropriate health collection vis-a-vis Indigenous affairs. I will start with respiratory illness. Between 1992 and 1994, the death rate from respiratory illness was seven to eight times the non-Indigenous average. In 2002, it was down to four times. Is this an accident? Was the Commonwealth government not involved here?

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-03-16,"—Quite clearly, the minister is intent on making sure these proceedings are drawn out.
—I have made one contribution.
—It was the manner in which you made the contribution. The minister seeks to attribute motive to the opposition. In what you said, you have attributed motive to other senators here. You start with a proposition that we are disingenuous in our concerns for the abolition of ATSIC. What we have said from day one is that the government’s actions were an administrative fait accompli. I have made that point numerous times. At no point, though, has anyone in the opposition said that we would not be seeking to essentially re-establish a national Indigenous body at the first opportunity we had. In fact, the position that was put forward at the Adelaide meeting of national Indigenous leaders just a few months ago was the position that we share. Professor Mick Dobson, when speaking about that meeting, told a Senate inquiry:
... the most significant point of agreement—overwhelming agreement; there was not one dissenter—was the need to maintain a national representative Indigenous voice. Participants at the meeting stressed that they—we, if you like; Indigenous Australians—should elect for themselves who would represent them at a national level.
We take that view very seriously—to the point where no member of the opposition has expressed a different view. We have all said that there needs to be a replacement for ATSIC. We will discuss with Indigenous people what that replacement will be. We will not be imposing a position; we will be taking our soundings from Indigenous people about the representative structures that they want to deal with a Commonwealth Labor government—which will occur after the next election. Indigenous people will not have to wait that long to overturn the position that this government is pursuing. We will establish a new structure to ensure that Indigenous people are genuinely represented at a national level and do have a voice at the table. We will restore self-determination so that the voices of the First Australians can be heard in Canberra. They will have a public voice to ensure that the Australian people know what the attitudes of Indigenous people are.
The government say that they are not in the business of making party political points about these questions. That is exactly what they have done throughout the time Senator Vanstone has been minister. They have made party political points to try to legitimise the actions that they have taken. They have sought to demonise Indigenous leaders. They have run their forensic audits; they have spent nearly $1 million pursuing individuals in a personal vendetta. And not one conviction has resulted from that. They have sought to denigrate individuals whenever there was bad news on the horizon. The public servants here know that. They have tried to cover up the fundamental mistakes of the government by going after individuals.
We have had members of this parliament convicted and jailed. Was that ever an excuse to close down the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia? No, never. But that is not the position that this government takes. It seeks to individualise this; to personalise it. It seeks to find fault for the structural problems in individuals rather than in the policies of this government. The policy position of this government is at fault here. This ought to be understood in those terms.
The government say that people have not voted in the numbers that they would like. There are local governments, community organisations and voluntary associations all over this country that have small turnouts. That is not an excuse to close them down, yet that is the argument the government pursue. They say that people do not behave the way they want them to, so they are going to close them down. Essentially, that is the argument the government wants to pursue in terms of their new policy directions. They want to deal with the people who they choose to deal with on terms that they choose to deal with them on. They do not like the idea of people being a bit aggressive, they do not like people being a bit boisterous, they do not like the people coming forward being a bit angry. For Christ’s sake, if there is anything to be angry about it is the way in which Indigenous people are being treated in this country. The government do not like that. They want to pick and choose who they will deal with. That is their notion of determination: they will determine who they deal with. I say this sincerely and genuinely: your policies will lead to the humiliation of Indigenous people in this country. That will be a direct result—
 (Senator Bolkus)—Senator Carr, could you please speak through the chair.
—That is the policy position that this government has adopted, and that is the outcome that will result. It is not about giving people a fair go. It will not produce the outcome which actually narrows the gap in inequality in this country. So I say: if the minister were serious about these matters, the government would not be pointing the finger over here and saying that there is some bad motive. We are putting a position which I think will be borne out—and it certainly has been borne out in the history of this Commonwealth. I can see no evidence to the contrary that the government has presented to date. All I have seen so far are my grave concerns being borne out that this government is repeating the mistakes of the past—the historic mistakes in this country—and going backwards to the assimilationist policy which produced the huge inequalities that this country now faces.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2005-03-16,"—I want to respond to some of the comments made by the minister. Frankly, I am astonished and find it remarkable that they were ever said in the first place. With respect, Minister, you should not attribute motive or some malice in relation to what is being said here or even suggest that it is all based on some egocentric need to respond, as if there were a collective ownership on Indigenous morality in this country. If the minister judges Indigenous health in this country by saying, ‘In the time that we have been in government we have doubled the amount of funding, and that amounts to success,’ that is ridiculous. It is ridiculous for one simple reason: because people are still sick and dying in communities. Call that egocentric or a personal motive if you want. I do not mind having it attributed to me, because the reality is that I have raised this on many occasions over the last six years—even before the minister became the minister for Indigenous affairs—with little result.
Thankfully, there was $10 million given in last year’s budget, but it hardly even touches the ground when things are so dry. Yet the minister seems to suggest that somehow there is ill will being created, because she thinks that other people cannot have different views and have those viewed expressed unless they are a personal attack on her. I take the view that they are not an attack upon the person. She is a minister in a government, the government have put forward policies and those policies are being criticised—rightly so. It is not unreasonable to come into this place and put forward alternative views, especially views about real issues that are happening with things out there on the ground. I do not know what the minister is talking about when she says that it is all about some alternative or different view being put forward, given the way the government have dealt with Indigenous affairs.
Perhaps the minister might have some collective caveat on this particular issue, but the first decision that her government took was to cut more than $400 million from the ATSIC budget. It was under fairly difficult circumstances at the time, when they wanted to respond to and deal with issues of domestic violence. I seem to recall that I asked a question in this place—and the minister may then have been the minister dealing with family and community services—about why $8 million went back into consolidated revenue in the heat of a public debate in this country about violence against Indigenous women. It seemed to me to be a lot more sensible to respond by giving the money to the communities where it was most needed, and there was certainly a cry for that to occur.
I seem to remember in 1997 the Prime Minister was on TV, holding up a map of Australia with 70 per cent of it blacked out and saying that that was what Mabo was going to result in. I hope the minister is going to become a champion of Indigenous affairs in this place come 1 July and will stand up for these issues. I also seem to recall that the Native Title Act was amended in such a way as to abolish the legitimate property rights of Indigenous people in this country. I hope that the minister is going to put some native policy in place to roll back native title and give it a fair go. I ask the minister—and it is on a similar matter—why is the government not jumping up and down when she complains about the state ALP government in relation to Redfern? Why it is okay to be able to geographically zone off an area, held under private title mind you, with a caveat from the Commonwealth government? Why are no words being spoken about protecting private property rights? Become a champion—or is that egocentric?
I ask the minister for some explanation on those things, not because of any bad intent or malice but because there are real things happening in Australia, there are real things happening in government and there are real policies being put forward. I think Senator Carr is right when he talks about the demonising of the leadership in this country. I saw a raid on a national Indigenous newspaper. I did not see a response from the government saying that it ought not to have happened and that there are many other newspapers or print outlets in this country that have received exactly the same sort of briefings, leaked or otherwise. No-one got out there and proclaimed that one group was being dealt with differently from another, because that is normal business in relation to Indigenous affairs in this country. I saw a government that engaged some firm to drive up in white vans and walk into 28 regional and state ATSIC offices across the country and take the paintings off the walls. If you want to talk about a decent way of doing business—a proper way—why not just walk through the front door and talk to the people and say, ‘This is what we are proposing to do’? I still do not have an answer about how much that cost or how much it cost to put the advertisements in the papers this week to tell people that there is some legal uncertainty.
I do not see the government standing up and defending the Racial Discrimination Act in this country, whether or not shared responsibility agreements are in breach, as the social justice commissioner said during the Senate select committee process. I do not see the government standing up and defending the Racial Discrimination Act when it comes to dealing with what is happening to property rights in places like Redfern. So I think it is a little disingenuous for the minister to attribute personal motive or malice to me. What I see here is standing up for people who are without a voice. When this legislation goes through, there will be no formal way for these people to have their views heard. You talk about the organic emergence of different structures coming into place. I hope that is the result but, quite frankly, it does require support to make sure that that occurs.
But I have to say that it is absurd for the minister to come in here and suggest that somehow egocentric views are being put forward. I do not mind having motives attributed to me and I can say right from the start that I am not suggesting in any way that the minister or the government are lying. I am saying that much of this information should be out there already—information from the review report and the Senate select committee report and information that has come from the various Senate committees of inquiry. The evidence is already there and it speaks loud and clear for itself. I am echoing what is already in those reports; I am not making it up. I am not doing it for any personal reasons; I am doing it because I believe an injustice is about to happen.
I do not expect that in this particular case the minister will stand up and champion the cause of ATSIC or even, at the very least, that of regional councils for the next six months. I hope that from 1 July, as the minister, you are able to become the champion out there—because there certainly will not be any way for Indigenous people to have their views heard then. I would hope we can work with each other on those issues but, given today’s debate, I doubt whether that will be possible. However, I will certainly be talking to Sam Jeffries because I know he does a hell of a good job out there.
The government needs to be reminded of what actions it has taken and not come in here and put on the pretence that nothing has happened in the last six years or in the time since the government came to office. The reality is that things have gone backwards so fast that there is utter chaos and confusion. The government is not responding, even when asked things about the blank piece of paper and what is on it. I will be interested to hear the minister’s explanation about that, because that is what Indigenous people are waiting for. But it is not unreasonable to come in here and ask for an explanation and to put views forward. No personal motive should be attributed, because that certainly is not what is intended. It is about policy debate, and that is what is being dealt with.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-16,"—I want to point out that the peak national Indigenous body in Canada is funded by the Canadian federal government and that I believe mainstreaming of Indigenous services is not self-determination. I know that the minister in her answer will point to shared responsibility agreements as being part of what she sees as self-determination. I do not believe that the negotiation of agreements by local communities, families and individuals with the whole of the Commonwealth government represents an equal partnership or equal relationship that equates to Indigenous control of Indigenous affairs.
I am pleased that the minister has raised the example of the Lockhart River community and the 51 different agreements. During the public hearings of the Senate select committee, I asked a government official about the number of shared responsibility agreements that they anticipated would be coming into effect. The answer they gave related to the Mulan community in Western Australia. They said for that community they had different individual agreements for different issues that the community wanted to raise—and one example of that is the petrol bowsers for the washing of faces. But in answer to my question that government official said, ‘These are all the different shared responsibility agreements that the Mulan community has,’ and he went through them.
To me, that is very similar to the situation that the minister describes for the Lockhart River community, for which there are 51 agreements on particular issues with state and Commonwealth governments. So maybe the minister could throw more light on how many shared responsibility agreements the government anticipates there will be for each community, given that the government official answering that question said there would be one for each different issue that the community wants to raise.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-03-16,"—I will address some responses. Senator Ridgeway, I notice that you again I think implied that, because I had remarked there had been an increase in funding—about a doubling of funding in real terms—somehow I was saying therefore things were okay in health. In fact, the Hansard will show that I made it very clear at the time that an increase in funding has not resulted in all the achievements we think ought to be made. With respect to your remarks on what I said on that, both specifically and generally, the Hansard will show what I said—and the Hansard will certainly show what you said in your earlier contribution. You can describe that now, not wanting to say what I believe it says. That is fair enough; others will judge that. It applies equally to Senator Carr. I do not believe that he can take out of the Hansard his assertion that this government is set and hell bent on the humiliation of Indigenous Australians. I do not believe Hansard will do that. I know they have taken things out for the Labor Party before, but I do not think they will take that one out.
I come back to the point about the achievements that have been made. I will say again, Senator, that I do not think we are anywhere near where we need to be. But let us not pretend that mainstreaming, in part, has not been successful in some areas. It is important to mention that we are not simply mainstreaming in the way I think the state and territory governments have mainstreamed and which are now seeing what we are doing and starting to change.
Yes, programs that were not already with mainstream departments have gone to them and they have been quarantined as Indigenous programs; they are not being just slipped into mainstream money. But that on its own is not good enough. I accept that; that is obvious. It has been tried before and it did not work. What is important is to have coordination across the departments. This time I will take to the Expenditure Review Committee, for the first time in Commonwealth history, an Indigenous affairs cabinet submission where all the relevant ministers have been consulted, where there is agreement across departments and where we have taken the time to try and do a better job—to get our priorities right and coordinate our spending—instead of individual departments doing their separate thing, ATSIC doing its separate thing and everybody sort of hoping that it all comes together.
We are doing a better job than that. We are determined to do a better job than that. We are going to make sure that all the departments speak to each other and that we speak to Indigenous communities directly, with one voice. So we will not have one department flying in one month, another department flying in the next month and a state government flying in the next. People in communities must be so sick of aeroplanes and people with clipboards. As I said, there is agreement across politics and between levels of government that we have to put the politics aside and just sit down and work together on the day-to-day issues to try to do a better job.
Let me turn to some of the improvements. As I mentioned earlier, death rates from respiratory illnesses from 1992 to 1994 were seven to eight times that of the non-Indigenous average. It was a disgrace. In 2002 that had shifted to being four times that of the non-Indigenous average, halving the previous rate. I regard that as a success. It is not good enough but it is heading in the right direction—from seven to eight times down to four times that of the non-Indigenous average. It was 15 to 18 times more likely that an Indigenous person would die from an infectious or parasitic disease than a non-Indigenous person; now it is down to five times. It is down to a third of what it was before. It is still not good enough, nowhere near good enough, that Indigenous Australians are five times more likely to die of an infectious or parasitic disease, but it is much better than being 15 times more likely.
Year 5 writing benchmarks from 1999 to 2001—quite a short period of time—went up by five per cent. It was similar with the reading benchmark. Secondary school attendance went from 66 per cent of the rate of non-Indigenous students in 1996 to 73 per cent in 2001. In other words, a higher percentage of Indigenous kids now go to secondary school; it is getting closer to the non-Indigenous percentage. It is the same for year 12 retention rates. In 1996 it was 40 per cent of the rate of non-Indigenous students; now it is 51 per cent. It is getting better. In 1996 the rate of Indigenous students studying at a TAFE college was 67 per cent of that of non-Indigenous students; now it is 51 per cent. That is an improvement in anyone’s language.
Yes, we have to do more. We have to keep finding a better way to make more improvements more rapidly. These are not the actions of a government that wants to humiliate Indigenous Australians, Senator Carr. From 1996 to 2003 the rate of Indigenous students doing bachelor or higher level degree courses increased by 36 per cent to almost 6,000. So Indigenous students doing bachelor and higher level degree courses between 1996 and 2003—the years of this government—increased by 36 per cent.
—What about the rest of the population?
—Senator Carr, I am glad that you asked that question because non-Indigenous students increased by 11 per cent. So we had a real success there because in that time period Indigenous students increased by 36 per cent.
We are doing something right and we are making gains, but the gains are nowhere near good enough. Indigenous people aged from 15 to 24 attending any form of education was 58 per cent in 1996 and went up to 61 per cent—only a very small gain. Indigenous students in VET were 2.4 per cent of all students in 1996; now they are 3.4 per cent. We can do better, but we have been getting something right. The rate of Indigenous VET graduates in employment in 1999 was 78 per cent of the rate of non-Indigenous students, in 2001 it was up to 95 per cent.
Indigenous employment grew by 22 per cent between 1996 and 2001, and almost 70 per cent of that was in non-CDEP employment. Non-Indigenous employment grew by about nine per cent. So, Indigenous employment grew by 22 per cent; that is giving people a job and a chance to be independent. It is giving them that chance to spend their own money and to have the pride that comes from spending money that they have earned. It is giving them a real chance. They are the things that make a difference, not whether some limited number of people in Canberra, elected by a portion of your community, have a job and can speak on your behalf. The real way for you personally, as an individual, to have independence is to have a real chance for an education, a real chance to make choices about how you live your life and a real chance to have a say about what should happen in your community. That is what this government is determined to achieve.
Senator Ridgeway referred to a meeting that I apparently had with Western Australian ATSIC regional councillors. I am not aware of any such meeting. Senator Ridgeway, I simply do not know what you are talking about. There may have been some Western Australians at another meeting; I do not know. My advisers do not recall such a meeting either, so I am unaware of what you were raising in that context. But it is true to say that we want to work with the state and territory governments. My advice is that government—that is, the bureaucracy—are consulting with regional councils and a range of Indigenous organisations and communities about alternative regional representation arrangements. It may result in quite different arrangements from one state to another. We simply do not believe that extending the life of regional councils by six months does anything more than that. We gave another 12 months because we thought that was appropriate, and that time is now up. We do not think that, because the bill has been delayed, there is any reason for a further extension in that area.
Senator Ridgeway, you raised the issue in relation to the general directions to the IBA. As I made clear to you the other day, the government believe that, because at the moment we have a general directions power with ATSIC generally, it is not unreasonable to have a general directions power with IBA, given its expanded functions, and we have not changed our mind on that matter. That is one issue that you raised and that is why I raise it now. In relation to your suggestion that there be an appeal to the AAT where the IBA refuses business loans, my view has not changed and neither has that of my colleagues. These are commercial decisions. They are not in the nature of administrative decisions. It is very much a commercial issue, and we simply do not agree with that suggestion.
As I feel strongly about environmental issues, particularly because of the importance of land and the environment to Indigenous communities, I would like to specifically address that issue. When the environment minister has to decide whether a proposal is going to have a significant impact on the environment and therefore has an assessment done, the environment minister has to invite comment from relevant ministers and from the public. The environment minister has to invite that comment—from other relevant ministers and the public. That means that whoever is the Indigenous affairs minister would be consulted—has to be; there is not a choice about it—and it also means that the public would be consulted. That means that not just a couple of people whom you choose to nominate but also any Indigenous people or organisations who want to put a view would be welcome to do so.
As you know, it is the usual practice that, when the government or a minister is required to consult, advertisements be put in the paper or that particular groups are contacted. It has often been the case in my time in government that there has been questioning as to how people knew what was happening and who you consulted. Governments have to be answerable to living up to that commitment. So I believe that it is appropriate. There was, I think, a requirement in relation to ATSIC, which is a statutory authority, and I do not think replacing that with individual people or committees is quite the same. Where you have a statutory authority, that is one thing, but individual people and committees, way beyond those that you seek to ensure have a say, are entitled to have a say. That is why I do not agree with your amendment. It is not that I do not agree with the sentiment; I just do not think it is at all necessary. I hope I have answered your questions.
—I was just wondering whether the minister might be able to address the question I asked about the number of shared responsibility agreements.
—Yes, I am sorry—I can answer that question. We will make, in the shorter term, shared responsibility agreements with communities to attend to a matter, whatever it may be, where they have a specific need they want addressed and they want additional funding over and above the things that we are all entitled to. It will be different from community to community. We do not want to say, ‘You’ve asked for one thing and we have done that with you and we’re not coming back.’ If there are other things that need to be addressed we might, or in the short term will, need to make separate agreements.
But these are agreements quite unlike the ones I refer to in Lockhart. They are simple agreements for things to be done: ‘If you do this, we will do this and the Territory government or the state government’—whatever it might be—‘will do this,’ to address a particular issue. Everyone will sit down and work out what they are going to do, what each of their contributions is and what each is going to get out of it—if that is the way you look at it—to get that problem on the way to being fixed. The agreements I refer to in Lockhart have application processes and guidelines being set in Canberra by people who do not necessarily go to all these communities. They have a separate application process where, in addressing the application, you have to meet the guidelines. There is then a process for deciding who under grant funding gets the money for this or that and then there is an acquittal process. The agreements that we are talking about in the shorter term do not have that. We do intend to bring those sorts of agreements into a much simpler structure, but that does not rule out a community coming back and looking for a quicker and simpler agreement for something to be done in a particular area.
I had a meeting with a Western Australian community the other day. They say that the kids are bored. That is a common problem in remote communities. There is not enough for the kids to do. They want to talk to us about a basketball court. And I want to talk to the Western Australian government, because there is a basketball court there—it is in the school. They are not allowed to use it outside school hours and, if they were to be allowed to use it outside school hours, kids who do not go to school—that is, non-school users—cannot use it. The reason that I want to talk to the Western Australian government is that, if we were prepared to put a basketball court in this community, would it not be better if we could get the Western Australian government to find a way to put lights on the basketball court they already have so the kids can play at night—that is what they are looking for—and to allow people in the community, other than the school goers, to use the basketball court? I know why this does not work in a metropolitan area, but I cannot see why it will not work in a remote community. Then perhaps the money that we would have available for a court could be put into something else. Wouldn’t that be better for the community? That is an example of why federal and state governments need to sit down and work together, so that the money that we all have—from whatever appropriation systems we have—is spent in a sensible way for the communities. Is that not a better way to go? That is what we intend doing.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-16,"—Just on the issue of shared responsibility agreements, I am wondering whether the minister could explain what, in evaluating the success of an agreement, she anticipates will be the penalties if either party to that agreement does not meet the requirements. Not necessarily penalties, but what do you think is the next step?",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-03-16,"—Senator Nettle, I am glad you asked that question and I am glad you chose other words than ‘penalties’. We do not think of it in that sense. We do want to make agreements. Where, for example, you make an agreement with a community for a pool, we think no pool, no school works very well. It is an idea that Indigenous Australia came up with, and it works very well in the communities where there is a commitment to it. It will be different from community to community. Some communities will be closer to regional areas where there might be a private sector firm that is happy to service the pool. Some communities will be more remote and will not have that capacity, so they might want to make an agreement about keeping enough people trained to keep the pool in good order, keeping enough people trained to be lifeguards at the pool so that the kids are safe, and organising swimming competitions or other physical activities using the pool so that there is a greater sense of community—that is, that the asset is really used and maintained—and in some cases they might want to make an agreement about kids who do not go to school not using the pool. In some cases we would be very happy with just that.
You are asking what happens if they do not do it. I will tell you what happens. If the pool is not maintained, the water is dirty and the kids are not safe—that is a disaster. If that community then came back and said, ‘Now we would like you to do something else,’ you can understand that our approach would be, ‘Hold on, we have an agreement with you about the pool. Let’s work on that agreement about the pool. Let’s get both sides of the bargain going there.’ So we have a very open and flexible approach working with community by community.
I do not have the expectation that an individual community will say, ‘We have got the pool; now we can sit down and do nothing.’ They want the pool to be clean and they want the kids to be safe and they want the kids to go to school. Ngukurr in Arnhem Land was the first community where I came across this approach. The community thought of it. They told me that everyone in that community had money taken out of their CDEP for three years, and they did this by themselves. They went to the local government—the federal government was not involved in this—and said, ‘We have this much money. Will you help us with the rest? This is what we want: we want a better future for our kids, we want them to go to school and we want them to be healthy.’ We will help them maintain the pool, keep lifeguards there and keep the kids active. If you get the opportunity you should go to Ngukurr and have a look, because they do a damned good job. So I do not approach these agreements on the basis of what I will do if Indigenous Australia do not live up to their word; I approach these agreements on the basis that Indigenous Australia will live up to their word.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-16,"—I was approaching the question from the possibility that the federal government may not live up to its word, which is another side of responsibility. I am pleased the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs raised the issue of no school, no pool because this is something that we talked about within the Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs with, for example, the AMA. The AMA talked about the health benefits provided by having a pool in each community. We also talked with the AMA about the idea that it is not always as simple as no school, no pool. There may be other reasons why children are not going to school. For example, there may be difficulties in their housing situation, domestic violence or a whole lot of other reasons why children are not accessing the school, but that does not mean that there are not health benefits available for those individual children in being able to access a swimming pool.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges for inquiry and report by 15 June 2005:
Whether, and if so what, acts of unauthorised disclosure of parliamentary committee proceedings, evidence or draft reports should continue to be included among prohibited acts which may be treated by the Senate as contempts.
The Privileges Committee has had concerns for some time about the leaking of draft reports and private deliberations of committees. These matters have in fact become core business for the Privileges Committee. But the Privileges Committee is not a star chamber and it certainly does not want to become a star chamber.
To those senators who are interested in the history of unauthorised disclosure, I would commend an examination of the 74th report of the Standing Committee of Privileges, which documents the first such case since the formation of the Privileges Committee—in other words, the first such case on which the Privileges Committee reported, which occurred in 1971. The second case occurred in 1984. I can say to the Senate that there have been 22 cases of unauthorised disclosure involving 18 reports since the establishment of the Committee of Privileges, including the first report in 1971. Four reports on three cases were made to the Senate before the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act and resolutions in 1987-88.
These matters are being referred more and more to the Privileges Committee. It is true that a few maverick senators have lied in their responses to the Privileges Committee about the leaking of committee deliberations and reports. I thought that it would be valuable—I do not doubt that you would agree with this, Senator Ferguson—to share with the Senate the wise words of one committee chair. You would find these wise words at paragraph 45 of the 99th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges. I am pleased that Senator Ferguson is in the chamber, because he is the wise senator whose words ought to be remembered. Paragraph 45 of the report states:
The committee shares the views of an equally frustrated chair of a parliamentary committee, Senator Ferguson, who as Chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee stated in the Senate recently:
The only people with any motive to leak information about private committee meetings or the work of any … committee are those who have a political motive. In fact, those who have a political motive are generally the members of parliament who actually work on those committees.
I quote those words because they are fair and accurate. Senator Ferguson was right about that, and the committee was right to highlight those comments that were made at that time. We could, of course, address ourselves to the issue of journalists, because we ought to acknowledge in this chamber that journalists do not disclose their sources. We ought to acknowledge here that there is a clash of principles: the journalist’s ethic of not revealing sources versus the Senate’s right to protect the integrity of its committee processes. That is another problem that the Privileges Committee in the Senate has had to grapple with.
We also, of course, have the vexed question of what activity does actually substantially interfere with a committee’s work. There are any number of examples of different members of a committee holding different views about the impact of leaks on the same committee’s operations. One thing which ought to be made clear in moving this motion on behalf of the Privileges Committee relates to in camera evidence. The previous chairman of the committee, Senator Ray, and I both strongly believe that the disclosure of in camera evidence should be an automatic contempt of the Senate—equivalent, if you like, to the breach of a court order. I do not think that is a statement that would be controversial amongst members of the Committee of Privileges.
We also ought to say that it has been 17 years since the Parliamentary Privileges Act and privileges resolutions were agreed to by the Senate. It is now time to examine this particular element of their operation. We should acknowledge that unenforceable rules or provisions will eventually demean the Senate. So in these circumstances the Privileges Committee recommends to the Senate that we examine these issues to establish if standard leaks should continue to be an offence. The committee believes that it is appropriate that we examine this issue without the limitation that is imposed by involving such an examination with another case—that is, without the limitations imposed by any individual case.
I would say to the Senate that the process that the Privileges Committee recommends here is a good one. It proposes a reference to the Privileges Committee in the terms of the motion before the chair. It gives the Senate an opportunity to determine whether unauthorised disclosure of committee deliberations and draft reports should be regarded as constituting a substantial interference with the operations of a committee, thus constituting contempt of the Senate. In the first instance, the Privileges Committee, which of course has expressed concerns about these issues for some time now, will be able to fully and thoroughly examine this important issue. The Senate can then consider the committee’s report. All senators are going to have an opportunity to consider these matters fully in the period ahead. I commend this approach and this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-16,"—I support this motion. I refused it formality earlier not because I do not support it but because I strongly support it and I believe it is a sufficiently important matter that it should be spoken about. The reasoning behind the motion and the committee’s request, in effect, for this to be referred to it should be put clearly on the record. Also, contributions such as the one Senator Faulkner has made should be on the record, because the value of people with experience in the operations of the Senate and its history—such as Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray and Senator Knowles, who is also on the committee—is often not recognised.
I also want to put a few things on the record because of the specific position of crossbench senators. As I have mentioned a few times in this place, the crossbenchers—minor parties and Independents—do not have representation on the Privileges Committee. I am not sure if they ever have. I noticed on the quite interesting chronology that Senator Faulkner referred to or incorporated—actually I am not sure if he did incorporate it—
—I was intending to do that in my reply.
—Okay. One of the early matters that was fairly significant involved a motion moved by former senator Janine Haines nearly 20 years ago in April 1985. I do not know if she was on the Privileges Committee at that time, but obviously she was interested in the relevant matter of an improper disclosure and misrepresentation by a departmental officer of an amendment prepared for moving in the Senate. That was covered in Privileges Committee report No. 9 back in 1985. Certainly these issues affect all senators. In that sense, while I make the point that crossbench senators are not represented on the Privileges Committee, I should also make the point that it is not a partisan committee. It has, I gather, always made unanimous reports, with one exception. So I do not make a partisan point in saying that crossbenchers do not have representation; the point is more that we have a different set of circumstances—a different way of operating, perhaps, or a different situation in terms of resourcing—which may be relevant to the considerations of the committee members with regard to the matter that will be before them.
I say that not knowing fully how senators from major parties operate in terms of their staffing and support or about the cross-consultation that they have when they are involved in committee inquiries. I will read the conclusion of the report that generated this motion—the 121st report, which Senator Faulkner tabled earlier this week—because I think it is important. It flows on from the latest series of unauthorised disclosures and it seems to be hinting at significant views in the minds of the current committee members. The relevant paragraph states:
The committee as at present constituted is of a mind to make a radical recommendation in respect of improper unauthorised disclosure of parliamentary committee reports and proceedings but wishes to discuss the matter in greater detail once the full membership of the committee is available to do so.
Clearly, some members of the committee think we need to make a radical shift here, and that may well be quite true. The current approach of dealing with unauthorised disclosure of reports is clearly becoming a joke, and because of that it is not being treated with the seriousness it deserves and is not able to be addressed in any meaningful way. I presume the phrase ‘once the full membership of the committee is available to do so’ is there because a couple of the members of the committee were not able to participate in this report because they were members of the committee where the unauthorised disclosure happened—the Senate Community Affairs Committee, from memory.
So I would simply say that the full membership of the committee would still not involve crossbench senators, even when the full committee is considering it. Again, that is not a partisan point of view; it is just an attempt to bring a different perspective to the way we engage with committee processes. I also note and very much endorse Senator Faulkner’s comments about the seriousness of the disclosure of in camera evidence. There is no doubt that if people cannot be certain that in camera evidence they give to a committee—whether it is via a submission or via a face-to-face hearing—is kept confidential they are not likely to do it. That is just commonsense. We clearly need to be able to show that we take those sorts of actions very seriously.
I have recently been encouraging people to put submissions in to the Senate select committee that has been set up to look into mental health. That could well involve people wanting to put in confidential submissions. Staff in certain establishments who want to give information about what they have seen but do not want to run the risk of damage to their careers, lives and families as a result of doing so need to be confident that, if they put in a confidential submission, it will remain confidential and that the Senate and senators as a whole will treat that very seriously. For that reason as well I think that a reference with the intent behind it that I believe this one has is actually very important.
Certainly, from the brief historical chronology that Senator Faulkner has provided and will seek to incorporate, it looks as though, in the early days when these sorts of things were first considered, there was an attitude that disclosures should require some form of penalty. There were recommendations about reprimanding editors and publishers of newspapers which suggested that any future breach might be met by a much higher penalty and there were suggestions in a later report that consideration might be given to an appropriate penalty for offences. I think in those early days people thought it was a rare occurrence and that perhaps it would be appropriate to have specific penalties applied, whether that was a fine or something else. It clearly seems to have been part of the mind-set.
Certainly, that is highly unlikely to be acceptable these days for a general, run-of-the-mill, so-called leak. There is a difference between a disclosure that clearly harms the effective operation of or substantially interferes with the work of a committee and disclosures in other circumstances. I might point to the recent case of the free trade agreement committee. That disclosure might have actually made things work a bit more effectively than they otherwise would have. I do not know because I was not part of it, but it seemed as though that committee had problems being overly functional by the time it got to the end. Just getting the findings out may have made things clearer.
All of those different issues need to be considered. At the heart of it all is how we can repair the credibility of the concept of contempt of the Senate so that things that are sufficiently serious are able to be reconsidered and treated in a way where it is more feasible to have some form of penalty or punishment if they happen. Whether or not it is unfortunate, things that are seen more as just part and parcel of political rough-and-tumble and political operations should be treated as such and they should not just all be put into the same basket. That is a pretty difficult dividing line to draw, but I think it is one that does generally need consideration. I welcome the indication from the committee that it wants to turn its mind to this. I would simply signal that certainly I, and I imagine at least some of my crossbench colleagues, would be interested in some mechanism for having input into that or at least providing our ideas about that to the committee. I, for one, would certainly welcome it.
It is perhaps more important than ever at this stage, with the government about to get the numbers in the Senate for the first time since 1981, that some of those basic shared standards of the Senate are recognised, reconfirmed and strengthened before there is the risk of a government majority weakening them even subconsciously. Looking at Senator Faulkner’s chronology again, apart from the very first matter, these issues have evolved in an era when the Senate has not been controlled by any one party. We are now moving back into an era—and hopefully, from my point of view, a short one—where there will be a Senate controlled by one party or at least by a coalition. It is more important than ever to get those shared values of the Senate reaffirmed. I am sure that the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, with its proud history of being non-partisan and unanimous, is in a good position to do that.
I would also say that committees will probably become more important than ever in this upcoming era when the government will have control of the Senate. Regardless of what the numbers may be on committees that are established down the track, generally speaking there has been more scope for the sharing of ideas and a willingness to find unanimous positions through the committee processes. That happens far from always, but reasonably often committee processes have operated in a way that has enabled some degree of unanimity or at least there has been an attempt to find it. There is no doubt that unauthorised disclosures cut right across and very much impede that. If we can find a way to reinforce the seriousness of such actions then it should help the committee process to work more effectively. I think that will assist more than ever in the coming era when the government will have control of the Senate.
I feel that it is important to put comments such as these on the record to reinforce not just my support for the motion but also the importance of the issue that the Privileges Committee is going to consider by virtue of this motion. Whilst this is not going to be headline news stuff—and I think the idea is that we do not have these things being headline news—the Privileges Committee is actually undertaking an incredibly important task in that it is trying to ensure that the Senate continues to be as effective as possible at its task all the way into the future. I support the motion and will certainly look for a way to ensure that our views can be thrown into the mix so that the wise members of the committee can consider the radical ideas that we have in our heads.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,28,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I have just a few brief words to say on this motion. I should really acknowledge the presence in the chamber today of three former members of the Privileges Committee that have all gone onwards and upwards. Senator Eggleston is now Government Deputy Whip, Senator Ellison is now the very distinguished Minister for Justice and Customs, and Senator Chris Evans is of course now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. It occurs to me that it is also a two-way street. There are two has-beens here, going the other way, who are currently on the committee.
—How sad of you to mention that. I was hoping you would miss that out.
—Might I say, through you, Acting Deputy President, to Senator Bartlett: we would most welcome a Democrats submission to the committee on this matter. If you would like to appear before the committee, we promise you an inquisitorial rather than adversarial discussion on these issues. Senator Bartlett often muses about the fact that the cross party are not on the Privileges Committee. It is a bit like The Nationals, who want to capitalise their profits and socialise their losses. You are disproportionately on a lot of other committees. We set up a select committee of five and guess what? You get one out of five when the ratio should only be about one out of 12. So there are other occasions where the Democrats are overrepresented rather than underrepresented. I suspect the reason for you not being on the committee is the fact that we set up a unique position in 1994, and that was to give the government a four to three majority on the committee but to have it chaired by an opposition member. That very much contributes to the bipartisan nature of the way in which the committee operates.
It is time that we tried to cut the Gordian knot. Unenforceable rules are bad rules. There are only so many times that the Privileges Committee can come back and say it does not have the capacity to determine those who have participated in contempts of the Senate. We are not a star chamber, as Senator Faulkner has said. We are not a body that can necessarily find out any more information about leaking than the committees that are leaked against. There is no question—and I have never hidden it—that virtually every leak out of every Senate committee or joint committee comes from a member of parliament. It never comes from the secretariat. It does not come by accident. It comes because senators have gone out and given the information to journalists. What is their motive? Half the time it is to get political advantage for their side of politics. That is pretty grubby, but at least I can see the logic of it. The other half of the time it is simply so that the senator concerned can chalk up some brownie points with journalists. It is a pretty pathetic existence if that is what you have to do, but that is what we are left with.
I think we can tackle this. Whilst not necessarily anticipating the results of the inquiry, because we will keep an open mind, I am of a mind at the moment to say that any leak from a committee—a normal leak, if you like—should be dealt with by the committee itself. At the moment, if there is a leak from a committee, that is a breach of privilege. But for it to become a contempt of the Senate you have to show that it unduly interfered or had a tendency to interfere with the operations of the committee—something very, very difficult to prove. What I would like to make an automatic offence is the leaking of in camera evidence—sensitive stuff on law enforcement, security and the protection of witnesses—so that you do not have to prove that it unduly interfered with the work of a committee; it becomes an automatic offence. All the rest no longer become offences.
I would still regard it as unethical to prematurely disclose a committee report, but at least everyone will be on a level playing field. Maybe some of them will be bound by the honour and the traditions of this institution and will not prematurely disclose the discussions or the findings of a report. It would be nice to think so, but I would not automatically assume it. Anyway, let us have a public inquiry into this. Let us hear from the journalists’ association. Let us hear from the Clerk of the Senate, who has a tremendous knowledge of these areas. Let us put it all together. I do stress, as Senator Faulkner does, that it is not a decision of the Privileges Committee. All we can do is come back with a recommendation to this chamber, and this chamber itself will decide.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-03-16,"—Senator Bartlett kindly mentioned a document that I had circulated to interested senators in the chamber which deals with the record of unauthorised disclosure reports from the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges from 1966 to March 2005. I thank the committee’s hardworking staff for the preparation of that document. I notice that Senator Bartlett gave me full credit. On this occasion it was not deserved. I thank the secretary and staff of the committee for preparing this. I think it is a very useful document. I seek leave for the document to be incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

*Before passage of Privilege Resolutions on 25 February 1988 all matters were referred to the Committee of Privileges by the Senate
In the spirit of the way the committee has operated now for very many years, I note that there is broad agreement and acceptance in the chamber about this motion. I commend the approach to the Senate and thank those senators who have contributed to the debate. I look forward to this Senate considering the report of the Privileges Committee after we have undertaken the public hearings that Senator Ray has just spoken about.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges for inquiry and report by 15 June 2005:
Whether, and if so what, acts of unauthorised disclosure of parliamentary committee proceedings, evidence or draft reports should continue to be included among prohibited acts which may be treated by the Senate as contempts.
The Privileges Committee has had concerns for some time about the leaking of draft reports and private deliberations of committees. These matters have in fact become core business for the Privileges Committee. But the Privileges Committee is not a star chamber and it certainly does not want to become a star chamber.
To those senators who are interested in the history of unauthorised disclosure, I would commend an examination of the 74th report of the Standing Committee of Privileges, which documents the first such case since the formation of the Privileges Committee—in other words, the first such case on which the Privileges Committee reported, which occurred in 1971. The second case occurred in 1984. I can say to the Senate that there have been 22 cases of unauthorised disclosure involving 18 reports since the establishment of the Committee of Privileges, including the first report in 1971. Four reports on three cases were made to the Senate before the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act and resolutions in 1987-88.
These matters are being referred more and more to the Privileges Committee. It is true that a few maverick senators have lied in their responses to the Privileges Committee about the leaking of committee deliberations and reports. I thought that it would be valuable—I do not doubt that you would agree with this, Senator Ferguson—to share with the Senate the wise words of one committee chair. You would find these wise words at paragraph 45 of the 99th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges. I am pleased that Senator Ferguson is in the chamber, because he is the wise senator whose words ought to be remembered. Paragraph 45 of the report states:
The committee shares the views of an equally frustrated chair of a parliamentary committee, Senator Ferguson, who as Chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee stated in the Senate recently:
The only people with any motive to leak information about private committee meetings or the work of any … committee are those who have a political motive. In fact, those who have a political motive are generally the members of parliament who actually work on those committees.
I quote those words because they are fair and accurate. Senator Ferguson was right about that, and the committee was right to highlight those comments that were made at that time. We could, of course, address ourselves to the issue of journalists, because we ought to acknowledge in this chamber that journalists do not disclose their sources. We ought to acknowledge here that there is a clash of principles: the journalist’s ethic of not revealing sources versus the Senate’s right to protect the integrity of its committee processes. That is another problem that the Privileges Committee in the Senate has had to grapple with.
We also, of course, have the vexed question of what activity does actually substantially interfere with a committee’s work. There are any number of examples of different members of a committee holding different views about the impact of leaks on the same committee’s operations. One thing which ought to be made clear in moving this motion on behalf of the Privileges Committee relates to in camera evidence. The previous chairman of the committee, Senator Ray, and I both strongly believe that the disclosure of in camera evidence should be an automatic contempt of the Senate—equivalent, if you like, to the breach of a court order. I do not think that is a statement that would be controversial amongst members of the Committee of Privileges.
We also ought to say that it has been 17 years since the Parliamentary Privileges Act and privileges resolutions were agreed to by the Senate. It is now time to examine this particular element of their operation. We should acknowledge that unenforceable rules or provisions will eventually demean the Senate. So in these circumstances the Privileges Committee recommends to the Senate that we examine these issues to establish if standard leaks should continue to be an offence. The committee believes that it is appropriate that we examine this issue without the limitation that is imposed by involving such an examination with another case—that is, without the limitations imposed by any individual case.
I would say to the Senate that the process that the Privileges Committee recommends here is a good one. It proposes a reference to the Privileges Committee in the terms of the motion before the chair. It gives the Senate an opportunity to determine whether unauthorised disclosure of committee deliberations and draft reports should be regarded as constituting a substantial interference with the operations of a committee, thus constituting contempt of the Senate. In the first instance, the Privileges Committee, which of course has expressed concerns about these issues for some time now, will be able to fully and thoroughly examine this important issue. The Senate can then consider the committee’s report. All senators are going to have an opportunity to consider these matters fully in the period ahead. I commend this approach and this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,28,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-16,"—I support this motion. I refused it formality earlier not because I do not support it but because I strongly support it and I believe it is a sufficiently important matter that it should be spoken about. The reasoning behind the motion and the committee’s request, in effect, for this to be referred to it should be put clearly on the record. Also, contributions such as the one Senator Faulkner has made should be on the record, because the value of people with experience in the operations of the Senate and its history—such as Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray and Senator Knowles, who is also on the committee—is often not recognised.
I also want to put a few things on the record because of the specific position of crossbench senators. As I have mentioned a few times in this place, the crossbenchers—minor parties and Independents—do not have representation on the Privileges Committee. I am not sure if they ever have. I noticed on the quite interesting chronology that Senator Faulkner referred to or incorporated—actually I am not sure if he did incorporate it—
—I was intending to do that in my reply.
—Okay. One of the early matters that was fairly significant involved a motion moved by former senator Janine Haines nearly 20 years ago in April 1985. I do not know if she was on the Privileges Committee at that time, but obviously she was interested in the relevant matter of an improper disclosure and misrepresentation by a departmental officer of an amendment prepared for moving in the Senate. That was covered in Privileges Committee report No. 9 back in 1985. Certainly these issues affect all senators. In that sense, while I make the point that crossbench senators are not represented on the Privileges Committee, I should also make the point that it is not a partisan committee. It has, I gather, always made unanimous reports, with one exception. So I do not make a partisan point in saying that crossbenchers do not have representation; the point is more that we have a different set of circumstances—a different way of operating, perhaps, or a different situation in terms of resourcing—which may be relevant to the considerations of the committee members with regard to the matter that will be before them.
I say that not knowing fully how senators from major parties operate in terms of their staffing and support or about the cross-consultation that they have when they are involved in committee inquiries. I will read the conclusion of the report that generated this motion—the 121st report, which Senator Faulkner tabled earlier this week—because I think it is important. It flows on from the latest series of unauthorised disclosures and it seems to be hinting at significant views in the minds of the current committee members. The relevant paragraph states:
The committee as at present constituted is of a mind to make a radical recommendation in respect of improper unauthorised disclosure of parliamentary committee reports and proceedings but wishes to discuss the matter in greater detail once the full membership of the committee is available to do so.
Clearly, some members of the committee think we need to make a radical shift here, and that may well be quite true. The current approach of dealing with unauthorised disclosure of reports is clearly becoming a joke, and because of that it is not being treated with the seriousness it deserves and is not able to be addressed in any meaningful way. I presume the phrase ‘once the full membership of the committee is available to do so’ is there because a couple of the members of the committee were not able to participate in this report because they were members of the committee where the unauthorised disclosure happened—the Senate Community Affairs Committee, from memory.
So I would simply say that the full membership of the committee would still not involve crossbench senators, even when the full committee is considering it. Again, that is not a partisan point of view; it is just an attempt to bring a different perspective to the way we engage with committee processes. I also note and very much endorse Senator Faulkner’s comments about the seriousness of the disclosure of in camera evidence. There is no doubt that if people cannot be certain that in camera evidence they give to a committee—whether it is via a submission or via a face-to-face hearing—is kept confidential they are not likely to do it. That is just commonsense. We clearly need to be able to show that we take those sorts of actions very seriously.
I have recently been encouraging people to put submissions in to the Senate select committee that has been set up to look into mental health. That could well involve people wanting to put in confidential submissions. Staff in certain establishments who want to give information about what they have seen but do not want to run the risk of damage to their careers, lives and families as a result of doing so need to be confident that, if they put in a confidential submission, it will remain confidential and that the Senate and senators as a whole will treat that very seriously. For that reason as well I think that a reference with the intent behind it that I believe this one has is actually very important.
Certainly, from the brief historical chronology that Senator Faulkner has provided and will seek to incorporate, it looks as though, in the early days when these sorts of things were first considered, there was an attitude that disclosures should require some form of penalty. There were recommendations about reprimanding editors and publishers of newspapers which suggested that any future breach might be met by a much higher penalty and there were suggestions in a later report that consideration might be given to an appropriate penalty for offences. I think in those early days people thought it was a rare occurrence and that perhaps it would be appropriate to have specific penalties applied, whether that was a fine or something else. It clearly seems to have been part of the mind-set.
Certainly, that is highly unlikely to be acceptable these days for a general, run-of-the-mill, so-called leak. There is a difference between a disclosure that clearly harms the effective operation of or substantially interferes with the work of a committee and disclosures in other circumstances. I might point to the recent case of the free trade agreement committee. That disclosure might have actually made things work a bit more effectively than they otherwise would have. I do not know because I was not part of it, but it seemed as though that committee had problems being overly functional by the time it got to the end. Just getting the findings out may have made things clearer.
All of those different issues need to be considered. At the heart of it all is how we can repair the credibility of the concept of contempt of the Senate so that things that are sufficiently serious are able to be reconsidered and treated in a way where it is more feasible to have some form of penalty or punishment if they happen. Whether or not it is unfortunate, things that are seen more as just part and parcel of political rough-and-tumble and political operations should be treated as such and they should not just all be put into the same basket. That is a pretty difficult dividing line to draw, but I think it is one that does generally need consideration. I welcome the indication from the committee that it wants to turn its mind to this. I would simply signal that certainly I, and I imagine at least some of my crossbench colleagues, would be interested in some mechanism for having input into that or at least providing our ideas about that to the committee. I, for one, would certainly welcome it.
It is perhaps more important than ever at this stage, with the government about to get the numbers in the Senate for the first time since 1981, that some of those basic shared standards of the Senate are recognised, reconfirmed and strengthened before there is the risk of a government majority weakening them even subconsciously. Looking at Senator Faulkner’s chronology again, apart from the very first matter, these issues have evolved in an era when the Senate has not been controlled by any one party. We are now moving back into an era—and hopefully, from my point of view, a short one—where there will be a Senate controlled by one party or at least by a coalition. It is more important than ever to get those shared values of the Senate reaffirmed. I am sure that the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, with its proud history of being non-partisan and unanimous, is in a good position to do that.
I would also say that committees will probably become more important than ever in this upcoming era when the government will have control of the Senate. Regardless of what the numbers may be on committees that are established down the track, generally speaking there has been more scope for the sharing of ideas and a willingness to find unanimous positions through the committee processes. That happens far from always, but reasonably often committee processes have operated in a way that has enabled some degree of unanimity or at least there has been an attempt to find it. There is no doubt that unauthorised disclosures cut right across and very much impede that. If we can find a way to reinforce the seriousness of such actions then it should help the committee process to work more effectively. I think that will assist more than ever in the coming era when the government will have control of the Senate.
I feel that it is important to put comments such as these on the record to reinforce not just my support for the motion but also the importance of the issue that the Privileges Committee is going to consider by virtue of this motion. Whilst this is not going to be headline news stuff—and I think the idea is that we do not have these things being headline news—the Privileges Committee is actually undertaking an incredibly important task in that it is trying to ensure that the Senate continues to be as effective as possible at its task all the way into the future. I support the motion and will certainly look for a way to ensure that our views can be thrown into the mix so that the wise members of the committee can consider the radical ideas that we have in our heads.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,28,2,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I have just a few brief words to say on this motion. I should really acknowledge the presence in the chamber today of three former members of the Privileges Committee that have all gone onwards and upwards. Senator Eggleston is now Government Deputy Whip, Senator Ellison is now the very distinguished Minister for Justice and Customs, and Senator Chris Evans is of course now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. It occurs to me that it is also a two-way street. There are two has-beens here, going the other way, who are currently on the committee.
—How sad of you to mention that. I was hoping you would miss that out.
—Might I say, through you, Acting Deputy President, to Senator Bartlett: we would most welcome a Democrats submission to the committee on this matter. If you would like to appear before the committee, we promise you an inquisitorial rather than adversarial discussion on these issues. Senator Bartlett often muses about the fact that the cross party are not on the Privileges Committee. It is a bit like The Nationals, who want to capitalise their profits and socialise their losses. You are disproportionately on a lot of other committees. We set up a select committee of five and guess what? You get one out of five when the ratio should only be about one out of 12. So there are other occasions where the Democrats are overrepresented rather than underrepresented. I suspect the reason for you not being on the committee is the fact that we set up a unique position in 1994, and that was to give the government a four to three majority on the committee but to have it chaired by an opposition member. That very much contributes to the bipartisan nature of the way in which the committee operates.
It is time that we tried to cut the Gordian knot. Unenforceable rules are bad rules. There are only so many times that the Privileges Committee can come back and say it does not have the capacity to determine those who have participated in contempts of the Senate. We are not a star chamber, as Senator Faulkner has said. We are not a body that can necessarily find out any more information about leaking than the committees that are leaked against. There is no question—and I have never hidden it—that virtually every leak out of every Senate committee or joint committee comes from a member of parliament. It never comes from the secretariat. It does not come by accident. It comes because senators have gone out and given the information to journalists. What is their motive? Half the time it is to get political advantage for their side of politics. That is pretty grubby, but at least I can see the logic of it. The other half of the time it is simply so that the senator concerned can chalk up some brownie points with journalists. It is a pretty pathetic existence if that is what you have to do, but that is what we are left with.
I think we can tackle this. Whilst not necessarily anticipating the results of the inquiry, because we will keep an open mind, I am of a mind at the moment to say that any leak from a committee—a normal leak, if you like—should be dealt with by the committee itself. At the moment, if there is a leak from a committee, that is a breach of privilege. But for it to become a contempt of the Senate you have to show that it unduly interfered or had a tendency to interfere with the operations of the committee—something very, very difficult to prove. What I would like to make an automatic offence is the leaking of in camera evidence—sensitive stuff on law enforcement, security and the protection of witnesses—so that you do not have to prove that it unduly interfered with the work of a committee; it becomes an automatic offence. All the rest no longer become offences.
I would still regard it as unethical to prematurely disclose a committee report, but at least everyone will be on a level playing field. Maybe some of them will be bound by the honour and the traditions of this institution and will not prematurely disclose the discussions or the findings of a report. It would be nice to think so, but I would not automatically assume it. Anyway, let us have a public inquiry into this. Let us hear from the journalists’ association. Let us hear from the Clerk of the Senate, who has a tremendous knowledge of these areas. Let us put it all together. I do stress, as Senator Faulkner does, that it is not a decision of the Privileges Committee. All we can do is come back with a recommendation to this chamber, and this chamber itself will decide.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,28,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-03-16,"—Senator Bartlett kindly mentioned a document that I had circulated to interested senators in the chamber which deals with the record of unauthorised disclosure reports from the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges from 1966 to March 2005. I thank the committee’s hardworking staff for the preparation of that document. I notice that Senator Bartlett gave me full credit. On this occasion it was not deserved. I thank the secretary and staff of the committee for preparing this. I think it is a very useful document. I seek leave for the document to be incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

*Before passage of Privilege Resolutions on 25 February 1988 all matters were referred to the Committee of Privileges by the Senate
In the spirit of the way the committee has operated now for very many years, I note that there is broad agreement and acceptance in the chamber about this motion. I commend the approach to the Senate and thank those senators who have contributed to the debate. I look forward to this Senate considering the report of the Privileges Committee after we have undertaken the public hearings that Senator Ray has just spoken about.

"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2005-03-16,"—In response to Senator O’Brien asking for further information, I have a statement which I seek to table. I believe it answers the questions that have been posed by Senator O’Brien. I have not shown this to the opposition. I have not sought to incorporate it, because we have not followed the usual procedure, so I will seek to table the statement and that will conclude my remarks. I will provide a copy of the statement to Senator O’Brien. If there were anything further, he could speak tomorrow. I table the statement.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-03-16,"—I take the opportunity to make some remarks on Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005 and related bills. I would like to concentrate on issues regarding the transfer of various service delivery agencies to the Finance and Administration portfolio and the creation therein of the new Department of Human Services. These changes were announced by the Prime Minister following the last election as part of the new administrative arrangements.
Labor has very serious concerns about the delivery of services to Australians under these new arrangements. The creation of what we see as an artificial barrier between policy departments and service delivery agencies by the placement of the delivery agencies in the Finance portfolio we think is a fundamental error in good public policy. In my view, public administration ought to be fully focused on maximising the connection between policy development and service delivery for the benefit of the Australian community. Whenever there is a disconnect between the policy and the service delivery, customers are always the ones to suffer. That is clearly, I believe, what is happening with the new human services arrangements put in place by the government.
Let us be clear: this is a deliberate disconnect between social policy and the delivery of the social services. The Howard government has consciously ripped service delivery away from the policy departments and lumped it in with the bean counters at the Department of Finance and Administration. The result of this flawed political decision will be the deterioration of service to customers—that is, Australian citizens. In my remarks today I would like to discuss the reasons for the government’s placement of these agencies under the Finance umbrella; the reasons why the new arrangements will, I think, result in a further deterioration of service delivery; and the ways in which the problems created by the government are currently manifesting themselves.
Social policy has never been this government’s strong suit. There has been embarrassment after embarrassment in the Health portfolio and in Family and Community Services, and the ministers have been turned over regularly. The political hardheads in cabinet, like the Prime Minister and Senator Minchin, know that social policy is not their gig, and they have struggled to find ways to neutralise the political damage done to the government through its failure to manage social policy properly. The best example is, of course, the Prime Minister talking about work and family being the barbecue stopper. Well, certainly the barbecue has gone out and there is no sign of the Prime Minister. This failure saw, among other things, Senator Patterson removed from Health and the job given to Mr Abbott.
Family and Community Services continues to be a problem. The flawed family payment system is a catalogue of failure, with hundreds of thousands of families saddled with debts and bungled indexation arrangements. The government’s solution was to write $600 cheques regularly to paper over the cracks in the system. Centrelink raised over 1½ million new debts in 2003-04 worth $940 million, and that is without the family tax benefit debts. In the same year they recovered more than $1.2 billion worth of outstanding debts from previous years. This seems to me to highlight the fact that Centrelink’s payment systems have major problems.
Poor delivery of payments and services has seen the government attempt to spend their way out of trouble rather than fix the policy contradictions that lie at the core of the problem. Systems policy problems have also compromised the delivery of the government’s mutual obligation regime. Through flawed breaching and job-matching processes, innocent people were penalised for noncompliance only to have their breaches overturned on appeal, if they knew how to pursue their rights. Customers have suffered the consequences of a culmination of poor policy and flawed delivery systems.
The offices of MPs on both sides of the chamber and community legal centres around the country are inundated with complaints about Centrelink and the Child Support Agency. Centrelink itself has been squeezed by staff cuts and efficiency dividends. Projections are that average staffing levels by 2006-07 will be cut from 24,100 in 2003-04 to 21,800. At the same time, staff in the agencies have been put under increasing pressure to take on more work, with fewer resources and without enough information and training. They were even asked to help with the tsunami crisis—there is nothing that Centrelink will not be asked to do! I do not at all criticise the work they did, but this is a sign of the extra pressure that is being put on them all the time.
Animosity between customers and staff is the norm, as staff on the front line attempt to deliver poorly thought out policies, with contradictory regimes, to customers who feel increasingly alienated from the system that is supposed to be there to help them. Prior to the last election the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, and her predecessors were incapable of getting on top of these problems. In fact, after the election the Prime Minister himself acknowledged that failure and that of his government. He was reported in the Courier-Mail on 23 October 2004 as saying:
I’ve seen too many examples over the last eight and a half years of a good policy being compromised by somewhat inferior service delivery.
I think that analysis was only half right. Not only was the delivery inferior but the policy was flawed too. Over the last two years the Family and Community Services portfolio has been gutted. In that time, all the serious policy work has been done by the quaintly named task forces run out of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Both FaCS and Defence seem to have their work done mainly out of that department these days. But it is all done under the direct control of the Prime Minister, John Howard.
The Prime Minister’s increasing frustration saw him after the last election take 60 per cent of Family and Community Services staff and move them to ‘more politically compliant’ departments, such as Human Services in the Finance portfolio and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations—departments with ministers more in tune with his highly conservative social views. This was further acknowledgment of the abject failure of social policy under the Howard government and, I suspect, part of a broader agenda to privatise the delivery of core government services. We see yet again the question of Medibank being privatised, and there have been ongoing rumours about the future role of Centrelink.
The fundamental policy problem in the transfer of social policy agencies to Finance is the imposition of an artificial barrier between the policy department and the agency that delivers those services. The Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Health and Ageing allegedly craft the policy and the Department of Finance and Administration—a completely foreign department—delivers the programs. A good social policy should drive its delivery, whilst delivery should inform policy. The government has broken this link. The greater distance imposed between the policy and its delivery will make it more difficult for the government to iron out the problems that plague its major social programs.
In a very practical sense the government has imposed additional chains of reporting and more obstacles to accountability between the policy agency and the delivery agency. Without a single minister responsible for both the policy and its delivery, there is no clear authority and no clear accountability when problems arise. There will be no coherent social policy under this government and under these administrative arrangements we will have only more selections to the shopping lists offered to the Prime Minister when he needs to spend his way out of a political problem.
Another point I make on the fundamental flaw in the placement of the social policy agencies in Finance is that from now on social policy in this country will be judged through the finance department prism, with its emphasis almost solely on the bottom line. While affordability of social policies is obviously a key factor in their development, it should not be the sole driver. Good social policy must be about outcomes for the Australian people, not just about dollars and cents. I do not know of anywhere else in the world where the finance department is responsible for the government’s social policy.
How is the problem manifesting itself? Just five months after the transfer of the agencies to the new Department of Human Services under the Finance umbrella, we are already seeing the negative effects of the fundamental administrative errors I have just outlined. It is clear that the government did not think through the practical issues surrounding the new arrangements. They were supposed to be new, seamless arrangements, and there was a lot of rhetoric around the new arrangements that referred to delivering better services. We already know that departments and agencies are already uncertain about their responsibilities and accountabilities.
We saw this at estimates hearings last month, when officials from the Child Support Agency were unable to tell the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee who was responsible for replying to criticisms of the agency, particularly to those made by the member for Hume. He made some virulent criticisms of the agency and the rules under which it operates, yet those criticisms remain unanswered. No-one from government defended their system.
Similarly, last week, we had a damning report from the Auditor-General on the dismal state of the feedback and review processes at Centrelink. The report showed that customers were too afraid to make complaints for fear of retribution by staff and that the agency is not even certain of the number of complaints it receives. Such fundamental systemic problems go to the heart of the rationale behind the establishment of Centrelink—the alleged improvement in service delivery. Again, confusion over accountability means that neither the Minister for Family and Community Services nor the Minister for Human Services have taken any responsibility for the issues raised by the Auditor-General. Neither of them could manage to issue a press release. No-one has responded on behalf of the government. What we do know is that they are fighting over whose job it is.
Another implication of the government’s policy mistake was also clear at estimates hearings: the transfer of the agencies has serious implications for departmental accountability to this parliament. The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee estimates report raises very serious issues arising out of the placement of the Department of Human Services within the Finance portfolio—and I might say that that was a bipartisan report.
During the short time available, the committee had to examine estimates from agencies including the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and Administration, Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. These are some of the largest, most complex and highest spending federal agencies, and there was simply not the time to look at them in sufficient detail. The committee had barely 70 minutes to raises issues with Centrelink and the HIC.
Another point made in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee report is that the nature of the work of the human services agencies means that they are better dealt with by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The estimates committee examining FaCS also had the major problem that the policy departments appeared but not at the same time as the agencies that deliver the policies. It was frustrating for the committee to be unable to hold the government to account and pursue issues. Previously, you would have been able to have the department responsible for the policy and the service delivery agency there together so one could pursue problems that constituents raise with you.
What we had instead was the handball situation where the agency said, ‘Senator, that’s probably a policy question. You’d have to ask someone else,’ or the policy department said, ‘That’s a question of the delivery of the program, Senator. You’d have to ask the delivery agency.’ That is a totally unacceptable situation. It frustrates accountability of the parliament and it frustrates our ability to represent constituents—members of the Australian public—with serious concerns about the way the system is operating. It is just not good enough. The movement of human services agencies from the community affairs committee to the finance and public administration committee undermines the system that has been built up to scrutinise the executive and hold it accountable.
In addition to these problems, we are now seeing a political turf war between Ministers Patterson and Hockey. While he made the new Department of Human Services to stand alone outside of FaCS, the PM could not bring himself to put Mr Hockey into cabinet. Obviously, a political fix was put in place. But there are serious implications for the administrative arrangements. In the Australian Financial Review on 23 October 2004 there was a report on the creation of the new department. In it, both Senator Patterson and Mr Hockey talked about how well they would work together. In the same article, the Prime Minister talked up the efficiency of the new departmental arrangements. He said:
The new department will ensure that the development and delivery of government services is placed under strong ministerial control with clear lines of responsibility through the secretary.
I do not know whether that was a shot at Senator Patterson, but what we do know is that is not being delivered. An article in Monday’s edition of the Australian shows how much the situation has degenerated in just five months. It says that Senator Patterson is refusing to cede control of the service agencies to Mr Hockey and that she is digging her heels in to try and defend the turf she thinks is hers. She is desperately trying to hang on to the last remnants of her ministerial responsibility. Quite frankly, if she does not win that battle there is not a lot left in her portfolio: child care is about it.
But if you read the administrative orders it is clear the PM’s intention was to cede most of that authority to Mr Hockey. What we hear now is that Mr Hockey is getting legal advice on his powers; he has actually gone to the lawyers to see if they can support him in his fight with Senator Patterson. He is also, we hear, threatening to hold back cash from the agencies: ‘Do as I say or I won’t give you the money to do the job serving Australians that you’re empowered to do.’ Clearly, these are not ministers who are devoting their attention to services to customers. They are having a major bureaucratic war at the expense of Australians.
To sum up, the transfer of the service delivery agencies to the finance portfolio was a major error in public policy. The decision was made for expedient political reasons and was poorly thought through. It was an attempt to neutralise the political impact of a range of problems in policy and service delivery which have been a political headache through the life of this government. It was also a move to give the Prime Minister and his key supporters more control. As a public policy move it is deeply flawed. It broke what should be the fundamental link between policy and delivery. This will make it more difficult to find solutions to problems in both areas. It has obscured and complicated accountability and responsibility relationships. It focuses the government’s attention entirely on service delivery problems at the expense of policy and it places service delivery agencies under a finance regime which is inappropriate to their primary role.
The flaws in the new arrangements are already apparent. Agencies and departments are unclear about their responsibilities and have shown themselves unable to respond to criticisms and last week’s Auditor General’s report. They are not able to meet the demands placed on them for public accountability. We saw at estimates that the new arrangements have diminished parliamentary scrutiny of government activity. We had bipartisan reports concerned at the limitations this places on the ability of the Senate to hold the executive accountable and to pursue the interests of Australian constituents. Finally, the political fix has resulted in a ministerial turf war. All this demonstrates that the government has failed to manage social policy. It means services to customers will continue to deteriorate and the government’s problems in these areas will increase. The bottom line is that all families, kids, seniors and people in need will be the big losers because of the failure of this government to get it right.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2005-03-16,"—The appropriation bills contain the new spending the government committed to: the $66 million pork-barrel bonanza designed to win the last election. That is all they did: create something that would get them back into office. It is the pork-barrel to match their mistruths regarding interest rates. The government made a commitment to the Australian people to ensure interest rates would stay low, and yet within five months of the election interest rates are on their way up and may continue to rise. The indicators are that they will continue to rise. The government went to the people promising good economic management, and yet economic growth figures over the last two quarters were 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent. The current account deficit is running at nearly $16 billion a quarter, more than seven per cent of GDP. Net foreign debt is now $421.9 billion. That is basically $21,000 for every single Australian. We are all in debt for $21,000.
What is causing this blow-out? It is the chronic failure of the government to invest in skills and infrastructure and the chronic failure of export policy. Under the Hawke and Keating governments, exports grew at an average annual rate of 8.1 per cent. Under Prime Minister Howard, that has more than halved to 3.4 per cent. We are not making gains in this country, even at a time when our resource exports are selling for the highest prices in 30 years. Household savings are negative for the first time since statistics started being collected, and they have been since the September quarter of 2002. Since that quarter, households have saved at a rate of minus 2.9 per cent on average. That is earning $100 and spending $103.
What caused the latest interest rate rise that threatens families with higher mortgage repayments? It is the $66 billion of pork barrelling over the forward estimates period—anything to win a vote. That is the philosophy of this government. In order to pump out the pork, the government has punched mortgage holders fair in the stomach. The government says: ‘Don’t worry about them. Just worry about the vote they’ll give us. Forget about them after that.’ The government has been very successful in driving up interest rates. How do we know that wild spending, massive current account deficits and net foreign debt create interest rate rises? It is because Peter Costello, the Treasurer, told us. What did he say on foreign debt? On 26 September 1995, he told the House of Representatives:
Australia today is staggering under the load of foreign debt. What concerns us is that we wake up a miscreant Prime Minister to the load he has inflicted upon the Australian economy and a country that is staggering under the load of foreign debt which threatens to break that country and impose on ordinary Australians some of the pressures that this government has allowed to build up. We are concerned that that message is brought home to them before in fact the full amplitude of its effects are known.
We want to break down the financial pressures which have been building up on families who have to pay higher interest rates in relation to their businesses and their mortgages as a consequence of the reckless financial mismanagement of this government.
What did the government do when they got into office? They doubled foreign debt, trebled the current account deficit and halved export growth. They are very impressed with themselves on the issues of economic management. Peter Costello likes to think of himself as an economic giant. The fact is that Wayne Swan was right in the other place when he said that Peter Costello is like the Wizard of Oz—a midget with a really big microphone. He is not an economic giant at all. The government can tell themselves over and over, ‘We’re so wonderful, we’re so great,’ but the truth is that they are driving our economy into the ground through reckless spending and complete apathy on things that matter. As I was not intending to speak tonight, I will leave it there, as I see my good colleague Senator Hogg champing at the bit to say something on this issue.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2005-03-16,"—In rising to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005 and related bills, I want to take the opportunity to add my thoughts to the rising chorus calling for major tax reform. Over its term in office, the Howard government has placed the biggest ever tax burden on Australian families, reaping more than $100 billion extra a year in taxes than when it was first elected in 1996. Crippling effective marginal tax rates are destroying the incentive to work harder and are a barrier to a more productive economy. On average, this year every Australian household will pay a staggering $11,000 more in tax than they did in 1996.
It seems that with each passing day there is another comment or report that confirms that this government’s high taxing ways are not welcome. Last week we had the OECD report Taxing wages. The Howard government has clearly been stung by this report, which exposed its failure to ensure that the tax system offered the incentive for people to participate fully in the work force. The report shows in black and white the punishing disincentives faced by many families. Key findings outlined were that our marginal tax rates cut in at some of the lowest levels among OECD countries and that Australian low-income earners were particularly bad off when the effective tax rates and the withdrawal of social security benefits combined to produce exceptionally high effective marginal tax rates, resulting in a net loss of disposable income. These people are the most vulnerable in our community and should be getting preferential treatment that allows them to live with dignity in our society. Of course, the Taxing wages report confirms earlier criticisms by the Reserve Bank governor and previous OECD reports that significant reform of the taxation and social security arrangements is required to fix disincentives to participation and productivity in the work force.
This week we have had one of the government’s own members, the member for Wentworth, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, publicly declaring the disaster that is the Howard government’s taxation system. Mr Turnbull is reported by AAP as saying:
... current marginal tax rates were too high and only encouraged the wealthy to engage in complex tax avoidance schemes.
                  …         …           …
... reform of the tax system had to be explored to reduce the incentive for people to engage in tax avoidance.
                  …         …         …
 “You’ve got to focus on tax reforms that are fair right across the economy, right across the population, so that all taxpayers benefit from it.”
I for one think this comment is totally true, as most members of the Australian community can readily associate those views with their thoughts on tax. They know that, for fairness and equity to prevail in a tax system, the burden of tax must be levied in proportion to one’s capacity to pay. Those with the greatest financial or economic capacity to pay should pay the most compared with those with the least capacity to pay. To many people, that seems to be a fairly fundamental and reasonable proposition. All reasonable people concede that they should pay tax but that it should not be disproportionate to that paid by others. That is why those high-wealth individuals who use their wealth to minimise their contribution to the tax pool are viewed so cynically.
On Monday this week, we saw the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation table its report Working for Australia’s future: increasing participation in the workforce. The report makes a total of 23 recommendations, but of particular significance to the tax debate is recommendation 4 at paragraph 4.79:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the tax free threshold, taper rates, effective marginal tax rates and income test stacking to maximise incentives to move from income support payments to increased participation in paid work.
Here again we have a clear and unequivocal call for serious reform of the current tax system and for serious reform of income support arrangements under our social security system, particularly where they intersect with the taxation system. It is worth noting that the committee that made this recommendation is dominated by government backbenchers. While I am talking about this report, I should say that, unlike recommendation 4, which I have spoken about here, not all recommendations were unanimously supported by the committee. In fact, the deputy chair, Mr Brendan O’Connor, and the Labor members of the committee produced a dissenting report. Mr Brendan O’Connor, in a media release announcing the dissenting report, said:
Government Members on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Work Force Participation recommended industrial relations changes that did not correspond with the evidence.
Having read the evidence and listened to witnesses, dissenting members do not consider there was a causal link between low participation and award reform.
Apart from those significant areas of disagreement the Committee sought to find common ground and develop ways to assist and enable more in the community to enter the paid work force.
He also went on to note in that release that the committee members all agreed, however, that ‘there is a need to remove unnecessary disincentives built into the tax and welfare system and the urgent need to attend to the nation’s skill shortage crisis’. I want to quote briefly from the dissenting report because one of the recommendations was disagreed to.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-03-16,"—I want to make some observations this evening about this morning’s meeting of the Australian parliament’s Parliamentary Association for UNICEF. It is interesting to note that the Australian parliament was the first parliament in the world to have a parliamentary association in support of UNICEF. The model has been replicated internationally, to the great credit of the parliament here. I have the great honour and privilege of chairing that organisation. It operates in a cross-party manner. Its deputy is Ms Kelly Hoare, the Labor member for Charlton in New South Wales; its other office bearers are Senator Lyn Allison, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and Mr Luke Hartsuyker, the National Party member for Cowper in New South Wales.
One of the matters we explored this morning was the work of UNICEF in getting children back to school after the recent tsunami and earthquake in Aceh. I want to thank Carolyn Hardy, Chief Executive of the Australian Committee for UNICEF, and Sarah Lendon, her project officer, who both spoke at the committee meeting this morning. Sarah Lendon’s enthusiasm really bears no mere verbal description; you have to see it to believe it. She has been back in Australia for just two days since her time in Aceh and, before that, Sri Lanka. So she really has a very on the ground feel for what has been going on. She is the project officer who managed the post-tsunami back-to-school program in the past two months in Aceh. She was able to illustrate very graphically for us what are the real issues and the real challenges facing the people of that community in getting back to some semblance of normality.
It does not take a genius to determine that, for children, it is going to be so much more difficult. There is an education system which has been devastated in a province that really was already devastated by decades of conflict. Sarah’s estimate given to us today is that there have been 400,000 people displaced in total, with unknown numbers of dead children. As well, 2,499 teachers died and 3,000 lost their homes; 10 per cent of the broad education staff in the province died as well.
That is notable, considered as a statistical point in isolation. But beyond that those teachers who have survived—those who are still there whom the community expect to look after their children—are teachers who will have lost their own children, their own homes, their clothes, their teaching uniforms and all the things that go to make their lives bearable and sustainable. While we are hoping that they are able to contribute to looking after the children of the province, they themselves are still struggling with those difficulties.
In Aceh 1,582 schools were destroyed, and the functioning schools are struggling with very little support. The majority of teachers report that students do have enormous emotional and psychological problems due to the tsunami and, of course, the teachers are suffering. The story Sarah told about the occurrence of regular earth tremors since the tsunami and the earthquake, and the impact they have on the children sitting in the classrooms and on how far their parents are prepared to let them out of their sight on a daily basis, was very powerful. In circumstances like this there is also quite poor coordination between Jakarta and Aceh.
In one town in particular which UNICEF told us about today the challenges include not just the natural disaster but conflict and long-term poverty. Ten primary schools in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar are functioning out of tents. Students from other areas have been relocated to this area, if their schools have been destroyed. In this particular community 4,542 primary school students have lost one or both parents. They are not described in normal parlance as orphans. In the tradition of the community, they live in an extended family—cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents—and that becomes their new world, but that does not make it any easier.
Three schools lost 13 teachers at each school—that is, one-third of their teaching staff. The impact is phenomenal. Half of the schools report that children are not attending and, again, that is an aspect of parents wanting to keep children close for fear of the events occurring again. And at the moment the children, perhaps not unreasonably, have lost some motivation and determination to continue with their education in these most extraordinary circumstances. The schools are in urgent need of cleaning, and some classrooms remain unsafe due to earthquake damage. Seventy-four primary schools have no toilet facilities for students or teachers and 144 schools have no water source altogether.
In terms of UNICEF’s actions in the area, I am pleased to say that UNICEF reported to us today that they have distributed over 5,000 Schools in a Box. Many colleagues will know about Schools in a Box because many of them responded positively to my suggestion that, as members of parliament and within our constituencies, we might contribute to the UNICEF Schools in a Box program. I am very pleased to say that the Parliamentary Association will contribute over $4,000 as a result of that fundraising effort for Schools in a Box. The boxes support, in two shifts, 80 children going to school every day, and recreational kits which support 200 children have also been distributed to a number of communities. To see the look on the faces of the people in the photographs in the presentation today when they see their new soccer balls and other bits and pieces for sporting and recreational activities makes it worth every effort that goes into it.
The government’s policy in the area at the moment is to integrate the displaced children into existing schools, but where no schools are available tents are provided. As I said, there are 10 of those operating in the area. There is a major campaign of school cleaning and an engineering assessment of damaged schools under way and an effort to rehabilitate the water and sanitation defects to which I referred before. There is also a great need for psychosocial training for the teachers which UNICEF is particularly cognisant of and working on. These teachers are expected not just to do their own job, not just to cope with their own trauma, but to teach highly traumatised children. There is a campaign for the registration and tracing of children who have lost their parents. UNICEF is the lead agency in Aceh for the supporting of government coordination and priority setting. There obviously needs to be a plan for the major reconstruction of schools, and that planning is under way.
In relation to the impact of the effort that has been required, 400,000 students have had to be provided with learning materials. There have been 1,000 primary schoolteachers recruited for whom training is under way, and there has to be a full assessment of the education situation in Aceh. There is construction of temporary classrooms and rehabilitation of primary schools, but the recovery of education in Aceh will really only come through the continuous support and capacity building of the local education and religious affairs departments. That is the most important impact on the community that we could possibly have—to build in that capacity for the education system in Aceh to take itself forward in this process, but the isolation, the enormity of the task, just beggar the imagination. In the visual material that UNICEF showed us today, the description, ‘As far as the eye can see there is nothing but destruction,’ is not an exaggeration.
The job ahead, for the short term at least, includes replacing tent schools with temporary classrooms and more effective coordination of communication both within the national and local governments and between international agencies. When they are considering planning for the reconstruction of primary schools, there will be an opportunity to look at things like child friendly standards, which perhaps were not considered in the past. So, out of this adversity, out of this challenge, some opportunities may come to assist the children in a tangible and an important way. Safety for the children is very important. We cannot contemplate them having to learn and play, which is also very important, in unsafe areas, so structural assessments and cleaning are ongoing, as I said. In some districts, though, the situation is still unknown, and another enormous challenge is reaching these areas and finding people, without having any idea what has been going on there.
I have been talking mainly about primary schools but the challenges exist for kindergartens and secondary schools as well. Psychosocial support for both students and teachers will at least go some way to providing the sort of strength that perhaps they need to move forward. The work that UNICEF have done in Aceh in this period is absolutely commendable.
