"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-09-08,"—Before the Senate adjourned last night I was on my feet talking about this bill. I will remind the chamber of what we are talking about, which is the abolishing of detention debt. The issue is who should actually have their detention debt abolished. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who, having thought about it and looked at this issue really hard, would disagree that it is fair and reasonable for a refugee to have their debt wiped, where the refugee is genuinely fleeing from persecution or fleeing for their life or is in circumstances that would ensure that they were a refugee.
In actual fact this government has a policy today—and the previous government had one too—by which genuine refugees have their debt wiped. It is not in law; it is a policy, and that has been happening. So you then say, ‘What is this bill actually going to do?’ Well, it puts that into law: genuine refugees will have their debt wiped. But what else does the bill do? This is where we come to the problem. It also wipes the debt of someone who is here illegally, someone who overstays their visa illegally. It wipes their detention debt as well. I do not understand how at the moment, when you have refugees having their debt wiped—they do not pay it as a result of policy—someone can come into this parliamentary chamber and say: ‘You beauty! We’re going to fix the problem. We’re going to make sure that refugees don’t have any debt.’ In actual fact they do not have a debt at the moment, because of policy, but supposedly we are going to pass this law without amendment.
Family First will be moving an amendment to make sure only refugees have their debt wiped and those people illegally in Australia will still have their debt; it will not be wiped. We should not be wiping it. The government put up some time ago the principle about people paying their way when they said that horticulture and agriculture had to pay their way through AQIS fees. Fair enough, but why should we be wiping the debt of people who are actually staying here illegally? It is crazy. It is absolutely crazy, and it is ludicrous to think that they are going to pass this law without any amendment. We will be putting up the amendment and hoping to get support from the coalition, because there is no way that people who stay here illegally should have their debt wiped clean.
This law goes too far. It stinks more than a fish market. Seriously, they have come into this chamber saying: ‘Good on us! We’re actually going to wipe the debt of refugees.’ But they already do that, and so did the previous government—they wiped the debt of genuine refugees. But this law goes a step further, which it should not, and wipes the detention debt of people who are staying here illegally. That is just crazy. Let us be clear what this government’s bill does through this example. A person comes into this country for a holiday, commits a violent criminal offence or illegally overstays their visa and gets put into detention and then the Rudd government says, ‘Let’s wipe their debt.’
—That is just not true.
—No, it is true. It is very true. Maybe that is one of the unintended consequences of your bill, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt. But you have got to fix it. I hear at the back of the chamber someone taking a cheap shot, saying, ‘How do you spell that?’
—How do you spell ‘consequences’? How do you spell ‘compassion’?
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order, Senators! If you would focus on the front of the Senate chamber and direct your remarks, Senator—
—Yes, having a go and taking a cheap shot.
—Excuse me, Senator Fielding, but if you would direct your remarks through the chair, please.
—Here we are talking about a very serious issue and we have got people from the Greens sitting up the back taking cheap shots.
—How do you spell ‘compassion’?
—Order, Senator! Let us stick to the debate.
—I will go through this again. Quite clearly, a person who comes to this country for a holiday, commits a violent criminal offence or illegally overstays their visa and gets put into detention has the government wanting to wipe their debt. This is not a person who is a refugee. This is not a person who has fled their country in fear of losing their life. This is a criminal. This is a person who has no respect for our laws. But the government now wants taxpayers to cough up for the bill rather than chase this person for it. Ordinary Australians are being asked by the government to make sacrifices and tighten their belts. I find it astonishing that the government wants to make sure this bill gets through without any changes. I will be moving changes and I am hoping the coalition and those on the cross benches will be supporting them. This is not right. I am reasonable and I am more than happy for genuine refugees to have their debt wiped. In actual fact the previous government did it and so does this one.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (ABOLISHING DETENTION DEBT) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2009-09-08,"—Today I would like to speak in support of this bill; I will be voting for this bill when the call is taken. Over the last few years I have played a small part in ameliorating and lessening some of the more punitive measures that have been imposed on asylum seekers, refugees and people who come to these shores. But I just want to put on record that this particular measure was introduced by a Labor government and perhaps it is poetic justice that it is being removed by a Labor government.
There is no doubt that since 2005, and in subsequent years leading up to now, recognition has grown in the community that people who come to our shores looking for assistance, asylum and a desire to have a better life should be treated a lot better than they are. And to impose accommodation charges on them in the way that has been done because this law has existed is not something I can go along with any more.
We often hear in this chamber about the agonies or the worries of those Australians who are battling mortgage stress. They wonder how they are going to pay their mortgage and how they are going to exist in the present global financial crisis if they lose their jobs. I can only ask the chamber to imagine how they would feel if they were a person newly arrived in Australia who was in a detention centre and was being charged every single night for their accommodation and board, and all they had, quite literally, were the clothes in which they stood. How would anybody feel if, when they left the detention centre, they received a debt notification letter and an invoice from the department—and this was prior to any thought of the debt being waived?
These are people who have spent a very short time in our country. They have probably very little knowledge of macroeconomics. They have left a life of perhaps torture and trauma behind them. They have been in a detention centre and we are asking them to pay a debt which sometimes amounts to $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000. How would they possibly cope with that? Indeed, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, in its recent inquiry, said:
[The detention charges policy] stands as a barrier towards refugees fully integrating into the community, and [these charges continue] to put significant pressure—both emotionally and financially—on those people who have already experienced so much trauma and uncertainty in their lives.
It must be a terrible psychological shock to them as they wonder how they will repay this debt. When they have nothing, no assets on which to base any sort of wealth accumulation, it must be a shock to be even contemplating this.
The comment has been made that the more we ‘soften’—and that is other people’s word, not mine—policies towards refugees the more we can expect a flood of refugees. And words like ‘flood’, ‘panic’ and ‘hundreds of thousands of people arriving on our shores’ are used all too often. There is no doubt that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in his most recent report, shows that the number of individual claims for asylum worldwide rose for the second year in a row by 28 per cent to 839,000 people. Developed countries like Australia do attract asylum seekers, but the fact is that 80 per cent of the world’s refugees are hosted by developing countries—Pakistan, Syria, Iran and Jordan. Among the developed countries, the US received 49,600 applications for asylum; France, 35,400; Canada, 34,800; the UK, 30,500; and Italy, 30,000. Australia received—and this is taken together, both boat people and plane arrivals—4,500 asylum claims. That is 0.05 per cent of the worldwide total, and almost all of them did not arrive by boat. So I challenge the theories of those who want to say that this is opening the floodgates. Firstly, that is an unpalatable concept to those of us who think about it and, secondly, it simply is not true.
We are legislators here in a 21st-century Australia, an Australia which has grown enormously through migration, through the assimilation of people who were born in other countries. I regularly attend citizenship ceremonies in my local municipalities where people are so happy to be here. At Stonnington, which is a municipal area in central Melbourne, we wave gladiola to show how happy we are that everyone has now received citizenship. These punitive sorts of charges and the putting up of these barriers should never happen. I will be proud to be in a legislature that legislates to take this law off the statute books.
Senator Fielding said that little of the money is recovered, and I see there is a reason for that. It costs more to gather that money than what we are getting back in the coffers. Let us just do away with it. The law does not help. Even if it is never collected, the fact is that it is still a blot on our statute book and I for one will not accept that it should be in continuation. No advanced society should have on its books laws like this, and so I will be supporting the government on this bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (ABOLISHING DETENTION DEBT) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-08,"—I wish to sum up on behalf of the government. I think it is fair to say that most of this debate has been characterised by a rerun of the hysteria that occurred around the time of the Tampa arrival and the Howard government’s use of fear of refugees in the political context. Very little focus has been on the actual bill.
—How many boats over the last 15 months? How many boats?
—Senator Cormann, you have had your go. You stand by your Hansard; you stand by your record on this matter. You have had your go.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Minister, please direct your remarks through the chair.
—What you have done, along with Senator Bernardi and other Liberal senators, is stake out your position, and that is fine. You have learnt nothing, you have not moved on at all from those rather unfortunate debates and the vilification of individuals seeking our protection. You and Senator Bernardi have achieved one thing in this debate: you have managed to put Pauline Hanson back at the centre of the political debate. The remnants of the Noel Crichton-Brown faction and the hard right in South Australia continue to peddle these untruths and the vilification of people seeking our protection. Quite frankly, I think you are irrelevant in the debate. But I want to—
—People of Australia don’t. People in Western Australia don’t.
—Order! Senators, would you please cease the interjections and comments across the chamber. Minister, address your remarks through the chair.
—We will see what the people of Australia think, as we did at the last election. I think the people of Australia have actually moved on.
—Not in Western Australia, did they?
—Order, Senator Cormann! I just asked you to cease interjecting. Would you please do so for at least some time.
—This typifies what concerns me about this debate. I had hoped that we had moved on. For a while the Liberal Party, post the election, had. I do not want to focus on those contributions, other than to say that they contributed nothing to the debate. I appreciate that the spokesman, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, did address the bill and tried to construct an argument around that. I appreciate the contributions of Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding, who have sought to deal with the issues on this.
What the government and I are trying to do here is have a rational policy debate based on evidence and our history on this legislation and the application of this policy. Unfortunately, we immediately fall back into the old debate we have in Australian politics about boat people et cetera, and the fear of arrivals, when in fact this bill has very little to do with these issues. Under the previous government, more than 90 per cent of those who arrived, including those sent to Nauru and Manus Island, were found to be refugees, and the previous government did not collect any detention debt from them. This bill is not about boat people.
Senator Fielding, I will come to your argument in a minute, but you quite rightly make the point that you do not think that this policy was an appropriate way to treat those found to be owed our protection. Your record on that is a good one and I recognise that. But this debate is not actually about them. The hysteria that is sought to be generated is misplaced. What we want is a serious debate. This is about tackling an issue seriously, recognising that we have had experience of this provision on detention debts since 1992.
We have a long history on this. It was introduced by Labor. It was not, as has been claimed, introduced as a deterrent. Look at the second reading speech. We are the only country in the world that has sought to collect debts from people held in detention for immigration matters. None of the other Western democracies do it. We do not do it for criminals. Senator Fielding made a debating point earlier about people who have committed a crime. It is an interesting point, Senator Fielding. It is not that you go to immigration detention for that. If you are a mass murderer or a rapist, we do not charge you for the time you spend in prison, but, if you get out of prison and we are about to deport you, we will run up a charge against you for immigration detention.
Just to deal with the deterrent value, first of all it has been widely accepted that people do not know about these conditions; it is not a factor in their decision. But, if you were focusing on unauthorised arrivals, you would focus on the fact that since 1992 15,000 people have arrived as unauthorised boat arrivals, so as a deterrent it is clearly not working as well as we would have hoped. If you throw in visa overstayers, which would be in the tens of thousands, it has not deterred them. If you throw in air arrivals, which would be in the tens of thousands, it has not deterred them. So it is a nonsense to pretend this is a deterrent. It is just a nonsense. People have no knowledge of it and it has not acted as a deterrent at all.
The second point to make very clearly is that we do not collect it. We actually collect three per cent of what we levy. It just has not been working. The previous government recognised this and stopped collecting the money, except from a very small subset of people, and I will come to that in a minute. It has not worked. Today we have been asked to keep the legislation as it is, to keep the principle—whatever that is—even though after 17 years of experience we know it has not worked. It has not deterred anyone and we have not collected the money. We certainly have not collected the money from the people we removed to overseas—they were a very tiny proportion of the debt collected—because they have no obligation to pay. So it is not a deterrent and we have not collected the money.
It actually costs Australian taxpayers more to run the scheme than is collected. Last year it cost us $350,000 or so to run a scheme that does not work. On any evidence based assessment, on any rational public policy debate, you would not do it. Why wouldn’t you spend that $350,000 in a better way? Again, on the questions of value for money and rational public policy, you would not do it.
If you examine the history of this and its review by sane, sensible people, you can point to a series of reports by the government and by colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives that have consistently said it does not work, it is not appropriate, it is punitive, it is unfair and it ought to be repealed. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in 2006 made criticisms of its punitive effect. The various United Nations Human Rights Committee reports have focused on it as being punitive and unfair. Most recently, last December the Joint Standing Committee on Migration unanimously recommended that the government introduce this legislation as a priority. A joint parliamentary committee of this parliament, with all the opposition members on it, unanimously requested that the government bring this bill in. I am being criticised by some for responding to a unanimous call from a joint parliamentary committee, represented by all sides of the parliament, that we bring in a bill to deal with this. They looked at it and said it was unfair, it was irrational and it ought to end.
Not only that, but I understand that the shadow spokesperson, Dr Sharman Stone, took a recommendation to the Liberal Party shadow cabinet to support the abolition of this measure. For whatever reason, the conservatives inside the Liberal Party had a win. The recommendation that came out of that meeting was against supporting the bill. So the shadow spokesperson herself, who was a member of the committee that recommended we bring the bill in, took that position to the shadow cabinet and was rolled. Unfortunately, we have the position where the Liberal opposition have decided to oppose this bill, despite the views of Mrs Danna Vale, Mr Petro Georgiou, Senator Alan Eggleston and, of course, their own spokesperson.
I do not want to spend a lot of time talking about why they took this decision or whether they saw some sort of political opportunity in having a rerun of the anti-refugee debates of the early part of this century. What we do know is that all the inquiries into this policy have confirmed the lack of any deterrent value, the lack of fairness and the unfair impact it has on those who have debts levied against them—and have called for us to repeal the legislation. The government has sought to do that.
The arguments are all there. They were set out in the second reading speech. I will not go through them all again, but, as I say, it has failed as a scheme. Whatever one’s views about it, the evidence is that it has failed as a scheme and that it has caused great distress to a range of people who have repaid some of their debts.
This takes me to Senator Fielding’s point. I appreciate his motives. Even though we had an exchange across the chamber last night, I will try to explain why he is wrong—not in his sentiment but in practice. I think you are wrong, Senator Fielding. It effectively goes like this. The debts of people who are found to be refugees are wiped off. Even John Howard when he was at the height of his anger and attack on refugees did not collect that money. We will put that to one side—it is a non-issue. I have never claimed that this legislation is about those people; it has never been about them. We have another set of people, whom you are concerned about, who overstay their visas and then have to be removed from the country after being detained. The vast majority of overstayers are actually removed without being detained, and we encourage that. We try to get them to go home without banging them up in Villawood—(1) because it costs money and (2) because there is a nicer way of doing it, saying, ‘Look, mate, it’s time you went home.’ A lot of them are British backpackers who are having such a good time in Sydney that they forget to go home. A lot of them are ordinary tourists who are partying and decide that they want a couple of extra weeks and their visas expire.
But the ones we tend to remove from Australia are those we take into detention. The reality is that, once they are removed, they never pay the debt. Why would you pay the debt if you have been removed? If you get a bill from the Australian department of immigration in the mail saying, ‘Please send us a cheque for $10,000 to pay for your detention costs,’ and you are back in Brazil or wherever, I think you would say, ‘I’ve got better things to do with my money. Why would I bother?’
Regarding Senator Fielding’s concern, the debt for removal is not affected by this bill. People removed still have a debt to the Commonwealth. So, regarding his concern about those people being able to come back into the country, and them not receiving a penalty for their failure to obey the visa conditions, those provisions remain. The removal debt is not affected by this bill. For a whole range of reasons it was easier for us to seek to remove detention debt, and there are a range of legal arguments about why all that should occur. But, regarding your major concern, someone who is removed involuntarily from Australia will maintain a debt for the cost of their removal, and that will impact on their capacity to come back into Australia. They have a PIC 4001 bar to the granting of a further visa and, as a consequence, a bar on re-entry to Australia. Those who go voluntarily, and do the right thing after having overstayed their visas by a couple of weeks, will have their visa history examined before they can come back in.
As I say, quite frankly, a lot of the overstayers are really not a problem. They are not criminals; they are just people who have overstayed, often by a day or two and sometimes by a couple of weeks. But the department has the capacity to deal with any further visa application with that immigration history in mind. If we think they have been of bad character, they could have a visa cancelled or they could be barred—we can make a judgment on their history. But, as I say, we know that we basically do not successfully collect any debt. We collect less than three per cent of the debt.
Coming to the nub of what this bill is really about—and this is particularly in response to Senator Fielding—the people this bill impacts on are the people who are given permission to stay legally in Australia but did not get a refugee or humanitarian visa. They might have got a spouse visa or another type of visa, largely as a result of intervention by the minister—Philip Ruddock, Amanda Vanstone or me—who has said: ‘On assessing your case, even though you were found not to be a refugee, you are entitled to stay in Australia. We grant you a visa to stay legally.’ Having decided that these people are legally allowed to stay in Australia, this policy imposes a debt on them that impacts on their capacity to get on with their life in Australia.
The most moving examples are often of people who were locked up in Baxter for two or three years, were given a visa by a former Liberal minister—they were found to be entitled to a visa in Australia—and married an Australian citizen. Some of them have debts of $250,000. They cannot buy a home and they cannot get on with their lives because they have a debt of $250,000. Some of their debts are smaller but some people have huge debts. These people are legally in Australia, often married to an Australian citizen, with Australian citizen kids, who have this burden on them. This burden on them is causing mental health issues, it is causing financial pressures and it is impacting on their ability to get on with their lives. Those are the people we are concerned about. Those are the people who are affected.
Whether someone notionally living overseas has a debt, quite frankly, is neither here nor there; it is these people, permanent residents of Australia, often married to Australian citizens, often on a pathway to citizenship themselves—some of them will now be Australian citizens—who have this pressure on them. These are people who are integrated into the Australian community. They might have been given a visa because they have Australian citizen kids. They might have been given a visa because of humanitarian considerations, because of their age or because of their disability. They might have had a complementary protection claim such as fear of being returned to a country where they might be subject to the death penalty or where they might be subject to female genital mutilation. They are not refugees but are owed our protection. Currently they are picked up in this group. It could be someone who has been granted a visa because she fears going back to a country where she may be forced to have compulsory female genital mutilation. You say, despite the government of the day saying she is entitled to a legal visa, she has a debt for her detention and we are going to punish her, even though we said she could legally stay. It is a nonsense; it has always been a nonsense. It needs to be changed. That is why it needs to be changed. This is the group of people whom this change will benefit.
Equally it is for a whole range of other people who are found to be eligible for a visa—most of them granted by a minister of the Crown. These people are legally here, they have settled here, they are staying here and we are saddling them with a debt. If you meet some of these people, you will understand the pressure that places on them. Many of them, I would argue, were detained in a way that should never have occurred and which I think people like Senator Fielding have agreed should never have occurred. Many people had long-term detention in really difficult circumstances—the people who were sewing up their lips and jumping off buildings. What we are saying is, ‘As if that experience wasn’t enough, even though we have recanted, if you like, and said you can have a visa to remain, we are going to keep on punishing you.’ Quite frankly, it is not good public policy; it is not humane policy. Senator Fielding, it is not the Australian thing to do, in my view. I am happy to argue this anywhere in Australia. This is not good policy. It has terrible, unfair consequences. Everyone who has looked at it, every parliamentarian who has been involved in a committee who has looked at it, has said that it ought to go. All the international bodies, all the human rights groups, say it ought to go. There is a good reason why this bill ought to be carried and why this detention debt regime ought to be abolished. I think some of the concerns that you have had, Senator Fielding, are addressed by it.
In conclusion, I appreciate the contribution of Senator Troeth. I have always had a great deal of respect for her. We are of the same class. But I also understand how difficult this is for people. I appreciate the fact that four of her colleagues did a similar thing in the House of Representatives. I have not sought to take any political advantage of it because I know how difficult that is for people. I know it reflects a deeply held view about justice and fairness in these matters. I welcome the decision but I do appreciate how difficult it is. I think it is important that we send the message as a parliament that this is not an appropriate way for Australia to respond.
I thank senators for their contributions to the debate—well, I thank some of them; I think others really do need to have a look at themselves and ask where their humanity is and whether they are really responding appropriately to people who are often in quite desperate circumstances. I urge the Senate to carry the bill. I will not be supporting Senator Fielding’s amendments, for the reasons I have explained, but I do appreciate the rationale behind his approach. But, obviously we will debate that in the committee stage.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-09-08,"—On behalf of the coalition, can I indicate our support for the Uranium Royalty (Northern Territory) Bill 2008. This bill will establish a uniform royalty regime for any future uranium project in the Northern Territory. The royalty regime of 18 per cent of net receipts will bring uranium into line with the mining of other minerals in the Northern Territory. On behalf of the coalition, I thank the secretariat of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for their work in conducting the inquiry into this bill. I thank Senator Eggleston, as the deputy chair of the committee, for his remarks as provided in his additional comments to the report.
The changes proposed here have come about from a process that was commenced by the former coalition government, under the then Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Ian Macfarlane. Australia is, as many know, the world’s second biggest producer of uranium. Our industry generated $658 million in export revenue in 2006-07 and provided over 800 jobs, mainly in remote parts of Australia. The Australian Uranium Association estimates that production of Australian uranium could increase from around the current level of 10,000 tonnes per year to 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes per year in 2030. The coalition in government recognised the economic benefits from uranium mining and understood that our uranium exports contribute to a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions through use in nuclear power generation.
Worldwide adoption of clean energy generation and the role of nuclear power as a cleaner alternative, combined with Australia’s low-cost reserves, means there is enormous potential for growth of our uranium mining industry—a fact that the coalition consistently recognised and supported but that, regrettably, was always opposed by the Labor Party, who held onto their antiquated three-mines policy way beyond its use-by date.
In late 2005, the then coalition resources minister, Ian Macfarlane, announced the development of a Uranium Industry Framework in recognition of Australia’s low-cost uranium resources. The framework was a project to identify opportunities for and impediments to the further development of uranium mining in Australia, with the aim of reducing impediments to exploration, mining and the export of Australian uranium. The framework was to also look at ensuring a consistent and efficient regulatory regime and promote community understanding of the economic benefits of a safe, secure and responsible uranium mining industry in Australia. In 2006, the framework’s steering committee presented a report containing 20 recommendations to support and develop uranium mining in Australia. The steering committee’s report stated:
The application of royalty arrangements for uranium development in the Northern Territory on a project-by-project basis is a major source of uncertainty and therefore a deterrent to further investment in the sector. New entrants to the industry are unsure about their potential royalty liabilities, and current arrangements mean that multi-product uranium mines would be subject to the Northern Territory Government’s profit-based royalty and the royalty regime imposed by the Australian Government. This leads to administrative complexity and could result in tax-driven investment decisions. These problems could be avoided by the consistent application of a more sustainable uranium royalty regime in the Northern Territory which balances the needs of Indigenous communities, the mining sector and government.
Recommendation 13 of the report stated:
The Australian Government should establish, in consultation with stakeholders, a royalty framework for the uranium industry in the Northern Territory.
In January 2007, Ian Macfarlane announced the formation of an implementation group to work through the framework recommendations. That of course was interrupted by the 2007 election. But I am pleased that this bill gives effect to the NT royalty recommendation of that framework.
As I said, the coalition welcome this bill and the implementation of the recommendations of the framework because we have a consistent and longstanding commitment to responsible, environmentally sensitive and effectively regulated uranium mining in this country. There are of course some areas in Australia that should not be subject to uranium mining. One was advertised yesterday on the front page of the Australian: the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary in the state of South Australia. It is one such area which many could not imagine could ever be subject to uranium mining. But there are many other areas in Australia where uranium mining can occur safely and with minimal environmental consequences.
This bill implements a recommendation of the Uranium Industry Framework and signifies that on some level Labor may be seeing sense on uranium and its potential benefits to the economy in Australia. In its submission and evidence to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Uranium Association highlighted a 2008 report by Deloitte Insight Economics that was prepared for the association. This report found that there would be significant economic benefits to the Northern Territory through to 2030 with an expansion of uranium mining, including $405 million more in investment and a $2.3 billion higher gross Territory product. The association advised the Senate committee that the Northern Territory has about 13 per cent of Australia’s uranium.
Unlike Labor, which as I said only abandoned its three-mines policy prior to the last election, and has a Queensland Premier and cabinet ministers still opposed to any expansion of uranium mining in this country, the coalition believe that investment in uranium mining should be encouraged and appropriate regulation put in place to ensure it is safe, efficient and of course environmentally sensitive. The coalition have always had a consistent policy in support of uranium mining—as long as it is conducted according to a very strict regulatory regime, one that was originally put in place in this country by the Fraser government back in the late 1970s. That is why we are pleased that this bill will give effect to a recommendation of the Uranium Industry Framework.
Currently, royalty regimes in relation to uranium in the Northern Territory—as I mentioned in quoting the steering committee report—are negotiated on a project-by-project basis. The Ranger mine has a 5.5 per cent ad valorem royalty. This bill will apply the existing profits based mineral royalty regime under the Mineral Royalty Act 1982 to new projects on Aboriginal land and non-Aboriginal land, meaning that all minerals in the Northern Territory will be under the same regime. I note that the committee gave significant consideration to the issue of an ad valorem versus a profit based royalty regime, particularly in terms of the moneys that would flow to Indigenous communities for mines on Indigenous land under each royalty scheme. Officers from the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism stated in evidence to the Senate economics committee:
… we consider that a profits based royalty charge is more economically efficient in that it does not of itself act to distort investment decisions …
They also said:
A profits based regime can also result in greater returns to the community, particularly during periods of higher profits.
I note that coalition senators on the committee concluded that there would be no real difference in the royalties paid to Indigenous communities with a profit based system and therefore indicated their support for this proposal after consideration of all evidence presented, but particularly the evidence from the Northern Land Council on this issue. The department also highlighted the administrative improvements that would result from the bill and the reduced complexity for all involved in the mining sector in the Northern Territory, particularly, as highlighted in the committee report, in relation to polymetallic mines.
As a South Australian senator and a former resources minister myself I am encouraged by this bill and the fact that the Labor Party has brought this forward, and I confirm coalition support for its provisions.",SENATE,<title>URANIUM ROYALTY (NORTHERN TERRITORY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-09-08,"—I rise to add my remarks to the debate on the Uranium Royalty (Northern Territory) Bill 2008. It would be no surprise to anyone in this chamber that the Australian Greens oppose uranium mining as an industry, because it poses unacceptable environmental and health risks and provides the essential ingredient of nuclear weapons. I have just spent the weekend in South Australia at the Australian Nuclear Free Alliance meeting. This is an organisation that has existed since about 1997. It is led by some very senior traditional Aboriginal people from right around the country, for whom uranium mining and nuclear waste dumping is not a matter of theory or political opinion but a matter of lived experience.
Most Australians have a healthy if distant scepticism for uranium mining, but for the people gathered in Quorn at the weekend these are matters of community life and death. At this point I pay my respects to the elders past and present who have led this campaign, often at great personal cost, and the campaigners from around the country, who are now into their third generation, who have stepped up against this industry since the fireballs of British nuclear weapons testing first lit up Central Australia.
I have a comment in response to Senator Minchin’s comments—and I am sure we will hear similar sentiments from the government when the minister debates this issue—that somehow it is possible to undertake responsible environmentally sensitive uranium mining. I certainly appreciate Senator Minchin’s sentiments as they apply to Arkaroola, a magical part of the country, and I do not understand why those sentiments could not be extended to a place like Kakadu National Park, our most important World Heritage area, or indeed regional Western Australia, my home state, which is under threat of uranium mining at multiple locations. I think Arkaroola is precious, Kakadu is precious, Kokotha country is precious and Wongi country is precious, and there is no place for uranium mining anywhere on this ancient continent. I do not think it is possible to mine this mineral in a way which is respectful of country or culture or that mouthing the words ‘world’s best practice’ in some way justifies the massive intergenerational harm that this form of mining guarantees. For this reason, I will be circulating a second reading amendment which simply states that the bill should allow for the orderly phasing-out of this toxic and obsolete industry. No fiddling around the edges is going to make this industry all right.
To move to the substantive provisions of this bill, if uranium mining is to occur—and we know that it is and that there is a huge bipartisan push at the moment for this industry to expand across Australia—the Greens do not believe that a for-profit royalty model is the best one on offer. The Standing Committee on Economics report tabled today does not make a convincing case for this model at all. The case that was made through this exercise is that royalties per se are not benefiting Aboriginal people, not just in the uranium mining sector but right across the board, and that the system is essentially failing. The case was very convincingly made that this government has been captured by the uranium mining industry and that all this bill is really is an answer to the uranium industry’s wish list for a simpler, more streamlined way of getting this material out of the ground, from marginal deposits if necessary. I will get to the detail of that in a moment. As we said in our dissenting report, regulatory capture is an entirely appropriate description to use in this case, when observing the actions of this government and the previous government becoming the nuclear industry’s tooth fairy, granting the wishes of the uranium industry framework, which on the day it was set up and to this day is an unrepresentative and industry dominated creation of the former Howard government, to which the Rudd government has now sadly become beholden.
The bill seeks to fast-track and remove barriers to the uranium mining industry. It prioritises industry imperatives—and it has been quite upfront about that—industry access, industry certainty, industry administrative ease and industry profits over other criteria, such as Aboriginal community development, environmental protection and sustainable regional economies. Royalty calculations for other minerals in the Northern Territory are using the for-profit system, and the key argument that has been advanced in the report of the committee and in the drafting of the bill is that we may as well bring uranium in line with other minerals and make sure that the system up there is streamlined. I note at this point that that is not the system that predominates in the other big mining states, Western Australia and Queensland. It is simply not a robust argument when it has been proven to be not working for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It has not even worked very well for the Territory government. If the Xstrata example, about which we had a considerable amount of evidence during our hearings in Darwin, is anything to go by, then this is not a robust system for calculating mining royalties. Creative bookkeeping, in the concealment of profits in this case, resulted in the Northern Territory government receiving no royalties at all from the McArthur River operations for over a decade. In fact, it would not have received any royalties except that Xstrata was simply seeking to expand that mine to an open-cut operation. The case shows how difficult it really is to extract information required to calculate profits generated by the mining industry, which is compounded by the lack of transparency arising from commercial-in-confidence and other corporate secrecy provisions, which even FOI laws were unable to penetrate in the Xstrata McArthur River case. In my view, the committee was far too easily satisfied by assurances from the industry and government that potential for manipulation would be minimal and that rigorous assessment processes are in place ‘when in fact there is no such thing’. There have been very recent cases to prove the point that private profits can be maximised when royalty payments are minimised.
The fact of the matter is that uranium is unique. It is not like other minerals and these are not like other mines. The radiation from uranium mining and the daughter isotopes that are produced when uranium is unearthed are uniquely hazardous, persistent and indiscriminate, damaging our most precious legacy, the core human blueprint stored in our DNA and passed on to future generations. We know now that radionuclides with very long half-lives are cumulatively loaded into the environment and are resulting right now in ongoing impacts on health as well as long-term damage to the human gene pool. Given these unique health and environmental risks, uranium mining not only requires special regulatory and environmental requirements if it is to proceed at all but also requires case-by-case decisions. The health risks posed by proximity of residents and workers to radon gas emissions, for example, vary according to the location of the mine. Positioning of tailings dumps in relation to water sources is also unique in each instance and requires individual treatment. Therefore, negotiations and royalty systems should be tailored to the particular circumstance. I suggest at this point that that should apply right across the board and not just to uranium mining.
Facts were presented to the committee that neither royalty system is actually delivering significant or long-term benefits to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We were told that the December 2008 report of the Native Title Payments Working Group—and this is an industry group with very serious industry representation—said:
... while hundreds of agreements exist between traditional owners and industry, there are only about one dozen agreements that provide substantial benefits to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders and exhibit principles embodying best practice ...
That is around a dozen out of several hundred agreements. This is a system that has failed and is failing today, and this bill will do nothing if not entrench that system further. We have not heard a word from the government yet about how the system that is supposed to be bringing development benefits to Aboriginal communities in the Territory is failing so catastrophically and we have seen no sign of reform. There is certainty no sign in the bill that is before us today. The Australian Greens are convinced by the evidence presented by this working group’s recommendations for a review to examine the extent to which Aboriginal people are benefiting from mining royalties. We will be pursuing such an inquiry and it is a disgrace that the government did not get onto the front foot to do so itself.
Not only is the royalty system in the Territory failing to deliver benefits, the current approval system under the Land Rights Act operating in the Territory forces Aboriginal people to consent to mining if they consent to exploration, and that has been quite seriously doing people over. The mining industry comes in and says, ‘We’re just going to have a little bit of a look around and see if there is anything out there.’ You give consent to that and before you know it, you have given consent to mining operations. Of course this failure to consent to exploration can often result in the project progressing regardless, while cutting traditional owners out of the possibility of receiving compensation in the form of royalties, and this reinforces the disadvantage that we see today.
It is from this disempowered and marginal position that the government and the opposition seem to believe that Aboriginal people will be able to negotiate additional payments and benefits to fix all of the shortcomings of the royalty system. There is a ‘She’ll be right’ attitude within the system, but the situation clearly is not all right. It is an unacceptable way to address the gap that people will experience when they have given up their land and allowed water quality on their country to be compromised. And of course they will not be receiving payments when the market is down. This allows companies to forestall paying royalties to the Territory and Commonwealth taxpayer and to Aboriginal peoples during the nonprofitable start-up years and also the long periods when site remediation, replenishment of equipment or capital items will see no profits coming in.
Rather than acknowledging the systemic failure, the committee has instead recommended that uranium agreements be simply folded into an already dysfunctional profit based system largely on the grounds that this would remove a barrier to mining development, particularly for marginal uranium developments, and provide administrative consistency that ‘would be easier and involve less paperwork for business’. That’s great! While people are living in disgusting poverty in the Northern Territory, at least we are easing the paperwork burden on business.
This committee has allowed the government to encourage marginal outfits to use the profit based system to gamble the start-up of uranium mines, hoping for eventual profits. In the case of uranium mining—in any operation really but in uranium mining in particular—with its uniquely toxic and long-lasting waste streams, this is a pretty deadly gamble for the people who are right up close to it. If these companies go broke well before their deposits have been mined out—and uranium is a notoriously volatile and difficult industry in which to get a project up—the government and local communities will be left to deal with the mess. In fact the government seems to think it a good idea to encourage the development of more marginally economic projects. This is entirely reckless, very unpopular and out of step with community concerns, and it is certainly well out of the way of Labor’s supposed policies of the world’s best practice. I therefore move the second reading amendment on sheet 5908:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate calls on the Government to provide for the orderly phasing-out of uranium mining in the Northern Territory”.
This second reading amendment calls for the orderly phasing out of uranium mining in the Territory—not world’s best practice, not fiddling around the edges or marginal improvements. This is an industry that deserves to be phased out as rapidly as possible. Should this amendment fail, and I will not hold my hopes up too high, I would like to briefly foreshadow a number of amendments that we will be moving, which the Greens believe will at least improve the process that has been put forward by the government and clearly has opposition support. Our first amendment seeks to insert a standard recognised by the government fo             r the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory. If the words ‘world’s best practice’ mean anything at all in this debate, it would mean a mine operating in Kakadu National Park certainly within the ecological boundaries of the World Heritage area, with its own Commonwealth department, the Supervising Scientist looking over its shoulder, with a commitment to return mine tailings and wastes into the mine void when operations are concluded and with a commitment by the mining company to ensure that those tailings are physically isolated from the environment for at least 10,000 years.
That is not a stricture that we would place on gold tailings or nickel tailings; that is something that is unique to uranium mining. I do not know of any other case in the world where a uranium mine has had a requirement placed on it that the tailings should be isolated from the environment for 10,000 years. God only knows how the company plans on achieving that but at least those requirements are there. Of course those requirements should apply to any company seeking to operate a uranium mine in Australia if that is indeed what we would consider world’s best practice. The same duty of care should relate overall.
In order to implement a 10,000-year monitoring program, which takes us back roughly to the establishment of agriculture—and these are the time lines that we need to be considering in proposals for uranium mines—a dedicated royalty stream will need to be quarantined over and above environmental bonds and so on that the companies may or may not be required to put aside. That is the subject of another amendment.
The resources and mandate of the Office of the Supervising Scientist should be expanded from only monitoring the Ranger uranium mine to providing oversight of all uranium mines in the Northern Territory. We know that they do have some role. They are called in on a case-by-case basis to consider uranium operations elsewhere including in South Australia. This should be mandatory and there are amendments here providing for that.
Finally, to minimise the possibilities of another Xstrata happening, the Greens believe that the NT government should receive support from the Commonwealth to review the figures provided by mining corporations to the Northern Territory government. I am certainly hoping for support from the National Party in this instance. Senator Joyce, who attended the committee hearings in Darwin, spoke out quite forcefully in this regard. The Australian Greens have moved to put those concerns and ours into legislative form, and that is what this amendment is about. It simply will not hurt to have the full weight of the Commonwealth in a double-checking of what mining companies are up to. In fact I think it will be well worth the expense for the Commonwealth to validate the claims made by mining companies so that we know the profits are not being hidden by the sort of behaviour that Xstrata was getting up to in the NT. I will leave it there. I will return to speak to the amendments at the committee stage when they are moved.",SENATE,<title>URANIUM ROYALTY (NORTHERN TERRITORY) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-09-08,"—The background of the Uranium Royalty (Northern Territory) Bill 2008 was thoroughly canvassed in the report on that bill by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I have read that report and, with respect, agree with the analysis of the evidence presented and the recommendation of the majority that the bill be passed in its current form. This legislation is vital to the uranium industry in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory holds, as Senator Minchin just indicated, 13 per cent of Australia’s uranium deposits. These resources are significant and they need to be carefully managed by the government to ensure that the uranium mining is done safely, efficiently and profitably.
As a South Australian senator I take particular interest in the mining industry because of its importance to my home state. Olympic Dam is located in South Australia’s far north and is the largest uranium mine in the world. The Beverley mine is also in operation and is the second largest uranium mine in Australia. The Honeymoon and Four Mile uranium mines will also begin commercial production in the future, which will further grow South Australia’s reputation as a reliable uranium exporter.
South Australia’s rise as a mining state did not happen overnight; it was the result of the South Australian government identifying mining as a priority in its strategic plan and proactively setting up a policy and regulatory framework to encourage mining investment. The South Australian example demonstrates how government policy can play a leading role in the development of mining industries. It is important for the government to clearly state its commitment to mining, to acknowledge the many benefits of mining and to put in place consistent and responsible laws governing the operation of mines to ensure that they are safe and provide a benefit to both the community and investors.
This legislation simplifies uranium mining in the Northern Territory. It does so by mirroring the Northern Territory’s Mineral Royalty Act 1982. The Northern Territory government will administer the legislation on behalf of the Commonwealth. The bill also provides some consistency to the royalty scheme so that mines that produce different minerals will need to adhere to just one taxation scheme, which will provide more certainty for investors. Polymetallic mining operations will benefit the most from these changes because they will be operating under a consistent set of rules rather than having to negotiate multiple regulatory systems. It will allow these mines to focus on mining and not on the complexities of the Northern Territory and Commonwealth legal systems.
Australia has the world’s largest supply of uranium. In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics the Executive Director of the Australian Uranium Association, Mr Michael Angwin, predicted that production of uranium would increase from the current level of 10,000 tonnes per year to 30,000 or 40,000 tonnes per year by the year 2030 as a result of rising world demand for energy. While I acknowledge that the global financial crisis has put the brakes on world economic growth for the moment, the demand for energy is predicted to continue to increase substantially. Asia is catching up with the industrialised world and its economic progress will significantly increase demand for Australia’s energy resources. Australia has the world’s largest supply of uranium at a time when world demand for energy is expected to increase exponentially. This will present many opportunities for Australia. As a nation we should develop the situation by laying the foundation for the world’s best practice when it comes to uranium mining.
The Australian Labor Party has been cautious in the past when it has come to the mining of uranium, and rightly so. It is a hazardous material and needs to be managed carefully so that it can be used responsibly for the benefit of the world. I understand that the coalition are supporting the government’s bill, as Senator Minchin indicated, but of course they have taken the opportunity to attack Labor’s record on uranium mining as being inconsistent. These accusations are untrue. When it comes to mining uranium, it is critical that the appropriate safeguards are put in place. The opposition points to the Hawke government’s three-mine policy and the current Labor government’s refusal to export uranium to India because they have not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as evidence that Labor is not committed to Australia’s uranium industry. I can point not only to this legislation but also to the expansion of uranium mining in my home state of South Australia to prove that these critics are wrong.
The opposition accuse the government of being cautious when it comes to exporting uranium, and they might have a point. When it comes to uranium, mistakes can prove to be very costly. Labor’s policy is unapologetically pro-exporting of uranium but this issue requires the government to show leadership and overcome legitimate concerns in the community about the export of uranium. Many people in the community—and I am sure that the Greens would proudly claim to be amongst them—are opposed to uranium mining under any circumstances. If it were up to them, Australia’s mining export industry would be banned and the substantial wealth generated from these mining operations would be lost. Of course, that would be the practical effect of Senator Ludlam’s first amendment. They keep an eagle eye on Australia’s uranium industry, scanning for even the slightest adverse consequence from mining uranium to use to bolster their cause.
The Australian government is showing not just the people of Australia but also the world that it is committed to setting the world’s best practice standard when it comes to successfully exporting uranium. The fact that the Liberals complain that the government is not going far enough and that the Greens complain it has gone too far is just more evidence that the Labor Party occupies the middle ground on this issue. We support the legislation and oppose the amendments of Senator Ludlam.

While 14 per cent of Labor seats missed out on any funding for science and language centres, 25 per cent of coalition seats—nearly twice as many—missed out.

—Answer the question!
—Order!
—In regard to the 537 science and language centres that the government is now supporting through its funding, the decision of the Minister for Education was based on advice she received from an independent panel established to assess the application submitted by a secondary school, based on a number of criteria set out in the BER guidelines. The education minister agreed to the list of projects as they were recommended by the independent panel. The education minister has never spoken to panel members about their selection. The panel’s recommendations were adopted without amendment. This is an outstanding result for schools across the country receiving funding that was neglected under the previous government. At the same time as that, the employment—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Sessional orders require that answers be directly relevant. The minister was asked a very specific question as to whether the government or the department undertook its own analysis of funding these centres by electorate. The answer is either yes or no and he should now be required, given that he has only 30 seconds left, to actually answer that question.
—On the point of order, Mr President: this is clearly a spurious point of order. Senator Arbib was asked a politically charged question. He has sought to outline the proper public processes that were put in train. He is directly answering the question by outlining the appropriate and proper processes that applied to these grants. There is no point of order.
—Mr President, before you rule on the point of order, could I ask you to take into account the fact that, although you cannot instruct a minister how to answer a question, you do have an obligation to enforce the sessional orders. Therefore, you do have an obligation to ensure that the minister is directly relevant. With respect, it is no answer to that to say, ‘I can’t tell the minister how to answer the question.’ With respect, you are obliged to ensure that he is directly relevant. That is a judgment, Mr President, you must make. With respect to this question, the minister was asked whether a particular fact occurred or did not. It is within your capacity and obligation, if you are going to enforce the sessional orders, to ensure that the answer is directly relevant.
—Mr President, on the point of order: the minister has been directly relevant in answering the question. It is not a case that a politically charged question or a question that is framed for a yes or no answer requires the minister to answer yes or no. The minister can be directly relevant to the question by ensuring that if it is necessary to reject the proposition—the proposition is rejected by the questioner—and the answer is given as to what the framework and process is, then that is being directly relevant to the question.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There are others participating when I need to listen to Senator Ludwig’s point of order.
—I did think that the second point that Senator Brandis raised in relation to the obligation to import skated very close to calling your judgment, your decision, into account. But what the ruling does do—and what you are entitled to do, I humbly submit—is indicate whether or not the particular minister is responding to the question. My understanding of the response you have provided is that it does, in fact, do that. It is not a question of ruling whether the minister has indicated yes or no to the particular question; it is about whether the minister is being directly relevant to the question in his answer. The answer does not call in to question whether the minister has responded yes or no. To be directly relevant to the question, the minister—
—Order! You are now debating the question. On the point of order: I remind senators we are still have a sessional order trialling this system. I understand that completely. I also understand that the minister has 32 seconds remaining. I believe the minister is answering the question. It might not be in the way in which it is desired to be answered by those who ask the question—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! I cannot force a minister to answer a question in a particular way. I can draw the minister’s attention to the question and I can ask the minister to address the question. But I cannot tell the minister, nor can I endeavour to elicit a particular answer from a minister that a questioner might like to hear. I draw to the minister’s attention the fact that he has 32 seconds remaining to answer the question and I ask the minister to continue.
—They have not heard of ‘independent assessment’, because in their time in government it did not exist. It did not exist. When a minister stands up and talks about an independent assessment, they get a bit surprised because they have never heard about that before. It was all the ministers making the decisions in those days, and we know they were all political decisions. I am advised that the department did not consider electorates or any analysis prior to the decisions being made.

In relation to funding, Senator Eggleston has raised a number of issues, so I am going to put on record that there are $800 million in this program. And when you do a partisan, party political analysis, the ALP gets across the country 53 per cent of the funding—shock, horror. But guess what? When you actually look at how many MPs we have, 55 per cent of the members in the House of Representatives receive 53 per cent of the funding. (Time expired)

Of that $800 million, 53 per cent went to Labor electorates—remembering that 55 per cent of members of the House of Representatives are Labor. It was 53 per cent funding for 55 per cent. The coalition seats received 41 per cent of the funding across the country and you make up 42.6 per cent of the House of Representatives.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-09-08,"—During question time, Senator Bob Brown asked me a series of important questions but, because of the constraints of our sessional orders and the serious nature of the questions, I was only able to answer one part of the last question that Senator Brown asked me, which went to the issue of the proposed UN conference requested by Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Brown. The other issue related to civilian casualties, and I just wanted to briefly respond to that now, because I think it is critically important.
I can inform the Senate that of course I am very much aware of reporting that there was an air strike in Kunduz province on 4 September which appears to have resulted in civilian casualties. ISAF have reported that they are undertaking an investigation into the incident, and that investigation is running its course as we speak.
I can assure Senator Bob Brown that the Australian government takes the issue of civilian casualties seriously. I can assure him that I do. Australia’s rules of engagement are specifically designed to avoid civilian casualties and to avoid damage to civilian infrastructure but also of course to provide a maximum level of protection to our troops. I share the strong view with many that the death of any civilians and noncombatants during any conflict is very regrettable.
I think it is important to note that the Taliban insurgents continue to employ tactics that place innocent Afghans at high risk, by choosing to launch attacks from heavily populated areas, and I stress, as I have said so many times in this chamber, that Afghanistan remains a dangerous place; that Uruzgan province, where we operate, is both dangerous and challenging; and that we must remember, as we address these important issues, that we face an enemy who, as I have said before and I stress again to the Senate, is ruthless and determined.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,6,1,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2009-09-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment Participation (Senator Arbib) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ryan, Eggleston and Payne today.
Over the last few days, there has been much discussion in this chamber, in the other place and in the media about the application of funding under various aspects of the Labor stimulus program. I am not going to talk in a more general sense about the stimulus program—that will be covered by my colleagues—but I will address some of these facts that have been in the public domain. The reason this has been in the public domain is that Labor has form. There is good reason for the public to doubt Labor’s claims that funds are applied in a fair and transparent way. Those who have been around this place a long time will remember the whiteboard. Those in states that have, unfortunately, been governed by the Labor Party will know that when independent panels are quoted by the Labor Party it is often a veil of independence to cover a politically motivated program.
It took the Minister for Employment Participation a while to come back to this chamber and outline that the panel’s advice with respect to the Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools program had been followed. But the minister could not confirm whether there had been any discussion between either his office and the panel or between the responsible minister’s office and the panel about this funding program. Those questions need to be answered. The question we have today is: why on earth do these numbers betray such a political agenda? I will quote a few of these numbers for the benefit of the record. Under the science and language centres program, Labor marginal seats receive on average $1 million more than coalition seats. Inner metropolitan seats held by Labor receive an extraordinary 3½ times as much as the same type of seat held by the coalition—$3.5 million compared with just under $1 million each on average. Labor seats in outer metropolitan areas receive almost double the amount coalition seats receive—$5.6 million to $2.9 million—and when all metropolitan seats across Australia are considered the bias in favour of government held seats is more than doubled: $4.4 million to $2.1 million. Australia is a relatively homogeneous country and when like is being compared with like there are very serious questions to be answered about how any panel could come to such an extraordinary differential in applying funding for schools.
Despite the much smaller number of seats held in rural Australia, we also see a bias there in favour of the government. Government held rural seats receive just under $9.6 million, with coalition seats receiving a little over $9.3 million each on average. The bias is comprehensive and begs an answer. When we consider marginal seats in the state of Queensland, the numbers are again extraordinary and defy belief if we believe what the government has to say. Nine government held marginal seats in the state of Queensland receive on average just over $8.1 million each, whereas seven coalition held marginal seats in the same state receive just under $5.2 million each. On average, government held marginal seats in the state of Queensland receive nearly $3 million more than their coalition counterparts. In my home state of Victoria, the bias is again quite extraordinary: every single government held seat received funding under the program, whereas just under one in five non-Labor seats missed out entirely. Of metropolitan seats in Victoria, coalition held electorates received an average of $2 million each and Labor held electorates received an average of $6.5 million each. These numbers come from the government’s own figures, and the classifications of seats are the same as those used by the Australian Electoral Commission. We have read in today’s Australian Financial Review that the community infrastructure program has also seen a similar level of bias in its application of funding around Australia.
The Labor Party has long had form on this—a leopard does not change its spots. Whether it hides behind a veil of independence does not change the fact that the numbers tell us something. The numbers tell us that money is being spent in Labor held seats at the expense of the rest of the community. Everyone pays taxes, but not everyone receives the benefit. This is a stimulus program for the Labor Party, not a stimulus program for Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2009-09-08,"—I rise in response to Senator Ryan’s motion to take notice of answers today in question time. What is not accepted by the opposition in this place at this time is that these decisions have been made at arm’s length from the government. They will not accept that. They prefer to accept the allegation that more of the funding has gone into Labor held seats, which is not correct. Assessments have been made by an independent panel at arm’s length from this government—something that the previous government did not do. All I need do is cite the rural and regional grants paid through the area consultative committees as an example. The grants were controlled entirely by the minister, dished out entirely according to where or where not their members in marginal seats had been re-elected at the previous election. The coalition government had a grants program allocated through the area consultative committees. The minister kept a stranglehold on them in his office, where they were vetted absolutely by ministerial staff and the minister and where they were given out absolutely according to where they could curry the most favour with those in the electorate.
If we have a look here at two of the programs I assume that the opposition are talking about, the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program provided funding to every—every—council and shire in this country. Under the $800 million community infrastructure program the government is delivering funding to every council regardless of their political persuasion and regardless of what sort of political electorate representative they have. Let us get this very clear here. It is being delivered to every council and shire in this country regardless of the electorate. Fifty-three per cent of the stimulus was directed to Labor held electorates but in fact Labor MPs actually comprised 55 per cent of the House of Representatives. So again, every council and shire in the country received funding from the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, the largest ever federal investment in local infrastructure.
Three of the top four grants were provided to coalition electorates, so it flies in the face of anything that we have heard from people on the other side of the chamber this afternoon. Three of the four largest single project grants are in coalition electorates. What are they? The safe Liberal seat of Moncrieff received the largest single grant of $36 million towards a new 25,000-seat AFL and sports stadium at Carrara. Where is the bias in that? It is nowhere. There is fairness and accountability in this.
Einasleigh River in Kennedy, which is held by the Independent member Bob Katter, got $18 million. Then we have the Flinders Street Mall in Townsville, which is in the seat of Herbert, another coalition held electorate, $16.2 million. There is the Goulburn River High Country Rail Trail in the seat of Indi, held by Mrs Mirabella, and the electorate of McEwen, which received $13.2 million. Again, four of the largest projects handed out are actually in coalition seats. So you cannot stand up on the other side of the chamber and allege that there is some gerrymandering of money being handed out—a cash splash—to Labor seats under this government. The figures defy that and show otherwise.
In a state by state breakdown, in New South Wales the total amount of funding was $138.5 million. Sixty-five per cent of the money is going to Labor seats, and Labor has 50 per cent of the seats. In coalition and other seats we have $47.2 million. So if we want to have a look at what is happening with this funding, we can see that the majority of seats that have the largest grants are coalition held seats.
If we go to the questions from Senator Ryan today about the science and language centres, again and again this opposition has been told that an independent panel has made that assessment. The BER guidelines were released in February. They stated that DEEWR would convene an independent assessment panel, which they did. That panel looked at the criteria and made recommendations.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-09-08,"—Over the last two question times we have witnessed skills which I think indicate that Senator Arbib would be a gun skier—and I will explain what I mean. The minister was asked a series of questions by Senator Ryan in relation to the science and language component of the BER. He was asked if Labor held metropolitan seats received double the amount of coalition held metropolitan seats. He was asked if Labor held marginals received on average $1 million more than coalition marginals. He was asked if any electorate by electorate analysis was undertaken by the minister’s office during project assessment.
There were no answers. Senator Arbib treated Senator Ryan’s questions as a slalom course to be negotiated, and it is clear why. The truth is the government’s stimulus package is not about economic strength; it is about political strength. It was all about being seen to be doing something regardless of effects. That is why the Senator Arbib and the government cannot answer how many jobs will be created from the $14 billion school spend. They cannot answer because they do not know. They do not know because they did not ask. And they did not ask because they were not interested. The purpose of the spend was to be seen to be doing something. It was there as a cover for a bit of old-fashioned pork-barrelling.
It is not about securing an economic dividend. It is about securing a political dividend. Efficacy was the last consideration. Look at the pink batts. Look at the bike paths. I think that Chris Berg from the Institute of Public Affairs put it well when he came up with a new definition for the noun ‘stimulus’. He defined it as ‘a huge amount of money spent on any old crap’. I think that is the best definition I have heard of this program to date.
Mr Deputy President, I know that I am depressing you so I will endeavour to lift your spirits. There is good news. Australia is faring better than had been expected and it is instructive to look at the Reserve Bank governor’s statement on monetary policy from 4 August which makes clear why Australia is faring better than other comparable nations. He cites five reasons. The first is the strength of the Australian financial system—nothing to do with the current government. He cites the significant monetary stimulus from the reduced cash rate—nothing to do with the current government. He cites the depreciation of the exchange rate in 2008—nothing to do with the current government. He cites China’s strong economic recovery—nothing to do with the current government. His fifth and final citation is the government’s fiscal stimulus, and the question I ask is: okay, but how much effect and at what cost? I would contend at great cost and with little effect.
It is important to appreciate the limits of fiscal stimulus. Fiscal stimulus can only make a difference at the margins. If Australia were headed for a deep and prolonged recession, no amount of stimulus would prevent that. If Australia is going to avoid a deep and prolonged recession—as it looks likely to—it will not be because of Labor’s stimulus; it will be because of the other four elements cited by the Reserve Bank governor. I must say that the governor was both modest and politic in his statement.
We contend that the stimulus should have been smaller and better targeted. That is what we have argued. To continue the planned spend will plunge the budget further into deficit and debt. We know that to continue to spend will push up interest rates. We know that to continue to spend will continue the greatest electoral rort in Australian political history. This is a rort that must end. This is a rort that must stop. It is good news that the Auditor-General is already investigating one element of this rort—the schools spending package.
The government frequently ask: how would you curtail this economic stimulus? I have a few ideas. Look at the pink batts, the bike paths and the excessive $14 billion spent on schools. It is not too late for the government to think again. They can save Australia from a future of deficit and debt. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2009-09-08,"—As tempted as I am to address the childcare issue on this occasion, I will focus on the language and science centres issue that Senator Fifield addressed at first but then strayed well away from. I say to Senator Fifield: do not try skiing, because you are lacking the snow. Senator Ryan’s questions about which electorates got what, how they compare and what the overall comparison really meant demonstrate that what the previous government did in terms of pork-barrelling has not been applied in this case. The attempts of the opposition to overlay a crass political assessment to these programs is laughable.
Senator Fifield referred to the opposition’s position in relation to our stimulus. Their view is that we should have spent less and it should have been more targeted. He forgot the critical component. The critical component was that our response needed to be timely. Our economic circumstances are where they are today because our response was timely. Our spending in schools was part of that timely, very critical and important response. It was the need for timeliness that encouraged the Rudd government to invest in infrastructure in schools, where this phase of our overall response could be rolled out relatively quickly.
It is important to repeat what Senator Arbib said in question time today. He said, ‘I am advised that the list of fully costed projects deemed by the independent national assessment panel to be highly suitable or suitable was adopted by the government.’ The independent panel determined which fully costed projects were highly suitable or suitable under established criteria, and the government accepted those recommendations. Let us look at what those criteria were.
The criteria for assessment did not include electorates. This is the opposition’s crass political overlay. That is what has informed, unfortunately, the media attention in the last day or so and the discussion in this chamber—their crass overlay. The answers about exactly which electorates got what are not immediately available for some very good reasons, and I will go through some of them.
The applications were assessed by the national assessment panel against the following criteria in order of priority: demonstrated level of disadvantage—if there are more Labor members in electorates where there is a higher level of disadvantage, maybe that better informs the assessment that Senator Scott Ryan has done rather than who the sitting member is; identified and demonstrated need for the specified building—so which schools needed language and science centres; the capacity to build the facility within the specified time frames—again this is the critical issue of timeliness; the effective and efficient use of Commonwealth funding; and the extent to which the project incorporates sustainable building principles. Those were the criteria. Data on a school’s electorate was not collected and was not required as part of the application process. The national assessment panel did not consider electorates when making their recommendations. The brief to the Deputy Prime Minister with the recommendations did not include electorate information.
What we really have here, rather than this crass political overlay, is this government delivering 537 science and language centres in secondary schools across Australia, including more than 160 in regional and remote schools. This results in $821.8 million in funding for new or refurbished science laboratories and language learning centres to create state-of-the-art facilities in secondary schools across Australia.
I said Senator Fifield lacked snow. He lacked snow because his assessment—or, indeed, Senator Scott Ryan’s assessment—of which electorate got what, is not the relevant issue; the issue was our criteria: timeliness, disadvantage and need. We have met those criteria. Senator Fifield referred to the fact that the economy is doing very well. It is doing very well in Australia uniquely because we had an effective and timely response.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2009-09-08,"—I think it is important to correct that slight misperception of Senator Jacinta Collins when talking about the economy doing well in Australia. Any independent commentator or independent observer knows that the strength of the economy lies in the foundation that was laid down by the previous Treasurer, Peter Costello, and Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, over in excess of a decade of strong, effective, capable, competent political and economic management and experience, which is sadly lacking in this nation currently. I am also slightly struck by the irony of Senator Collins utilising the term ‘crass political overlay’, but let me not go there.
This afternoon I asked Senator Arbib a question in relation to the potential for increases in childcare costs as a result of the government’s so-called reform program in childcare. The basis of the question, a perfectly reasonable one, stems from the fact that the much vaunted childcare policy of those opposite that was forced down the throats of Australian parents for months and months in advance of the 2007 federal election—discussions I had the opportunity to enjoy on Friday afternoons with Senator Wong during the campaign on ABC radio about the radical plan to slash childcare costs—is proving to be, unsurprisingly, entirely unfounded. Not surprisingly, we look like we are about to have another broken promise from this government, this time in relation to child care. This time there will be more costs on Australian families, more impost on their already struggling family budgets in the current economic environment.
We have been asking for some time now—I have had the opportunity to pursue it myself with officers in estimates in this portfolio area—how the government was actually planning to achieve its reform plans without increasing costs. When you institute a series of reviews and a series of proposals to reform a sector, those participants in the sector—parents in particular, who have to bear the costs—are entitled to ask how those reforms are intended to be implemented without increasing costs. In relation to the minister’s response to me and interjections from those opposite at the time, it is no answer to say, ‘We have made a promise in relation to the childcare tax rebate.’ That is not an answer to the question, because, no matter what you do in relation to the childcare tax rebate, parents will still have to pay increases if fees go up. The commitment was to slash parents’ childcare costs. We were told it was very simple and that it was very plain. That was the commitment: to slash childcare costs.
How can that be the case if parents are going to expected to pay for just some of the reform program? Let me cite a number of those examples: the potential for increasing staff ratios in childcare centres, the proposal to ensure higher staff qualifications and the proposal to insist on higher standards in centres. How is it possible to pursue that reform program without increasing the costs that parents will face? I think Australian parents, those with children in childcare centres, are entitled to ask that question. In this place, it is on their behalf that members of the opposition put that question, quite reasonably, to the Minister representing the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth here this afternoon.
We also have, as I cited in my question to the minister, an independent economic analysis prepared on behalf of Childcare Queensland, which indicates in the independent modelling that the potential annual increase for a parent who has just one child in care could exceed $3,000 a year. That is not an insignificant amount. Any parent facing that sort of cost, that sort of challenge, would be asking themselves how they are going to pay for that. What we are asking—reasonably, I think, and fairly simply—is how the government expects families struggling in the current environment to meet a price increase like that and how the government expects childcare centres, in the face of some pretty indicting material in this piece of research, to deal with these challenges as well. There is a startling lack of information available to the opposition and most importantly available to parents, who have every right to ask how they are meant to respond to these propositions. They should have been more adequately consulted.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-09-08,"—I would like to begin by sharing with the chamber a cartoon by Moir in today’s Sydney Morning Herald. It is very illuminating. The New South Wales ALP is represented by a caricature of Premier Rees, who says, ‘Hey Kev! ... Remember me?! Your Sydney cousin ... Remember?’ A hastily moving Prime Minister is ducking into the back seat of a Commonwealth car, while saying to the chauffeur, ‘Step on it!’ Federal Labor is running a mile from their cousins in New South Wales Labor.
Recently, there was a motion of no confidence in the New South Wales parliament—why wouldn’t there be, given the soap opera that has now become the New South Wales government? The New South Wales government is kept on its feet by the New South Wales Labor Right. In his speech on that motion, the Leader of the Opposition articulated the litany of scandals and the broken promises that have been presided over by the New South Wales government. In New South Wales, we are seeing spectacle after spectacle of this government on a daily basis. Quite frankly, it is about time that New South Wales Labor put everybody in that state out of their misery and that we go to an election to enable the electors of New South Wales to change government.
State Labor in New South Wales is a catastrophe. It is so bad that it has become a gross embarrassment. It is tragic for the people of New South Wales and the people we represent in what has now become a failed state. Voters are naturally very upset about it. Of course, Kevin Rudd tries to distance himself from the New South Wales Labor Party but the Labor Party in New South Wales is the very well-organised machine which made him Prime Minister. Let us not forget that the Prime Minister is supported by the same right-wing faction in New South Wales Labor that runs the state. Minister Arbib is one of the key figures in it. Therefore, the group who is responsible for the catastrophe that is the Labor government, the train wreck, in New South Wales is the same group that put Kevin Rudd into the leadership—
—Order! Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you must refer to the Prime Minister by his proper name.
—I apologise, Mr Deputy President—that put Prime Minister Rudd into the leadership and that is his key supporter base.
As I said, it is important to remember what this well-oiled, disciplined machine is. They put Nathan Rees in, they put Bob Carr in and they have been running New South Wales for years and mismanaging it shockingly. Look at New South Wales today and you will see what this country will become after this Labor government has finished with it. An incompetent, mismanaged, corrupt Labor Party machine that has catastrophically failed in New South Wales for more than a decade will now go and do the same thing at a federal level.
Look at the toxicity of what we have now become. Labor’s failures in New South Wales are the most spectacular but Labor failures are all around the country. The so-called stimulus package was the classic example. The schools program was the most spectacular example of classic Labor Party spin and politics. They said that they wanted to put a lot of money into the economy and give support to the construction industry and tradies. Yet we know that what is actually happening is that schools are having the Julia Gillard memorial assembly halls foisted upon them, whether they want it or not. We know that the neediest schools are missing out and we know that local tradesmen and women are not getting the jobs. They are going to the large firms chosen by the state Labor governments.
When we were in power and the coalition had the vision of re-plumbing rural Australia so that we could produce more food and fibre with less water, there was an opportunity to put money back to do all this work. Of course it would have created jobs. It would have created jobs in regional New South Wales. But that would not have afforded the Labor Party the ribbon-cutting opportunities. Senator Heffernan would very much agree with this, given his keen interest in rural New South Wales. They chose not to do it because with school halls it has really become all about politics.
The most cynical result of this is that these signs that have been forced on schools—that they have to put up and keep there until after the election—will, funnily enough, be there on polling day. This will be the so-called gentle reminder that people should vote Labor back into power. As we know, the Australian Electoral Commission has said that this is a breach of the electoral provisions, so now we are going to spend millions of more dollars to put little signs at the bottom to rectify what was clearly—and, I have to say, I think intentionally—done. But time will tell whether that was in fact the case.
When the coalition was in power we had a very successful Investing in Our Schools program where we went to the school communities and we said, ‘Okay, what is it that you most want? What is it that you actually need?’ That is not like this government, which has told them that they are going to have their Julia Gillard memorial hall. We actually asked schools what they needed the most and met those needs. I am sorry that Senator Arbib is not here because I wanted to tell him that on one occasion when I was attending with a minister from New South Wales—and I will not mention the minister’s name—she said, ‘Thank goodness for the federal government’s Investing in Our Schools program because we could not fund the inadequate facilities that we have in schools.’ For example, in the Illawarra, where my electorate office is, there are some schools that have been there for more than 50 years and are asking the state government in New South Wales to rectify their toilets and the government has not done it. Instead of getting their toilets fixed, which is so important, they are going to get the Julia Gillard memorial hall whether they like it or not.
In the end, we are borrowing all this money and we are going into debt. This debt that we are incurring is being spent and not properly targeted. Every dollar and every cent of that $350 billion—and the rest, because we are kidding ourselves if we honestly think that Labor is going to stop at $350 billion—that we are borrowing will have to be repaid. It will have to be repaid by the taxpayers of Australia. This is short-term gain—which has been spun very effectively—for long-term pain. I say to those of you sitting in the gallery that you may or may not have got moneys now but you will certainly be paying for it. And to those listening to this broadcast: get ready, because you are going to be paying for many years to come.
When we do look at New South Wales, it was once the driving force of the Australian economy—
—It still is.
—Yes, Senator Hutchins, it is desperately lagging behind other states. The latest national accounts figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that New South Wales experienced only a five per cent growth in state final demand from the March to June quarter. New South Wales experienced lower growth than even the Victorian economy, which grew by three per cent. In further embarrassment to the New South Wales economy we find that it is also growing at a slower rate than the Tasmanian, Western Australian and South Australian economies.
As a result of the reckless mismanagement of the New South Wales economy, now federal Labor has been forced to intervene in what can only be described as the politically motivated spending spree. Every day we are seeing more and more examples of how Labor’s reckless and politically motivated spending is totally and utterly out of control. In turn, this will put pressure on interest rates and result in higher taxes.
Let us look at the $550 million in so-called community infrastructure grants. Earlier, in question time, we heard Senator Arbib fluffing and carrying on and not answering the question about this program because what is actually happening here is that the federal Labor government is coming in and helping New South Wales Labor by assisting predominantly Labor electorates. One only has to look at the article in today’s Financial Review which looks at infrastructure spending and asks where the $550 million of community infrastructure grants have gone. Interestingly enough, grants have gone to the federal seat of Robertson. We won’t go there! Robertson has become very famous, or infamous, as a consequence of the antics of its local member. Then there is Bennelong, another marginal Labor seat.
Government senators interjecting—
—Senator Ludwig, as the patron senator for Bennelong, I keep a very close eye on what happens in that seat.
Let us look at the government’s $200 million on campaign advertising despite pledges, when in opposition, to slash federal spending on advertising. There was a story today in the Australian. And, as I mentioned, let us look at the blatant and shameless political spending on school signs, which has been exposed by the Australian Electoral Commission as politically motivated. You are not even being subtle with the signage at the schools. In the Investing in Our Schools Program, we had little plaques put in discreet places at the school. But you have to have the big sign right in front of the school, right near the entrance to the school and right near the entrance to the polling booth. If that is what you think it is going to take at the next election for people to vote Labor and if you already feel desperate enough to have to put those signs up in schools, then maybe you have a problem.
You are pursuing this political strategy. You are borrowing more and more money to spend more and more money in marginal seats, thereby imposing an absolutely huge debt burden not only on this generation but on future generations. As I said, the real concern is that this reckless spending is going to result in higher taxes and higher interest rates.
In conclusion, I will say this in relation to New South Wales: what was once the premier state in this country has now been reduced to a soap opera. Every day we have been seeing the incompetence of Labor in New South Wales, but now we are going to see the spectacle of federal Labor—those very people who were in Sussex Street when New South Wales was sent to rack and ruin and who are now sitting here—going to bail them out.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>New South Wales Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2009-09-08,"—Listening to Senator Fierravanti-Wells reminds me—
—So now you can pronounce my name properly?
—So you understand me okay? Senator Fierravanti-Wells reminds me of a book that was very popular some years ago: Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. I do not know what planet you are on, but you are not on a planet that is anywhere near the reality of this planet. You are not on a planet that is anywhere near dealing with the needs of the Australian community.
What that speech demonstrated and encapsulated is the incompetence of the coalition. Here we are in a global economic crisis, and what do we have a New South Wales senator come and talk about? She talks about signage at schools in New South Wales—that is the level. That is the competence, or should I say incompetence, of Senator Fierravanti-Wells in her understanding of the economic challenges.
That speech was all about a diversion. It was a diversion from the trials and tribulations of the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull. That is what it was about. It was about trying to look elsewhere—anywhere other than at the working of the federal government and the needs of the community of Australia—in order to try and hide the incapacity and incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition. It was a diversion from the lack of policy that the opposition display day in, day out in the Senate. It was a diversion from the lack of leadership—no leadership on any of the big issues facing the Australian public. There was no leadership for a decade and we still do not get leadership from the opposition. It was a diversion from the splits and the disunity in the coalition.
You really do not have any capacity to come here and criticise a government that recognises the issues, takes on the challenges and deals with the problems that this community is facing in a decisive and effective way. So we get these diversions and these meanderings and this nonsense from Senator Fierravanti-Wells in her contribution. This really is a diversion from the coalition’s inability to understand the economic challenges facing Australia arising from the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Why don’t we hear the coalition talk about the international economy, about the challenges facing every government around the world? I will tell you why we do not hear about it: because the coalition is a rabble. The coalition is disunited. The coalition does not have any policies. The coalition has a weak and incapable leader. The Nationals are fighting with the Liberals. The Liberals do not like the Nationals. That is what we are faced with. The public look aghast at the lack of performance from the coalition. Senator Fierravanti-Wells encapsulated the incompetence, the lack of vision, the lack of economic understanding that the coalition perpetrates in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
What we have here is a coalition that are bitter. The coalition cannot accept that the Australian public had enough of them. The coalition are dispirited. They are squabbling with each other, fighting with each other—no vision, no plan, no strategy ever to lead this country. They are a coalition that are isolated from reality, never talking about the real issues that are affecting Australian working families and Australian communities. So the diversions flow continually. The diversions are there because you have no alternatives—no alternative leader, no alternative policies and no alternative to a decisive, effective Labor government. That is the problem that we face with the coalition in this country.
I want to go back to what I said earlier. When the coalition were in government we had a decade of lost opportunities. The money was flowing into the economy because of our terms of trade and our mineral exports. The terms of trade had never been better. It was like a government winning the biggest lotto in the world. And yet what did you do with it? You did nothing, absolutely nothing. You absolutely failed to build for the future. You absolutely failed in a range of the key economic issues that build the economy, and you left this economy ill-prepared for the biggest economic recession since the Great Depression. That decade of failure was a failure of investment. Less than two-thirds of profits ever went back into investment to provide the machinery, to provide the technology for new jobs in this country. That was your failure, a failure of investment.
It was a failure of innovation. We hear much about innovation and research and development, but where were we in the decade under the Howard government? The fourth-bottom of the OECD. That is where we were in terms of investment in research and development and innovation—1.7 per cent of GDP in research and development, the fourth-bottom of the OECD. Productivity, despite this Work Choices, despite Senator Minchin going to the HR Nicholls Society, prostrating himself and saying, ‘I’m sorry we didn’t do more; I’m sorry we didn’t take more workers’ rights away—we’ll do better next time. I really apologise to the HR Nicholls Society,’ productivity was below par in the OECD.
It was a failure of development: elaborately transformed manufactured exports declined under the Howard government. Don’t come here talking about economic credentials and bad economic decisions. It was a decade of incompetence from the Howard government. It was a failure in competitiveness: we were less competitive under the Howard government. It was a failure of balance: $30 billion went from wages to profits under the Howard government. Infrastructure development declined from six per cent of GDP to 3.9 per cent of GDP.
And the coalition failed on sustainability, the biggest challenge facing governments around the world. On dealing with global warming, dealing with climate change, they were a complete failure. The coalition continue to be a failure on climate change policy. At each others throats, divided, the deniers there do not want to do anything about global warming. They are an absolute rabble.
And that is just the decade of the Howard government. No wonder the Australian public had enough of you. No wonder the Australian public said, ‘We want better than this; we want a government that will take the decisions to take this country forward into the future.’ And that is what they got. When they elected the Rudd government the public got a government that was prepared to deal with the challenges of the global economic crisis, challenges that laid out a decline of $210 billion in taxation receipts; nine out of 10 of our trading partners in recession; the world economy contracting by 1½ per cent; advanced economies contracting by 3¾ per cent; unemployment around the world going up, to 10 per cent in some states of the USA; wealth destroyed around the world; confidence down around the world—and yet what do we get from Senator Fierravanti-Wells? ‘We don’t like the signs on the schools.’ I think the Australian public deserve better from the coalition. The sooner you change your leader, the sooner you have a leader who can actually provide some leadership, who can provide some direction for you, the better—because being an uncoordinated rabble without the capacity to develop policy leads to speeches like that of Senator Fierravanti-Wells, where you do not deal with the real issues, where you do not deal with unemployment for Australians, where you do not deal with communities facing the global economic crisis.
This is the problem; a dispirited, ineffectual, incompetent coalition. An example just wandered past me right now. This is the problem that we have, leaving this country ill-prepared for the global economic crisis. But the Labor government moved quickly and we moved decisively. What we have done is to stimulate demand to keep more than 210,000 Australians in work. What do we hear from the coalition, out there on Planet Zog somewhere, arguing about who is going to be the next leader? That is the biggest debate in the coalition: who is going to be the next leader.
Yet the ACCI came out and said basically do not withdraw the economic stimulus, that any sudden withdrawal of the stimulus would have a negative effect on the economy. The coalition do not hear this. You do not even listen to your former allies. You do not listen to business, you do not listen to the trade union movement, you do not listen to the Australian community. All you do is fight amongst yourselves, squabble and bicker. You cannot find a seat for Senator Joyce in the House of Representatives. He wants to go there. You want to fight about that. You want to fight about neo-liberalism. You want to defend neo-liberalism. You want to let the market rip, not worry about what it does to communities. Let us not learn the lessons of the global financial crisis; just let neo-liberalism rip. Do not let the government intervene in the interests of the economy. That is ready the basis of the problems with the coalition. They are a dispirited, disunited rabble with no policies, no leader, absolutely incompetent and not available to be an alternative government for this country.
What have the Labor Party done? We have looked after pensioners. We have put economic stimulus in place. We have looked at infrastructure. We will build the rail system of the future. We will build the road system of the future. We will build the schools of the future, the universities of the future, the things that a coalition government should have done during your 10 years of incompetence and inaction.
What did you say when we were facing the global financial crisis? ‘Let us wait and see what happens.’ Yet the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, every economist of any standing was saying now is the time for government to intervene, to make sure that unemployment does not go through the roof, so that a depression does not come on, so that working families are not destroyed because of inaction of government. What did we get from the coalition? We got carping, inane criticism that has no resonance in the community. That is why the coalition will be a coalition in opposition for years to come, because you do not have any answers for the Australian public. You do not have a vision for the Australian public. You do not have any heart and you do not have any mind to deal with the problems and challenges that Australia faces. The Rudd government have delivered, the Rudd government will still deliver. We are not out of the woods yet. We have problems and we will deal with them. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-09-08,"—I must comment on one of Senator Cameron’s remarks, where he talked about an ‘effective Labor government’. To me that is an oxymoron. We are talking about the New South Wales government, the ‘premier state’. That was what its title was, has been and hopefully will be after March 2011. The situation in New South Wales is that 500 people a week pack up and move out of the state. I suppose Senator Cameron is proud of the way his colleagues are running the state of New South Wales.
Prior to the last election we had 50 federal seats in New South Wales and just 28 in Queensland. Of course, one was taken off us, the seat of Gwydir. We went down to 49, and Queensland went up to 29 because people are moving out. They would not have a bar of Labor and the way they were managing the state of New South Wales. What happens now? The move keeps on and New South Wales is about to go down to 48 seats, while Queensland goes up to 30. The Rees government—and those of his predecessors, Mr Iemma and Mr Carr—have had a policy to drive people out of the state. That is a fact and the AEC can confirm that.
Let us go back to the Labor Party and Bob Carr. He will halve our elective surgery lists. Have a look at them now. He will lead the greenest government the state has ever seen. They have become the blackest government because of the way they have locked up national parks, have not managed them, have let the fuel levels increase, after lightning strikes they burn, the fire kills the trees, kills the animals and they call it conservation. I call it destruction and we are seeing more and more of it. Now it is going to continue because we have the Labor government in Canberra combined with the Labor government in New South Wales buying places like Toorale Station and locking it up for national parks—90,000 hectares, 225,000 acres. That will be the next fireball we will see in a few years time and you call it conservation.
I want to have a look at the history of what we have seen in the last 14 years of Labor in New South Wales. I mentioned Mr Carr; he knew when to jump off the ship, didn’t he? Then along came Mr Iemma. He did not change anything at all. He had been the health minister. New South Wales has had four ministers in the health portfolio in the last four years. They are just getting removed, sacked or resigning for whatever reason.
That is the way you are running your health system. It all started with the outrageous super health boards that you introduced. For 100 years local volunteers could run our health system, could run our hospitals, and then along came Mr Genius and did away with them. Look at the mess they are in now. We have just seen a situation in Gilgandra and Coonabarabran where meat could not be supplied to the hospitals because the bills were not being paid by the New South Wales Labor government. Small business finally said: ‘Enough is enough. We’re not giving you any more credit.’ I suppose some over there are proud of that management. I would be disgusted with it.
Only a couple of weeks ago I had the privilege to be with the current—hang on; I have got that wrong; I should say past—health minister, Mr John Della Bosca, when he opened the hospitals at Bingara and Warialda. He was cosying up very closely with his Independent colleagues Mr Torbay and Mr Windsor. A great coalition they are; one supports the other. Mr Torbay got given the Speaker’s position as a way of saying, ‘Thanks for the way you attack the National Party at each election.’ You notice the Independent Mr Torbay never goes after the Labor Party. He only campaigns against the National Party. But that is to be expected because he was a member of the Labor Party till 1997. He was warden of the Student Union at the University of New England, so we know what colour his politics are.
So we were standing there, opening the hospitals, and there was not a mention of John Anderson, the former member for Gwydir, who guaranteed the money to see that those hospitals were built. The situation at Warialda prior to that, 10 years ago, was that there was going to be a nine-to-five hospital. You call that running the health system? This is the Labor Party in charge of rural health. It was a disgrace. There were no thankyous to those who actually got the money for it.
So let us move along and look at the management of New South Wales. We have seen people jump ship. Mr Iemma called the troops together and said, ‘Behave yourselves or you’re gone.’ They replied, ‘Sorry, you’re gone.’ And off went Mr Iemma. Off went Reba Meagher. The next thing was that Treasurer Costa pulled up stumps and did the bolt. We could go back through the history of them all. There is a list of them. Mr Orkopoulos is looking at striped sunlight for his activities. Look at Matt Brown; he was sacked. Look at Tony Stewart—dumped from his position. On and on it goes. And these are the Labor Party people, from Sussex Street, Sydney, who are running the state of New South Wales. No doubt this will flow on through to Canberra.
We have a situation here where you are going on a spending spree of $16 billion to build buildings in schools. Who is responsible for buildings in schools? It is the state government’s responsibility. What do we have here? We have the federal government propping up the states for their failure to deliver proper infrastructure in education right throughout Australia.
In the meantime, there is one sector that has been neglected terribly, and that is aged care. Aged-care facilities are actually a federal responsibility. There is a little place at Bundarra, 40 kilometres south of Inverell, called the Grace Munro Centre. In only a few weeks time that aged-care facility will close. That is the way you are looking after aged-care facilities. What money did you put into your stimulus package to look after aged care? The answer is not a cent. It is your responsibility to look after the elderly. The Medicare rebate for the removal of cataracts is to be cut down to $300. I think a veterinary surgeon charges $2,000 to $3,000 to remove a cataract from a dog, and you expect an eye specialist to remove a human cataract for $300. It is outrageous! But this is your care for the elderly.
You go and pour the money into schools to prop up your failing states, especially New South Wales, and neglect the very thing we must address first, and that is looking after our elderly. They are the very people who gave us this nation in the condition it is in now. They are the ones who fought in the wars, the ones who worked hard. And what are we doing? Closing their facilities. Recently 8,000 beds were issued and there were only 5,000 take-ups because the providers know very well that the money they get for aged-care nursing does not cover the cost of running the facilities. This is a big part of your negligence in the Labor Party: you will not look after our elderly.
I could go on and on, but I would just like to say that the Labor government in New South Wales are a disgrace. They have neglected the people of New South Wales, especially those in regional areas. No doubt everyone in New South Wales is looking at them and saying, ‘Bring on March 2011.’ No doubt the policies will flow on to Canberra.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>New South Wales Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2009-09-08,"—It is indeed interesting to follow Senator Williams in this matters of public importance debate. I think his state member is currently an Independent. After the next election, probably his federal member will be an Independent. Senator Heffernan is next to speak. He is one of the champions of the Liberal Party. His state member is a National Party member and his federal member is a National Party member.
—My state member happens to be Adrian Piccoli.
—Yes, and he is National Party, isn’t he? That is the point I am making.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Hutchins, you will direct your comments through the chair.
—I will. After the next federal election, I think the National Party might be almost without representation in New South Wales, except for possibly in the Riverina, where Mr Heffernan, despite his best efforts, will still have a National Party—
—Order! You will refer to colleagues by the correct name.
—Senator Heffernan will still have a National Party member of federal parliament representing him.
We are confronting serious times. Indeed, a number of the speeches today have outlined some difficulties that governments are experiencing. But I want to commence my remarks by talking about an event that occurred in Sydney last Friday evening. The event was held at a restaurant called Le Montage, I think, in Leichhardt. Senator Faulkner may be able to help me here. We often hold Labor Party functions at that restaurant.
—Which one?
—Le Montage, in Leichhardt.
—The old Apia Club.
—Yes, the old Apia Club. It is not a bad venue for a reception. At a reception there last Friday night there was a guest speaker for a gathering of some of the most right-wing, extremist members of the New South Wales Liberal Party—people associated with David Clarke. I do not know whether Senator Heffernan was there or not. I asked whether Senator Fierravanti-Wells attended, but she did not. I am not sure if any other federal MPs were there.
Senator Cory Bernardi was the guest speaker for this 200-plus gathering of New South Wales Liberal Party extremists. I am not sure whether there was any sort of warm-up speech before Senator Bernardi made his contribution, but I understand that the occasion was to support the preselection of the extreme right wing candidate or one of the candidates in the forthcoming Bradfield electorate by-election. When Senator Bernardi commenced his address, to the delight of the crowd, I understand, he said—and I have this from a person who I understand was at the dinner—

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Senator Heffernan may be able to correct me when he gets up to speak, because he may have been at the dinner. I am not sure whether Senator Heffernan is in the extreme right wing faction of the Liberal Party or one of the combatants, but it was definitely the David Clarke group in the New South Wales Liberal Party. This also highlights exactly what Senator Cameron was talking about earlier. This is, I understand, how Senator Bernardi commenced his remarks. He said: ‘I wandered into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting thinking it was a Liberal Party meeting. I said, “My name is Cory Bernardi, and I haven’t had a left-wing thought for 27 years and no-one in the Labor Party has ever approached me to join it!”‘ That apparently brought the house down.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The MPI we are discussing is:
The need for the Federal Government to intervene, by way of wasteful spending to compensate for the policy failures of the New South Wales Labor Government.
Even on a very liberal interpretation of relevance, I fail to see how what Senator Hutchins is saying—that is, what Senator Bernardi allegedly said to a private gathering at a restaurant in Sydney which Senator Hutchins asserts had to do with internal Liberal Party affairs—has anything whatsoever to do with the MPI, and I invite you to rule it irrelevant.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I listened very carefully to Senator Brandis’s erudite point of order but unfortunately I believe that there is no point of order. It would have had a great deal more credibility if he had taken a similar point of order while Senator Williams was raging against the New South Wales Labor Party in his speech. You have got to be consistent in these things, just a bit of give and take. As I say, there would be a great deal more credibility about this point of order if other speakers in the debate had not strayed into these sorts of areas. From my own point of view, I am listening very closely to what Senator Hutchins is saying. I must say I am finding it extremely interesting—just as I found Senator Williams’s comments very interesting as well. So I am asking for consistency in rulings from the chair in this regard, and I look forward to your ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: that would of course be relevant for you to look at if indeed there had been a point of order taken during Senator Williams’s speech. But, as Senator Brandis quite rightly indicated, you have been asked to rule on the matters that have been referred to by Senator Hutchins—and, quite frankly, what Senator Williams said is old news.
 (Senator Barnett)—I am willing to make a ruling. Prior to you standing to take a point of order, Senator Brandis, I was reading the wording of the matter of public importance, which does say, and I repeat it for the sake of the Senate:
The need for the Federal Government to intervene, by way of wasteful spending to compensate for the policy failures of the New South Wales Labor Government.
I listened intently to Senator Williams and believe that his comments were in order. I draw Senator Hutchins’s attention to the motion. Matters of public importance are dealt with in a liberal manner, and I will continue with that convention for the time being, but I draw your attention to the fact that I will be listening intently to your comments, Senator Hutchins.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I appreciate your comments. I do want to go back to what I was saying, which was the alleged statement by Senator Bernardi which apparently brought the house down—that is, 200-plus extreme right wingers all gathered to basically ‘burn’ the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Malcolm Turnbull. That is what it was all about. You do not need to be a Rhodes scholar to work out that Senator Bernardi was referring to Mr Turnbull’s previous acquaintance with maybe the Left of politics, his previous desire to be a member of the Labor Party, his association with us—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I repeat my point of order on relevance. This is now a commentary on the prior political career or history of Mr Turnbull. It cannot possibly be even indirectly relevant to the topic.
—Senator Hutchins, I draw your attention to the wording of the matter of public importance and ask you to relate your comments in some way to that reference.
—I will get to the point in a moment, unless I am prevented from doing so by being interrupted. As I was saying, this was a light-hearted attack, at a gathering of 200 extremists of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, on their federal leader. He was never going to be a federal Labor leader, George!
—Order! You will refer to senators in this place by their correct titles. Senator Hutchins, you referred to Senator Brandis—
—Sorry, Senator Brandis.
—It could have been any ‘George’!
—Please refer to Senator Brandis in the correct manner.
—I will. Senator Brandis, he never was going to end up being our leader, I can tell you. As Senator Cameron said—without interruption—this demonstrates again the lack of policy, the lack of direction and the lack of leadership of the coalition currently. We have seen the twists and turns they have done over the last 12 months. They are finding it very difficult to be an opposition. As I said, you only have to look at their twists and turns.
I want to go further with what Senator Bernardi said at this gathering of extremists: ‘The Liberal Party will ultimately rediscover the success it seeks through a return to the Menzies inspiration, while remaining mindful of the difference between short-term public opinion and long-term public interest.’ That is what he said in his address to that dinner in inner Western Sydney.
One of the things that has interested me and a number of my colleagues in politics has been the degree to which the coalition has opposed our stimulus package. I think you can pretty much divide non-coalition and coalition supporters on the basis of their approaches to the stimulus package. I can only put it down to one thing: for almost half a century, we in this country—with a variety of governments in power—have enjoyed prosperity and safety. We have not had the political unrest or turmoil that has occurred in Third World countries or in less-developed countries. We have not had the mass insecurity; we have not had the political and social traumas. Our generation never went through those. The coalition is at one with Gordon Gekko: greed is good. That is where they are coming from. This generation—of which I, you, Mr Deputy President, and almost everybody in this room is a member—has never known that insecurity or that lack of prosperity.
I want to go back to what Senator Bernardi said. He harked back to the Menzies era. I would like to talk about some of the achievements of the Menzies government: what it did, what it introduced and why that occurred. That occurred because the men and women of that generation understood exactly what it was for people to be on dole queues and to face starvation, civil unrest, turmoil, suicides, homelessness and the collapse of the economy. They saw it in their lifetime; they saw it from 1929 until World War II commenced. Consensus between the parties, labour and non-labour, was established in this country and almost half a century earlier on the continent in Europe.
I am in the presence of an esteemed Labor historian, Senator Faulkner, so I hope I am not taken to any tribunal for lauding some of the achievements of the Menzies government! Let me tell you what the Menzies government did and remind Senator Bernardi, who, had he reminded the extremists in Leichhardt on Friday night, might have been hanged by them. Let me tell you about the expansion of the Menzies government into education, not only into universities and science labs but also into funding non-government schools. Let me tell you about the maintenance of the Snowy Mountains scheme and the millions of pounds—at that stage—that would have been poured into the construction of that mighty scheme initiated by Labor. It was the Menzies government that created at the CSIRO; it was the Menzies government that expanded the government’s role in social services; it was the Menzies government that expanded the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; it was the Menzies government that expanded pharmaceutical and pensioner medical services; it was the Menzies government that believed in the compulsory conciliation and arbitration system; and it was the Menzies government that expanded significantly the role of the federal government in the provision of services in this country. So I wonder whether Senator Bernardi’s right-wing extremist mates on Friday night knew exactly how much the Menzies government did by consensus to expand the role of government in developing what the Australian economy needed at that time. Did Senator Bernardi’s mates know?
We might call this a stimulus package from 1949 onwards. We might have to call it that, because the government at that time knew exactly what they were confronted with: they were confronted with the images that they had seen for themselves in the Great Depression. A number of them would have seen for themselves the depressions that occurred from the beginning of the 20th century. They were never going to see those things happen again while they could do something about it, and that is equally so where the Rudd government is concerned. We are not going to see dole queues and we are not going to see the unrest or the turmoil that has occurred as a result of the inaction of governments when action is required. This government has decided to intervene because we are not going to forget like the coalition has forgotten. We cannot forget those periods in our own past; we cannot forget that these things occurred, and they are never going to occur again. That is what I cannot understand when people invoke the name of Menzies—they do not necessarily understand the complete contribution by that government in the expansion of the federal role in the provision of services in this country.
I do not think that goes down well with the coalition side, because they do not know their history. Again—and this is one of the terrible things that has been occurring—people have forgotten the past; they have forgotten that turbulence. They have indeed forgotten it, but we have not forgotten it. We know exactly what would happen. We know that our unemployment rate is not anything like what it is in the United States or Britain or continental Europe. We know that we have got people at work. We know that retail sales are going up. We know that, if the coalition did get away with it and was able to block our stimulus package, we would be heading towards 10 per cent unemployment at the moment. We know all these things. Indeed, we have been approved by international bodies. Let me tell you what the IMF said when it welcomed the design and implementation of our stimulus package:
We welcome the quick implementation of targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus. The stimulus provides a sizable boost to domestic demand in 2009 and 2010 that will cushion the impact of global recession.
Well, isn’t that marvellous! That is great if you are one of those people who is actually at work because of the government’s intervention in the economy. It further says:
... the Government’s commitment to return to surpluses and achieve a positive budget balance on average over the medium-term is commendable ... few other advanced economies have adopted such a clear commitment.
That is what we are doing. That is what we have decided to do.
We have been opposed every step of the way by this coalition. They have sat on their hands and they have come up with no alternative policy in this regard. If we had their strategy we believe that there would be an additional 210,000 Australians out of work today. We could not let that happen because we are not going to forget that period from 1929 onwards when there was hopelessness and turmoil. It is not in our make-up and we will ensure that this stimulus package is continued so that men and women in this country are protected from the worst excesses of the global recession.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>New South Wales Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2009-09-08,"—One of the great tests in public life, I think the most important, is not to get trapped by other people’s trappings and not to have a price. I have to say that I do not have a price and I do not like crooks. I notice that the terms for this matter of public importance are:
The need for the Federal Government to intervene by way of wasteful spending to compensate for the policy failures of the New South Wales Labor Government.
I notice that the Labor Party have not actually mentioned New South Wales because it is a constitutional flaw that you cannot get rid of a government that has completely failed and lost its intellectual base. I have to say that there are probably six or eight people in New South Wales parliament, in government, who should be in jail.
Let me give you an instance of the waste by the Commonwealth that is occurring. I have spoken to the government about some of these issues. There is a school in Sydney that is getting a seven core library, costing the Commonwealth $727,000. It is on a flat site. This building was already in the program under the state scheme and was costed out in February under the state building program for $285,000. The state was going to do it for $285,000. Switch the responsibility to the Commonwealth and the cost is $727,000!
Some of that money could have gone, for instance, to Westmead Cancer Care Centre, where I spent three hours last week. The Westmead Cancer Care Centre does some wonderful work right from the laboratory to the patient. I talked to some of the patients who were having their last chance treatment and are facing a pretty grim circumstance. We do not have money for Westmead but we have money to treble the price for a school building somewhere simply because we have transferred it to the Commonwealth. Westmead Hospital does some wonderful work and I plead for people to understand that they have a wonderful resource out there. It is the best in the southern hemisphere and it badly needs resources.
By the way, the key researchers out there are almost on weekly contracts because the hospital cannot guarantee them beyond a few months’ work because they do not have the budget. These are key researchers who look after people’s lives. They have now identified the melanoma gene, and that work is going to save a lot of people. The biggest killer of men between 25 and 45 is melanoma. So that is the waste.
I did notice in the Australian that Paul Kelly said in November 2008 that the decay of New South Wales was reflected in the open antagonism towards the government by Paul Keating and people like John Robertson and the fact that the government in New South Wales has been handed back to the New South Wales trade union movement.
There is a cost in not having a price. Last Thursday I got a death threat. I rang the AFP. They did not have enough people to put anyone on the case. I have had a $1 million bribe offer. I do not know how many people in this room have had a $1 million bribe offer, but I have. This was from people who are wanting to develop things in Sydney. I said to the guy, ‘Hang on a minute. I actually do this for nothing.’ But unfortunately in New South Wales there are a lot of people who say, ‘Yeah, let’s go and have a cup of coffee and get down to business.’ What is going on in New South Wales is a dear and expensive way to learn a lesson. I know a lot of the people involved and I know that some of those people expect a return on their money. It is pretty sad that a lot of people do have a price.
I take you to something that is more ‘touch and feel’, and that is the fact that in New South Wales historically in a few weeks time—and I cannot think of another time when this has happened—they are going to put a bank across the Lachlan River below Condobolin and cut the river off. Where is the Green movement? Bob, where is your mob? They are about to cut the Lachlan River off. We have just restocked it with fish—30 inches they are; my man caught a couple the other day. Without any consultation with the community, without even knowing how many people are going to be affected, they have taken a decision to put a block in the Lachlan River. Everyone downstream from Condobolin has been told, ‘Make your own arrangements.’
Not only is the department in New South Wales at fault but I would have thought that the landowners themselves are at fault. I would have thought the management committee of the river is at fault. I asked them: how many people are going to be affected? They did not know. I asked them: how many stock are going to be affected? They did not know. These properties rely on the river for stock and domestic water and, as Senator Fisher would say, for ‘critical human needs water’, but we have taken a decision to block it.
We have the Cadia mine—a big enterprise—looking to further develop the mine. They want to take more water out of the subcatchment of the Lachlan River. I have the plan here and I will table it. It is a project application and statement of objection to the project by the Belubula Landholders Association. This mine wants to take more water from the system. There is no understanding of the connection between groundwater and the river. The Upper Lachlan landowners, Mr Moxey and his mob, actually control the committee that controls the management of the river. They are not restricted in how much groundwater they can take out of the ground in the Upper Lachlan aquifer—whereas the blokes down at Hillston have been controlled, and they should have been controlled because what they were taking was excessive. But the excessive extraction from the aquifer at the top of the river is not controlled. The only reason they are allowed to do it is that the New South Wales government has not got around to doing the management plan for that aquifer. As we know, there is a lot of connectivity between groundwater and rivers. Up to 40 per cent of the river water is actually groundwater flowing into the river. But, no, in New South Wales it does not matter.
Historically I cannot remember a time when the government took a decision to put a block in the river and let everyone downstream, including the fish and livestock, make their own arrangements. I cannot think of a better example of an incompetent godforsaken government. It is an absolute and utter disgrace. It is a constitutional flaw. The mob over here do not care. There is not one person in this government in this parliament who lives and/or makes their living in the bush. They do not care and they do not know.
It is time that Australia’s farmers marched on this place and had a meeting out the front. Go to Tasmania and talk to the dairy farmers. You would be familiar with this, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett. The dairy farmers have just been told they will get 26c a litre for milk.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Your time has expired. Were you seeking leave to table a document?
—Yes. I seek leave to table the Belubula Landowners Association statement of rejection to the further expansion of the Cadia mine.
—Is leave granted?
—At this stage leave is not granted, because the usual courtesy of providing a copy of the document has not been adhered to. It has just been thrown at me by Senator Heffernan.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-09-08,"—by leave—I am very happy to put the Belubula landowners document on the record, because that is how it should be, but the form is for the senator to provide that to other members of the house first. I might also add that, if Senator Heffernan wishes to take some action about the blocking of the Lachlan River, which sounds to me to be full of incredible problems, then let him take action because actions speak louder than words. The Greens will certainly be there taking consideration of that action in this Senate.
—I have glanced quickly at this document, but that will not necessarily solve the problem because Senator Bob Brown has not had an opportunity to sight it. Senator Heffernan, I do not want you anywhere near me, thank you. You have to retain your sense of humour in this place. Did you actually mean for the email to be tabled?
—Not the email; just the white papers. I was in a hurry.
—You were in a hurry. What about the covering email?
—None of that; just the submission.
—So there are two documents you do not want tabled that you have passed on. You are not very careful with documents, Senator Heffernan. Anyway, I am happy, on behalf of the government, to give leave for the Belubula Landowners Association document, given to me discourteously by Senator Heffernan, to be tabled. This is subject to the views of other senators in the chamber, of course.

That the Senate take note of the document.
The Auditor-General report entitled Administration of parliamentarians’ entitlements by the Department of Finance and Deregulation is a remarkable indictment of the failure of successive governments to put a proper curb on the printing entitlements of parliamentarians. I think it warrants some response in this place. In 2003 I moved to disallow a major hike in printing allowances, particularly for members of the House of Representatives, in the run to an election and I was successful. In 2006 I similarly moved to prevent a hike but I was not successful. On behalf of the Greens I have repeatedly sought a facility for parliamentarians to keep a watch on their spending and for parliamentarians to get advice on whether spending is legitimate.
—Didn’t the opposition propose that and you supported it?
—Yes, thank you, Senator Faulkner. But here we have a document which is a pretty savage indictment of the rorting of the printing allowance by members of parliament to advantage themselves politically.
The Auditor-General is making out, if I am not misrepresenting this—I am shorthanding it—that the printing allowance is meant to help parliamentarians extend their work with their electorates and to give information which is helpful to their constituents but instead it has become more and more a facility to help MPs in election campaigning. It has become a taxpayer funded advantage which candidates who are not incumbents do not have. Therefore, it advantages incumbent members over those who contest elections. On the face of it that is patently unfair. The printing allowance should never have been allowed to do that.
In the report the Auditor-General found that the government turned down approaches in the past for something to be done about this. I am not going to go into the full gamut of the findings by the Auditor-General, but they are an indictment of misspending, self-investment, taking political advantage and misuse of taxpayers’ money. The Greens and I will be expecting that the recommendations of this report, which principally call for a set of guidelines which cannot be broken and which defend the public interest in the spending of printing allowances, be adopted. There are five recommendations and all five ought to be adopted. On behalf of the Greens, I want to propose that this parliament and this government should instigate this. But this parliament should go further. It should set up an independent arbiter to oversee the spending of the monies that come to MPs for use in their electoral work. I do not think it should just be the printing allowance but electoral and other allowances as well.
There is a double side to this. One is that the ‘parliamentary ombudsman’, if you like, would be able to arbitrate the spending of money to defend the public interest, to see that it is not rorted, not self-invested, not giving a particular electoral advantage and not being saved up—as under this printing allowance—to be spent in a run to an election. The second thing is that it will defend the interests of good parliamentarians who are worried about whether they should spend their printing allowance or other money on a particular purpose. They would be able to refer to an arbiter who makes that decision.
Ten years ago, if I wanted something printed in this place using the printing allowance, there was a Senate printing office. They would say, ‘Senator, you can’t spend it on that,’ or ‘Yes, we’ll go ahead and print that,’ or ‘If you take off the Greens logo, that’ll be okay.’ We knew where we stood. That has now been abolished and we do not know where we stand anymore. And, if you do not know where you stand, good people will try to do the right thing, but there will always be those who will try to rort the system. It is embarrassing that we have this report before the parliament but it must be taken note of. The recommendations should be implemented.
We should go further and establish a permanent watchdog, an independent arbiter, to watch over printing allowance spending and other parliamentary spending meant for electoral advantage—that is, the advantage of the people we serve, not the serving members themselves. It is an important matter. There is a pure finding by the Auditor-General of double-dipping here; printing allowances have been used for electoral advantage and then the member, or the party, has sought to get a refund for that printing through the electoral allowance. The already-publicised use of a very limited number of printers, particularly by the bigger parties, have been found to be donors to the parties. An absolute watch has to be put on that.
We must act on this Auditor-General’s report. I think we must be bold and come up with stronger recommendations than the recommendations of the Auditor-General. This is an indictment of misspending of the public’s money in the self-interest of the parliamentarians. We have got to put an end to it. It is simply not right that we put this report on the shelf and do nothing about it. The executive is the agency that must implement these findings. Without the executive, without Prime Minister Rudd taking action on this, it will not happen. I challenge the Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, to not only implement the findings of this Auditor-General’s report this year, but to also go one step further and set up an independent watchdog in the public interest and in the interest of those parliamentarians who want to do the right thing.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 3 of 2009-10</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,17,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-09-08,"—Senator Brown, I know that you do have, and maintain, a significant interest in this area. I recognise the contribution you have just made. On behalf of the government, I will briefly outline a response shortly. I will firstly go to a couple of issues. One, the recommendations have been accepted in full by the government. I am pleased to announce today that I have responded to the Australian National Audit Office’s performance audit report on the administration of parliamentary entitlements. Today’s report does show that on the issue of parliamentary entitlements the system is—quite frankly—vague, ambiguous and ill-defined. It is fair to say that the report is critical of both the way politicians have accessed their entitlements and the way Finance has administered them.
In particular, the report does deal with—as I think you have outlined, Senator Brown—five areas in total. It was a comprehensive examination of five specific entitlements. They looked at office consumables, paper and toner. They looked at newspaper and periodicals. They looked at the communication allowance. They looked at the printing entitlement. And, of course, they looked at car transport. The audit focussed, though, on the use of printing entitlements by 144 members and senators from three states, primarily in the months leading up to, and during, the 2007 election.
As I indicated, the government have accepted all of the recommendations of the Auditor-General. Today I have also announced a package of reform measures to address those recommendations. We also indicate that there will be a two-step process. The first is the package I will shortly outline and the second is a review of the entitlements. That review of the entitlements will be undertaken by an independent panel. I will deal with the reforms first. We know from the Auditor-General’s report that this framework is complex and overdue for reform. We know that the Auditor-General suggested a review of the system in 2001. We also know that there was no reform of the entitlements in the intervening eight years. As a consequence, there is a loud and clear call for reform and the Rudd government will answer.
Of the reforms I have announced today, the first and most immediate change will be an immediate cut to the printing entitlement of 25 per cent, reducing the total amount from $100,000 to $75,000. That will mean a reduction of the entitlement by half since the Rudd government came to office. In addition, the rules for how to access the entitlements will be changed. Access will be strictly limited to parliamentary or electorate business. For the first time, we will put in the regulations a clear definition of ‘electioneering’. This will specifically prevent the use of the entitlement for the production of party-political or electioneering material, including such things as how-to-votes and party-political flyers. The second area I announce a change in will be the previously unlimited expenditure on office consumables like toner, paper and stationery. Expenditure will be capped and indexed to $35,000 per annum. This will ensure that the use of that entitlement in election years does not, as it has in the past, spike around election periods and that there will not be a shift from the printing entitlement to office consumables.
Members will be required to authorise all printing of material. The authorisation will be in the form of a clear written statement in the material, with a standard 10-point font informing constituents that the material has been printed at Australian government expense and which member has produced it. The taxpayer will be able to understand who has printed the material, as it will be printed clearly on the pamphlet. It will be only about parliamentary or election business. The printing entitlement-communication allowance will also be combined—and this is effectively an overdue reform—so that there will be one entitlement. They have been in the past—and I think the ANAO highlights this—overlapping. The entitlement framework will be clearer, more transparent and more streamlined. In addition, the role of Finance in administering the entitlement will be dramatically strengthened. There will be more rigorous checking at the front end, where the entitlement will be checked before it is accessed by parliamentarians. There will be more rigorous checking before and after—that is, when the entitlement is being accessed by members and senators—to ensure that the material printed is within entitlement. At the back end there will be a more rigorous checking system when invoices for printing are presented and paid for.
To ensure that the printing providers themselves have reasonable access, there will be multiuser lists available. Those will ensure that people in regional and remote areas can have the printer provider and not be disadvantaged, but the multiuser list will ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money. The purpose of establishing a multiuser list is to support the local printing business. The current newspaper and periodical allowance will also be reformed to ensure that it is only used for parliamentary or official business and that the titles purchased, with the allowance and the costs, will be publicly reported. It will be about ensuring openness and transparency in the entitlement. As soon as practicable, we will drive a more open and transparent system so that the Department of Finance and Deregulation can place that material on the web, to use the general term. It will ensure that people will be able to understand what we have accessed, what amount we have spent and what we have spent it on. It will also mean the taxpayer and the general public will be able to understand the entitlement.
I indicated at the outset that there is a second part, which is the wider reform. A panel will consist of four distinguished public servants. I am sure this chamber would be aware of Barbara Belcher, a former First Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Also on the panel will be Mr John Conde AO, President of the Remuneration Tribunal; Ms Jan Mason, General Manager, Corporate and Parliamentary Services, Department of Finance and Deregulation; and Professor Allan Fels AO, former ACCC Chairman and now Dean of the Australia and New Zealand School of Government. The panel will provide a report to government within six months of commencement. The report and recommendations of the panel will be reported publicly and will be considered by the government as a basis for a second-stage reform of the entitlements system.
The Auditor-General’s report sheds light on a system that is in bad need of repair. Entitlements, as we know, are ill defined, vague and difficult for Finance to administer. The parliamentary entitlements system has developed in an ad hoc way over many years. We know from the ANAO report, in looking at parliamentary entitlements, particularly the printing allowance, that parliamentarians have acted on the advice of the previous government. This advice by the ANAO has now been called into question by subsequent legal advice obtained in the course of the audit. I think the ANAO report makes that plain. This has left many politicians who have acted in accordance with the Howard government’s advice at the time at some risk of being found to have their entitlements outside of the framework. There is ambiguity within the framework itself, and that is why the Rudd government is moving to put in place clear rules and greater transparency. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-09-08,"—This report is timely. It is important that it not be ignored, as Senator Bob Brown has indicated. It is an indictment of the system that is currently in place. It indicates that there needs to be substantial and significant reform. There must be a complete overhaul of printing allowances and, if we do not do so, we further jeopardise our reputations in the community as politicians. No wonder there is cynicism about politicians when this sort of material indicates that the system is not working in the public interest.
The Auditor-General’s report No. 3 of 2009-10, Performance audit: administration of parliamentarians’ entitlements by the Department of Finance and Deregulation, is quite revealing. A sample of printed materials from 144 members of parliament reveals that 74 per cent of items were at varying risk of being outside of entitlements and, further, that successive governments have encouraged the department of finance not to sight or check any printed materials. So there has not been enough oversight. There has not been a system in place to ensure that money is being spent on the purpose for which it is meant to be spent. Further to that, there is real concern that the framework has significant shortcomings. This is not a reflection on the Department of Finance and Deregulation. I think they do a very good job but the framework, the guidelines, are simply not there for the department to be able to ensure that politicians are accountable for their expenses.
Given that the Auditor-General has indicated that there ought to be a framework with overarching principles, I think that must be put in place sooner rather than later so that the printing entitlement is not rorted. There needs to be a framework that guides parliamentarians on their entitlements to ensure that they fall within the guidelines. I believe there ought to be sanctions if we fall outside those guidelines. There also needs to be formal arrangements in a mandatory sense for all of us to ensure that entitlements have been used for the purposes certified. There needs to be greater transparency in relation to the reporting on entitlements and done in way that is more publicly accessible. I think the best way of doing that is to put it on the internet.
I am pleased to see that the Special Minister of State is committed to reform in this area. That is welcome. Taxpayers are fed up with this allowance being used in such a partisan way. The fact that public funding or taxpayers’ money for this allowance was being used for how-to-vote cards is, I think, beyond belief. How can that be seen to be part of what a printing allowance ought reasonably to be about? That is clearly party political. Also, there ought to be rules in place so that newsletters or material from members of parliament paid for by the printing allowance are not distributed or disseminated once the writs are issued. Once the writs are issued for an election, clearly anything that goes out of an MP’s office is party political in the context of the use of a printing allowance. These are important reforms that must be implemented. If we do not do so, I think it will diminish all of us in terms of the system that we have in place.
I checked with my office today about my printing allowance. I used $1,305 in the last 12 months for letterheads, business cards and ‘with compliments’ slips. I am obviously not a very good politician, because I did not put out any newsletters in the last 12 months. It is quite legitimate for MPs to put out newsletters but I would see an allowance that goes beyond $10,000 or $15,000 per annum as being very much party political in nature. It gives a benefit to incumbents whether they are a member of a political party or they are an Independent. I do not think it is healthy in a democracy to have an in-built advantage for incumbents to use public money in this way. So I look forward to working with the government and the opposition on this issue. Senator Ronaldson, as the shadow special minister of state, has a particular interest in it. I think there is real scope for us to clean this up and to do so in a way that will enhance public confidence in the system of entitlements, and that will be a good thing for all of us.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 3 of 2009-10</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,17,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-09-08,"—I, on behalf of the opposition, say that we support the recommendations of the Auditor-General report No. 3 2009-10 Performance audit: administration of parliamentarians’ entitlements by the Department of Finance and Deregulation and we also support the matters raised by the Special Minister of State to address them to date. We need to go back and explain why we support these recommendations. There has been a clear lack of clarity about these entitlements from the time of the Keating government, which introduced the newsletter allowance, to that of the Howard government and then through the first 20-odd months of the Rudd government. The ANAO has indicated that there needs to be clarity and a lack of ambiguity to address this situation.
I note with some interest that in about 2003 all political parties, including the Australian Democrats at that stage, the Labor Party, the National Party and the Liberal Party, were operating off the back of a number of conventions. The parties followed them because of a lack of clarity. The conventions came out of a Senate estimates hearings with Senators Robert Ray and Faulkner in 2001. Parliamentarians have been acting off the back of those conventions up until today. I am sure that all my colleagues on both sides in the other place and in the Senate would appreciate some clarity. In relation to the 42 points, it is useful to refer to page 28 of the summary to the ANAO report, where it says:
However, if the components of the 42 Questions and Answers document were read separately by Parliamentarians and relied upon, as we now understand has occurred, then the number of printed items that would fall outside of this guidance would represent a very small proportion of the items sampled by the ANAO.
Parliamentarians on both sides have been relying on those conventions. I am pleased that after the Keating, Howard and Rudd governments at least there will be some clarity now where there was a lack of clarity. The opposition looks forward to working with the Special Minister of State, Senator Ludwig, regarding this inquiry and the implementation of the matters that he has announced this afternoon. We believe, as the government does, that that clarity is extremely important. We are pleased that the ANAO has identified that lack of clarity and given some indication about what may be the move forward.
I note that back in 2001 when the ANAO looked at this they did not make recommendations themselves relating to further clarity. The Remuneration Tribunal has in the past chosen not to put in any clarity. In some respects I think it has a lot do with the need for a judicial interpretation of these definitions and everyone has been operating in a vacuum now for a decade and a half. Hopefully, on the back of the ANAO report, we will see that clarity take the ambiguity out of the interpretation and we can move forward; and the community can look at what we are doing with some confidence and say that there are appropriate processes being followed and that individual members and senators are following those processes.
But again I say that we were operating on the back the 42-point convention, which was driven by a lack of clarity and at least provided some indication for members and senators as to what was or was not appropriate. I acknowledge that the ANAO has said that those conventions may well have been outside their interpretation of the guidelines. I accept that and I accept their recommendations. The Special Minister of State will have the opposition’s full support in ensuring that the ambiguity and lack of clarity in this matter is addressed.

The statement read as follows—
Mr President, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security’s oversight of the Australian Intelligence Community is a key element of our national security architecture. I am therefore pleased to present the sixth review of the administration and expenditure of the AIC by the PJCIS
The review examined a wide range of aspects of the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies, including the financial statements for each agency, the reorganisation and consolidation of agency structures, the impact of any recent legislative changes, their human resource management including separation rates, training, recruitment and accommodation and budget growth and financial governance systems associated with expenditure.
With regard to human resource management, the Committee found that maintaining adequate levels of language skills, especially with expertise in local dialects, remains a challenge for a number of the agencies. The Committee also noted that some agencies experienced higher separation rates in 2006-07, exacerbated by a competitive job market and internal policies encouraging staff mobility.
All AIC agencies indicated that performance management and evaluation continued to be a key service delivery priority. In some agencies this process has involved developing more user friendly intelligence product, more stakeholder engagement programs, annual customer surveys and formal performance reviews.
The Committee also noted that, in recognition of an upward trend in its litigation workload, ASIO introduced a new Legal Division and a Terrorism Litigation Advice Branch within the Investigative Analysis and Advice Division. The Committee identified the challenges associated with e-security across the AIC. It heard that agencies are working collaboratively and diligently to maintain optimum levels of e- security in a fast paced and global threat environment.
The Committee found that, despite facing the challenges associated with considerably increased budgets and the rapid, large-scale recruitment of staff, all agencies are currently managing expenditure appropriately.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-09-08,"—I move:
That the Migration Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 6), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No. 143 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
These migration regulation amendments issued by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship remove the requirement for onshore protection visa applicants to lodge their application within 45 days of arrival in Australia in order to be eligible for a right to work and Medicare benefits. Onshore protection visa applicants are generally granted a bridging visa while their claims are being assessed or reviewed. However, no work rights or Medicare benefits are currently available to people who are applying for a protection visa and who have been in Australia for 45 days or more in the 12 months before their application is made.
The 45-day rule will be replaced with a new test that provides that the minister must be satisfied that the applicant has a compelling need to work and the reasons for the delay in making the application for a protection visa are acceptable to the minister. The amendments will essentially allow all onshore protection visa applicants—at all stages of the application and lengthy appeal process, and regardless of whether they were lawful or unlawful at various stages of their time in Australia—to apply for permission to work, which presumably will be likely to be granted in all but the most exceptional of circumstances.
Amid the increase of boatloads of illegal arrivals, the minister’s silence on this issue is deafening. One has to delve deeply into the minister’s website to find any reference to these changes. These changes were announced as part of the 2009-10 budget in May this year, and at the time the only reference to these planned changes was buried deep within the portfolio budget statement. In fact, we had to wait until the minister’s press release of 1 July 2009 to find out more details of the Labor government’s proposed changes. Even then he only devoted a paragraph worth of explanation.
To understand Minister Evans’s silence, we need to be aware of the context in which these changes are being made. Australia is currently facing a drastic rise in the number of illegal arrivals through the criminal activity of people-smuggling. It seems to be a regular occurrence now, almost every week a new boatload of asylum seekers are intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy or the Australian Customs Service patrols.
Since the Rudd government abolished the temporary protection visa and further watered down the strong immigration policies of the coalition, there has been a steady stream of smuggler boats carrying a total of 1,293 asylum seekers, with an unknown number drowned at sea or intercepted and held in detention in Indonesia. In addition, and following the debate earlier in relation to the detention debt bill, it is very clear that we have approximately 48,000 overstayers in Australia at any given time.
Minister Evans knows that the policies of his government have directly led to an increase in the instances of people-smuggling to Australia. Despite these simple facts, the minister’s departmental website is littered with media spin falsely promoting his government as being tough on the issue of people-smuggling. It is no surprise that amid the spin we find only one minor reference to the government’s changes allowing greater work and Medicare rights to asylum seekers. This, of course, comes at a time when the Australian people expect the government to be directing their attention to deterring the criminal activity of people-smuggling. If the government feels so strongly about these changes, then clearly it should be actively promoting them to the Australian people. Indeed, it has been Labor Party policy for some time to change the system of access to work rights and Medicare benefits for refugees.
The Australian Labor Party National Platform and Constitution 2007 states in chapter 13:
Labor recognises that the arbitrary 45-day-rule results in legitimate asylum seekers on bridging visas being unnecessarily denied the right to work while their claim is being processed.
It is worth remembering that the statement was made in 2007, at a time when the Howard government’s tough stance on people-smuggling had reduced the flood of illegal boats to just a trickle. It is no wonder that, amid a surge in the number of boats, the Labor government is being noticeably silent over these changes.
The government earlier today debated the amendments which abolished immigration detention debt obligations, except for people-smugglers and illegal fishers. It is important to note that during that debate the key point raised by the coalition was that asylum seekers found to be refugees have their detention debts waived or written off. Other illegals who were subsequently granted visas can have their detention debt waived or written off. In relation to overstayers who have breached their visa conditions and are placed in detention, it is entirely appropriate that they meet their detention debts. If they depart Australia without paying their detention debt, the coalition argued that they should meet those obligations before they are granted a visa to return to Australia in the future. Overstayers who depart voluntarily or are deported are still required to meet their removal costs. This debt is registered on the movement alert list and will be taken into account should that person choose to return to Australia at a future date.
If this program is poorly administered, then administrative arrangements should be improved rather than the government abandoning another deterrent mechanism. Rather than dismantling the system and abolishing the framework for detention debt, the waiver and the writing-off procedures should have been retained for consideration on merit. Further changes such as these act only to weaken our well-established and effective system of deterrence. The coalition has always been committed to an orderly and humanely managed immigration and refugee program, and we will continue to ensure that Australia remains one of the most generous providers of humanitarian settlement in the world. However, we will do this in a way that does not encourage unauthorised arrivals.
The Rudd Labor government has systematically unravelled the measures which previously kept our borders secure and have ensured a properly managed immigration system. This includes abolishing temporary protection visas, the proposed creation of a protection visa for those who are not eligible for refugee protection under the rules of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and now these changes to the 45-day rule. People-smugglers clearly have a well-established pipeline to Australia and are using the Rudd government’s softer policies to recruit more. Instead of sending out the right messages with policies to end this trade, the Labor government is instead proceeding with its program of deliberately softening border protection and immigration measures. We have seen a raft of changes in the department since July last year, all geared towards softening border protection and immigration measures and sending the wrong message. The shadow minister for immigration and the Leader of the Opposition have consistently called for an inquiry into the linkage between softening of policy and the surge of illegal arrivals. Such an inquiry is now long overdue and it is time this Labor government looked at the evidence, toughened up and took decisive action.
I would like to remind the Senate about the history of the 45-day rule. The coalition introduced the 45-day rule in July 1997. The rationale for this and other measures introduced at about the same time, such as the $1,000 charge for review by the Refugee Review Tribunal if applicants were unsuccessful, was to discourage bogus claims. In a speech to the National Administrative Law Forum in May 1997, then immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, explained his rationale for the new rule:
I have particular concerns in relation to those who travel to Australia on a visitor visa, with the necessary documents issued by their own government to travel here, and who seek to claim refugee status in Australia.
I am gravely concerned by reports I have received that people are using the onshore protection system to obtain work rights and access to Medicare. There are people who apply to my Department asking for the $30 work visa who appear not to be bona fide asylum seekers. These applicants seek to delay their departure as long as possible knowing full well they are not refugees.
This abuse costs tax payers millions of dollars, undermines public confidence in the system and causes processing delays, disadvantaging genuine applicants.
There is no reason to expect that the number of potentially bogus claims would be fewer in the future after these changes, given other recent softenings of the Labor government’s migration policy. In fact, with the dropping of the 45-day rule, one would expect that the number of vexatious claims would rise.
Indeed, one only has to consider the words of Minister Ruddock and the circumstances in Australia at the moment, given the number of overstayers that we have in this country—about 48,500—to easily see that, for example, international visitors and students may come to this country for a particular purpose and suddenly decide at the end of their time here, now that we no longer having that 45-day-rule barrier, to claim refugee status in Australia, irrespective of the documentation they had when they originally arrived. Therefore, I am very concerned that the abolition of this rule will result in quite a number of vexatious claims.
It must be remembered that income support is currently provided to asylum seekers who are unable to meet their basic needs for food, accommodation and health care while their applications for protection visas are being assessed. The assistance is provided through the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme, which provides 89 per cent of Centrelink benefits. It is run by the Australian Red Cross. After an asylum seeker has received a decision from the Refugee Review Tribunal, they are no longer eligible for this assistance. Under article 24 of the refugee convention, governments are required to provide state support for refugees equivalent to that provided for resident citizens. However, this requirement does not cover asylum seekers.
The 45-day rule has been effective in limiting abuse of the system. Vexatious claims occur mostly when international students and visitors exploit the chance to extend their time to earn wages in Australia. As we well know, and as I certainly saw in my many years of experience dealing in immigration law with the Australian Government Solicitor, appeals in this area can take a long time. Given the processes that are available, this can mean a highly extended period of time during which unsuccessful applicants will potentially receive unemployment benefits and Medicare assistance.
The arguments in support of retaining the 45-day rule for asylum seekers include the fact that most asylum seekers in the community have entered on visitor visas, which include no work rights or Medicare assistance. Nevertheless, they are given work rights and access to Medicare until their applications for protection visas are refused at the merit review stage if they apply within 45 days of entry. Secondly, so far as past governments have been concerned, asylum seekers whose claims for protection are rejected by the department and rejected again following merit review by the Refugee Review Tribunal are failed asylum seekers. The fact that they are able to pursue claims through the court should not entitle them to access the job market and other benefits and support. This creates a situation where, if one looks at the media reports, one sees some students doing courses for years, in areas in which they will never practice or undertake work, for the specific purpose of remaining here in Australia. At this time, given the economic circumstances, it is legitimate that Australia and Australians would question whether such persons should be also entitled to Medicare and unemployment benefits, especially given the levels of unemployment and, in particular, the very high levels of underemployment currently in our economy.
Thirdly, if the asylum seeker process is seen to be abused by people who have already been in Australia for months or years, it may indeed create a backlash against all asylum seekers in the community. Fourthly, the removal of the 45-day rule will further soften Australia’s border security and immigration policy, which is designed to provide all Australians with strong border security and an effective immigration system.
In conclusion, the opposition supports this motion for the reasons that I have outlined, given the very legitimate concerns about the potential problems, relating to abuse in particular, that removal of the 45-day rule may cause, especially in circumstances in Australia at the moment where we do have high unemployment and other real issues to deal with. I think this is a legitimate concern that Australians would want examined.",SENATE,"<title>

</title>",<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-09-08,"—I rise to speak to the disallowance motion before us that has been put forward by the coalition. This, of course, is an attempt to prevent a better system of community support for asylum seekers while their applications are being processed. The idea of this disallowance motion is to stop this better process from being implemented. I would like to state that, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Greens do not support the coalition’s attempt to take us back to a system in which asylum seekers are denied basic access to services such as health and welfare support. In fact, the Greens have been at the forefront of pushing and lobbying for the removal of the 45-day rule, so there is no way that we would support the coalition’s motion. What we see before us today is another attempt by the coalition to mount a scare campaign—that Australia is sending a message to people-smugglers that we are going soft on people-smuggling. I do not know how far from the truth the coalition can be when talking about the basic rights of desperate human beings seeking our protection.
We are talking about the most vulnerable people—people who have fled persecution in search of a better life for themselves and their families. Yet the coalition, through this disallowance motion, are seeking to prolong the unacceptable, undeserved hardship of those in the most need of support and assistance. For the past 12 years we have had a system that has meant for asylum seekers who have not applied for a protection visa within a 45-day period after their arrival in Australia the denial of work rights, welfare support and access to Medicare whilst waiting for their visa application to be processed. The fact is that there are many legitimate reasons why an asylum seeker may not lodge a protection claim within 45 days of arrival in Australia, such as being given the wrong information by family and friends, having limited English skills or lacking an understanding of Australia’s immigration rules and processes. The coalition are attempting a return to a system where asylum seekers are dependent on charities for basic survival—a system we do not have to, and should not want to, return to.
This draconian policy, introduced by the coalition to ‘prevent extensive abuse of the refugee processing regime and limit the making of vexatious claims’ has resulted in many asylum seekers living in conditions of extreme destitution, with social isolation a common occurrence. This has meant that their basic mental and physical health has been impacted upon. Many key refugee and an asylum seeker advocates have highlighted the serious effects on the mental and physical state of asylum seekers who are unable to support themselves due to the current imposition of the 45-day rule. The imposition of this rule has meant the deterioration in health of asylum seekers and a complete dependence on charities, churches and community groups for basic day-to-day living requirements while their application is being processed.
When this policy was introduced the Howard government simply accepted that other people would carry the can, that other people would offer the support and assistance that these vulnerable human beings needed, and that, for some reason, it was not the role of the government, who had signed up to the UN refugee convention. The Australian Human Rights Commission, in evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration’s inquiry into Australia’s immigration system, stated:
... the [current] conditions and restrictions attached to some bridging visas may significantly impact on the ability of asylum seekers and refugees to exercise their basic human rights, including the right to work, the right to social security, the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to the highest attainable standard of health.
Is this really a policy that we want to retain? Is this really the type of immigration policy we should be proud of? I think not.
Statistics prove that there is a higher visa grant rate—that is, around 36 per cent—among asylum seekers who have applied after the 45 days than those that have applied within the 45-day limit, which is at 20 per cent. This clearly puts at rest the argument from the opposition that there is some link between the time that a person lodges the protection visa application and the merit of their claim. That argument is clearly false.
Last year the joint standing committee also heard from the Hotham Mission’s asylum seeker project. The Hotham Mission gave the committee an example of a client that has been affected by the imposition of the arbitrary 45-day rule. According to the Hotham Mission, their client, who has a master’s in social work, was not aware of the 45-day rule when he arrived here. So clearly it was not a deterrent. He has subsequently been denied the right to work for three years. The mission said:
His mental health has deteriorated because he frankly has nothing to do and he is living on $33 a week.
This is despite the fact that he is willing to work, willing to be a participant in his local community.
He has recently been linked into mental health services and has been deemed unable to work due to his mental health issues. If he even does get a visa now he will be a greater cost to the community than he would have been if he had been allowed to work.
So is this really a cost-effective policy in terms of monetary cost or social and human impact? Clearly it is not.
While the Asylum Seekers Assistance Scheme can provide some financial assistance, having no permission to work and being reliant on welfare and other support networks that may or may not be easily accessible does cause substantial alienation and psychological problems for those asylum seekers awaiting their visa resolution. Why would the coalition want to put more hardship and stress on a group of individuals that have fled dangerous and traumatic circumstances in their home country simply in search of a better life? It beggars belief that we are being told by the coalition that these people should not be able to go and get a job, work, sustain themselves, prove that they actually want to start a new life and participate in the community. We need to be looking far beyond the ignorance that is currently being spewed from some of the members of the coalition.
Placing punitive work, health and welfare restrictions on those seeking our protection is an abhorrent policy, and we as elected parliamentarians must not allow it to continue any longer. I commend the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship—this is the second time today that I have commended the minister—on moving to a more humane approach. In this aspect he has stayed true to Labor’s 2007 election promise, where they clearly stated that they:
... recognise the arbitrary 45-day-rule results in legitimate asylum seekers on bridging visas being unnecessarily denied the right to work while their claim is being processed.
So good on the government for actually standing by at least one of their election promises.
After the Senate today voted historically to overturn the appalling policy of detention debts, the coalition still have the gall to come in here and argue that this rule should not be overturned here. They are clearly out of touch with what the Australian community thinks is acceptable, humane and fair. It is time for them to step back and perhaps rethink where their party is sitting on these issues, because they clearly are not in touch with the Australian public. It just highlights over and over that there is a lot of cleaning up to do in the coalition ranks. This disallowance motion is just another example of the regressive immigration stance that the coalition continues to advocate.
We have moved beyond the days when people turned a blind eye to locking children in detention, to vulnerable people sewing their lips together in the middle of the desert. We have moved beyond that. Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep moving towards becoming a country with a reputation that we should be proud of. We have now abolished detention debts—fantastic. Let’s not go back to a place where we think that vulnerable people should be left to beg for the support of charitable organisations because the government does not want to take the responsibility that has been clearly outlined in our obligations under the refugee convention.
I should note that none of the unfair, inhumane and punitive policies on asylum seekers that have been implemented—such as the 45-day rule, the temporary protection visa regime or even detention debts—has ever been shown to be an effective deterrent to people seeking asylum. Why is that? Because when people are desperate for freedom and protection of their families it does not matter what is written on the government’s website or whether the Australian government has overturned or accepted a disallowable motion of a particular policy. Desperate, vulnerable people will always seek protection and freedom for themselves and their families. And it is something that we, as Australian citizens and as parliamentarians of a country that advocates for fairness and justice, have a responsibility to uphold.
What happened to the Australian fair go? It clearly disappeared—it was dissolved—during the 12 years of the Howard government. Let’s not go back there. Let’s move forward. Let’s ensure that we become the compassionate, humane nation that we desperately want to be.
So, the entire basis of the coalition’s argument that we are seeing an ‘influx’ of ‘illegal entrants’ due to the removal of these policies is clearly redundant. What should be noted, however, is that the existence of these punitive polices has been not only a blight on Australia’s international human rights reputation but also a clear breach, as I have pointed out, of our international human rights obligations—a claim that is supported by organisations such as the UN Human Rights Committee, the UNHCR and the Australian Human Rights Commission.
The Greens, as I said right at the beginning, have been advocating for years for this unfair regime to be removed, and I hope that the Senate will see sense, as it did earlier today, and quash the attempt of the opposition to continue to keep this oppressive 45-day rule regime. I would like to stress, as I did at the beginning of my contribution, that the Greens do not, and never will, accept any attempts to turn back the clock to the dark days when we locked children in detention and threw away the key, to the dark days when we thought it was okay for the person in the highest office of the land, the Prime Minister, to demonise the world’s most vulnerable people. The Greens will not allow that to happen. We must get rid of this 45-day rule, and there is absolutely no way we will be supporting the coalition’s scare campaign and voting for this motion. We will absolutely not do that.",SENATE,"<title>

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2009-09-08,"—Our vote on this regulation today will not change the country. It will not pave new highways, fix our hospitals or build more schools. But it will show that we are a nation of compassion by righting a wrong that is causing needless suffering to people in our country.
These regulations amend the Migration Regulations 1994 to abolish the 45-day rule for some bridging visa subclasses and make new provisions such as for the right to work, income support and access to Medicare. Introduced in 1997, applicants must have applied within 45 days of arriving in Australia or relinquish their right to work, access to Medicare and funding for torture and trauma counselling.
It has been estimated that 40 per cent of these applicants do not meet this deadline due to poor English skills or the lack of, or incorrect, information given by well-meaning but badly-informed family or community members. Unable to work to support themselves, asylum seekers are forced to rely on the charity of churches and community groups for financial support, food, and, as many live out in the community, assistance with accommodation.
The American Vice President Hubert Humphrey once observed that compassion is not a weakness and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism. It is not a mark of pride for this parliament that successive governments have devalued these principles in the administration of this policy. The shameful burden placed on churches, community groups and benevolent individuals by this policy is incompatible with the indelible concept and revered national tradition of the fair go.
Beyond our shores, this policy seriously undermines what should be Australia’s commitment to the highest standards of international rights. As a signatory to the 1951 Convention on Refugees, Australia has an obligation to provide essential living necessities and adequate health care for asylum seekers living within our territory. We are also committed to treaties that require their member states to ensure asylum seekers have the right to seek work and somewhere to live. They include the United Nations High Commission for Refugees—ExCom, 2002—and article 24(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which requires:
States Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health.
The International Covenant on Economic. Social and Cultural Rights states:
The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.
These changes not only epitomise Robert Menzies’ conviction that a strong economy is the best form of social justice but demonstrate that real social justice can build a strong economy.
In 2005 the Uniting Church’s Hotham Mission Asylum Seeker project surveyed 211 asylum seekers living in Victoria and New South Wales who did not have work rights or Medicare access. Among those surveyed; 74 per cent had skills recognised on the skilled occupation list for the General Skilled Migration program occupations. They included engineers, teachers, tailors, social workers, computer programmers and agricultural scientists. Of those listed on the skilled occupation list, 45 per cent had skills that were considered in high demand, and the majority of those surveyed were willing to work in rural or regional areas. In particular, the research found that the cohort of 211 asylum seekers who undertook the skills audit would have potentially added up to $26 million to the Australian GDP over a three-year period. More broadly, it was estimated that, if 75 per cent of the population of asylum seeking bridging visa E holders obtained minimum wage employment, it would still add over $75 million dollars to the economy over three years.
The Liberal Party is having an important conversation with history on how we treat those who seek refuge within our shores. In the 1980s, we wrestled with the great economic debates of the century and emerged with a renewed commitment to an open, free market. Enabling people who are willing and able to work, who ask not for welfare but for self reliance, to sustain themselves is intrinsic to what we believe as the party of not just Menzies but Howard as well.
Today, as we hew a new path to government, the Liberal Party must arrive from our deliberations having found a confidence in our ability to defend our borders without closing our hearts. The Liberal Party has a proud story to tell on immigration, but both parties over the last 50 years have written some bleak chapters too. We find our genesis in Harold Holt’s dismantling of the White Australia policy and in Malcolm Fraser’s welcoming of Vietnamese refugees that not only made Australia’s migrant intake truly multiracial but turned the abolition of the White Australia policy into a practical reality. In 1999, the former government rightly provided Australia as a beacon of safety for 4,000 Kosovars and for 1,500 East Timorese fleeing conflicts in their respective home countries. But it also introduced legislation that had no place in the contemporary nation we aspire to be.
Debates on the plight of asylum seekers in Australia too often invoke the defence that we ought not send the wrong message to those who seek shelter within our borders from tyrannies abroad. Let us grasp a new opportunity to understand the difference between sending the wrong message to those who truly wish us harm and sending the right message to those who need our help. Australia does not have to choose between strong, secure borders and compassion for those seeking liberty and freedom. We can have both.
Many of the people seeking to reach our shores do so as a result of their flight from tyranny in places such as Afghanistan. Australia has sewn together a rich tapestry of multiculturalism. The challenge now is to weave our future as a country big enough to recognise misdeeds and small enough to administer changes that work. The changes to these regulations mark an important step that should be supported by the whole parliament. And there should never be opportunity found in human misery; there should be a united determination by all who take their place in this parliament to conquer it jointly.
Today we talk a lot about respect—respect for oneself, respect for one another. We talk about respect where we see the demise of community and often of family too. Menzies’ Forgotten People speech applies just as well today as it did in 1942. Where Menzies extols a society not reliant on government for bread or ideas, today we vote to give people the right to work, not just to sustain themselves but for the self-respect that work brings with it. Perhaps through this small token of generosity, the righting of a wrong, we can inspire a renewed respect within individuals, families and our communities and we can respect ourselves as a nation of true generosity to those who need it most, and who want most to give it back.
I commend to the Senate these amendments moved by the government.",SENATE,"<title>

</title>",<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2009-09-08,"—I rise to oppose on behalf of the government the disallowance motion moved by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. The government moved to reform work rights arrangements for asylum seekers as a result of approaches by many community activists and community organisations that have to care for asylum seekers living in the community who do not have access to work and therefore have no income and, often, are destitute. As a result of that destitution, as I say, service organisations have to try and support them.
These are people who are lawfully in the community. In this debate again we have confusion between lawful and unlawful boat or air arrivals. These changes do not apply to unlawful boat arrivals. So all these arguments about weakening border security et cetera are a complete nonsense, a complete furphy, continuing a drum roll of disparaging refugees and creating fear in the community. These changes do not apply to unauthorised boat arrivals. Those people are mandatorily detained and they are only released into the community after they have had health, identification and security checks. The vast majority of people we are talking about here are people who are lawfully in the community, who have arrived on another visa and are living in the community while they pursue their protection claims. Most of them arrive at Sydney airport on a commercial plane with a valid visa. Senator Fierravanti-Wells rightly quoted what Minister Ruddock was talking about when the changes were introduced in 1997. But we have to be clear about this. This is not about unauthorised boat arrivals. What it is about is a group of people who arrived legally in this country, who are living in this country and who are applying, as they have the right to do under international law, to seek our protection.
While they seek our protection, the issue at question is: should they or should they not have the right to work and support themselves? Under the Howard government—and the existing conditions until 1 July this year, when the government changed these regulations—two-thirds of those people were entitled to and allowed to work but a third of them were not allowed to work. They are mainly the people who are caught by what is known as the ‘45-day rule’. So this is not a question of great principle, it is not a question of border security and it is not a question of opening the borders to unauthorised arrivals; it is about evidence based policy.
We have had since 1997 to assess the success or otherwise of the 45-day rule and we have found that circumstances have changed. We are now dealing with a different situation. The previous government introduced the 45-day rule in order to put a time limit on people seeking a protection visa. In other words, the theory was that if they had not applied for a PV within 45 days they would lose the right to work and this would provide an incentive for them to seek a PV. The logic of it was not too bad; it was worth a try. Also, quite frankly, it was driven by the real problem at the time, which Senator Fierravanti-Wells is well aware of—that there were advantages for people in delaying the whole process. They could delay applying for a PV and use a range of appeal rights to delay the processing. But what the previous government did, following that, was speed up the processing by the introduction of the 90-day processing rule and a lot of that problem went away. We have a situation now where 79 per cent of applications are finalised within three months. When this was introduced, only 25 per cent were finalised. The problem has changed. Senator Vanstone did some work on how we might improve the system and when I became the minister I inherited a report commissioned by her.
The question before us then is whether we continue to deny a group of people who are legally in the community the right to support themselves, the right to have self-respect, to work and to feed and clothe their kids—whether we say to them that they have got to be destitute and live off scraps from charities—while we allow them to exercise their legal rights. You have to ask yourself, ‘Why would we punish them and deny them the right to work and force the Hotham Mission and others to support them?’ It does not make any sense. In fact, we know that more people who have been affected by this rule are actually found to be owed protection than those who apply within the 45 days. It just does not make sense any more. If it did make sense it certainly does not now. We know that a lot of people are destitute in the community.
As a result of the changes initiated by the previous government, when they did the community care trial and the case resolution trials, we have also learnt that you have better results at resolving people’s status and better results in getting them to return home if you treat them with respect and manage them in the community. Locking them up did not work. That is why we had long-term detention. For this group of people, who are lawful, if they are treated with respect, allowed to work, allowed to save some money and allowed to treat their kids appropriately and support their families we have had much better success rates—and the previous government had much better success rates; it was a Howard government initiative that I am looking to expand—at getting people to return. They will understand where they are at and that they are not going to be allowed to stay in Australia and will return voluntarily. It is about treating people with respect and allowing them to make proper decisions, while having an understanding of all their circumstances. The Howard government are to be congratulated for those initiatives. What we have done is seek to expand them and ensure that we treat people with respect.
But I reinforce—and I will not cover some of the ground because of the shortage of time and also because Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Troeth addressed the arguments better than I could—that this is not about unauthorised boat arrivals. This is about people who are legally in the community who came in on visas and are allowed to apply for protection under our law and international law. It is a question about whether we let them work and support themselves or let them starve and rely on charities to look after them while that process occurs. I am all for strong integrity in the immigration system. I am all for saying to people that they have had their chance and, if they failed on their PV application, they have no right to stay here and they have got to go. I am working hard to make sure our compliance arrangements are improved so that people who are found not to be owed our protection are removed or encouraged to go. But the success of encouraging them to go has been much higher when they have been managed out in the community and when they have their dignity and self-respect, and that is enhanced by the capacity to work.
We are talking about perhaps 600 people in addition to those already allowed to work. Early indications are that we are seeing a slightly increased number of people seeking work rights. But what we are doing is ensuring that we do not have that arbitrary 45-day rule and that we assess people’s circumstances and say to them: ‘If you are lawful, if you are cooperating with the immigration department and if you are looking to resolve your status you will be allowed to work. If you do not play the game, if you are unlawful, if you are working without permission, if you are engaged in any activity contrary to your visa, there will be no sympathy. Play the game and you are allowed to work. Don’t play the game and you do not get the benefit of that consideration.’ That is the system we put in place.
The 45-day rule was arbitrary. If you applied after 46 days you missed out on work rights, with no discretion. It is crazy. There are all sorts of reasons why people might apply after 46 days rather than before the 45-day cut-off. For instance, for many of them the circumstances in the country they came from may have changed. If there is suddenly a civil war in a country they may apply for protection and may be successful whereas they would not have been earlier in the piece. So there are good reasons for people failing to meet the 45-day rule other than trying to delay their processing.
I will not go further because I know we are short of time and I think it would be good to get this matter resolved tonight. We think these changes are positive. We think they are working well so far. We think they are responding in an evidence based, risk management approach to the reality of PV applicants who are living in the community lawfully now. It treats them more fairly, it gets us better immigration outcomes and it removes the arbitrariness of the 45-day rule, which was introduced to solve a problem that no longer exists. We think this is good public policy. It is not about some of the emotive debates that we have again had about unauthorised arrivals, boat people, sending signals about softness and all that terrible rhetoric. Look at the case here: it is about good public policy, improving the conditions of those who are lawfully here seeking asylum, but, equally, it makes it clear to them that if they fail in their claim for protection they go home. It is a system with integrity. It treats people with respect and with dignity and does not insist on them being destitute. But, also, it is firm in the message that, if you are not found to be owed that protection once your case is resolved, you go home. The system we have introduced is better and I urge the Senate to reject Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s disallowance motion on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,"<title>

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-09-08,"—I would like to make a couple of quick comments in reply. I will not reiterate the points I made except to say—and I take the points that the minister made—that assistance is provided, as we know, to asylum seekers through the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme and, once the asylum seekers have received a decision from the Refugee Review Tribunal, they are no longer eligible for assistance.
The reality is that we now have, and we are increasingly seeing, people who see Australia as a place they want to come to and to stay in. I take the minister back to the reasons for the 45-day rule. The 45-day rule was introduced to deal with those claims that are put in by people who, as the minister says, legitimately come here with a visa but then decide to claim refugee status in Australia. The prolonged litigation, which I have personally seen over the years, really undermines public confidence in the system, and there is a legitimate question about it. I say to Senator Hanson-Young that there are some people in the community at the moment who not only are doing it tough and are unemployed but have a legitimate expectation that people who abuse the system will not be afforded additional rights. I say to the Senate that those people are entitled, can I say, Senator Troeth, to have their views articulated in this place, not dismissed in some manner, as you, Senator Hanson-Young, have sought to do today.
I conclude my comments by saying that there are concerns. We will be looking to see that abuses of this system do not occur like they occurred in the past and that the dropping of this rule does not result in bogus claims. We will see, Minister, what the ultimate result of this is.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-09-08,"—I have spoken a number of times during the adjournment debate about those missing at Fromelles in northern France. As those listening will recall, it is at Fromelles that mass graves have been more recently discovered. Original estimates were up to 400 Australian and British dead from that horrific battle on 19 July 1916. I will not recount the detail but, as we are all aware, recovery of those men has now moved to a fairly advanced stage. The estimate is closer to 300, with 222 already recovered. It must be said at the outset that this has been a rather magnificent feat. We have not seen its like since the war finished on World War I battlefields. As with the final recovery of those missing in Vietnam, now also recovered, this has been achieved in the face of stiff bureaucratic scepticism and resistance. Now, of course, those tasked to do the recovery will be bestowed with plaudits. As is said, success has many fathers.
The real credit, though, goes to those who persisted year in and year out. In particular, I would like to acknowledge two people: Mr Jim Bourke and Mr Lambis Englezos. Both these fine Australians persevered where many others would have been defeated. The pity is that throughout their persistence they have been denigrated as troublemakers and cranks. As far as I am concerned, they are nothing other than national heroes. The credo that we look after our own has had at times a very hollow ring to it. The corollary should be: when we are shamed into doing so. Putting that aside, we are grateful for the success of these two men and for the support that they eventually received.
At Fromelles, the recovery is nearing completion. The new cemetery near the local church is well advanced. The site faces north-west, across the former battlelines and to the right of the current site of Pheasant Wood. The completion date of 19 July 2010, in time for the formal ceremonial funeral service, is clearly achievable. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, with the support of the British and French governments, has done very well indeed. I understand that after remains have been sampled for DNA they will be buried in graves marked ‘Known only to God’. When identities are matched, headstones will be replaced with appropriate names and family inscriptions. This is the practice now when bodies are found and identified.
We know that sampling of the skeletal remains has also commenced. There seems to be some confidence that the anthropological work has been able to distinguish a large number as Australians. The proximity of badges and other material clues with the remains have made this possible. Further, we have been informed that the DNA sampling has also commenced and that testing is about to begin. This follows the conclusion from a sample of remains. An agreement between governments was made for the purposes of assessing the viability of DNA testing and ascertaining whether it is indeed practical. We are also cautioned that the varying conditions of the burial pits will result in equally varying ability to extract viable DNA. It was found during the preliminary excavation that some of the burial pits were very wet and others much drier. Therefore, the effect on the clay is likely to result in quite different outcomes. Inevitably, it seems there will be some disappointment. Of course, not all remains will be identified. While 1,400 people have registered on the Defence website as potential DNA matches, it seems the success rate might be quite small. Nevertheless, the important fact is that matching has become a commitment and it is now up to the DNA specialists.
There has been one disappointment in this process from beginning to end, as I have watched with close personal interest, and that is what seems to be the most petty jealousy between the academics and associated interests. The origins of this seem to me to have been the awarding of the original trial excavation contract to Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division, or GUARD. This was managed by both the Australian Department of Defence and their British counterparts without tender. While tendering guidelines may have allowed for this, inevitably it upset opposing competitive interests. The campaign of derision from the unsuccessful tenderers continued throughout that contract, with tame journalists in tow. It persisted even after the successful results were released. The great irony was that when the contract was finally let for the recovery task the critics won. With a contract much bigger and more extensive, the critics from Oxford and their previously very vocal associates won. The boot, as they say, was on the other foot. Surprise, surprise—what we have seen in the media in recent weeks has been a counterattack by the Glasgow supporters, alleging all sorts of shortcomings. The key evidence has been attributed to a Belgian who is not even an archaeologist.
All of this criticism has been denied and by the most respectable of relevant experts. The project seems to be very successful and on track. We can only suggest that the media stories might be a case of sour grapes—really a great pity, as all those with a deep interest in this project have to date behaved with impeccable professionalism. I do not wish to buy into arguments, as they seem to be ill-informed to some extent. At the behest of the current successful interest group, this made for good news material. The pity is that the controversy has trivialised what has been, from beginning to end, an outstanding and difficult project. This is, after all, a matter of great national consequence. Over 60,000 Australians died in World War I. A further 60,000 are said to have died as a result of their injuries and illness in the 15 years after 1918. The controversy between these rival camps of archaeologists is therefore demeaning and disrespectful. It might make for a good short-term headline for the journalistic hack but ultimately it is offensive and embarrassing.
This has been a project followed carefully by many Australians with a keen interest in the topic. It includes all those descendants who might eventually find out where their great-uncle or grandfather lies in peace. I certainly look forward to further news of the recovery being completed. I also look forward to hearing about the progress of the DNA testing and matching, and the commemoration on 19 July next year at Fromelles. I encourage those who are not aware of this project to log on to the website at media@CWGC.org. There, the latest news is available, and the website is regularly updated. Again, may I commend all those who brought this project to its final stages. May I also say how pleased I am to have been associated with it in some small way.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Battle of Fromelles</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech
