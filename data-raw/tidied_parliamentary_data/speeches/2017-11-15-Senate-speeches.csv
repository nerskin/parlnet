"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-11-15,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:39):  In speaking before the debate was adjourned yesterday, I ran through the significant issues that are facing Australians in relation to housing—those Australians who seek to buy and also those Australians in the private rental market. I emphasised in my earlier remarks that, despite the focus so frequently being on housing issues in capital cities and housing affordability in capital cities, in fact these issues are also critical in many of our regions. Certainly in my home state of New South Wales, the coastal regions—both the north coast and southern New South Wales—are subject to some very particular pressures, which I'm keenly aware of as a duty senator for both Cowper and Gilmore.


What's required is not a narrow series of tax integrity measures, worthy as the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 may be. What's actually required is a concerted, serious, nationally led effort to address housing affordability. If we are unable to pursue that, we will continue to see more and more Australians under very significant housing stress. It starts with home ownership and a recognition that the proportion of people who own their home has declined, from 42 per cent back in 1995 to just 31 per cent now, and the proportion of people who have a mortgage continues to climb. The proportion of people who are renting has increased over the last 20 years—it's up from 26 per cent to 31 per cent—and people are renting for longer and longer periods.


The way that housing is organised in Australia has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. It is essentially a consequence of housing prices becoming higher and higher, putting pressure on housing costs for those who rent and those who have bought. It's also putting pressure on homelessness. We continue to see unacceptably high rates of homelessness, and I made remarks earlier in the debate about the impact of homelessness in one city in New South Wales, in Coffs Harbour, and the very direct impacts that service providers in that city have reported to me.


In that context, it's been incredibly disappointing that the government have failed to act in any serious way about this, despite the fact we are now into their fifth year of what they like to call 'governing'. By contrast, Labor have taken this incredibly seriously; we have gone to election after election with a serious plan to restore housing affordability. We're not naive about how difficult that is. The inflation of housing prices in the private rental market and the residual and unaddressed demand for social housing means that there is a very, very big hill to climb to tackle this problem, but that shouldn't deter us from trying. In fact, it should mean that the measures we put in place are robust and proportionate to the scale of the challenge.


The No. 1 thing that we've put forward is to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. I've lost count of the number of times young people have approached me and told me of attending auction after auction after auction and walking out disappointed each time. They're going home on a Saturday afternoon and realising that yet again they have been outbid, not by someone who wants to live in the house but by someone who wants to acquire that home as an investment. Now there's nothing wrong with seeking to acquire a home as an investment, but the kicker is this: when you've got a first home buyer and an investor walking into an auction room, there is an enormous tax advantage allocated to the person who is investing. It's just not right. There is something very, very wrong about a tax system that privileges the investor over the young person, the young couple, perhaps a young family, seeking to buy a home to live in. There is something very, very wrong about that.


That's why we have proposed a reform to negative gearing. Of course, we will continue to allow negative gearing concessions to be applied to new housing. If there are tax concessions in the marketplace, they should be applied to make sure that new housing supply is brought on. But for tax concessions to continue to apply to investors to allow them to participate in this churn of properties in the private market, bidding up asset prices higher and higher and higher, is wrong. We think it's a waste of public money, we think it's unfair and we think it has very significant social consequences as fewer and fewer Australians are able to enter the housing market.


We also seek to limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds. We do that for a range of reasons, not least of which is our very great concern that limited recourse borrowing in self-managed superannuation funds presents very great risks to the individuals whose money is invested in those funds. Limited recourse borrowing in that sector has absolutely exploded. It was just $2½ billion in 2012. It's now $24 billion. That is an incredible rate of growth in self-managed super funds; it is an 860 per cent increase. It has real risks for the super system, but it creates real problems in the housing market because what it means is that these tax-advantaged vehicles are piling into the property market and crowding out first home buyers. Our intention is to place some limits on this. We will adopt the recommendation of the Financial System Inquiry—a recommendation that the government has chosen to ignore—and we will restore the prohibition on direct borrowing by superannuation funds. We do that because, unlike those on the other side, we actually think that this is a challenge that we need to take seriously.


Neither of those things is necessarily popular. It's always risky going to the public and saying, 'We intend to change taxation arrangements.' I've had many conversations with people who have come to me and said, 'This is not fair,' or, 'That's not fair', and we know there are many people who are presently taking advantage of some of these arrangements. But we have to face up to facts. These privileged arrangements for people who are already in possession of substantial assets are working to exclude people who are not from gaining assets themselves, and it's not right. We can't continue like this, and we are seeing the consequences in the falling numbers of young people who are able to buy their own home.


Of course, we also need to look at social housing. It's a very great shame that the government has abolished so many of the mechanisms that the previous Labor government had in place to consider the supply of housing overall. One of the things we are very interested in doing is looking at how we can increase investment in affordable housing, because the community housing sector has real potential to play a much greater role in providing affordable housing for people on a range of incomes at the lower end of the spectrum. But the trick here is ensuring that they're able to access finance. These are often organisations that are of a modest scale, and it's difficult for them to obtain finance even when they've got a very good business case for building new housing that can provide reasonable returns.


We will establish a bond aggregator that will assist community housing providers to access cheaper finance for new, affordable rental housing. The purpose of the bond aggregator is to be able to source funds from the wholesale market on behalf of the community housing providers. We'll do that by issuing bonds to private investors. This has been immensely successful in the United Kingdom. Their Housing Finance Corporation has lent to about 152 housing associations, and their goal is to deliver up to 30,000 new affordable rental homes.


We need substantial, meaningful intervention from government in the housing market. We need leadership, we need a minister for housing and we need a government with the courage to take on this most difficult challenge.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Acting Minister for Regional Communications) (09:49):  As there are no other colleagues seeking the call, I will sum up and thank colleagues who have contributed to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017.


As a government, we are committed to ensuring that home ownership is achievable for Australians and that they have access to secure, stable and affordable housing across the spectrum. The changes contained in these bills are part of the government's 2017-18 budget package to reduce pressure on housing affordability. Two of the measures will improve the integrity of Australia's tax system by better targeting tax deductions relating to residential investment properties. The other measure aims to increase the availability of foreign-owned residential real estate. The vacancy charge will support the government's foreign investment regime, which seeks to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-11-15,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I want to concentrate my remarks on an issue that is playing out in the mid-coast of my home state of Queensland, in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area. Tragically, unemployment in that part of the country is double the national unemployment figure—somewhere in the order of 10 per cent. We are hoping that that will be alleviated in due course with some of the developments we are happy to support just north of there, including the continued development of the Bowen Basin and the Galilee Basin, particularly with the onset of investment by Adani, one of five corporations who are intending to invest very significantly—billions of dollars—in that Central Queensland region.


Unemployment is having an impact on families. We know that 1,000 children receive breakfast when they arrive at school in this area. Think about that for a moment—1,000 children leave home and make their way to school without having had any nourishment for the morning, and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that sometimes that breakfast is the only meal that they receive on a given day. One of the problems is that these children largely come from a sector of the community who are likely to be, I suppose, challenged by their economic circumstances, and, whilst there are no figures available, arguably many of them will be on some sort of social welfare. Many will neglect their children because of their own circumstances, including alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling abuse—not all; I don't want to reflect on an entire group particularly when the stats aren't available, but that seems to be the anecdotal evidence, and where surveys have been taken that's the sort of argument that is borne out. 


The government has taken it upon itself to roll out the cashless debit card into this area—it's one of the areas that have been selected. This is enormously supported by the community of Australia. People fully expect that if social welfare payments are made to anybody then those payments are for the vitals of life, including making sure, to the best of their ability within the limited economic assistance that these payments provide, that they support their children so that we don't have a thousand children arriving at school without having received nourishment in the form of breakfast. Tragically, the Queensland Labor government have decided to select this as a key issue in politics, and they are undermining the government's effort to roll out this program in that area. Sadly, they have been joined in this by one of our colleagues, Senator Watt. I've often said of Senator Watt that he makes expressions with a thought to follow, and up there he has attacked the government by saying that there has been no consultation between the federal government and the local member in this case, Ms Donaldson, and their social services minister. Ms Donaldson repeated that in a Senate legislation committee hearing. Perhaps there's an argument there that she has even misled the Senate through her statements, because, when the evidence had been produced—and I'm happy for anybody who wants to explore this further to produce the physical evidence—we found that our minister had responded in writing to a letter from Ms Donaldson on 1 August and had agreed that they would meet, to clarify some of the issues around the program, and that the minister's office would be in contact to arrange a suitable time.


In the week of 7 August, Minister Tudge's office contacted Ms Donaldson's office to organise a time to meet. Dates in September were offered. These were declined by Ms Donaldson's office as being unsuitable. On 20 September, Minister Tudge's Melbourne office arranged and confirmed by email a meeting with Ms Donaldson for 4 October. With plenty of notice, there was a change of venue—for her to come to Canberra rather than Melbourne. She declined. On 4 October, Minister Tudge called Ms Donaldson's office and left a response. No calls were returned. On 15 October, the minister's office called Ms Donaldson's office and, again, offered to meet. On 16 October, the following day, Minister Tudge's office emailed Ms Donaldson's office—given there had been no reply to their offer—to organise a teleconference for 9.30 am on 23 October. These times were arranged and locked in. This is something that happens for many of us in our day-to-day lives. When Minister Tudge's office rang at the agreed time, Ms Donaldson's office said that the minister was not available. Minister Tudge's office called Ms Donaldson's office to arrange another teleconference time. Her office replied that they would provide a suitable time. That was on 23 October—and they haven't heard from her since.


There is a reason for this. Ms Donaldson is playing serious politics—along with Senator Watt, my colleague here in the Senate—because they want the vote from these people. We have a state election happening, you might have noticed, and that's what drives behaviour like this. There is no regard for the general benefit of the community and no regard for the thousand children going to school each day and not receiving nourishment. Ms Donaldson, when confronted with that, made the defence that she thought these children were double dipping—that they were eating at home and eating again when they got to school. In fact, she admitted her children were engaged in that practice. Well, for a woman who has had as much time as she has had around social services, she ought to know that that was a misleading and very dangerous statement to make.


We had a direct mail-out to over 32 constituents of this community, to engage with them on the rollout of the program. A phone poll of about 500 people showed overwhelming support, as is the case across Australia. There was 67 per cent support when formal contact was made. There were also about 5,500 direct emails sent to the constituents of this area to advise them. In every instance, they were afforded the opportunity, as they ought to have been, to engage with government on how this program would be rolled out. I don't want to blame her for politics and then start to play politics, but she has misled the Senate and the community on the government's efforts to engage with her, on the rollout, as an appropriate courtesy.


You don't need to take my word for it. Let me leave you with a quote from someone who was a very popular Labor member for Hinkler, Mr Brian Courtice. Courtice was a legend in that district. He had this to say about Ms Donaldson:


What she is looking for is votes out of it but she is going to lose the votes from the people who pay tax.


She is trolling for votes from the unemployed.


His words, not mine. 


But I wouldn't expect anything different from her … she is a political dud.


She is a very disappointing member.


They're the words of Brian Courtice, not mine. They're the words of a Labor legend—about a Labor dud.


Disappointingly, she is joined by Senator Watt of the Labor Party, a current member of this chamber. Senator Watt ought to come down now into this place and put on the record that he doesn't agree with Ms Donaldson's protest that there has been no contact with her, because he knows full well there has been contact. Senator Watt is always a little bit careless around the facts in relation to matters, but here is an opportunity for him to clear the air. Ms Donaldson may well have misled a Senate inquiry, and we'll have a look at that over time, but for the good people of Bundaberg and the good people of Australia, whose taxes are to be wisely invested, this program is going to proceed for the benefit of the community.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:00):  The answer, Senator Moore, is, no, I haven't spoken to Senator Hanson in relation to that policy. But, in relation to domestic violence generally, I think that we can all say that it is something that I would hope that each and every one of us in this chamber is committed to absolutely eradicating.


The government's position has been very, very clear. All women and children in Australia need to be safe at home, safe in the streets and safe online. That is very much why the first announcement of the Turnbull government was the $100 million Women's Safety Package. That is, of course, on top of the Third Action Plan under the Commonwealth action plan to reduce violence against women and their children, which we committed a further $100 million to. I certainly hope that all of us in this chamber are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to ensure that when we do say that women and children in Australia deserve to be safe we are putting in place the policies that will effect that.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, a supplementary question?

It is something that we stand together in solidarity against. In no way is domestic violence ever a joking matter. It is never a matter to be laughed at. That is why the coalition government has been very, very clear since we came to office that we are determined to keep women and children in Australia safe at home, safe in the streets and safe online. To that extent, again, the very first announcement of the Turnbull government was the $100 million Women's Safety Package.

The LNP in Queensland, led ably by Mr Tim Nicholls, have made their position very clear: no deals, no coalition and no shared ministry. But, Senator Moore, in relation to allegations of violence and in particular domestic violence, when those on the other side actually stand up and absolutely condemn Luke Collier and have him thrown out of the CFMEU instead of ensuring he is sent to Western Australian to become the youth advocate, then I might start believing some of those on the other side when they say they don't support domestic violence.

That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Moore today relating to the release by Pauline Hanson’s One Nation (Queensland) of a domestic violence policy.


This was the first question of the day. It seems like a long time ago. The question I put to the minister was about the Liberal Party knowledge of the One Nation domestic violence plan that was only released quite recently and also whether in fact, as a result of the knowledge of that plan, she had any concerns and, as a result of those concerns, which she indicated that she had, whether she was concerned about the situation in Queensland—I won't call it a deal, as the minister seemed to take objection to the term 'deal'—which is on the public record that the Liberal National Party is preferencing One Nation in at least 49 seats in the Queensland election. In terms of the process—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Not in Thuringowa, as you know.




Senator MOORE:
  I'm sorry? I heard something across the chamber. I'm concerned about that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator, I may be able to help you—just ignore the interjection.




Senator MOORE:
  I raised those issues because the release of the One Nation domestic violence plan a couple of days ago—it's a very short plan, and anyone in the chamber would be able to read it quite clearly—has caused a number of responses in Queensland by people who work within the industry and also by people concerned about the issues of domestic violence. In particular, the previous minister in Queensland, my friend Shannon Fentiman, and the Liberal-National shadow minister for child protection and domestic violence issues in Queensland, Ros Bates, have both made very strong comments on their concerns about the impact of this particular plan. Also, my friend Angela Lynch from the Women's Legal Service went on record as well around the issues of legal process.


The plan is clear and it talks about the fact that there are concerns about a number of the policies that are part of this new plan put forward by One Nation. One of them is around the appearance in court of people involved in domestic violence and also the impact that this could have on people's feelings of safety and protection in this area. The Senate did an extensive inquiry on domestic violence a couple of years ago, and one of the key issues that came out of that was the concern about the impact of having both the alleged victim of domestic violence and the alleged perpetrator of domestic violence being together in a court process. This was raised consistently as an area which could create further damage, further harm and further fear—not just to the people involved immediately but also to the children who could be caught up in this process.


We raised this particularly because, when Mr Dickson and Ms Hanson were releasing this plan in Queensland, they said that the whole focus of the domestic violence plan before us was to look at the needs of children. We all agree with making sure that we listen to the needs of children. The minister made a strong point in her answers that she believed that everybody in this chamber would share concerns around ensuring that anyone who is caught up in the process of domestic violence should feel safe and protected. Unfortunately, Ms Hanson was not in the chamber at that time, so we don't know whether Ms Hanson feels the same way. It would be useful to get that on record sometime in the future. I say 'Ms Hanson', in her role as leader of the party, but I should say 'Senator Hanson', in the case of being in the Senate.


There was a clear reason behind my question. When there are such strong and very longstanding policies in this place about what we need to do cooperatively together at the state and federal government levels to ensure that we identify the clear concerns around domestic violence, when issues have been raised by practitioners, supporters and advocates for those in domestic violence and when we have a plan being put forward by one party and then we have the decision by the LNP government in Queensland to provide preference deals with that party that's put forward such a plan, the reason for my question was to see whether, in fact, the minister responsible here was aware of the plan and whether she had talked with the One Nation party. We found out that she had not spoken with the party, but we did get clearly on record that she was concerned by some of the issues in that plan that I'd put forward in my question.


So my question remains. If there are these concerns raised with the minister, who has taken a lead in the area of domestic violence nationally, there should be an interaction, there should be discussion and there should be discussions about whether the LNP is fully aware of this particular policy and, if so—and having their shadow minister knowing about it—what will happen next.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:13):  Unfortunately—and, coming from Senator Moore, I say particularly unfortunately—this is clearly a despicable and deliberately misleading slur against my party in Queensland. Senator Moore spoke about the candidate for Thuringowa and in the next breath talked about LNP preferences for One Nation. Let me be very, very, very clear about this. In the electorate of Thuringowa, the LNP is, heaven forbid, preferencing the Labor Party before One Nation. Senator Moore knows that.


There is no deal from the LNP in Queensland with One Nation on anything—preferences or otherwise. But the ALP in Queensland is run, controlled and financed by the union movement. I was in Cairns a couple of weeks ago, and the union movement had a roadside stall with placards they were waving around that said, 'Put the LNP last!' If you put the LNP last, that means the Labor Party and their backers in Queensland are preferencing One Nation before the LNP. 


I would like to have Senator Moore say the same words about her backers and funders, the union movement, who are there putting One Nation before the LNP. All the fine words you said, Senator Moore, about domestic violence and violence against women, you would equally say about your union mates, who are urging voters in Queensland to put the LNP last, which, by extension—and you don't have to be very bright to work this out—means that the ALP will be preferencing One Nation before the LNP.




Senator Watt:
  That's not true. Stop lying.




Senator Moore:
  That's just not true.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I'm glad to have the interjections from the two Queensland senators here, because they're both products of the union movement, they are both controlled by the union movement and they are both funded by the union movement. If they will get up here and tell me that the union movement is not running a campaign in Queensland that says, 'Put the LNP last!'—in other words, preference One Nation before the LNP—then I will take that down and write it in gold every day between now and the Queensland state election.


I saw them in Cairns. I've seen them in Townsville with these placards—'Put the LNP last!'—which means Labor voters preference One Nation before the LNP. What they do is their own business, but it is hypocritical for Labor politicians to get up here and blame the LNP for preferencing One Nation when, in fact, the people that run and fund the ALP have workers out today, as we speak, on pre-poll—the CFMEU is out in droves in the electorate of Burdekin, six of them at a time, saying, 'Put the LNP last!' which means, 'We're urging you to support One Nation in a preference before the LNP'. 


This is despicable. It is deliberately misleading, and it is a typical Labor rort in Queensland. The Labor Party say, 'We're not doing it,' but the Labor Party don't run the campaign in Queensland, and they don't fund the campaign in Queensland. The Labor Party do not have the men and women on the polling booths in Queensland. They're all the union thugs from the CFMEU and elsewhere, and they are the ones who are handing out how-to-vote cards saying, 'Put the LNP last!'—in other words, preference One Nation over the LNP.


I conclude where I started, again, to make it very clear that the LNP in the electorate of Thuringowa, which Senator Moore used in her questions, will be preferencing the ALP before preferencing the One Nation candidate. (Time expired)

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-11-15,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:19):  I rise to take note of the answers to questions posed by Senator Moore to Senator Cash today. I have to say I was shocked by Senator Cash's answers to Senator Moore's questions. I was shocked that we would have a minister for women, among whose responsibilities is the protection of women from domestic violence, who seems to have no concern whatsoever for the disgraceful comments made by Senator Hanson and her candidates regarding domestic violence. Senator Moore asked Senator Cash whether she had spoken with Senator Hanson about Senator Hanson's policy that supports violent fathers having visitation rights to their children even when there are court issued protection orders to protect children from those violent fathers. You would think that, if this minister were doing her job properly—standing up for the rights of women fleeing from domestic violence—she would actually take it seriously and she would have a word to Senator Hanson about that policy. She didn't answer that whatsoever. She clearly has not spoken to Senator Hanson about that point. Similarly, Senator Cash has done nothing about the offensive comments put forward by one of Senator Hanson's candidates for the state election regarding domestic violence which were made on his own business's social media pages. As I say, you would think that a minister who was serious about her responsibilities to protect women from domestic violence would do something about that and would take Senator Hanson aside and say, 'Look, what you're saying is unacceptable; maybe you don't understand the issues at play, but here's my perspective,' but she clearly hasn't done anything of the sort.


We know why Senator Cash never takes Senator Hanson on about these matters, and that's because she desperately needs the votes of Senator Hanson and her fellow senators in Canberra to get anything done. We've all seen Senator Cash taking Senator Hanson aside, having a good old joke and giving a pat on the back and a bit of a hug. She's constantly and desperately schmoozing Senator Hanson for her votes. That's why Senator Cash is never prepared to have a hard conversation with Senator Hanson about the grossly offensive and, in some cases, dangerous positions and comments from her party. We also know that Senator Cash has a long history with One Nation. She was one of the architects of the deal between One Nation and the Liberal Party in the Western Australia election. She doesn't want to admit that, but we know that they—she and Senator Cormann—went out for a nice private dinner and did the deal to get those preferences exchanged. So she has form in ignoring and turning a blind eye to the worst excesses of One Nation in order to get their votes here and in order to get their preferences in elections.


But what is going on here at the moment is about a different preference deal. It's not about Western Australian preference deals; it's about Queensland preference deals.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator WATT:
  Senator O'Sullivan probably knows about them as well. The state LNP in Queensland have repeatedly said, 'Oh, no, there's no preference deal between us and One Nation—none at all.' Senator Cash stood up here today and said it again—'No, no, I don't know anything about a preference deal'—just like she didn't know anything about a preference deal in Western Australia, even though she did the deal over a dinner with One Nation. How else do you explain that, in the Queensland state election, the LNP gave its preferences to One Nation in 49 seats—over half of the seats that are being contested? And that's ignoring the large number of seats in which One Nation isn't even standing a candidate.


The Gold Coast is one of the areas that I've been spending most of my time campaigning in and doing most of my activity. We all know that is a key battleground in this election, where there are a number of highly vulnerable LNP seats that are at risk of falling to Labor. Rather than cutting a preference deal with One Nation there, what the LNP and One Nation have done is come to an arrangement where One Nation won't even stand a candidate. That's their way of propping up vulnerable LNP members on the Gold Coast, as they are in so many other places. So Senator Cash and the state LNP back in Queensland are saying: 'No, believe us: there's no deal here whatsoever, just like there's never been a deal anywhere else. It just so happens that, in 49 seats, we're giving One Nation our preferences and, in a number of other seats, including our most vulnerable seats, One Nation isn't even standing a candidate.' If that's not a deal, I don't know what is. How could the Queensland LNP be doing a deal with One Nation? That is a party that makes offensive statements and has offensive positions, policy-wise, on domestic violence. They have a senator who walks in here dressed in a burqa and shames some of our multicultural communities. They're out there—and forgive the language, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle—saying teachers are teaching kids to strap on dildos. And there is the chaos from the anti-vaxxers about autism. Why does the LNP keep doing deals with One Nation? (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-11-15,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:24):  I must be getting used to this place. It's been 15 months since I was elected and I think this is the first day that I have felt truly jaded. I am so sick of us talking about ourselves. We are constantly talking about ourselves. Don't you think that the public is sick to death of hearing us talking about ourselves?


We have so many bigger issues to deal with, and yet we're talking about preference deals. We're talking about what was said in estimates. We're talking about citizenship over and over again. This is madness. We are here to govern. The parliament is supposed to be a solemn place. It is supposed to be a place of considered deliberation. It is supposed to be a contest of ideas, and we are talking about ourselves again—this time, under the shroud of domestic violence. The argument we're having here today in the motion to take note of answers is not about domestic violence, and yet domestic violence is such an important issue. It's an issue that we desperately need to take seriously, and yet you are using it as political opportunism. I find it totally shameful.


There are so many things that we could be talking about. We could be talking about tax policy. We could be talking about tax reform. We could be talking about the $150 million of extra taxes that the Labor Party intend to impose on an unsuspecting public, but they won't talk about that. What they want to talk about is themselves again. We could be talking about energy policy—a transformative energy policy that has been proposed in this place. We have discussed over and over again how important affordable and reliable energy is, and yet the Labor Party—who are completely tied up in knots over their ridiculous and irrational ideological obsession with their Renewable Energy Target—don't want to talk about energy policy. I can understand why, because it is so politically unpopular for you. You don't want to talk about that. What you want to talk about is yourselves, again. Don't you see how frustrated the public are with us talking about ourselves?


If you want to talk about domestic violence, fine, let's talk about domestic violence. The Turnbull government's first cabinet decision was to dedicate $100 million to domestic violence. There is nothing that this government should hang its head in shame for on the issue of domestic violence. In fact, we should stand proud for all that we've done. Please, let me enlighten you to some extent about what has been done by this government in the area of domestic violence. We have dedicated $100 million to technology and to police and healthcare training. Prime Minister Turnbull has taken the lead on this cultural change and, indeed, so has the Attorney-General. In fact, he was speaking just the other day about new specialist domestic violence units—$3.4 million in funding committed to establish six new domestic violence units and support for the expansion of an existing one, ensuring more women can receive the vital legal and social support they need. Family violence is truly devastating. It devastates the lives of tens of thousands of Australians. It affects women and children of all demographics and leaves scars that may last a lifetime on the children who suffer and witness it. Yet what you have done today is shameful. What you have done is pure political opportunism. Rather than talking about what's important in this place, which is debating and contesting ideas—rather than talking about tax reform, energy reform, the new trade agreement with Peru or banking and superannuation reforms—you have taken a truly important issue that affects so many, that has devastated so many lives, and you have created a political hobbyhorse.


This is a place of dignity. It is a place of solemn and thorough consideration of issues. There will always be political argy-bargy, but your insinuations and accusations today are completely out of line, and you know it. The integrity of senators here has never been in doubt. It's never been in doubt by the leadership. It's never been in doubt in my mind and, let's face it, it's never been in doubt in your mind either. What you have done today is political opportunism. It is opportunistic deflection at best; it is shameless and immoral disingenuousness at worst. I hope you hang your heads in shame, because this is not what this place is for.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-11-15,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:29):  I think what's become clear is that the acting lessons that Senator Cash has had are compulsory on the other side, because we've just seen another performance. There is a serious element to this, and Senator Moore explained this. Election campaigns often put a spotlight on policy. That's what's happened in Queensland with the One Nation policy on domestic violence. Basically what this means is that One Nation's domestic violence policy supports violent fathers having visitation rights despite court issued protection orders. That is what their policy is. That is what is on the One Nation website. The reality is that the fact that the Liberals are preferencing One Nation in 49 seats means that, if One Nation wins seats in Queensland, it is going to be because of their preferences. That is the reality; that is why this is a serious issue. 


I just wanted to take up the point that Senator Macdonald raised, because I can't let that sit. No party in Australia has done more than the Queensland branch of the Labor Party to defeat One Nation. In every election since One Nation have been on the scene, we have put them last. We will do that in this election campaign and we will continue to do it for as long as One Nation exists.


Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you'd be aware of this: if there's one thing you'd say about Senator Cash it is that she is a vigilant minister. She is so vigilant that we know that on occasion her office tips off journos to get down to see a raid that's going on. But you'd have to say on this issue that she's been less than vigilant. We raised this serious issue. Senator Cash had the opportunity to condemn it, but Senator Cash did not. I think that speaks volumes for the relationship between One Nation and the Liberal-National Party in this chamber and indeed across Australia. Since I got elected, I've seen the way that they've operated in this place. We know that One Nation vote with the LNP 85 per cent of the time in the Senate. We know how important those votes are and the damage that it does to Queenslanders and Australians. We know they voted for anti-work laws. We know they voted to cut pensions. We know they voted for education cuts as well, and there's been a pattern around Australia. We know what they did in WA for the state election. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you know that particularly well, given that's your home state. We also know what is going on in Queensland, where the LNP are preferencing One Nation in 49 seats. This will have consequences. 


Senator Macdonald mentioned Thuringowa. He didn't mention the how-to-vote card his home seat of Burdekin. I've got it here in front of me, and the LNP will be preferencing, No. 2, Sam Cox, One Nation candidate, ahead of the Labor Party. In the seat where he actually lives, they're preferencing One Nation ahead of Labor. You might say something different in Thuringowa, but we know what they're doing in Burdekin and we know what they are doing in 49 seats across the state. This will be the key point between now and the election; indeed, this will go to the next federal election as well. 


Tim Nicholls likes to say he will provide stability, but you can't provide stability when you're preferencing One Nation in 49 seats. You are the ones who are going to be responsible for electing more of them to parliament at the state level, and it is something that you will wear around your necks. The voting record that we're seeing is something that will be an issue in the state campaign, and it will also be an issue in the lead-up to the next federal campaign. We know that former Senator Roberts made the quick switch across to run in Ipswich. It's already becoming a dominant issue in Ipswich. We know the record of Senator Roberts. We know that he was a former Liberal. We know that he will be someone who would potentially be a Treasurer in a Nicholls LNP government. This is what it has become. It's become a coalition—a Liberal-National Party-One Nation coalition operating in the Senate—and it will be coming to Queensland soon enough as well. 


If stability is going to be the focus of this election campaign, whilst the LNP are doing what they are with preferences, whilst they are preferencing One Nation in 49 seats, they don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to stability. They will be the ones responsible for electing more One Nation members to parliament. They will be the ones who will do a deal with them to form government. And we know what the consequences will be—we've seen it played out across Australia, and it will be something that will be coming to Queensland—cuts to basic services, cuts to health and a focus on whacky conspiracy theories, when what Queensland needs is a stable Labor government, and it's only Annastacia Palaszczuk who can provide that.

Leave granted.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I table an explanatory memorandum. I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I introduce the Judiciary Amendment (Commonwealth Model Litigant Obligations) Bill 2017.


The purpose of the bill is to subject Commonwealth litigants to enforceable model litigant obligations.


The Attorney-General already has discretion to issue obligations for Commonwealth litigants to act as a model litigant. 


He exercised this discretion most recently in March 2017, requiring the Commonwealth to assess and deal with claims promptly, to pay legitimate claims, to consider alternative dispute resolution, to keep the costs of litigation to a minimum, for example by not requiring the other party to prove a matter the Commonwealth knows to be true, to not take advantage of a claimant lacking resources to litigate a legitimate claim, and to apologise when the Commonwealth has acted wrongfully.


In its Access to Justice Arrangements report of 2014, the Productivity Commission recommended that each government should impose enforceable model litigant obligations on its agencies, given government's power, resources, 'frequent-player status' and role of acting in the public interest. The Commission noted that this would not prevent governments from acting firmly to protect their interests.


In 2016 the Commonwealth Government dismissed this recommendation based on fears of increased costs and delays. 


However, model litigant obligations include obligations to reduce costs and delays, and making these obligations enforceable is likely to translate this theory of reduced costs and delays into reality.


My bill would compel future Attorneys-General to maintain the practice of issuing binding obligations to act as a model litigant, and would make these obligations enforceable. 


Firstly, the bill establishes a process by which the Commonwealth Ombudsman can investigate a complaint about a Commonwealth litigant failing to act in accordance with its obligations as a model litigant. 


Secondly, the bill empowers a court to order a stay of proceedings while the Ombudsman considers a complaint. Thirdly, the bill provides that, if the court is satisfied that the Commonwealth litigant has contravened or is likely to contravene the model litigant obligations, the court may make any order it considers appropriate. 


For example, the court could make an order with regards to the Commonwealth litigant's future conduct, or it could issue a costs order against the Commonwealth litigant in response to a past failure to act as a model litigant.


This bill demonstrates that the Productivity Commission's recommendation can be enacted responsibly. It shows that the Commonwealth Government's theoretical fears about increased costs and delays are misplaced, and that an opportunity for reduced costs and delays beckons. 


This bill is modest, sensible and practical, and I commend it to the Senate.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill establishes caps and reporting requirements for the remuneration of executives in the Commonwealth public service. The Greens believe for the broader issue of excessive executive remuneration to be tackled, and for the pay gap between the rich and the poor to be bridged, this is a good first place to start. Because the government has a role to play in setting public service salaries, Parliament can play a leadership role in tackling growing wage inequality, and set public service executive salaries to better conform to community expectations and standards. There is power and purpose in this symbolism.


Ordinary Australians are coming to realise that the economic reforms of the last thirty-odd years haven't delivered all the benefits that were promised to them. People are beginning to realise that our political and economic system has failed them, and that it favours the wealthy and powerful. The strong sense of this is fuelling discontent with politics and a decline in respect for institutions globally. This growing tide of anti-establishment sentiment will only serve to increase political volatility and introduces its own set of challenges for parliaments. 


Globally and in Australia, workers have increased their output, but wages have not kept up with productivity. Companies are making more money, but workers are getting a smaller share of the pie. Ordinary Australians are being asked to accept less security and be more 'flexible', but a casualised workforce is far from relaxing.


There is no more conspicuous example of income inequality that the growing disparity between what executives—our bosses—are paid and what ordinary workers are paid. The spectacle of executives taking home fat pay-packets while wages are growing at the slowest rate on record is emblematic of a system gone wrong. This does not need to be so and should not be so.


There is little evidence that, beyond a certain point, increased remuneration provides an incentive for executives to perform better. Senior executives are rarely as uniquely skilled or as valuable as excessive salaries would suggest.


There is also little evidence that excessive executive salaries make for better workplaces. Conversely, a large pay gap between executives and workers can have a negative impact on employee satisfaction and self-worth. 


However, there is evidence to suggest that excessive executive salaries have become self-reinforcing phenomena. Excessive salaries can encourage people motivated by big money to manoeuvre themselves into these positions. In doing so they risk the creation of a rarefied club; and encouraging an organisational culture that emphasises the importance of money rather than the importance of the job: public service. Ultimately, this offers up the self-serving justification: it's the market rate, it must be right.


Well it isn't right, and we should call this out. More broadly, wage inequality is becoming a drag on economic performance and social cohesion. To the extent that executive pay contributes to pay inequity—and is emblematic of it—it should be of concern to anyone interested in a fairer and more prosperous society.


The Commonwealth public service has not been immune from the trend towards excessive executive salaries. Since 2010, the salaries the Senior Executive Service has risen 18%, and that of Commonwealth Departmental Secretaries even more. Over the same period, the salaries of lower ranking public servants have risen just 13%.


This is not acceptable. The current system is clearly failing to reward employees equally. It's time for the Parliament to take additional steps to restore some balance. It's time to make sure everyone in the public service gets a fairer go.


The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the Act) sets standards for Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth companies. Within the framework provided by the act, this bill inserts requirements relating to the remuneration of executives.


This bill will establish a cap on the total remuneration of senior executives, inclusive of any performance payments or other bonuses, at five times the average earnings of full-time adults across the Australian public service. The introduction of this cap will close the gap between the wages of public sector executives and those of ordinary Australians. Thereafter, this cap will ensure that public sector executives do not get a pay rise greater than that of average workers.


The effect of this will be to reduce the maximum salary of executives in the public service to an amount, on current figures, in the order of $420,000. This is still a lot of money, and much more than most people earn. However, it would be a significant reduction in salary for the most highly paid public servants, and would cut the wages of some by as much as half.


In time, the introduction of this pay cap is also likely to lead to a reduction, in real terms, of the wages of second tier management. Remuneration in the public service is structured around a hierarchy of pay grades. So as to maintain a premium for the chiefs, second tier management will likely see their wages stagnate for a period while a new hierarchy is established within the cap.


Finally, the introduction of this cap will help break up the 'normalisation' of the club. It will directly challenge the idea that excessive executive pay is inevitable and, in doing so, will set an example for the private sector.


This bill also introduces annual public reporting requirements. Commonwealth departments and companies covered by the act will be required to report annually on the total remuneration of executives, the ratio of total remuneration to the average wage, and the ratio of total remuneration to the minimum wage.


Introducing ongoing transparency and comparisons for executive pay in the public service will ensure that there is a constant reminder of the level of disparity that exists within the wage structure.


If the parliament is to speak with any authority on inequality, then it must lead by example and structure remuneration in the Commonwealth public service in a way that is fair and reasonable. Sky-high executive salaries are an affront on the dignity of ordinary workers, and are deeply unpopular with most Australians. Dramatic pay inequity inherently devalues the efforts of lower-ranking employees. For the sake of respect we need to take steps to put limits on executive pay.

The PRESIDENT:  There is no objection.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator BRANDIS:
  The effect of this motion will be to bring on for debate the private senator's bill put forward by Senator Smith to enable the parliament to give effect to the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people to change the law to allow same-sex couples to marry. This delivers on the Prime Minister's promise to facilitate such a debate in the event of a yes vote. The debate will now proceed in the usual manner for dealing with a private senator's bill, subject to the timetable provided for by the motion. The debate on the second reading will begin tomorrow. It is the government's intention that the debate will continue until the bill, with whatever amendments the Senate may agree to at the committee stage, is finally disposed of. I envisage that that is likely to be by the end of next Senate sitting week.


The Prime Minister and I and other members of the government have always said that there should be strong protections for religious freedom and freedom of conscience. Different senators will have their own views about whether the protections in Senator Smith's bill go far enough. I myself would prefer to see them go further, so I foreshadow that in the committee stage of the debate I will move an amendment to extend the right of conscientious objection to performing a ceremony of marriage from ministers of religion to include civil marriage celebrants as well. That is not a government position—there is no government position on a private senator's bill—but my own private view. Nothing in this bill inhibits the right of churches or of people of religious faith generally to continue to adhere to the doctrines and teachings of their church when it comes to marriage and to speak freely of those teachings, and to bring up their children in accordance with the tenets of their faith. Some have suggested incorrectly that the effect of the bill may be to limit that right. To put the matter beyond doubt, I will also move an amendment to make it clear that nothing in the bill makes it unlawful for people to hold and to express the views of their own religion on the subject of marriage. Such an amendment would not in any way derogate from the primary purpose of the bill, to enable same-sex couples to marry, but would make it clear that, as the Prime Minister and I have always said, that reform and the protection of religious freedom are not inconsistent. I thank the Senate.

I, too, share the view that we, as a government, and we, as a parliament, need to have this matter resolved. There is an inevitability about the passage of this bill, but I want to be certain that people out there who want the protections to which they're entitled know that they have strong voices still within this due process. We will debate it and bring amendments respectfully because, I think, we all share one view: we want to create legislation here that brings a nation together and doesn't leave the potential for a nation to be divided.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:11):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WONG:
  I thank the Senate. I'll be very brief. I'll just make a few comments. The first is in relation to the context in which this bill is being brought forward by a number of colleagues from around the chamber, and I thank all of them for their co-sponsorship of it. Australians have done their part and it is now time for the Senate to do its part. Australians have voted very clearly to change the law and it's time for the parliament to reflect that perspective. I make this point: in relation to the time frame, Senator Brandis envisages that this bill will be finalised by Thursday of the next sitting week. That is, in fact, what the procedure set out in the motion provides for. This will be a debate which will conclude at the conclusion of the next sitting week, for the Senate's part.


In relation to the amendments, and in the spirit of the respectful way in which others have contributed to this debate, I won't go into a long debate about this. We do have the view that the Australian people voted to lessen discrimination and not to extend it. That is our view. We also take the view that the Senate committee bill doesn't change or take away any existing protections for religious freedom. I trust that the Senate will bear in mind the nature of the vote that has been reported today as we proceed to debate this bill.


I will also make a point about the management of debate. There's obviously a free vote amongst the major parties on the substantive issue. There will be the need to ensure that there is time for consideration within groups of amendments, and I would encourage senators who are seeking to put amendments to try to ensure that those are provided early to enable various groupings around the chamber to consider them carefully. In closing, I simply say this: I believe the Australian people voted to remove discrimination and I trust the bill will reflect that.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:13):  I seek leave to make a brief statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I will be brief. Today, Australia spoke resoundingly in support of marriage equality and in support of ending discrimination—not extending it, not entrenching it. The Greens have had a longstanding position in this place through my predecessors senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne. Indeed, every MP who has represented the Greens has been a strong supporter of marriage equality. I do want to make a point though about amendments. There was an opportunity for all supporters of marriage equality to discuss this issue through the very extensive cross-party committee process that was engaged in several months ago. It was through that process that the issue of potential amendments was raised, and significant ground was given on all sides. Let me make it very clear: the Greens made significant concessions in ensuring that a cross-party bill that got widespread support would be able to be presented to this chamber. We engaged in that committee process in good faith, knowing that we would have to give some ground if this parliament was to support it. This bill is not the bill the Greens would have introduced if we were proposing legislation ourselves.


I just say to people, particularly those people in support of marriage equality: we have already made our position very, very clear when it comes to amendments. The consensus position that we arrived at through that cross-party bill was the position that the Greens support and that we would not be entering into discussions about further extending discrimination in law. I would just say to every person who supports ending discrimination in this place: think very, very carefully about entrenching discrimination in order to appease your colleagues, rather than listening to the Australian people who spoke loudly and clearly today.

 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:17):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator SMITH:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill amends the Marriage Act 1961 to remove the restrictions that limit marriage in Australia to the union of a man and a woman. The bill will allow two people to marry in Australia, regardless of their sex or gender.


The bill will also recognise foreign same-sex marriages in Australia. 


The requirements for a legally valid marriage otherwise remain the same under the Marriage Act.


It will continue to be the case that a marriage is void if one or both parties are already legally married, the parties are in a 'prohibited relationship' (siblings, a parent-child relationship), one or both parties did not provide real consent, or one or both parties are not of marriageable age.


The architecture of the bill has been informed following the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Exposure Draft of the Marriage Amendment (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill.


This bill further refines and improves the exposure draft legislation to more accurately reflect community attitudes expressed through the senate committee process.


The Senate select committee report identified a broad desire and willingness from parties (including pro-same-sex marriage groups) to protect religious freedom in respect to marriage in any future same-sex marriage legislation.


The Senate report identified considerable consensus for a continuation of exemptions for ministers of religion and to create a new category of religious marriage celebrants. There was also consensus agreement that any laws or exemptions need not single out same-sex couples. The Senate committee also proposed a pathway for current civil celebrants to become religious marriage celebrants, while all remaining and future civil celebrants would continue to provide non-discriminatory services. 


The Senate report did not recommend introducing controversial new provisions which lack precedent within Australia's legal framework (conscientious belief, a 'no detriment' clause, exemptions for individuals). In keeping with the consensus reached by the Senate select committee, this bill does not include these provisions.


Australia's marriage laws have been amended on 20 occasions since the introduction of the Marriage Act.


These latest proposed amendments will insert an 'objects clause' which will create a legal framework to: 


(a) allow civil celebrants to solemnise marriage, understood as the union of two people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life;


(b) allow ministers of religion to solemnise marriage, respecting the doctrines, tenets and beliefs of their religion, the views of their religious community or their own religious beliefs; and 


(c) allow equal access to marriage while protecting religious freedom in relation to marriage.


The bill will allow a minister of religion to refuse to solemnise a marriage if that refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the minister's religion.


This would allow ministers of religion to refuse to solemnise a same-sex marriage where the minister's religion only allows heterosexual couples to marry.


The bill will create a new category of religious marriage celebrants. 


This new category will include:


(a) existing civil marriage celebrants wanting to perform marriages consistent with their religious beliefs; and 


(b) ministers of religion that perform marriages for religious denominations that are not recognised, such as independent religious organisations and smaller, emerging religious groups.


This new category of religious marriage celebrant will be able to refuse to solemnise a marriage on grounds that the religious marriage celebrant's religious beliefs do not allow them to solemnise the marriage.


The bill will require marriage celebrants who are not religious marriage celebrants – colloquially referred to as civil celebrants – to perform same-sex marriages and will be subject to existing anti-discrimination laws.


The bill will also establish a new category of marriage officer to solemnise marriages of members of the Australian Defence Force overseas, as proposed in the Senate report.


The bill will allow bodies established for religious purpose to be able to refuse to make a facility available or provide goods and services, for the purposes of, or reasonably incidental, to the solemnisation of a marriage. 


Consistent with existing anti-discrimination law, the refusal must conform to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion of that body or be necessary to avoid injury to the susceptibilities of adherents to that religion.


It is worth noting that bodies established for religious purposes already have a similar exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Inclusion of this in the bill will reaffirm their exemption in relation to the solemnisation of marriage.


The bill will ensure the Sex Discrimination Act is amended to give full effect to the religious protections in the bill.


It should be noted the parliament has previously determined the ability of religious organisations to lawfully discriminate in the provision of goods and services (including hiring of facilities for weddings or marriage related services such as catering) where this discrimination would accord with the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of their religious order or would be necessary to avoid injury to the susceptibilities of adherents to their religion.


The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act that enshrined this position were passed by the former Labor Government with support from the Coalition Opposition.


The bill follows the Senate report in not including provisions which are inconsistent with existing anti-discrimination law, create a dangerous precedent or raise complex legal matters about the intersection of federal, state and territory law.


Australian discrimination law already sets the standard and balances competing rights. These laws have operated without significant controversy for a number of years.


Finally, this bill gives effect to the view that all Australians should have equal access to Australia's marriage laws and that extending marriage to same-sex couples will strengthen and not diminish marriage in Australia.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:11):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WONG:
  I thank the Senate. I'll be very brief. I'll just make a few comments. The first is in relation to the context in which this bill is being brought forward by a number of colleagues from around the chamber, and I thank all of them for their co-sponsorship of it. Australians have done their part and it is now time for the Senate to do its part. Australians have voted very clearly to change the law and it's time for the parliament to reflect that perspective. I make this point: in relation to the time frame, Senator Brandis envisages that this bill will be finalised by Thursday of the next sitting week. That is, in fact, what the procedure set out in the motion provides for. This will be a debate which will conclude at the conclusion of the next sitting week, for the Senate's part.


In relation to the amendments, and in the spirit of the respectful way in which others have contributed to this debate, I won't go into a long debate about this. We do have the view that the Australian people voted to lessen discrimination and not to extend it. That is our view. We also take the view that the Senate committee bill doesn't change or take away any existing protections for religious freedom. I trust that the Senate will bear in mind the nature of the vote that has been reported today as we proceed to debate this bill.


I will also make a point about the management of debate. There's obviously a free vote amongst the major parties on the substantive issue. There will be the need to ensure that there is time for consideration within groups of amendments, and I would encourage senators who are seeking to put amendments to try to ensure that those are provided early to enable various groupings around the chamber to consider them carefully. In closing, I simply say this: I believe the Australian people voted to remove discrimination and I trust the bill will reflect that.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:13):  I seek leave to make a brief statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I will be brief. Today, Australia spoke resoundingly in support of marriage equality and in support of ending discrimination—not extending it, not entrenching it. The Greens have had a longstanding position in this place through my predecessors senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne. Indeed, every MP who has represented the Greens has been a strong supporter of marriage equality. I do want to make a point though about amendments. There was an opportunity for all supporters of marriage equality to discuss this issue through the very extensive cross-party committee process that was engaged in several months ago. It was through that process that the issue of potential amendments was raised, and significant ground was given on all sides. Let me make it very clear: the Greens made significant concessions in ensuring that a cross-party bill that got widespread support would be able to be presented to this chamber. We engaged in that committee process in good faith, knowing that we would have to give some ground if this parliament was to support it. This bill is not the bill the Greens would have introduced if we were proposing legislation ourselves.


I just say to people, particularly those people in support of marriage equality: we have already made our position very, very clear when it comes to amendments. The consensus position that we arrived at through that cross-party bill was the position that the Greens support and that we would not be entering into discussions about further extending discrimination in law. I would just say to every person who supports ending discrimination in this place: think very, very carefully about entrenching discrimination in order to appease your colleagues, rather than listening to the Australian people who spoke loudly and clearly today.

The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senate Siewert.


Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


The complete failure of the Turnbull Government to develop a climate and energy policy, resulting in Australia's emissions increasing since 2013 and contributing to an increase in global carbon pollution in 2017.


Is the proposal supported?




More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—




The PRESIDENT:  I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-11-15,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:19):  As climate change talks commence in Bonn, a report released on Monday shows that global carbon emissions have risen in 2017 by two per cent on 2016 levels. This means the world will belch 37 billion tonnes of CO2 this year alone. Let's reflect on that. We have seen an increase in global carbon emissions at a time when the science is telling us that we urgently need to reduce emissions. 


On the Turnbull government's watch, since 2013, Australia's emissions have continued to increase. Since 2013—I say that again—our emissions have continued to go up and up and up. We are now facing the loss of the Great Barrier Reef. We are seeing global climate systems completely disrupted, record storms through the Atlantic and records broken through each year, and yet we see our emissions here in Australia continue to increase. Why has that occurred? It is because we have a government with no plan to cut pollution, no coherent climate policy and no coherent energy policy. This is a government totally captured by the fossil fuel interests of its big business donors. The government has ruled out a renewable energy target. It has ruled out a clean energy target, despite commissioning the Chief Scientist to conduct a comprehensive report on it. It has of course ruled out the most efficient mechanism by which to reduce emissions—that is, a comprehensive, economy-wide price on carbon pollution. 


We now have the introduction of the farcical National Energy Guarantee, a policy designed to put a handbrake on renewables and to keep dirty coal-fired power stations open. In one of the most bizarre turns this year, we saw the Prime Minister instruct one of the big energy operators to keep a dirty, polluting coal-fired power station open, as the centrepiece of the government's climate policy. This coal-fired power station would be more at home in 1960s Russia than it is in a modern, 21st century economy. Sadly, the LNP is absolutely hell-bent on appeasing the coal lobby and, of course, on appeasing its own vocal right wing, led by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. It's prioritising its big corporate donations from the fossil fuel industry over a livable climate, over our precious places like the Great Barrier Reef. It seems its intention is to make sure that the dollars just keep rolling in and that vested interests are kept on side: 'We've got to have the money flowing, even if we lose the Great Barrier Reef, even if people are in climates and environments that are uninhabitable.' It seems that the dollars are much more important than our children's and our grandchildren's future. 


We are seeing now in Bonn that Australia is trashing our international reputation. We are an international pariah right now, receiving a Fossil of the Day Award, following on from the prestigious awards that we were able to win at the previous climate talks and the ones before that. ANU Professor Frank Jotzo says that the possibility of achieving Australia's 2030 Paris climate target is now slipping away, slipping further from reach. This is a disgrace. The science is telling us in which direction we need to be moving, and we have a Liberal Party taking us in precisely the opposite direction. Our neighbours are so frustrated by Australia's behaviour that we had the leader of Tuvalu publicly declaring, 'Australia is stuck in the Dark Ages with its reliance on dirty fossil fuels.' 


We are at crisis point. We have an opportunity to take our economy out of the 19th century and into the 21st century, with a solution that is good for jobs, good for prices and, most importantly of all, good for the environment. We Greens have a plan to do that. We've got a policy that sets out a plan to transition communities so that Australia can go from being the worst per capita polluter in the world to one of the best, least-polluting countries. We can do that by making sure that we produce at least 90 per cent of our energy from clean, renewable energy resources. We can do that by 2030. Of course, we need to stop the Carmichael Adani mine in its tracks if we are to have any chance of meeting the climate targets that we agreed to in Paris, if we are to have any chance of achieving that two-degree temperature reduction that the climate so desperately needs. 


Queensland are about to head to the polls. They know the Greens are the party standing between them and the construction of the Adani coalmine. They know that we are the only party that have committed to ensuring that this mine does not get built—and that means no taxpayer funded handouts, regardless of whatever form they take. We were pleased to see, under pressure, the Queensland state government indicate they would refuse to support the NAIF loan, but this is the same party that has supported secret royalty deals to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. That is taxpayer money going to support a project that will cook the planet. It is the Queensland Labor Party, of course with the support of the LNP opposition, that wants to give that Adani mine unlimited access to groundwater in the Great Artesian Basin. It is the same party that wants to continue to see that rail line being built, that port being built and the risk to the Great Barrier Reef as that coal is shipped through to go on to continue to fuel dangerous climate change.


Queenslanders now have a choice. In a few days time they have an opportunity to put in place three wonderful, outstanding representatives—Kirsten Lovejoy in McConnel, Amy MacMahon in South Brisbane and Michael Berkman in Maiwar—to send a very strong statement to whoever should form government in Queensland at the next election that the community does not want to see that Adani mine built. Today we learnt that the former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and Minister Canavan have written to the Chinese government and said, 'If private financiers won't fund it, we want you to fund it.' It's another secret deal that we see this government entering into, with the Chinese government, begging for support for that coalmine. In a few short days the people of Queensland will have an opportunity to make such a strong statement about where their values stand. The only thing that stands between them and the Adani coalmine is the Australian Greens. Vote for Kirsten Lovejoy, Amy MacMahon and Michael Berkman and say to the next Queensland government, 'This cannot be built.' (Time expired)

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2017-11-15,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (16:27):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance proposed by Senator Siewert of the Greens. I have to say, I'm not surprised by the breathtaking level of economic illiteracy on display. As everyone in this place knows, Australia's carbon footprint is a minuscule percentage of global emissions and, even if we were to slash our carbon output to zero, it would have no impact on global temperatures.


The government is taking strong action required to protect Australian industry, to protect Australian jobs, to keep the lights on and to comply with our international obligations. Those opposite would rather see working Australians out of a job as those jobs are moved offshore to countries with much cheaper electricity than Australia, often with electricity that's generated by burning Australian coal! The irony of that should not be lost on anybody.


When the South Australian Labor government demolished coal-fired power stations, the stations were having no impact on global temperatures but the government were condemning their state to a second summer of brownouts, potential blackouts and energy rationing. Obviously, it's almost impossible—it's very, very difficult, indeed—to keep a viable manufacturing sector going if you have those sorts of pressures. Conversely, the government have a plan to make our electricity supply more reliable and more efficient while, at the same time, meeting our international emissions reduction obligations. Through the coalition's National Energy Guarantee, we are bringing to an end government subsidies for renewable energy, which will bring us back to a technology-neutral energy policy which will allow energy providers to invest in the reliable, baseload capacity that Australians need.


The National Energy Guarantee is made up of two parts, integrating both energy and climate policy. The first is a reliability guarantee that is set to ensure a reliable level of dispatchable energy is always available from ready-to-use sources such as coal, gas, pumped hydro and, potentially, batteries. This guarantee will be set by the experts—the AEMC and the Australian Energy Market Operator. The second is an emissions guarantee, which will be set to ensure we continue to meet our international commitments. The level of this guarantee will be determined by the Commonwealth and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator. The National Energy Guarantee is a practical, workable, pro-market policy to increase the affordability and reliability of our energy system whilst also meeting our international commitments.


Once again—and I think this is a very important point—we have to highlight that the policy is technology neutral. Our policy allows energy providers to make decisions on the source of supply whilst maintaining reliability. 'Reliability'—it's another word for keeping the lights on. I reiterate: there will be no subsidies, no taxes and no emissions trading scheme. This policy will provide power generators with the certainty they require to invest in the latest technologies—whatever technology is most efficient and effective for meeting their obligations. It could be batteries; it could be the next generation of low-emission, high-efficiency coal-fired power stations. Who knows? One day we might see a fourth-generation nuclear reactor or some new technology that, quite frankly, nobody in this place even knows about yet. These cutting-edge, low-emission technologies can produce cheap, reliable energy for Australians while simultaneously reducing our dependency on gas and our vulnerability to fluctuations on the price and supply of LNG.


Our policy isn't based on ideology; it's based on a deliberative evaluation of the evidence. The government doesn't engage in knee-jerk, ideological policymaking. That is why we commissioned the Finkel review into the future of the national energy market, following the disastrous statewide energy blackout experienced in South Australia in September 2016. It's simply not acceptable that, in a First World country as prosperous and energy-rich as Australia, we'd find ourselves in a situation where we cannot keep the lights on just because it happens to be a bit warm. We're used to it being a bit warm.


In addition to implementing the National Energy Guarantee, the coalition is already implementing a number of Finkel review recommendations in conjunction with state and territory governments, including the energy security obligation, which provides the necessary support services that have traditionally come from coal generation and assist in stabilising the system as the level of intermittent generation increases. We're also implementing a requirement that there be a three-year notice of closure, requiring large generators to give notice before closing their facilities. This gives the market time to plan and invest in the system. Whilst some will jump up and down, bemoaning the end of the renewable energy subsidies, I would remind them of the words of Australia's Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, who described this plan as 'a credible mechanism'—this is from the country's most authoritative voice on energy matters.


When we're thinking about the guarantee, we should look at who is out there supporting it. We have seen support for the plan from across a wide range of industry groups and industry sectors. We've seen it from the BCA, ACCI, AiG, Manufacturing Australia and the Energy Users' Association. We've seen it from employers like BHP, BlueScope and JBS meat processors—large energy users. We've also seen support from the energy industry itself: Origin, AGL, EnergyAustralia and Energy Networks Australia. We've seen it from the irrigation sector. We've seen it from the grocers. We've seen it from the mining industry. We've seen it from the forest products industry. We've seen it from groups involved in infrastructure. We've seen it from the Grattan Institute and from energy consumers. The CEO of BCA, representing more than one million Australian jobs, says:


It is the most practicable, workable thing we've seen in business for quite some time.


The CEO of BlueScope, Australia's largest manufacturer, said:


It turns the game around—where now, the effective functioning of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals is the priority.


That's a very important point. We need to get back to reliability again. The effective functioning of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals is the priority. Surely no-one in this place would say that should not be the priority of anybody setting Australia's energy policy going forward?


We've also seen from the coalition government a significant amount of work in this space on the domestic gas supply. This affects the eastern states much more than my home state of Western Australia, where we are very fortunate to be very gas rich. In fact, part of what the coalition government is doing is undertaking a feasibility study in an east-west pipeline to see whether the vast resources of gas in Western Australia can be economically transported to the eastern states, which would obviously open a new market for Western Australian gas but would also add to the reliability and put downward pressure on costs in the eastern states, which currently have some of the highest energy prices in the world.


On the east coast itself, the coalition government secured a deal with the gas producers that will cover projected shortfalls in domestic gas supply in 2018 and 2019. This has already delivered results, with Origin committing to put 41 petajoules into the domestic gas market starting 1 November 2017 through to 2018. Again, we're making sure there is enough gas for Australia. This is about providing the reliability of supply to keep our manufacturers in business, to keep the turbines spinning and to keep the power going into people's homes, people's businesses, hospitals, banks and schools. This is a very positive outcome and it was a welcome relief to Australian households and businesses who have been struggling with the lack of supply and high prices.


The long-term solution, as I've said, is the National Energy Guarantee. We obviously need to keep working on the detail of this policy with the state and territory governments, but this is a plan that will deliver real benefits to the people of Australia. This is a plan that will deliver a reliable energy supply to the households and businesses of Australia whilst meeting our international obligations—again, very important. We are meeting our international obligations and I'm very proud to be part of a government that is doing so.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2017-11-15,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:36):  It is interesting that the first two speakers have summed up many of the debates that we've had in this place since I arrived. Senator Di Natale, in his contribution, started by referring to the current international conference that's being held on energy and climate in Bonn and talking about the information which has been widely circulated—many people have read it—in terms of concerns about where our world is going in the international response to energy and concerns going to our future. Senator Brockman, when he started his contribution, after he made the traditional slap at the Greens for their economic knowledge, made the point, and we've heard this so many times in this place, that we are a low emitter and that nothing we can do here will have any impact on the international stage. The natural consideration that came from that, although Senator Brockman did not say this, is: why should we do anything? I've been here through many debates about what our role is, what we should be doing about climate change nationally and what our energy policy is. It seems to me that those two represent the extremes in the debate. There does not seem to be any understanding of a common response to the issue. That's one of the real issues. Senator Siewert's proposal says: the failure of the government to develop an effective energy plan. Certainly the shadow minister in our party, Mr Butler, has talked in many places recently about the series of attempts there have been under this government to come up with a plan and that still, in November 2017, we do not have a detailed plan before us.


I'll give a little bit of the history first because I looked it up and I feel as though I should mention it. In terms of the process, the emissions intensity scheme was talked about in 2014-15. It was a proposal from the Australian Energy Market Commission, AEMC, in 2015 which was the result of a large amount of consultation about what should be the national energy plan. By and large, that's what went to the last election: modelling to ensure that there was an emissions intensity scheme according to the different baselines, making an emissions reduction target of 45 per cent by 2030. The idea was that this would respond to concerns raised by industry, by households and by the wider community about exactly how our energy system fits and what the best way to operate it is. Importantly, I think there is a growing awareness of the way the world operates in terms of emissions—that it doesn't matter where the emissions come from; they still build up, so we cannot segment ourselves in Australia or in New Zealand or in Bonn. We have to look at the overall issue, because we cannot hide from the international impact. 


This has been brought home to me very clearly, as I believe it has with you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, when we have had the opportunity to talk with people in our Pacific areas. I've been very, very impressed by the range of discussions I've had with our Pacific neighbours, not only with people in government but also with people in the wider community, in civil society. Farmers that I have met in different areas openly discuss issues of climate change and how it impacts on their livelihoods and on their life. In the Pacific, we have seen land being lost to the sea. There's no firmer argument to the fact that something is happening than actually seeing that your own backyard is disappearing. A call has been made by our neighbours that we do have an international responsibility. That's part of the wider discussion. This is not something that you can separate and put to the side. This is part of the discussion we must have in Australia about how we develop a plan and what the international and domestic obligations are going to be. We cannot hide from that. 


As I mentioned, the emissions intensity scheme was plan 1 on the agenda, and the government moved away from that. They said that it wasn't going to happen and that they would move in another direction. That was when we first heard about the intention to refer a general investigation to the Chief Scientist. We discussed that in this place. I can remember having discussions about what the role would be, how the Chief Scientist would consult and the public way in which he would go out and seek a range of views on how to develop an effective energy policy from the scientists, from the users, from the community and in fact from anyone who wanted to be involved, because this was a public process. The information on what was going on was put out to the community and people had the opportunity to put in submissions. Then, based on those submissions, there were a range of public hearings and discussions. That is a format with which we are familiar; it was very similar to the way we operate in the committee process. 


The response across the board again proved that people in the community wanted to be involved in decisions about our energy policy. They were not backward in coming forward, in bringing forward a whole range of ideas and concerns. Not all agreed. We never have full consensus in this space, but it showed that people were thinking about these issues and wanted to be involved, but they wanted their government to listen and they wanted their government to come up with a plan. Out of that came the quite detailed Finkel review process. We debated that in here, Madam Acting Deputy President. I feel certain we had a bit of a go at each other—probably; that is the way it works. We debated how the Finkel process would operate, how his recommendations would be implemented and why there was an expectation that change would happen. That was an agreement. There was a recommendation from Finkel particularly around renewable energy targets, the sources of our energy, how it would operate, taking into account all the concerns that had been raised and the best minds who work daily in this space. 


Then the government moved away from that process as well and we heard there was going to be another process. We heard that through someone coming into the chamber and telling us that there was going to be another iteration of a plan. Senator Brockman mentioned the details of that plan in his contribution. I was pleased, because he had 10 minutes, but we only have an eight-page document in front of us to cover all the intricacies of the plan in public knowledge, and I think he did a really good job. I think he mentioned most of the public awareness and knowledge of the so-called NEG that's now before us as the plan that's going forward. I remember clearly at our recent Senate estimates process that we were asking a range of questions about exactly what the new plan was and what modelling was being done on how it would actually work. What we need to have is not theory, though it's very important to have a solid base of theory.


I look across to the One Nation team and I expect to see Senator Roberts there because he was such a strong contributor to the debate and he kept asking for empirical evidence. He wanted evidence around plans, which is an absolutely valid issue. You need to have evidence. You need to have documentation. Whether you accept the evidence is another issue, but you need to actually have detail which you can consider and work out what the future plans are going to be. That's what we don't have now.


In the proposed new plan that the government has gone out marketing very strongly in the community through the media, there is not a lot of detail and there certainly is not modelling of exactly how we are going to balance Australia's energy needs; how we will look at the way we are going to work with our energy; as Senator Brockman rightly put it, how we are going to keep the lights on, which is the basis of what people are concerned about; how we are going to do that in the most efficient way; how we are going to keep prices down, which of course is the overwhelming fear element that's always run in these arguments about maintaining low prices; and at the same time how we are going to meet our international obligations, because we still have strong international obligations.


I'm concerned about the information that has come out from the Bonn conference. People are worried about whether Australia is going to be able to maintain the obligations that Prime Minister Turnbull made at the original Paris conference. We have made a commitment that we are going to be part of an international reduction of emissions so that we can respond to the international issue of climate change. In the last week at the recent conference the Prime Minister attended, he reaffirmed that we were going to be continuing our role in that process. But what we don't know from the plan before us is how that is going to happen. In taking up Senator Siewert's notice of motion we are working on— (Time expired)

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-11-15,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:47):  I will say that Senator Moore is right: Senator Roberts is sorely missed in this place, especially when it comes to debates to do with climate change. He was the only one in this place who really had a clear understanding and knew how to debate this issue.


I believe that a lot of people have been led down the garden path so far as climate change goes. I remember Professor Tim Flannery making comments over the years like: 'We will never have floods again. This whole country is in drought. Therefore, we must build these desalination plants.' So what did we do? We went out and built all these desalination plants to be left in mothballs, costing taxpayers approximately $31 million a year—that's for one—to have them in mothballs. We were listening to these professors who went and bleated their beliefs—it was never the case—'The fact is we've got these rising seas and waters and all this flooding will happen.' Well, it's yet to happen.


We have used climate change as a furphy. People have no understanding of it. Over the years I've listened to sceptics, to people that are scientists who are saying it is happening and to scientists saying, 'No, it's not happening.' These scientists have been employed by certain organisations because they've got a job now; there's a lot of money in it. Taxpayers are funding this to the tune of billions of dollars. It's become a political football. Even in our educational system, we are actually pushing this agenda. It's being used as a political football without clear science.


None of us, not even I, can get up and speak with regard to science. Do I know exactly what's happening? No, I don't; I have to rely on others to try and give the right information. How many times have we heard now that they've taken the temperature out in deserts or in concrete jungles and have come back with a temperature gauge and it's not the case at all? I'm not denying there is climate change, but is it man-made? Has anyone stopped to think about the volcanic eruptions that are happening or the earthquakes that are happening? Have we actually been looking at the factors? What about the atomic bombs that have been let off in this world? Has that had an impact on it?


The oceans actually make about 97 per cent of emissions, and we're talking about a small, minuscule amount that's supposed to be created by humans on the planet. 


Labor's policy of 50 per cent renewable energies by around about 2030 is absolutely ridiculous. We are not going to cope. If you head down that path, we are going to end up as a Third World country. We are feeling the effects of it now. People are struggling to pay their power bills. In Queensland, 430 people a week are unable to pay their bills and are being cut off by their power suppliers. I've just come back from India. If you think you've got problems here, go over to India—the smog that's in that country there. They're burning fires to get warmth because they don't have coal-fired power stations or the coal that they need to give themselves energy, so they're burning anything on the streets to get warmth and cook their food.


Here in Australia we have energy resources. We have an abundance of coal and gas, but we don't keep it for our own needs or energy here in Australia—to keep our own manufacturing industry going and so the pensioners can turn on a fan or heating when it suits them. We are destroying our own country because you're headed down this path where we've got to appease everyone else without protecting ourselves. 


Renewables will come. There will be a time for that when we actually have the technology to be able to store the energy. But to head down this path, destroying families, businesses, industries and manufacturing when most of us in this place have no idea what we're talking about when we're making legislation—I think you have to look at the factors and start looking after our own country first without being led by those who have more to gain by selling their own product. They don't understand and they don't give two hoots about the people in this country who are struggling to keep their heads above water.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:52):  What a pleasure to follow Senator Hanson, who has made a sensible, rational contribution to this debate, like my colleague Senator Brockman earlier. It's pleasing to see some rationality and common sense coming into this whole debate. 


The Turnbull government is focused on keeping the lights on and getting more affordable power to Australian households and businesses. Senator Hanson has just indicated how many people and businesses cannot afford to use electricity because of the cost of power, particularly in my home state of Queensland. Why? It is because the Queensland Labor government own the generators, and, for years, they've been gouging the price—adding to the price—to try and prop up their budget. 'Forget about the households or the small businesses. We need to try and balance our budget.' They've chased any other investment away from Queensland, so that's why power prices are so high in Queensland.


Our approach is driven by engineering and economics, not by ideology. It brings together the advice of the very best experts in the field, whereas from the Greens you get all the mantra, ideology and stuff they've read in left-wing papers around the world. It doesn't make any sense. They can never argue the case. They don't understand the issue. They just mouth the rhetoric and put that out as policy. 


The Turnbull government has adopted the National Energy Guarantee, which is a practical, workable, pro-market policy to increase the affordability and reliability of our energy system whilst also meeting our international commitments. I have to remind everyone: Australia is one of the few countries—under Liberal governments, I might add—that has actually met its target from Kyoto and previous targets from Paris. We do that without subsidies. There are no subsidies, no taxes and no emissions trading schemes. The Turnbull government is focusing on this because the provision of affordable power is so important to every mum and dad and every household right throughout Australia, but more particularly so in my home state of Queensland.


You've heard the Greens in this debate and elsewhere talk about how these carbon emissions are destroying the world and destroying the Great Barrier Reef. I keep asking a question, and none of them will ever tell me the answer, because they can't. The question is: how come Australia's share of the world's emissions, 1.2 per cent—keep that figure in your mind—is going to change the whole climate of the world? In fact, when I questioned the Chief Scientist, Dr Finkel, about that and asked, 'If we stopped our emissions by 1.2 per cent, which is everything in Australia, what difference would that make to the changing climate of the world?' his answer was, 'Virtually none.'


Senator Williams has done some research into this with the help of the Parliamentary Library. He has shown me figures, and the Parliamentary Library has got them, where new power stations in China alone—




Senator Williams:
  Coal-fired power stations.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Coal-fired power stations; thank you, Senator Williams. New ones—these are not existing ones—have a carbon emission of something above 2,000.




Senator Williams:
  It is 670 million tonnes.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is 670 million tonnes. But, in units, it's somewhere around 2,300, I think. Australia, just to keep these figures in mind, has 73. These are new, coal-fired, emission-generating units. In China alone, they are above 2,000; in Australia, we are under 100. Yet the Greens are saying: 'This is what we've got to do in Australia. We've got to shut business down and export jobs overseas.' They say we've got to do all this so we get a warm, fuzzy feeling and so we can go to the green international conference somewhere around the world and say, 'Oh, look, Australia's cut its emissions by 50 per cent.' The Labor Party, unfortunately, have fallen for that gag as well. It will mean nothing to the changing climate of the world. Don't take my word for it; ask Dr Finkel. It will mean absolutely nothing if we cut it by 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 50 per cent or, according to Dr Finkel, 100 per cent, and yet the Greens would ruin every manufacturing-job-creating exercise in Australia.


That's why they're so opposed to the Adani project. The Adani project won't, in any material way, export carbon, and what it does will have absolutely no impact on the changing climate of the world—absolutely none. But it will create jobs in Queensland—particularly up my way—it will create wealth in Queensland, and it will enable the Queensland government, whoever's in power after Saturday, to almost pay their bills, because of the royalties that will come in from the mining of this clean, abundant, natural coal we have not far from where I live. It's waiting there to be tapped. When it's tapped, it won't impact upon the changing climate of the world and will certainly not have any impact on the Great Barrier Reef. But it will create jobs. It will provide electricity for the starving millions in India—but that doesn't seem to be a concern of the Greens in this particular debate.


I say to the Greens: please explain. I keep asking them. I've been doing this for, I think, 10 years now, when this issue of climate change first came up. I've been asking the Greens to explain to me: if Australia—which emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions—cuts its emissions by 50 per cent, how is that going to change the changing climate of the world? None of them will ever answer me. Why? Because there isn't an answer. Or there is an answer, but Dr Finkel has given it; Dr Finkel said it won't make any difference whatsoever. But it does make a difference to people I know—people up in Townsville who desperately need the jobs and who desperately need the work from Adani. For the small businesses that run off that—the accommodation, the houses and restaurants and all of those people that will benefit from the Adani project—it means big things to them.


So I plead with the Greens: give me an answer. I keep asking them. Senator Roberts, when he was here, used to keep asking them, but they always ignored that. They go on about how horrible we are, how we don't understand, how the latte set in Sydney think we are all troglodytes—yes, thanks to the Greens' propaganda. But give me an answer to that. Australia, I keep repeating, emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. China each year—or week, was it? I forget what it is, but let's say each year—exudes more carbon with its new power stations—not the old ones, the new ones—than Australia has been emitting for years.


I say to the Greens: how come it's okay for China? How come it's okay for India? How come it's okay for Russia? They're all okay, but poor little old Australia emits practically nothing, makes no impact on the changing climate of the world, and yet the Greens political party—and Labor, I'm sorry, have gone along with them—think there are a few votes in it from the ignorant latte set around the leafy suburbs of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Those people might vote for the Greens and the Labor Party. The Labor Party and Greens keep fighting each other for that cohort of votes.


But ask any of the people at the latte place next time you go there, Senator Rice—ask them how is it that Australia's emissions are somehow going to destroy the Great Barrier Reef? I'd ask you to ask that. They'll just open up the Green Left Weekly and read out the propaganda that pops out of the paper, but none of them will understand it. None of them will ever be able to argue the case. Sure, if the rest of the world stop their carbon emissions, so should Australia; I've never challenged that proposition. But, until they do, why does Australia destroy itself and the jobs of its people and its standard of living for a meaningless ideological, warm-feeling approach for the latte set in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane?


This is a debate which I think more and more Australians are starting to understand is just ideological claptrap from the Greens, regrettably being now mirrored by the Labor Party as they fight for Greens votes. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-11-15,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:02):  I also rise to speak on the matter of public importance, and I think it is with great pleasure that I follow One Nation and their friend Senator Macdonald in this debate.


I note Senator Hanson said, when she first started speaking, that today she spoke with reluctance, as it was normally her colleague the former Senator Roberts—who was of course found by the High Court to be ineligible to be a senator, a dual citizen—who swamped the chamber with his ridiculous theories and conspiracies. The speech that we just heard from Senator Hanson sounded just like something her former colleague would have said: full of conspiracies and lacking any empirical evidence. You can love coal, but to love Australia you should embrace all energy options. If you don't like things because of their colour, don't discount something because of its colour. Listen to the real scientists, listen to the energy industry and let's get people across the country back into work in our energy industry. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in our renewable energy sector since 2014 because of scaremongering and short-term anti-scientific policies. But we can do better, so get your head out of the smog and let the cool breeze of windmills and the warm glow of solar panels improve the energy security for this country.


This matter of public important reads:


The complete failure of the Turnbull Government to develop a climate and energy policy, resulting in Australia's emissions increasing since 2013 and contributing to an increase in global carbon pollution in 2017.


This is certainly an important matter of public importance for us to debate.


But, before I get into my argument, I just want to point out that there appears to be a drafting error in the motion. I hate to be semantic, but if we're going to attack the Turnbull government for their abject failure on climate and energy policy then we have to get our facts right first. According to the data I've seen—the empirical evidence, as former Senator Roberts would say—emissions actually decreased from 2013 to 2014 by six megatonnes. It's an important point. It demonstrates the worth of this chamber resisting attempts in late 2013 to repeal the carbon price, a carbon price that provided certainty to industry and investors, and the total emissions allowed in the Australian economy and let the market resolve how best to produce the energy. 


I've also had to point out a much bigger mistake than a drafting error from the Greens, and it was back in 2009. Under the leadership of former Senator Bob Brown, the Greens voted against Labor's original Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. As it is today, climate change was an urgent policy area back in 2009. The commitment of the Labor Party to take action on climate change was a key factor in the 2007 election. Yet, for their own reasons, which make absolutely no sense, the Greens voted with the Liberals and Nationals. They voted with the member for Warringah, Mr Abbott, and opposed Labor's action—action that would have introduced a mechanism to ensure that prices were affordable, that our electricity infrastructure was reliable and that we promoted technology that is sustainable, low carbon and, where possible, carbon free. I say the reasons made absolutely no sense because, when the Greens finally did support Labor on climate change action in 2011, the mechanism within the legislation to reduce carbon pollution was almost identical to that in the earlier 2009 bill. 


While there was that delay of two years, all that was really achieved was the creation of space for Mr Abbott to launch his dangerous, ill-informed scare campaign—a scare campaign that his former senior adviser Peta Credlin finally admitted earlier this year was all about politics and nothing about economics or the environment. It's important to point out that this delay of two years enabled Mr Abbott to take the leadership and commit the next five years to repealing the carbon price, only to fail to replace it with any credible climate change or energy policies when it was finally repealed. 


So when the Greens get up in this place and say, 'We must take urgent action on climate change,' I do agree with them, but I remind them of their ideological move in 2009 that is a big part of how we ended up with such a failure of climate and energy policy in this country. While the Greens failures are clear, the failure of the Turnbull and Abbott government is much, much worse. Under their watch, Australian emissions have increased and we've been left without an energy policy for over four years. 


The member for Wentworth once famously said that he would not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as he was—I emphasise 'was'. In his lust for power, this Prime Minister has thrown out everything he once stood for publicly. He's thrown out his long-held, leather-jacket-wearing commitment to action on climate change. He's thrown out his support for renewables. He's thrown out his support for Australia as a leader in this space. Who do we have instead? We have a desperate Prime Minister, a hapless Prime Minister who has abandoned reasonable policy processes. He has abandoned his beloved proper cabinet processes and rushed out his so-called National Energy Guarantee without any analysis or modelling by the Department of the Environment and Energy and without adequate consultation with industry or with the states. 


This is a timely matter of public importance because just yesterday the Global Carbon Project reported new data showing global CO2 emissions have risen for the first time in three years. Coinciding with that report on Monday, 15,364 scientists from around 180 countries signed an article appearing in BioScience that stated unequivocally:


To prevent widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss, humanity must practice a more environmentally sustainable alternative to business as usual.


I repeat: over 15,000 scientists from around 180 countries have said that business as usual will lead to widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss unless we stop what we're doing and curb our per capita consumption of fossil fuels. Unless we change the behaviours more broadly, our earth will become uninhabitable. This isn't an ideological dream. This is the revisiting of a study from 1992 by eight climate scientists who are supported by over 15,000 other scientists.


The report from 1992, which was at that point signed by more than 1,700 scientists, entitled World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, warned that humans were on a collision course with the natural world. The updated article, released on Monday, found that, across nine indicators, humanity is failing our planet, and Australia needs to do its bit—Australia needs to lift its game. This is something that our Prime Minister once understood. This shouldn't be a partisan argument. There have been Liberal members for the environment who have, in their own way, demonstrated care for our world. Yet, somehow, here we are, with the so-called most progressive Liberal Prime Minister in history, who has completely abandoned Australia's role as a strong middle power and completely abandoned the notion that Australia should do our bit to combat climate change.


Weeks after the launch of his National Energy Guarantee, the Prime Minister can give no guarantees about its effectiveness, no guarantees on its price, no guarantees on its reliability for energy supply and nothing on the sustainability of our energy sector—nothing. All that we know is that, under Prime Minister Turnbull's National Energy Guarantee, power bills will keep going up and up and thousands of jobs in the renewable energy area are at risk. As it stands, the Prime Minister's plan will strangle the renewable energy industry for a lousy 50c in three years time, and that 50c saving isn't even guaranteed.


On our investment in renewables, it's worse than business as usual. The National Energy Guarantee is so bad that Australia's energy mix will be comprised of only 28 per cent renewables by 2030. That's seven per cent lower than the Chief Scientist said would occur if we did nothing at all. It's a bizarre and dangerous policy, but it is true to form for this government. Under their watch, one in three renewable energy jobs has been lost and confidence and certainty in that sector has been shattered.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2017-11-15,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (17:12):  This is, once again, not my first speech. When considering the wording of this matter of public importance, I can't help but think that the use of the words 'complete failure' in relation to the Turnbull government's policies on climate change is awfully kind of my colleague Rachel Siewert of WA. When I think about the policies of this government in relation to climate change, the phrase that comes to mind used to be 'disappointed but not angry'. Well, I sit here this afternoon in this chamber thoroughly angry, and I believe that I speak on behalf of most of my generation when I say that.


Those in the Liberal-National section of this chamber, in particular, don't often talk about youth issues, apart from when they find that there have been proposed attacks which will affect the very many vested interests which fund them, and then of course they speak at length and with great emotional detail about the need to protect my generation from the intergenerational theft which is either the current tax at hand or the current spending proposition. I would like to ask this chamber whether it can think of any greater act of intergenerational theft than failing to act on climate change and whether it can think of any greater act of intergenerational theft than letting the vested coal and various fossil fuel interests which seem to run this government rob my generation of its future, of a safe and healthy environment in which to raise our kids—because I cannot.


Further to this, I cannot think of any greater act of theft than to deny my generation the opportunity to reap the benefits of the third great industrial revolution of our species. I'm talking of course of the transition to the renewable economy. We in the WA Greens have done extensive work on this issue, and I pay great thanks and respect to my former colleague Senator Ludlam in referring to the work he did on how we might transition our part of this ancient continent to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030. Among the many findings of this work, it was discovered that this process would create no fewer than 156,000 new jobs. That is 12,000 jobs a year, with 25,000 jobs in the solar PV industry alone. These are the kinds of things that are being sacrificed upon the altar of the coalition's allegiance to the various fossil fuel interests which now seem to so comprise their support base. 


I would add also that we cannot discuss the issue of climate change at this current time without discussing the issue of the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland, which again Senator Canavan seems to be such a huge fan of that you would have thought Adani had personally made sure that he wasn't a dual citizen in the end anyway. This proposal seeks to do nothing less than put the world's largest coal port through the Great Barrier Reef—one of the great natural wonders of the world, something which we in Australia are lucky enough to hold in trust for the entirety of mankind, for the entirety of humanity. It is ours to steward. Yet we treat it with such disrespect and disregard. We would put at risk 69,000 jobs within the state of Queensland on the vague promise of 1,500 jobs in the construction sector. And let me inform this chamber, as somebody from WA, that jobs in the construction sector and phases of the mining industry quickly disappear as we transition to the more automated aspects of the industry. They disappear and leave nothing in their place. 


So we would risk this natural wonder. We would risk tens of thousands of jobs for 1,500 jobs, which will be gone as soon as they've come, to support a company which is linked to everything from multinational tax avoidance to the most horrendous types of environmental abuses, all because the Minerals Council tells those in the coalition that it's a good idea, all because the mining lobbies are in your ear 24/7 and all because nobody—I'm sad to say, on either side of this chamber that doesn't sit in the Greens section of the crossbench, or some of the more enlightened crossbench senators—has the courage and conviction to clearly stand up against this group and say no. This is not exclusively a failure of the coalition. It is also a shame shared by the Labor Party at a state and federal level. They campaigned for the Queensland election on the platform of saving the Great Barrier Reef and have only now withdrawn their support for the billion-dollar taxpayer subsidy to this tax-dodging multinational corporation because of a legal loophole they found themselves in. It is a disgrace. 


This government's policy in relation to climate change is a disgrace. It is an act of intergenerational theft. While I am in this chamber, I will not let it go by without it being called out for what it is.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:58):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. They are both bills that Labor will oppose. In relation to one of these bills, we will also be moving some amendments. What these bills amount to are a continuation of the rather sad attack that we continue to see from this government on the independence of superannuation funds and the right of workers to have some control over their own retirement savings. I understand that there was a rather brief Senate inquiry conducted into these bills, and I noticed from the dissenting report from Labor senators that this was a very rushed exercise. The bills were introduced late in a sitting week, and then a very short amount of time was provided for the inquiry. So I thank all senators, whether they be Labor or other senators, for their work on this inquiry—no doubt under significant time pressure. Thank you to the committee secretariat as well for their work.


At the outset I want to put on record that we on the Labor side of parliament are very proud of our nation's superannuation system. It is obviously a great Labor achievement from the Hawke-Keating days, in partnership with the trade union movement and employers. All observers would recognise that our retirement scheme, particularly based on compulsory superannuation, is an incredible social justice measure, making sure that all working people, no matter what their background, no matter what their income, are able to enjoy a dignified and secure retirement as a result of the superannuation contributions that they make and that their employers make on their behalf. 


Not only is compulsory superannuation a critical social justice measure in Australia; it's also become a really key component of our economic wellbeing as a nation. Superannuation funds are obviously large investors in Australian companies, in property and in infrastructure projects, which all go on to create more jobs for Australian working people as well. There is no doubt that some of the prosperity that Australia has seen over the last 25 years is based on the introduction of compulsory superannuation by the Hawke-Keating Labor government a couple of decades ago. We are extremely proud of our role in having established compulsory superannuation, and we will always fight to preserve it and to preserve workers' ability to have some control and influence over their own retirement savings. 


There was a very clear decision made by the Labor government when we set up compulsory superannuation that it needed to be a bipartisan exercise between employers and trade unions on behalf of working people. A very deliberate decision was made to ensure that boards of superannuation funds reflected the interests that both employers and working people, through their unions, had in the preservation of good retirement savings and a decent retirement for all working people. That's why, when this system was established, it was created on the basis that there would be an equal place for employers and trade unions on the boards of superannuation funds to ensure that those interests were properly reflected. So it's very sad to see this government now wanting to change that, to change a system that has been extremely successful for working people, for social justice, as I have said already, and for the health of the Australian economy. 


It's worth observing that industry superannuation funds, which are the primary target of this legislation, have consistently out-performed retail and corporate superannuation funds over many, many years. We see a government which claims to be about the free market, about prosperity, about lifting economic growth and about making everyone wealthier. It's ironic, then, to see this very government introduce some legislation which interferes with the operations of the most financially successful superannuation funds around—being industry superannuation funds. I could understand the government wanting to take some action if there were a demonstrated poor record from industry superannuation funds, which are run by a combination of employer and union representatives. I could understand it if there were problems there and if members of those funds were essentially being dudded out of their own retirement savings. But it is quite the contrary. If you look back on the record of industry superannuation funds—the funds that do have employer and employee representation on their boards—you see that they have outperformed retail and corporate funds. So, if anyone needs a bit of a look at them, it's surely got to be the retail and corporate funds rather than industry superannuation funds. 


We know that, over a long period of time, large banks have lobbied this government very heavily to get their hands on the massive and growing pile of retirement savings that has been built up by these industry funds on behalf of ordinary working people. We know that lobbyists have been in and out of the doors of ministers' offices and government departments, putting the case for why banks should be able to have greater control over those funds. I don't understand why they've been given much consideration by this government, when, again, if you look at the record of funds that are run by banks, they have a much poorer financial record than the industry funds, which, now, this government wants to tinker with. I would've said to them: thanks; but why don't you go and get your own house in order before you come knocking on the door, seeking to get your hands on the funds which have been run highly effectively on behalf of working people through a combination of employer and employee membership?


I noted that this bill, the strengthening trustee arrangements bill, essentially replicates a similar bill that was brought forward and introduced by this government back in 2015—before I was here, but I remember the debate on it occurring at the time. At that time, Labor senators also put forward a very strong dissenting report on a similar argument—that the right way to go about building up retirement savings is to have them administered by a combination of employer and employee representatives. The government was not able to get that legislation through at the time, and they should've read something into that: this Senate, and the opposition, does not support this attack on industry funds and the retirement savings of working people.


Labor's position on this 2017 bill is very similar to the position that we took back in 2015, and we continue to have the same primary concern, which is that this bill seeks to impose a corporate governance model on funds which operate under a trustee governance model. You've got to acknowledge that the way these industry superannuation funds operate is fundamentally different to the corporate approach taken by retail and corporate superannuation funds. It's quite appropriate that retail and corporate funds have imposed on them a governance system that is based on what happens in the corporate world, but industry superannuation funds effectively run as trustee arrangements, and they need a different approach, accordingly.


Some of the problems of the imposition of this corporate governance approach were highlighted in the Labor senators' dissenting report on this bill, where they acknowledged, at paragraph 1.13, that:


Corporate governance—


the model that's sought to be imposed here—


faces particular issues which need to be addressed and include:


Board members having a fiduciary duty only to their shareholder owners, which can put at risk the needs of a company's customers; and


The presence of executive directors, that is, management of the company having a presence on the board, where decisions might be taken that advantage management over the needs of shareholders.


As I say, it was a fundamental principle in the Hawke-Keating government's embarking on this approach that the administration of industry super funds would be done on a cooperative basis, with agreement reached, hopefully, between employer and employee representatives. It is important that working people have confidence that their retirement savings are being managed in a way where their interests are paramount, not the interests of shareholders in a company. We know that we have a corporate law system where, in large corporations, the interests of shareholders are paramount. That's fine. That's appropriate for a corporate environment. But if we're talking about a system that is designed to protect and grow workers' retirement savings, surely the biggest priority should be to make sure that the interests of those working people who've made their contributions—and employers who've made contributions to these funds as well—remain paramount over the interests of any particular shareholder. That's what's at risk here if these amendments do go through. Similarly, it's not appropriate that the fiduciary duties that directors of corporate funds have, again, primarily being to a shareholder, be simply transferred across and put onto a trustee based fund, when other considerations are important—the needs of the employers and working people, who this system is designed to benefit. Those are the kinds of considerations that are much more appropriate for a trustee based system. But, unfortunately, if this bill is passed, that's what will be removed. 


Equal representation of employers and working people, through their unions, on superannuation boards has been a very longstanding arrangement. It's served Australians well and it is something that Labor believes absolutely needs to be maintained. I just don't understand why the government is so hell-bent on changing a system that works, changing a system that has consistently delivered better financial returns to members than the returns provided by retail and corporate funds. Even if you look away from the benefits to the individual members of these funds, the system that we have in place for superannuation at the moment, the legislative architecture that we have in place, has not only served the members of those funds well but it's actually served the nation well. It's built up a massive, world-leading pot of funds across superannuation that has been effectively invested to the benefit of members of the funds but also to the benefit of the nation, through investments in infrastructure, property and other Australian companies, as well as overseas companies, but there has been a direct benefit to Australia and the Australian economy through the very system which this legislation now seeks to undermine. Over the last 10 years, the analysis conducted by APRA shows that not-for-profit superannuation funds have outperformed bank-owned super funds by, on average, more than two per cent. That's something that we should be encouraging. We should be encouraging the actions and operations of not-for-profit superannuation funds which are overseen by joint employer-employee directors. We shouldn't be trying to undermine them, which is what is sought to be done here. 


As I mentioned, there is only one explanation I can come up with for why the government would want to ignore the evidence, ignore the economic benefit to the nation, ignore the financial benefit to members and ignore the many benefits that flow to employers who participate in industry super funds as well. The only explanation I can come up with is that they've been worn down by the lobbying of big banks and big financial services companies. Indeed, Minister O'Dwyer, who oversees this legislation, let slip what this legislation is really about in November last year, when she said the government needed to 'lift superannuation funds to at least the same standard as other financial services organisations like banks and life insurance companies'. That came from a report in the Financial Review on 23 November 2016. Clearly there is an agenda at play here from this government and from this minister to ignore the proven track record of industry super funds based on a cooperative approach between employers and employees, throw the baby out with the bathwater, copy what's being done by their mates in the banking industry and throw that into the mix as well. 


This is the real aim of this bill. It's to make the governance of superannuation funds the same as that of the big banks. You really have to wonder why any minister would want to put forward a change to our internationally successful superannuation system to make it more closely modelled on what happens with the banks. You would have to wonder why any minister would want to do that, after the litany of scandals that we have seen from Australian banks over the last few years. I've lost count of the number of scandals that we've seen, particularly involving the Commonwealth Bank but across our banking system more generally, with insurance and other products being sold to people who didn't need them, the tying of commissions to the number of sales of products, which perversely incentivises people working in the banking system to sell people products that they don't necessarily need, because that's the only way they're going to get their bonuses. 


We know very well that the Australian public have had enough of this, and that's why the calls that Labor has made for a banking royal commission, backed in by some members of the government and crossbenches as well, has resonated with so many people out there. They're sick of seeing the scandals that we see day after day, month after month, year after year from the big banks. Despite that, despite all the evidence that there are some serious culture problems in our banks, this government now wants to take the approach that banks use, apply it to a successful industry superannuation scheme and provide an avenue for the banks to come in and get their hands on workers' money. I think that the banks, before they're given that opportunity, need to get their own house in order. They need to show that they actually have changed, that their culture has changed and that they recognise their responsibilities to look after their customers as well as their shareholders before we even give any consideration to giving banks a greater opportunity.


It's going to be very interesting, when the House of Representatives comes back in a couple of weeks time, to see where a number of government members of parliament stand on the issue of a royal commission. There have been a number of lower house members from the government, particularly from my home state in Queensland, who've been very vocal about the need for a banking royal commission. But every time there's been the potential for them to vote it in they've either gone missing in action or voted with their own government colleagues. The member for Dawson is probably the best known example. He's an absolute champion of rights for people against the banks when he's back home in Mackay, but the minute he comes down to Canberra he gets taken aside and told what to do, because we all know that he isn't independent of mind and he takes his writing instructions from Canberra and then runs back to Mackay to do what he's told.


I can't remember whether it's on this issue—the banking royal commission—or one of the other many issues that the member for Dawson has grandstanded about, where he has actually said he won't be voting against the government while the former Deputy Prime Minister, the absent Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, is campaigning. That's how strong the commitment of the member for Dawson is to a banking royal commission. It's a perfect example of the fact that he's actually got his own government's interests at heart rather than those of his constituents, who want to see something done about the banks. 


I wouldn't be at all surprised if we see some sort of a debate about the need for a banking royal commission in the last two weeks of the House of Representatives, and it's going to be a real test for the member for Dawson to show where he stands. Does he actually believe the things when he's out there back in Mackay or running around the Bowen Basin beating up the banks, saying that they need a good talking to and they need a royal commission, or is he going to come back down to Canberra like he's always done and fold and lose the chance to put in place a banking royal commission?


It's not just him. The member for Capricornia is another. We know that there are many problems that her constituents have been experiencing with banks. It's a great opportunity for her as well to actually flex her muscles and show her government that she's going stand up for her constituents, when her vote could actually make a difference and could actually drive a banking royal commission.


In conclusion, I don't understand why we would want to tamper with a world-leading superannuation system. It has served us, its members and the Australian economy very well, having that cooperative approach between employers and employees. The last thing we should be doing is letting the big banks get their hands on this before they fix up their own problems.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:18):  I, too, rise to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. I'm glad Senator Watt has remained in the chamber. I trust he's going to stay here for a bit longer, because he put the question to the chamber and to the Australian people: why would we change something that is working well? But the question is: who is it working well for? He also said that if there was any evidence that this was not working well for members then, perhaps, he might reconsider. Can I draw his attention to some of the cases that have been raised in recent years where we have seen members' funds, which they have put into an industry fund for the benefit of their own retirement, used on things that the members are just not aware of and, certainly, are not for the members' benefit. Let's take the disclosures that we see from the Australian Electoral Commission of the financial statements of industry super funds, and you get an estimate that around $8 million was paid last year alone to unions in unexplained payments. Other reports call them 'dark payments'. The industry fund CBUS, for example, chaired by former Victorian Labor Premier Steve Bracks, looks after some 732,000 members working in the construction industry. CBUS paid over $1 million in sponsorship fees to unions, including the ACTU, the CFMEU, the AWU, the AMWU, the ETU and the PTU. 


Coming back to the point that was made by Senator Watt and those opposite about directors appointed by unions, guess where their fees go? In many cases the fees are going directly to the unions, not to the directors themselves. In some cases they get paid a small retainer, or a percentage amount. Essentially there is a flow of cash to the unions both in grants and in other payments, and even the directors' fees go back to the unions. TWUSUPER, which covers transport workers, paid almost $1 million to the TWU last year and over $126,000 in directors' fees. It doesn't publicly release its financial statements, but it is clearly not using those funds for the benefit of its members. Australian Super, one of the largest industry funds, with nearly $92 billion in assets, only declared one payment to the ACTU, of over $225,000, but other unions have declared to the AEC that they receive sponsorship payments from Australian Super. 


What we see here is a clear pattern of industry super funds paying money to the unions. When Senator Watt says it's a system that's working well, I think the Australian people and members of industry funds are well placed to be asking the question, 'But who is it working well for?' Looking to the future, with the growth in the investment value of funds—it is already at $2.3 trillion and it is expected to grow to around $4 trillion over the next 10 years—union payments, if not scrutinised, can be expected to rise to $22 million a year. That's $22 million that should be going into the retirement savings of Australian workers but, instead, is being diverted into the political campaigns and other activities of unions—and that is the question that we need to raise. 


I'm disappointed Senator Watt has left the chamber. He said that it would be dreadful to upset the relationship on the board between employers and employees. The government is not proposing to say you can't have equal representation. You can still have equal representation—people appointed by the employers, people appointed by the unions—but what we're saying is that good governance requires independence, and that is not just in the financial sector; there are many sectors where good governance has a requirement around transparency and independence. The government is saying by all means have your union appointees, by all means have an equal number of employer appointees, but you must have a minimum of one-third independent directors to make sure there are no conflicts of interest and that there are no dark payments, as have been proven, with millions of dollars flowing out of the retirement savings of employees and into the coffers of unions. So the two points that Senator Watt raised are clearly disproven by the facts. 


We have introduced these bills to strengthen the foundation of Australia's compulsory superannuation system, in particular for the default MySuper members. That's an important thing to grasp. There are two elements to that. It's compulsory. This is us taking some of the gross earnings of workers in Australia and putting it into super. It was a Labor idea, we grant that, it has worked well, and we fully support it. But it is compulsory, which means we must make sure the governance around that process is absolutely squeaky clean, is transparent and works in the best interests of employees. 


Because it's the default MySuper program, we're talking here about a whole range of workers, including young people who've just come into the workforce who perhaps have no background in financial planning or management, or thought for their retirement, and what do they do? They just take the default fund that is offered as part of their agreement or what the employer has as the default fund as part of MySuper. In terms of financial literacy, these people are probably some of the most vulnerable in our community. They need the protection of a governance system that not only is effective but is transparent to make sure that the workers are the people who benefit from the growth in that system.


The superannuation sector has grown to over $2 trillion as a result of the mandatory nature of it. These reforms are consumer based reforms. They're focused on the consumer to make sure that it's more accessible and more understandable, and that the providers are more accountable for how they use their members' money. It's aiming to have stronger prudential standards—that is, the enforcement and the transparency which gives people who are putting their money compulsorily into these funds the confidence that it's being managed in their best interests. This is not something that's just been cooked up overnight. There have been a series of reviews that have recommended these kinds of measures and these bills put them together.


There are three bills: Treasury laws amendment improving accountability bills that I mentioned, Treasury laws bill No. 2 and the accountability bills. They aim to increase choice, increase independence on the trustee boards and increase transparency. It includes new measures to strengthen the supervision of the superannuation sector, boosting the trustee accountability and improving member engagement. I've had a crack at the unions here, but importantly it also closes a legal loophole that has been used by some unscrupulous employers, a minority, to short-change employees who choose to make a salary sacrifice contribution into their accounts. 


Contrary to what those opposite would tell you that this is all about the government trying to disrupt and tear down the system, we're actually trying to make it more transparent and effective, and to increase the governance of the framework for the benefit of the employees. The protests that come from the other side, particularly when you hear them say, 'It's working well,' should ask the question, 'Who's it working well for?' Currently, it's working well for the unions. 


Is this just something that comes from the conservative sides of politics? Let's go back to Mr Jeremy Cooper, who was appointed by the ALP as the chair of 2010 super system review—and Labor was in government then. This quote comes from the Senate Economics Committee inquiry hearing. Mr Cooper said, 'Providing for independent directors shouldn't diminish the representation of members but actually enhance it.' He goes on to say, 'How we can make people who are forced to save into it feel confident that the standards of governance is at or near world's best practice.' That is from someone appointed by a Labor government to do a review into super who is saying that transparency is a good thing and will actually enhance the benefit for members.


Professor Graeme Samuel was appointed by the board to conduct an independent review into the governance arrangements at the CFMEU-backed industry fund, Cbus. This quote comes from the Senate Economics Committee inquiry hearing. Professor Samuel said: 'I don't draw a great distinction between the structures of corporate governance. I'm more concerned about the reality of it. When you've got proprietors or sponsors that are heavily involved in the board and are appointed as representatives of proprietors or sponsors, there's a tendency for the skills metrics to be less relevant. That's where independent directors then become much more relevant and where the skills metrics and qualities that they can provide become far more relevant.'


What we hear there is that where it's just jobs for the boys—or girls, as the case may be—the members are actually getting a disservice because the people on the board are there because of who they know not what they know. It is not their skills or competence that results in them getting the appointment; it is because they've been a long-term member or secretary of a union, or they're part of the employer's group. What we've seen from two eminent people who have presented evidence to the Senate committee is that those are not in the best interests of the members of the fund. Members of the funds are members of the Australian public who expect transparency when it comes to money that is theirs, whether it is their savings or their taxes. 


Looking at South Australia, where I'm from, when it comes to transparency we've had an issue just recently, where the Aboriginal Affairs minister, Kyam Maher, has been embroiled in a scandal about the appointment of a Mr King to the APY Lands, and an FOI has uncovered that it looks like there were backroom deals done, appointments and packages approved by the minister—we're not quite sure what the relationship was—but there's been no transparency. Now they're using taxpayer funds to fight the FOI order which was given by the appropriate authority who said, 'Yes, this should be released.' They're fighting that, and the public are rightly outraged that money appears to be being spent in a way that is not endorsed by the board, even, and it is unrealistic in its terms and conditions. 


When it comes to superannuation, people rightly have the same concerns. In South Australia, questions have been asked about the validity of some of the members on the board of Statewide Super in South Australia. People are concerned about this concept of jobs for the boys, or jobs for the girls. Ms Alexandra Overly has recently been appointed as a board member of Statewide Super. She took the position over in March this year, after her husband, Justin Hanson, became a state member of the SA Legislative Council for Labor. Mr Hanson, interestingly, inherited the membership or the directorship from his father. I've got to say, that's a pretty close nexus—from father to son to wife. I think Professor Graeme Samuel's point about whether there is a skills deficit here as opposed to appointment for other reasons is a really valid question that people should be asking. Another Statewide Super director, Mr Ian Steel, was appointed by the South Australian and Northern Territory branch of the Australian Services Union and, according to his LinkedIn profile, he's also been working for Labor ministers. In 2015-16, over 70 per cent of the fees received by Mr Steel for his work as a director were paid to the ASU. There are also current members of the lower house, from the Labor side, who have a history with Statewide Super. Mr Georganas, for example, received $66,000-plus in directors fees for one year, all of which was paid to the ASU. One of our former colleagues here, former senator Anne McEwen, was appointed by the ASU as a member representative on the board of Statewide Super. Katrine Hildyard MP, the state Labor Minister for Disabilities and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Recreation and Sport, was a former secretary of the ASU and also a director on the Statewide Super board and resigned when she went into the parliament. 


You have to start asking questions about whether it is all just an in-house thing and what value is being added to the members, particularly when Statewide Super has started sponsoring things in the community that are related to people from the unions who are on their board. On 9 October, there was a $150,000 sponsorship for women's sports, and Ms Hildyard is now coincidentally the Minister Assisting the Minister for Recreation and Sport. It would be interesting to know if there was any declaration of conflicts of interest around that particular one. Also, the Australian Electoral Commission records show the SA branch of the Labor Party received over $16,000 from Statewide Super in 2015-16. Statewide Super asserts that this was a refund for overpayments. That may well be. But, in total, Statewide Super has paid over $600,000 of the retirement savings of hardworking South Australians to the trade unions over the past decade. Yet, if you come back to this concept of 'compulsory' and MySuper, Statewide Super is the default fund in 18 different South Australian industrial awards, including those for children's service workers, hospitality employees and passenger vehicle transport workers. That means that funds are being stripped out of this super fund—a super fund for some of the lowest paid, hardest working people in Australia, who trust their money to this union, to this super fund—not for their benefit but to go back to the unions. And members opposite ask why we think transparency is important. 


Members opposite made the point, 'It's a good thing if industry super funds outperform other funds.' Let's look at Statewide Super. They have outdelivered and outperformed for the unions but not necessarily for their own members. Using Industry Super's own advertisement concept, let's compare the pair and see how a Statewide Super member would fare next to a member in another industry super fund achieving the 10 year average. Take a 30-year-old office worker and look at what she has achieved in terms of the rate of return. What you will find over a 10-year average period is that Statewide Super returned 3.58 per cent and the Industry Super fund average returned 5.13 per cent. That means that she would be $116,000 worse off in retirement because she didn't look around and check to see if there was another industry fund that would do a better job. I will pick a retail fund that I've done some research on, BT Growth. Over a 10-year period there was a return of 5.53 per cent. So all the rhetoric that says industry funds will always get you a better deal is clearly not correct for Statewide Super. They're not getting the best returns and they're streaming money off to the unions, none of which are in the members' best interests.


What the government is looking to do is not just make the funds more user-friendly for the people who are using them but, importantly, put accountability and transparency around the governance—still keeping the model that the Labor Party want in terms of having employee and employer representatives. That's absolutely fine. But what we're saying is that one-third of the directors should be independent so that we can deal with the issues of conflict of interest and we can ensure that accountability and transparency are there, not in our interests but in the interests of the men and women who those opposite and the unions purport to represent. What we see in the facts before us is that around the country, in union after union and industry fund after industry fund, the savings of hardworking Australians are creamed off and paid to unions for their own political benefit rather than the benefit of their members. I will be supporting this bill.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (18:37):  Here we are again with the continuation of the ideological attack on the trade union movement and any organisation or any person who is in any way associated with the trade union movement. In this instance, we're looking at an attack on the industry superannuation fund sector. Whilst I have a lot of respect for Senator Fawcett, his contribution just continues that attack on the union movement, in terms of the ideology. The premise behind Senator Fawcett's contribution is that union officials should be considered persona non grata. They shouldn't be anywhere near the industry superannuation funds, which, after all, the unions helped to create back in the 1980s, and unions should not receive any payments from anybody, ever.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order! Senator Ketter, resume your seat, please.




Senator Fawcett:
  On a point of order: in fact, I made the point that they are welcome to remain on the board.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's no point of order, Senator Fawcett. Continue, Senator Ketter.




Senator KETTER:
  This is an ideological agenda continuing from what we know of the government's attack on the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. This government's obsession with the union movement is on display for all to see.


In relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannunation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017, I want to start by talking about my concerns regarding the rushed process with these bills. As set out very clearly in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's dissenting report, we note that these bills were introduced into parliament on 14 September this year, on a Thursday morning, on the last day of a two-week sitting period. This was made worse when very short reporting dates were set for the bills. I note that the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, Senator Gallagher, moved a motion to extend the reporting dates on the superannuation bills to give proper time for scrutiny. It is unfortunate that we lost that vote. As I look at the bills in more detail, the more concerned I become. The committee managed to review four bills over a two-day period and, for that, some credit is due to the chair, Senator Hume, for her cooperation, despite the unreasonable reporting dates set by the government.


I'll use my time today to go through two major aspects of these bills: firstly, the policy aspects of these bills and how the government continues to confuse corporate governance and trustee governance; and, secondly, the politics of these bills and the government's incessant desire to destroy the union movement. So the first is the policy issue. I'll begin by talking about the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. Let's be clear: this is a recycling of the same bill that was defeated in 2015. Since that time, no clear evidence has been received to show that there was any deficiency in the funds with equal representation boards that warranted this bill, and that's notwithstanding the contribution that Senator Fawcett made. He identified a number of areas, but, again, it's all about throwing mud at the industry funds and, when it comes to the retail banks and their performance, it's all: 'There's nothing to see over here. Let's move on and attack the sector of the superannuation industry which is performing at a higher level and, at the same time, charging much less in fees to members of the superannuation funds.' There's no evidence which would warrant the establishment of a minimum of one-third independent directors or to warrant abolishing the requirement for equal representation for the remaining board members. 


We have seen the scandals in the major banks. If we take a step back, I think we can all agree that superannuation is now a vital part of our public policy landscape. That wasn't always the case, and I'll talk a bit more about that later.


It's Labor and the union movement that have a proud record of establishing the superannuation sector—$2.3 trillion now—for the benefit of all Australians, not just the privileged elite. Labor and the union movement have a proud history of establishing industry funds or profit-to-member funds. We have capital and labour at the same board tables, working together to enable workers to have a decent retirement. The history—and I know Senator Watt has touched on this—is that it was the unions that won superannuation as an industrial matter back in the 1980s. Then, through the accord with the Labor government, that was established as an industrial matter that could be put into industrial instruments. Of course, employers opposed that at the time. In fact, the employers took the matter to the High Court, and it had to be determined there. Then, having won that battle, Labor introduced the concept of universal superannuation in the 1990s. Where was the coalition at that time? It was opposed to that. When it came to increasing the initial three per cent superannuation to nine per cent, that was something that Labor voted to do. Where was the coalition? Again, it opposed that. When it came to increasing the superannuation level from nine per cent to 12 per cent, again, this was something that Labor voted for and the coalition opposed.


Let's be quite frank about this: the coalition expects us to believe that it is acting in the best interests of the members of the nation's superannuation funds. If it were left to the coalition, we wouldn't have the $2.3 trillion superannuation benefit for Australian workers. In fact, the superannuation system wouldn't exist. If this were a reform package truly designed to focus on improved accountability and member outcomes then the sort of things we'd be looking at would be the underperformance of bank-owned super funds. Why is this happening? It's within our competence to find out what is going on there. Why is it that the bank-owned funds are continuously underperforming compared to industry funds? Why don't we have a look at the vertically integrated structures of the retail banks, the potential conflicts that exist and whether members' interests are being safeguarded there and not bank interests? Why aren't we looking at the lack of visibility of profits and margins in retail funds and their related entities and how much the retail fund is spending on related party transactions, which impact the net return to members? Why aren't we looking at whether all super funds are run only for the benefit of their members? Of course, we know that the elephant in the room is that retail funds are inherently conflicted because they operate in the environment of return to shareholders as well. We should be looking at things like transparency and accountability measures being sector neutral. This is a package of measures which is aimed, fairly and squarely, at the industry fund sector, and it is an instance of the government running, basically, a protection racket for the banks. 


We know that industry funds, according to the analysis of APRA data by a number of stakeholders, have outperformed retail and corporate funds on average, and they've done a better job of making their customers rich. The competitive tension between industry funds and the trustee governance structure and other financial services firms with their corporate governance structure is a good thing for the sector. Ideally, it should be a race to the top to offer the best outcomes for working Australians. 


In that context, looking at the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill, it remains flawed in that it seeks to impose a corporate governance model on funds which operate under a trustee governance model. Corporate governance faces particular issues which need to be addressed. These include board members having a fiduciary duty only to their shareholder owners, which can put at risk the needs of a company's customers, and executive directors—that is, management of the company—having a presence on the board, where decisions might be taken that advantage management over the needs of shareholders. The inquiry found that profit-to-member funds do not normally face these same issues. As the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees notes, 'Profit-to-member funds do not face the shareholder-customer conflict, and also do not have executive directors on their boards.' 


This bill seeks to prescribe independence in legislation. Stakeholders such as the peak body ASFA said that the ASX principles based approach would be the preferred approach. In seeking to mandate a minimum of one-third independent directors, the government is claiming that board decision-making will be improved and that member outcomes will lift in the long term as a result. However, in our inquiry, witnesses such as Mr Cooper, whom Senator Fawcett cited, and Mr Samuel stated that what should really be desired in board member selection is the concept of cognitive independence—that is, that each board member is able to think independently of other board members, with diversity of thought leading to better group decisions. Mr Bernie Fraser, who is well known to most Australians, also appeared before the committee. He stressed that the skills and values of board members are paramount in good board member selection—not labels such as 'independence'. 


When poor consumer outcomes were being considered during the inquiry, Industry Super Australia tabled a document which noted that $480 million in compensation, reimbursements, refunds, payments, remediation and consumer loss for alleged misconduct has been made by the big four banks plus Macquarie and AMP. And this is only in the past two years. This document included details of the ANZ paying an additional $10.5 million in compensation to 160,000 superannuation customers, CBA paying $16.3 million to staff after a review of superannuation guarantee arrangements where they were not paying their part-time staff, the National Australia Bank's superannuation trustee company paying $35 million in compensation for two breaches involving failures in relation to provision of general advice, and Westpac's BT Financial Group paying $12 million to customers whose life insurance claims were knocked back. This document is an absolute eye-opener. It goes for pages. As I said, going forwards two years from 16 September 2015 it details $480 million. If you put that up against the types of issues that Senator Fawcett was raising, we are looking at chalk and cheese here when it comes to failure of governance. That is quite clear. This list continues to evolve. 


As time goes on, we know things are happening. You are well aware of these matters, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. We know that ASIC is pursuing the banks when it comes to attempted unconscionable conduct in relation to the BBSW rate-rigging scandal. So $50 million has been agreed to by the ANZ in respect of a settlement there. It's expected that the National Australia Bank will have a similar settlement. We have seen that the Commonwealth Bank has been in significant breach of anti-money-laundering laws—53,000 breaches. That could potentially lead to billions of dollars in fines.


Although those matters don't directly relate to superannuation, the $480 million figure certainly does. It's also worthwhile noting that just today we see reports of ASIC now probing how banks and super funds stiffed customers of billions of dollars. This is in relation to what is supposed to be happening with the transition of legacy superannuation products into the low-fee MySuper environment. This is supposed to be happening under reforms introduced by the Gillard government in 2012. There was a four-year period to enable all funds to transition to offering the MySuper product. We saw the industry super sector moving across to the MySuper environment much quicker. This ASIC investigation is into the fact that a number of bank-owned super funds have taken until the eleventh hour of the four-year transition period to transfer these funds. 


Why have they done that? This was the subject of a Rainmaker report instigated by Industry Super Australia. Rainmaker concluded that the slow retail transition was most likely a deliberate strategy by retail wealth managers. The transition has had a material impact on the profit margins of some of the major banks. One UBS analyst has said that the profit margins on revenue for the major banks over the past six months fell 8.5 per cent year on year and the MySuper transition was one of the major drivers of the falling profit margins. We see billions of dollars of extra fees being gouged from members as a result of the banks dragging their feet in moving to the low-fee MySuper environment.


We know that there are many other scandals, but I think this just illustrates the point that, when it comes to governance issues and misbehaviour, no credible observer could say that there are genuine governance issues on the industry fund side in comparison to what's been happening with retail banks. We see the ridiculous situation where the minister has said that the purpose of these bills is to lift the standards of all funds to this level. If that's the purpose of it then it really is misdirected, at best. In fact, this is a protection racket for the banks. 


We know that, two years on from the previous attempt to pass these types of bills, the profit-to-member funds have not been idle in reviewing their own governance arrangements. The AIST Governance Code, which applies ASX corporate governance principles to the superannuation and trustee governance context, will be in force on 1 July 2018. Mr Fraser also delivered his review and made recommendations to strengthen the selection process of board members and to ensure that boards had the right mix of skills that they required.


I want to say that I'm not against independent directors as a principle. A number of industry funds have already moved down that track, but it should be left to trustee boards to suit their own circumstances. Where they believe that independent directors would enhance board decision-making then they should be appointed. Many profit-to-member funds, as I said, have adopted such appointments. However, I don't agree with prescribing an arbitrary quota of independent directors and defining 'independence' in legislation. I welcome the work of AIST in developing a governance code and endorse the idea that cognitive independence is what policymakers should strive to achieve. Given all these findings, the Senate should reject this trustee arrangements bill once again. 


A number of the submitters to our inquiry—including, I think, Choice—were very concerned about the fact that the government was throwing the baby out with the bathwater by abandoning the employer and employee governance model and basically leaving a vacuum there. Apart from the one-third director component of the board, the rest of the composition of the board is left open. I think that is very much a backward step. Once again I want to illustrate the difference between what we've got on the industry super fund side and on the bank side. We know that many of the retail bank funds do have a majority of independent directors, but that's in an environment where they've got banking executives sitting on the board of superannuation funds, making decisions about the interests of members—and who is appointing these banking executives to these boards? Of course, it's the banks themselves. Not only do the banks appoint the banking executives; they also appoint the so-called independent directors. When it comes to concerns that we should all have about governance, the focus should very much be on what is going on in the retail super sector. 


When it comes to member outcomes—I have a brief period of time to address this issue; this is a very dense piece of legislation and I won't go through all the details—I am concerned this legislation will not improve protections, accountability and outcomes for members across the sector. In particular, the need to strengthen outcomes for choice products and to improve reporting and accountability of retail RSCs with a large financial firm parent company has not been given due consideration in these bills. In closing, these bills are misdirected; they are a protection racket for the banks and should be rejected.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:57):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannunation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. It is always a pleasure to follow my Queensland Senate colleagues from the Labor Party in debates such as this. I have to say, Senator Ketter, you tell a good story. You sound like a banker, you look like a banker and some of your arguments could almost be convincing for someone who didn't understand them. I have to say your colleague from Queensland wasn't quite so urbane. I think I would have purchased a litre of snake oil from him. I think he could sell anything to you if you just go for flowery words. Unfortunately, in both cases, you need to develop some facts about these matters.


I do agree with Senator Ketter in one aspect—that is, there must be transparency and accountability. There's got to be. I heard Senator Watt say that it was important that the representation of workers and employers was maintained. Hang on. We're not talking about a parliament. We're not talking about a football match. We're not talking about a workers' representative and an employers' representative. We're actually talking about people's savings and what the superannuation company can do with those savings. It's not a question of representing one side or the other. It's a question of getting the best financial return. 


I'm sorry Senator Cameron is leaving, because I was going to make a very favourable and complimentary comment about Senator Cameron. I hate to admit it in this chamber, because it will be on the record for all time, but I quite like Senator Cameron. If you take him out of this atmosphere and out of the hothouse atmosphere of the Senate committee process, he's a lovely fellow, good to be with. But I'm not quite sure what Senator Cameron's qualifications were for the position he held as a director for a superannuation company. I think I'm right—and, fortunately, he's gone—that I've heard somewhere in this chamber over the years that I've been here that Senator Cameron was a director of a superannuation company. Now, as I say, I like Senator Cameron; he's a great debater. But I had a look on Wikipedia just to get some background to Senator Cameron to see why he would be a director on a superannuation fund that was trying to maximise the return for those who invested in that superannuation fund. Wikipedia says that Senator Cameron:


… left school at 15 to take up an apprenticeship as a fitter at a local chain-making factory. Shortly after completing his apprenticeship the factory closed …


I don't know if there's any connection between Senator Cameron becoming a tradesman and the factory closing, but that's what Wikipedia says! Mr Cameron, as he then was:


… emigrated to Australia in 1973 … He initially worked at the Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney, before moving to the Liddell Power Station in Muswellbrook—


in the Hunter Valley—


… where he worked as a maintenance fitter. After seven years working at the power station Cameron was elected as the Hunter Valley/New England regional organiser for the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union …


He later became assistant national secretary, was then national secretary of the AMWU for several years and then was elected to the Senate in 2007. I was around at the time. I used to like George Campbell, but I remember how Senator Cameron stabbed poor old George Campbell in the back and came into the Senate.


In that background of Senator Cameron, I'm asking: if that is a union director of a trillion-dollar superannuation fund, what business expertise or financial expertise does he bring as a board member to that particular facility? If I have wronged Senator Cameron—if he wasn't a director—I'll apologise, but I'm pretty certain that's right. I think it became public at one stage. He was on $120,000 a year. I think it only became public because there was a bit of a fight on whether the director's fees, $120,000, belonged to him or belonged to the union that he was representing. I just wonder about someone with that background. I'm sure he was a wonderful fitter and I'm sure he was a wonderful organiser for the union. But does that make him the right sort of person to be a director of a trillion-dollar superannuation fund? Perhaps someone could explain that to me.


Senator Watt spoke a lot about representing the workers and representing the employers. Well, as I say, this isn't the parliament; this isn't a debating society. It's not where you represent someone. What you're there to do as a director is to make sure that the contributions to the fund made by workers get the very, very best return. That's not a question of representing workers or representing employers. It's a question of using every available skill to get the best return for the people whose funds you have control over. I think Labor speakers have this all wrong. It's not a question of representing workers and employers; it's about getting the best result and about accountability and transparency. That accountability and transparency needs to be there and obvious. Senator Watt was saying, 'The union representatives represent all the workers, and so they're there to look after the workers' money.' Can I just alert anyone who might be listening to this debate to the fact that the unions don't actually represent the workers; they represent 10 per cent of the workers. If you've got a union representative on the superannuation company board, supposedly representing the workers because he's a unionist, well, I'm sorry, he's not representing the workers; he's representing 10 per cent of the workers—which means he certainly doesn't represent the 90 per cent of workers who choose not to join a union.


So I think the Labor Party have got this all wrong. It's about the best return for the contributor's money. I would hope that, for whichever superannuation fund I or my wife have, there are directors who know something about high finance, something about international finance, something about exchange rates and something about floating dollars—something really top class. There are many, many people around Australia—very, very good financiers—who understand what money is all about. They should be there—I think that in the retail funds they are there—to get the best return for the contributors to the superannuation fund. They're not there to represent 10 per cent of the workers. They're not there to represent the employers. They're there to get a good deal for those who put their money into the superannuation fund.


I think the Labor speakers on this are simply mouthing the words they've been told to mouth by the unions and the members of the union leadership groups, the union bureaucracy, who, because of their position, happen to be directors of these superannuation companies. They would be drawing in—I don't know—$100,000 or $200,000. It'll all be on the record somewhere, but I do know that $130,000 was spoken about, and that's not a bad return for four or five meetings a year.




Senator Smith:
  Better than the award rate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is a bit better than the award rate—you're right, Senator Smith. I want my superannuation fund to have people who know what they're doing. Whilst I love Senator Cameron—and I'll live to regret that statement, I might say, but he is a nice fellow—when he did his fitter apprenticeship, he joined a company that immediately went broke and then he spent seven years as a maintenance fitter. I'm not quite sure how that qualifies him to deal with high finance. I'm sure he was a very good fitter. Fitting and turning is a very noble and honourable profession. It's not easy in some instances. I have a nephew who has chosen that trade. They're experts at fitting and turning. I wouldn't have thought they're experts at high finance around the world. That's one issue: directors are not there to represent everyone; they're there to get a good return for the money that contributors invest in the superannuation fund.


The other thing that concerns me about the background that has necessitated this bill is that I understand, and there is factual evidence, that over the last 10 years the so-called industry superannuation funds have contributed $53 million of members' money—I repeat that: $53 million of members' money—to the union movement or to the ALP. It is documented, of course, that the money that goes to a union from sources like this does a sort of round-robin circle: it goes to the unions and it's then immediately paid to the ALP to fund election campaigns and to try to keep them in power with their tentacles. So $53 million of contributions have gone to the unions over the last 10 years. Is that accountable? Is that transparent? Why would a superannuation fund be donating $53 million to the unions? Those unions that receive that money then make equally generous donations to the Labor Party, who then use it to try and win elections—and they're pretty good at that.


I wondered when my Queensland colleagues from the Labor Party spoke on this whether they hadn't been given the gee-up by the unions in Queensland running up to the Queensland state election, because I do know that most of the campaign workers for the Labor Party in the Queensland election are not branch members of the ALP, if there is any such a thing—unlike my party. The people working on the booths for my party are actually branch members—ordinary mums and dads, young people, students and retirees out there because they believe in a cause. But I know through experience in just the last few weeks and over many years that the people running the booths for the Labor Party are—would you believe it?—the union organisers, the union heavies, in every state. They are not only from across the state of Queensland; they ship them in from Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia or wherever to man the pre-poll booths and man the booths on the day. There are very few local people, ever, at the booths in Townsville. They're all visiting unionists. We know the one or two local unionists. We know the one or two people locally who are Labor Party members, but there's not many of them. Most of them are people shipped in by the union movement.


I just wonder if the reason that Senator Ketter and Senator Watt are here trying to retain the influence of these union heavies in their board positions on these superannuation funds is they've been given by the union people in Queensland a bit of a hurry up: 'Look, if you guys want us to work for you on the booths, you'd better get into the Senate. Here's a speech we've written for you. You can go and deliver that and say how terrible it would be if this superannuation arrangement was changed.' You could see the passion in Senator Watt's speech on how he wants to retain that privilege for a few union heavies. I repeat: they're not representing the workers, because the unions only represent 10 per cent of the workers—10 per cent! So they're not even representing the workers. They're representing the union heavies, they're representing the ALP and they're representing that privileged group that believe they have a God-given right to be able to interfere with the running of a country or, in the case of Queensland, a state.


I'd like someone to explain where the $53 million from superannuation contributors went. I know it went to the unions, but why? Why would a superannuation fund be making donations to a union? We know that all the unions are there for these days is simply to shovel money through the Labor Party to try and win elections and to keep them in the positions of power and privilege that they currently hold in the state of Queensland and elsewhere around Australia. If there are any more Labor speakers in the debate, it would be interesting for them to indicate why superannuation companies would contribute some $53 million of contributors' money to the unions. Perhaps there is a reason. I've never heard it explained.


The fact sheet is littered with those sorts of things. Charis Mullen has been a director on the board of AusSafe since October 2013, following her nomination by the Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland. She's the campaign coordinator for the AWU's Queensland branch, and she is now the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Jordan in the upcoming election. AustSafe, the superannuation fund of which she's a director, has paid more than $305,000 of members' money to trade unions over the past decade. Why? I would be interested if any Labor speaker could explain that. 


Gary Bullock has been chair of the Intrust Super board since earlier this year. He is the state secretary of United Voice and honorary treasurer of the Queensland Council of Unions. Mr Bullock is on public record about United Voice supporting seven successful ALP candidates in the 2015 state election, going so far as to call them 'the United Voice MPs'. I have to say, with some dismay, that they include the current member—not for long, I hope and expect—for Mundingburra, Ms Coralee O'Rourke, who, according to reports, had her living expenses leading up to the 2015 election paid for by United Voice. Where did United Voice get that money from? Perhaps they got it from that donation from the Intrust Super board. One would be interested to find out why Intrust would have paid—I am told—some $618,000 of members' money to trade unions over the past decade. 


Time, unfortunately, doesn't allow me to go through a series of these examples. I see Senator Watt has rejoined the debate, which is good to see. I'd be interested, Senator Watt, to know if you were ever a director of a—

Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Chairman, I'd be interested if Senator Watt could tell the chamber whether he has ever been a director of a superannuation fund and, if so, what financial expertise he might have brought to the board. 




Senator Watt:
  I'm an expert on many things but not that.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Senator Watt. That saves me wasting my other 32 seconds on wondering what your expertise is. It hasn't become obvious to me in the time that you've been here. I'm sure it's not financial expertise, but it's not relevant. 


Clearly the whole superannuation industry and the industry funds really do need serious looking at. What's wrong with having independent directors—not workers' representatives or employers' representatives but independent directors—who will look after the money well on behalf of the contributors?

 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:17):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I note that we only have a few minutes left for this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017 before we reach 7.20, so unfortunately I'm probably not going to have the opportunity to really get into the arguments that I was going to breathtakingly make that would blow you away.

Senator Watt:
  What time do we come back?




Senator DASTYARI:
  I believe they are selling tickets for it upstairs. It's going to be massive; that's all I can say—huge! 


I think it's important for us to spend a little time having a closer examination of the real intention of legislation such as this. It is unfortunate that, at the heart of so many of the decisions that get made, or the arguments that get pushed, by the government, there is an ideological agenda. I think that these bills, unfortunately, are not devoid of ideology, when really we should be having a debate about a fairly practical piece of legislation around superannuation laws, around strengthening trustee arrangements. What we have here is legislation that does nothing more, in the opinion of many Labor and crossbench senators, than push forward a strong ideological agenda. 


The government, unfortunately, come from a political stream of thought that means they have never really been fans of superannuation. The idea of superannuation is something that the government and the conservative side of politics have consistently opposed in one form or another. Towards the end of the Keating government, there was a proposal to increase superannuation. Over time, this was something that they opposed. The notion that there is going to be a savings base for the nation that is built by workers, protected by workers and controlled by workers is something that, unfortunately, those at their end of town have always argued against. There is a simple proposition at the heart of this. Do you vote to keep money in the pockets of mums and dads saving for their retirement, or do you pursue an agenda that is about increasing and lining the pockets of some of Australia's wealthiest, most successful bankers? That is what the debate here is going to be about—and, in 10 seconds, that's just a snippet.

  I can hardly wait.

  You won't be sleeping tonight, waiting to hear what I have to say next!

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:58):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. They are both bills that Labor will oppose. In relation to one of these bills, we will also be moving some amendments. What these bills amount to are a continuation of the rather sad attack that we continue to see from this government on the independence of superannuation funds and the right of workers to have some control over their own retirement savings. I understand that there was a rather brief Senate inquiry conducted into these bills, and I noticed from the dissenting report from Labor senators that this was a very rushed exercise. The bills were introduced late in a sitting week, and then a very short amount of time was provided for the inquiry. So I thank all senators, whether they be Labor or other senators, for their work on this inquiry—no doubt under significant time pressure. Thank you to the committee secretariat as well for their work.


At the outset I want to put on record that we on the Labor side of parliament are very proud of our nation's superannuation system. It is obviously a great Labor achievement from the Hawke-Keating days, in partnership with the trade union movement and employers. All observers would recognise that our retirement scheme, particularly based on compulsory superannuation, is an incredible social justice measure, making sure that all working people, no matter what their background, no matter what their income, are able to enjoy a dignified and secure retirement as a result of the superannuation contributions that they make and that their employers make on their behalf. 


Not only is compulsory superannuation a critical social justice measure in Australia; it's also become a really key component of our economic wellbeing as a nation. Superannuation funds are obviously large investors in Australian companies, in property and in infrastructure projects, which all go on to create more jobs for Australian working people as well. There is no doubt that some of the prosperity that Australia has seen over the last 25 years is based on the introduction of compulsory superannuation by the Hawke-Keating Labor government a couple of decades ago. We are extremely proud of our role in having established compulsory superannuation, and we will always fight to preserve it and to preserve workers' ability to have some control and influence over their own retirement savings. 


There was a very clear decision made by the Labor government when we set up compulsory superannuation that it needed to be a bipartisan exercise between employers and trade unions on behalf of working people. A very deliberate decision was made to ensure that boards of superannuation funds reflected the interests that both employers and working people, through their unions, had in the preservation of good retirement savings and a decent retirement for all working people. That's why, when this system was established, it was created on the basis that there would be an equal place for employers and trade unions on the boards of superannuation funds to ensure that those interests were properly reflected. So it's very sad to see this government now wanting to change that, to change a system that has been extremely successful for working people, for social justice, as I have said already, and for the health of the Australian economy. 


It's worth observing that industry superannuation funds, which are the primary target of this legislation, have consistently out-performed retail and corporate superannuation funds over many, many years. We see a government which claims to be about the free market, about prosperity, about lifting economic growth and about making everyone wealthier. It's ironic, then, to see this very government introduce some legislation which interferes with the operations of the most financially successful superannuation funds around—being industry superannuation funds. I could understand the government wanting to take some action if there were a demonstrated poor record from industry superannuation funds, which are run by a combination of employer and union representatives. I could understand it if there were problems there and if members of those funds were essentially being dudded out of their own retirement savings. But it is quite the contrary. If you look back on the record of industry superannuation funds—the funds that do have employer and employee representation on their boards—you see that they have outperformed retail and corporate funds. So, if anyone needs a bit of a look at them, it's surely got to be the retail and corporate funds rather than industry superannuation funds. 


We know that, over a long period of time, large banks have lobbied this government very heavily to get their hands on the massive and growing pile of retirement savings that has been built up by these industry funds on behalf of ordinary working people. We know that lobbyists have been in and out of the doors of ministers' offices and government departments, putting the case for why banks should be able to have greater control over those funds. I don't understand why they've been given much consideration by this government, when, again, if you look at the record of funds that are run by banks, they have a much poorer financial record than the industry funds, which, now, this government wants to tinker with. I would've said to them: thanks; but why don't you go and get your own house in order before you come knocking on the door, seeking to get your hands on the funds which have been run highly effectively on behalf of working people through a combination of employer and employee membership?


I noted that this bill, the strengthening trustee arrangements bill, essentially replicates a similar bill that was brought forward and introduced by this government back in 2015—before I was here, but I remember the debate on it occurring at the time. At that time, Labor senators also put forward a very strong dissenting report on a similar argument—that the right way to go about building up retirement savings is to have them administered by a combination of employer and employee representatives. The government was not able to get that legislation through at the time, and they should've read something into that: this Senate, and the opposition, does not support this attack on industry funds and the retirement savings of working people.


Labor's position on this 2017 bill is very similar to the position that we took back in 2015, and we continue to have the same primary concern, which is that this bill seeks to impose a corporate governance model on funds which operate under a trustee governance model. You've got to acknowledge that the way these industry superannuation funds operate is fundamentally different to the corporate approach taken by retail and corporate superannuation funds. It's quite appropriate that retail and corporate funds have imposed on them a governance system that is based on what happens in the corporate world, but industry superannuation funds effectively run as trustee arrangements, and they need a different approach, accordingly.


Some of the problems of the imposition of this corporate governance approach were highlighted in the Labor senators' dissenting report on this bill, where they acknowledged, at paragraph 1.13, that:


Corporate governance—


the model that's sought to be imposed here—


faces particular issues which need to be addressed and include:


Board members having a fiduciary duty only to their shareholder owners, which can put at risk the needs of a company's customers; and


The presence of executive directors, that is, management of the company having a presence on the board, where decisions might be taken that advantage management over the needs of shareholders.


As I say, it was a fundamental principle in the Hawke-Keating government's embarking on this approach that the administration of industry super funds would be done on a cooperative basis, with agreement reached, hopefully, between employer and employee representatives. It is important that working people have confidence that their retirement savings are being managed in a way where their interests are paramount, not the interests of shareholders in a company. We know that we have a corporate law system where, in large corporations, the interests of shareholders are paramount. That's fine. That's appropriate for a corporate environment. But if we're talking about a system that is designed to protect and grow workers' retirement savings, surely the biggest priority should be to make sure that the interests of those working people who've made their contributions—and employers who've made contributions to these funds as well—remain paramount over the interests of any particular shareholder. That's what's at risk here if these amendments do go through. Similarly, it's not appropriate that the fiduciary duties that directors of corporate funds have, again, primarily being to a shareholder, be simply transferred across and put onto a trustee based fund, when other considerations are important—the needs of the employers and working people, who this system is designed to benefit. Those are the kinds of considerations that are much more appropriate for a trustee based system. But, unfortunately, if this bill is passed, that's what will be removed. 


Equal representation of employers and working people, through their unions, on superannuation boards has been a very longstanding arrangement. It's served Australians well and it is something that Labor believes absolutely needs to be maintained. I just don't understand why the government is so hell-bent on changing a system that works, changing a system that has consistently delivered better financial returns to members than the returns provided by retail and corporate funds. Even if you look away from the benefits to the individual members of these funds, the system that we have in place for superannuation at the moment, the legislative architecture that we have in place, has not only served the members of those funds well but it's actually served the nation well. It's built up a massive, world-leading pot of funds across superannuation that has been effectively invested to the benefit of members of the funds but also to the benefit of the nation, through investments in infrastructure, property and other Australian companies, as well as overseas companies, but there has been a direct benefit to Australia and the Australian economy through the very system which this legislation now seeks to undermine. Over the last 10 years, the analysis conducted by APRA shows that not-for-profit superannuation funds have outperformed bank-owned super funds by, on average, more than two per cent. That's something that we should be encouraging. We should be encouraging the actions and operations of not-for-profit superannuation funds which are overseen by joint employer-employee directors. We shouldn't be trying to undermine them, which is what is sought to be done here. 


As I mentioned, there is only one explanation I can come up with for why the government would want to ignore the evidence, ignore the economic benefit to the nation, ignore the financial benefit to members and ignore the many benefits that flow to employers who participate in industry super funds as well. The only explanation I can come up with is that they've been worn down by the lobbying of big banks and big financial services companies. Indeed, Minister O'Dwyer, who oversees this legislation, let slip what this legislation is really about in November last year, when she said the government needed to 'lift superannuation funds to at least the same standard as other financial services organisations like banks and life insurance companies'. That came from a report in the Financial Review on 23 November 2016. Clearly there is an agenda at play here from this government and from this minister to ignore the proven track record of industry super funds based on a cooperative approach between employers and employees, throw the baby out with the bathwater, copy what's being done by their mates in the banking industry and throw that into the mix as well. 


This is the real aim of this bill. It's to make the governance of superannuation funds the same as that of the big banks. You really have to wonder why any minister would want to put forward a change to our internationally successful superannuation system to make it more closely modelled on what happens with the banks. You would have to wonder why any minister would want to do that, after the litany of scandals that we have seen from Australian banks over the last few years. I've lost count of the number of scandals that we've seen, particularly involving the Commonwealth Bank but across our banking system more generally, with insurance and other products being sold to people who didn't need them, the tying of commissions to the number of sales of products, which perversely incentivises people working in the banking system to sell people products that they don't necessarily need, because that's the only way they're going to get their bonuses. 


We know very well that the Australian public have had enough of this, and that's why the calls that Labor has made for a banking royal commission, backed in by some members of the government and crossbenches as well, has resonated with so many people out there. They're sick of seeing the scandals that we see day after day, month after month, year after year from the big banks. Despite that, despite all the evidence that there are some serious culture problems in our banks, this government now wants to take the approach that banks use, apply it to a successful industry superannuation scheme and provide an avenue for the banks to come in and get their hands on workers' money. I think that the banks, before they're given that opportunity, need to get their own house in order. They need to show that they actually have changed, that their culture has changed and that they recognise their responsibilities to look after their customers as well as their shareholders before we even give any consideration to giving banks a greater opportunity.


It's going to be very interesting, when the House of Representatives comes back in a couple of weeks time, to see where a number of government members of parliament stand on the issue of a royal commission. There have been a number of lower house members from the government, particularly from my home state in Queensland, who've been very vocal about the need for a banking royal commission. But every time there's been the potential for them to vote it in they've either gone missing in action or voted with their own government colleagues. The member for Dawson is probably the best known example. He's an absolute champion of rights for people against the banks when he's back home in Mackay, but the minute he comes down to Canberra he gets taken aside and told what to do, because we all know that he isn't independent of mind and he takes his writing instructions from Canberra and then runs back to Mackay to do what he's told.


I can't remember whether it's on this issue—the banking royal commission—or one of the other many issues that the member for Dawson has grandstanded about, where he has actually said he won't be voting against the government while the former Deputy Prime Minister, the absent Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, is campaigning. That's how strong the commitment of the member for Dawson is to a banking royal commission. It's a perfect example of the fact that he's actually got his own government's interests at heart rather than those of his constituents, who want to see something done about the banks. 


I wouldn't be at all surprised if we see some sort of a debate about the need for a banking royal commission in the last two weeks of the House of Representatives, and it's going to be a real test for the member for Dawson to show where he stands. Does he actually believe the things when he's out there back in Mackay or running around the Bowen Basin beating up the banks, saying that they need a good talking to and they need a royal commission, or is he going to come back down to Canberra like he's always done and fold and lose the chance to put in place a banking royal commission?


It's not just him. The member for Capricornia is another. We know that there are many problems that her constituents have been experiencing with banks. It's a great opportunity for her as well to actually flex her muscles and show her government that she's going stand up for her constituents, when her vote could actually make a difference and could actually drive a banking royal commission.


In conclusion, I don't understand why we would want to tamper with a world-leading superannuation system. It has served us, its members and the Australian economy very well, having that cooperative approach between employers and employees. The last thing we should be doing is letting the big banks get their hands on this before they fix up their own problems.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:18):  I, too, rise to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. I'm glad Senator Watt has remained in the chamber. I trust he's going to stay here for a bit longer, because he put the question to the chamber and to the Australian people: why would we change something that is working well? But the question is: who is it working well for? He also said that if there was any evidence that this was not working well for members then, perhaps, he might reconsider. Can I draw his attention to some of the cases that have been raised in recent years where we have seen members' funds, which they have put into an industry fund for the benefit of their own retirement, used on things that the members are just not aware of and, certainly, are not for the members' benefit. Let's take the disclosures that we see from the Australian Electoral Commission of the financial statements of industry super funds, and you get an estimate that around $8 million was paid last year alone to unions in unexplained payments. Other reports call them 'dark payments'. The industry fund CBUS, for example, chaired by former Victorian Labor Premier Steve Bracks, looks after some 732,000 members working in the construction industry. CBUS paid over $1 million in sponsorship fees to unions, including the ACTU, the CFMEU, the AWU, the AMWU, the ETU and the PTU. 


Coming back to the point that was made by Senator Watt and those opposite about directors appointed by unions, guess where their fees go? In many cases the fees are going directly to the unions, not to the directors themselves. In some cases they get paid a small retainer, or a percentage amount. Essentially there is a flow of cash to the unions both in grants and in other payments, and even the directors' fees go back to the unions. TWUSUPER, which covers transport workers, paid almost $1 million to the TWU last year and over $126,000 in directors' fees. It doesn't publicly release its financial statements, but it is clearly not using those funds for the benefit of its members. Australian Super, one of the largest industry funds, with nearly $92 billion in assets, only declared one payment to the ACTU, of over $225,000, but other unions have declared to the AEC that they receive sponsorship payments from Australian Super. 


What we see here is a clear pattern of industry super funds paying money to the unions. When Senator Watt says it's a system that's working well, I think the Australian people and members of industry funds are well placed to be asking the question, 'But who is it working well for?' Looking to the future, with the growth in the investment value of funds—it is already at $2.3 trillion and it is expected to grow to around $4 trillion over the next 10 years—union payments, if not scrutinised, can be expected to rise to $22 million a year. That's $22 million that should be going into the retirement savings of Australian workers but, instead, is being diverted into the political campaigns and other activities of unions—and that is the question that we need to raise. 


I'm disappointed Senator Watt has left the chamber. He said that it would be dreadful to upset the relationship on the board between employers and employees. The government is not proposing to say you can't have equal representation. You can still have equal representation—people appointed by the employers, people appointed by the unions—but what we're saying is that good governance requires independence, and that is not just in the financial sector; there are many sectors where good governance has a requirement around transparency and independence. The government is saying by all means have your union appointees, by all means have an equal number of employer appointees, but you must have a minimum of one-third independent directors to make sure there are no conflicts of interest and that there are no dark payments, as have been proven, with millions of dollars flowing out of the retirement savings of employees and into the coffers of unions. So the two points that Senator Watt raised are clearly disproven by the facts. 


We have introduced these bills to strengthen the foundation of Australia's compulsory superannuation system, in particular for the default MySuper members. That's an important thing to grasp. There are two elements to that. It's compulsory. This is us taking some of the gross earnings of workers in Australia and putting it into super. It was a Labor idea, we grant that, it has worked well, and we fully support it. But it is compulsory, which means we must make sure the governance around that process is absolutely squeaky clean, is transparent and works in the best interests of employees. 


Because it's the default MySuper program, we're talking here about a whole range of workers, including young people who've just come into the workforce who perhaps have no background in financial planning or management, or thought for their retirement, and what do they do? They just take the default fund that is offered as part of their agreement or what the employer has as the default fund as part of MySuper. In terms of financial literacy, these people are probably some of the most vulnerable in our community. They need the protection of a governance system that not only is effective but is transparent to make sure that the workers are the people who benefit from the growth in that system.


The superannuation sector has grown to over $2 trillion as a result of the mandatory nature of it. These reforms are consumer based reforms. They're focused on the consumer to make sure that it's more accessible and more understandable, and that the providers are more accountable for how they use their members' money. It's aiming to have stronger prudential standards—that is, the enforcement and the transparency which gives people who are putting their money compulsorily into these funds the confidence that it's being managed in their best interests. This is not something that's just been cooked up overnight. There have been a series of reviews that have recommended these kinds of measures and these bills put them together.


There are three bills: Treasury laws amendment improving accountability bills that I mentioned, Treasury laws bill No. 2 and the accountability bills. They aim to increase choice, increase independence on the trustee boards and increase transparency. It includes new measures to strengthen the supervision of the superannuation sector, boosting the trustee accountability and improving member engagement. I've had a crack at the unions here, but importantly it also closes a legal loophole that has been used by some unscrupulous employers, a minority, to short-change employees who choose to make a salary sacrifice contribution into their accounts. 


Contrary to what those opposite would tell you that this is all about the government trying to disrupt and tear down the system, we're actually trying to make it more transparent and effective, and to increase the governance of the framework for the benefit of the employees. The protests that come from the other side, particularly when you hear them say, 'It's working well,' should ask the question, 'Who's it working well for?' Currently, it's working well for the unions. 


Is this just something that comes from the conservative sides of politics? Let's go back to Mr Jeremy Cooper, who was appointed by the ALP as the chair of 2010 super system review—and Labor was in government then. This quote comes from the Senate Economics Committee inquiry hearing. Mr Cooper said, 'Providing for independent directors shouldn't diminish the representation of members but actually enhance it.' He goes on to say, 'How we can make people who are forced to save into it feel confident that the standards of governance is at or near world's best practice.' That is from someone appointed by a Labor government to do a review into super who is saying that transparency is a good thing and will actually enhance the benefit for members.


Professor Graeme Samuel was appointed by the board to conduct an independent review into the governance arrangements at the CFMEU-backed industry fund, Cbus. This quote comes from the Senate Economics Committee inquiry hearing. Professor Samuel said: 'I don't draw a great distinction between the structures of corporate governance. I'm more concerned about the reality of it. When you've got proprietors or sponsors that are heavily involved in the board and are appointed as representatives of proprietors or sponsors, there's a tendency for the skills metrics to be less relevant. That's where independent directors then become much more relevant and where the skills metrics and qualities that they can provide become far more relevant.'


What we hear there is that where it's just jobs for the boys—or girls, as the case may be—the members are actually getting a disservice because the people on the board are there because of who they know not what they know. It is not their skills or competence that results in them getting the appointment; it is because they've been a long-term member or secretary of a union, or they're part of the employer's group. What we've seen from two eminent people who have presented evidence to the Senate committee is that those are not in the best interests of the members of the fund. Members of the funds are members of the Australian public who expect transparency when it comes to money that is theirs, whether it is their savings or their taxes. 


Looking at South Australia, where I'm from, when it comes to transparency we've had an issue just recently, where the Aboriginal Affairs minister, Kyam Maher, has been embroiled in a scandal about the appointment of a Mr King to the APY Lands, and an FOI has uncovered that it looks like there were backroom deals done, appointments and packages approved by the minister—we're not quite sure what the relationship was—but there's been no transparency. Now they're using taxpayer funds to fight the FOI order which was given by the appropriate authority who said, 'Yes, this should be released.' They're fighting that, and the public are rightly outraged that money appears to be being spent in a way that is not endorsed by the board, even, and it is unrealistic in its terms and conditions. 


When it comes to superannuation, people rightly have the same concerns. In South Australia, questions have been asked about the validity of some of the members on the board of Statewide Super in South Australia. People are concerned about this concept of jobs for the boys, or jobs for the girls. Ms Alexandra Overly has recently been appointed as a board member of Statewide Super. She took the position over in March this year, after her husband, Justin Hanson, became a state member of the SA Legislative Council for Labor. Mr Hanson, interestingly, inherited the membership or the directorship from his father. I've got to say, that's a pretty close nexus—from father to son to wife. I think Professor Graeme Samuel's point about whether there is a skills deficit here as opposed to appointment for other reasons is a really valid question that people should be asking. Another Statewide Super director, Mr Ian Steel, was appointed by the South Australian and Northern Territory branch of the Australian Services Union and, according to his LinkedIn profile, he's also been working for Labor ministers. In 2015-16, over 70 per cent of the fees received by Mr Steel for his work as a director were paid to the ASU. There are also current members of the lower house, from the Labor side, who have a history with Statewide Super. Mr Georganas, for example, received $66,000-plus in directors fees for one year, all of which was paid to the ASU. One of our former colleagues here, former senator Anne McEwen, was appointed by the ASU as a member representative on the board of Statewide Super. Katrine Hildyard MP, the state Labor Minister for Disabilities and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Recreation and Sport, was a former secretary of the ASU and also a director on the Statewide Super board and resigned when she went into the parliament. 


You have to start asking questions about whether it is all just an in-house thing and what value is being added to the members, particularly when Statewide Super has started sponsoring things in the community that are related to people from the unions who are on their board. On 9 October, there was a $150,000 sponsorship for women's sports, and Ms Hildyard is now coincidentally the Minister Assisting the Minister for Recreation and Sport. It would be interesting to know if there was any declaration of conflicts of interest around that particular one. Also, the Australian Electoral Commission records show the SA branch of the Labor Party received over $16,000 from Statewide Super in 2015-16. Statewide Super asserts that this was a refund for overpayments. That may well be. But, in total, Statewide Super has paid over $600,000 of the retirement savings of hardworking South Australians to the trade unions over the past decade. Yet, if you come back to this concept of 'compulsory' and MySuper, Statewide Super is the default fund in 18 different South Australian industrial awards, including those for children's service workers, hospitality employees and passenger vehicle transport workers. That means that funds are being stripped out of this super fund—a super fund for some of the lowest paid, hardest working people in Australia, who trust their money to this union, to this super fund—not for their benefit but to go back to the unions. And members opposite ask why we think transparency is important. 


Members opposite made the point, 'It's a good thing if industry super funds outperform other funds.' Let's look at Statewide Super. They have outdelivered and outperformed for the unions but not necessarily for their own members. Using Industry Super's own advertisement concept, let's compare the pair and see how a Statewide Super member would fare next to a member in another industry super fund achieving the 10 year average. Take a 30-year-old office worker and look at what she has achieved in terms of the rate of return. What you will find over a 10-year average period is that Statewide Super returned 3.58 per cent and the Industry Super fund average returned 5.13 per cent. That means that she would be $116,000 worse off in retirement because she didn't look around and check to see if there was another industry fund that would do a better job. I will pick a retail fund that I've done some research on, BT Growth. Over a 10-year period there was a return of 5.53 per cent. So all the rhetoric that says industry funds will always get you a better deal is clearly not correct for Statewide Super. They're not getting the best returns and they're streaming money off to the unions, none of which are in the members' best interests.


What the government is looking to do is not just make the funds more user-friendly for the people who are using them but, importantly, put accountability and transparency around the governance—still keeping the model that the Labor Party want in terms of having employee and employer representatives. That's absolutely fine. But what we're saying is that one-third of the directors should be independent so that we can deal with the issues of conflict of interest and we can ensure that accountability and transparency are there, not in our interests but in the interests of the men and women who those opposite and the unions purport to represent. What we see in the facts before us is that around the country, in union after union and industry fund after industry fund, the savings of hardworking Australians are creamed off and paid to unions for their own political benefit rather than the benefit of their members. I will be supporting this bill.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (18:37):  Here we are again with the continuation of the ideological attack on the trade union movement and any organisation or any person who is in any way associated with the trade union movement. In this instance, we're looking at an attack on the industry superannuation fund sector. Whilst I have a lot of respect for Senator Fawcett, his contribution just continues that attack on the union movement, in terms of the ideology. The premise behind Senator Fawcett's contribution is that union officials should be considered persona non grata. They shouldn't be anywhere near the industry superannuation funds, which, after all, the unions helped to create back in the 1980s, and unions should not receive any payments from anybody, ever.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order! Senator Ketter, resume your seat, please.




Senator Fawcett:
  On a point of order: in fact, I made the point that they are welcome to remain on the board.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's no point of order, Senator Fawcett. Continue, Senator Ketter.




Senator KETTER:
  This is an ideological agenda continuing from what we know of the government's attack on the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. This government's obsession with the union movement is on display for all to see.


In relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannunation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017, I want to start by talking about my concerns regarding the rushed process with these bills. As set out very clearly in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's dissenting report, we note that these bills were introduced into parliament on 14 September this year, on a Thursday morning, on the last day of a two-week sitting period. This was made worse when very short reporting dates were set for the bills. I note that the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, Senator Gallagher, moved a motion to extend the reporting dates on the superannuation bills to give proper time for scrutiny. It is unfortunate that we lost that vote. As I look at the bills in more detail, the more concerned I become. The committee managed to review four bills over a two-day period and, for that, some credit is due to the chair, Senator Hume, for her cooperation, despite the unreasonable reporting dates set by the government.


I'll use my time today to go through two major aspects of these bills: firstly, the policy aspects of these bills and how the government continues to confuse corporate governance and trustee governance; and, secondly, the politics of these bills and the government's incessant desire to destroy the union movement. So the first is the policy issue. I'll begin by talking about the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. Let's be clear: this is a recycling of the same bill that was defeated in 2015. Since that time, no clear evidence has been received to show that there was any deficiency in the funds with equal representation boards that warranted this bill, and that's notwithstanding the contribution that Senator Fawcett made. He identified a number of areas, but, again, it's all about throwing mud at the industry funds and, when it comes to the retail banks and their performance, it's all: 'There's nothing to see over here. Let's move on and attack the sector of the superannuation industry which is performing at a higher level and, at the same time, charging much less in fees to members of the superannuation funds.' There's no evidence which would warrant the establishment of a minimum of one-third independent directors or to warrant abolishing the requirement for equal representation for the remaining board members. 


We have seen the scandals in the major banks. If we take a step back, I think we can all agree that superannuation is now a vital part of our public policy landscape. That wasn't always the case, and I'll talk a bit more about that later.


It's Labor and the union movement that have a proud record of establishing the superannuation sector—$2.3 trillion now—for the benefit of all Australians, not just the privileged elite. Labor and the union movement have a proud history of establishing industry funds or profit-to-member funds. We have capital and labour at the same board tables, working together to enable workers to have a decent retirement. The history—and I know Senator Watt has touched on this—is that it was the unions that won superannuation as an industrial matter back in the 1980s. Then, through the accord with the Labor government, that was established as an industrial matter that could be put into industrial instruments. Of course, employers opposed that at the time. In fact, the employers took the matter to the High Court, and it had to be determined there. Then, having won that battle, Labor introduced the concept of universal superannuation in the 1990s. Where was the coalition at that time? It was opposed to that. When it came to increasing the initial three per cent superannuation to nine per cent, that was something that Labor voted to do. Where was the coalition? Again, it opposed that. When it came to increasing the superannuation level from nine per cent to 12 per cent, again, this was something that Labor voted for and the coalition opposed.


Let's be quite frank about this: the coalition expects us to believe that it is acting in the best interests of the members of the nation's superannuation funds. If it were left to the coalition, we wouldn't have the $2.3 trillion superannuation benefit for Australian workers. In fact, the superannuation system wouldn't exist. If this were a reform package truly designed to focus on improved accountability and member outcomes then the sort of things we'd be looking at would be the underperformance of bank-owned super funds. Why is this happening? It's within our competence to find out what is going on there. Why is it that the bank-owned funds are continuously underperforming compared to industry funds? Why don't we have a look at the vertically integrated structures of the retail banks, the potential conflicts that exist and whether members' interests are being safeguarded there and not bank interests? Why aren't we looking at the lack of visibility of profits and margins in retail funds and their related entities and how much the retail fund is spending on related party transactions, which impact the net return to members? Why aren't we looking at whether all super funds are run only for the benefit of their members? Of course, we know that the elephant in the room is that retail funds are inherently conflicted because they operate in the environment of return to shareholders as well. We should be looking at things like transparency and accountability measures being sector neutral. This is a package of measures which is aimed, fairly and squarely, at the industry fund sector, and it is an instance of the government running, basically, a protection racket for the banks. 


We know that industry funds, according to the analysis of APRA data by a number of stakeholders, have outperformed retail and corporate funds on average, and they've done a better job of making their customers rich. The competitive tension between industry funds and the trustee governance structure and other financial services firms with their corporate governance structure is a good thing for the sector. Ideally, it should be a race to the top to offer the best outcomes for working Australians. 


In that context, looking at the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill, it remains flawed in that it seeks to impose a corporate governance model on funds which operate under a trustee governance model. Corporate governance faces particular issues which need to be addressed. These include board members having a fiduciary duty only to their shareholder owners, which can put at risk the needs of a company's customers, and executive directors—that is, management of the company—having a presence on the board, where decisions might be taken that advantage management over the needs of shareholders. The inquiry found that profit-to-member funds do not normally face these same issues. As the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees notes, 'Profit-to-member funds do not face the shareholder-customer conflict, and also do not have executive directors on their boards.' 


This bill seeks to prescribe independence in legislation. Stakeholders such as the peak body ASFA said that the ASX principles based approach would be the preferred approach. In seeking to mandate a minimum of one-third independent directors, the government is claiming that board decision-making will be improved and that member outcomes will lift in the long term as a result. However, in our inquiry, witnesses such as Mr Cooper, whom Senator Fawcett cited, and Mr Samuel stated that what should really be desired in board member selection is the concept of cognitive independence—that is, that each board member is able to think independently of other board members, with diversity of thought leading to better group decisions. Mr Bernie Fraser, who is well known to most Australians, also appeared before the committee. He stressed that the skills and values of board members are paramount in good board member selection—not labels such as 'independence'. 


When poor consumer outcomes were being considered during the inquiry, Industry Super Australia tabled a document which noted that $480 million in compensation, reimbursements, refunds, payments, remediation and consumer loss for alleged misconduct has been made by the big four banks plus Macquarie and AMP. And this is only in the past two years. This document included details of the ANZ paying an additional $10.5 million in compensation to 160,000 superannuation customers, CBA paying $16.3 million to staff after a review of superannuation guarantee arrangements where they were not paying their part-time staff, the National Australia Bank's superannuation trustee company paying $35 million in compensation for two breaches involving failures in relation to provision of general advice, and Westpac's BT Financial Group paying $12 million to customers whose life insurance claims were knocked back. This document is an absolute eye-opener. It goes for pages. As I said, going forwards two years from 16 September 2015 it details $480 million. If you put that up against the types of issues that Senator Fawcett was raising, we are looking at chalk and cheese here when it comes to failure of governance. That is quite clear. This list continues to evolve. 


As time goes on, we know things are happening. You are well aware of these matters, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. We know that ASIC is pursuing the banks when it comes to attempted unconscionable conduct in relation to the BBSW rate-rigging scandal. So $50 million has been agreed to by the ANZ in respect of a settlement there. It's expected that the National Australia Bank will have a similar settlement. We have seen that the Commonwealth Bank has been in significant breach of anti-money-laundering laws—53,000 breaches. That could potentially lead to billions of dollars in fines.


Although those matters don't directly relate to superannuation, the $480 million figure certainly does. It's also worthwhile noting that just today we see reports of ASIC now probing how banks and super funds stiffed customers of billions of dollars. This is in relation to what is supposed to be happening with the transition of legacy superannuation products into the low-fee MySuper environment. This is supposed to be happening under reforms introduced by the Gillard government in 2012. There was a four-year period to enable all funds to transition to offering the MySuper product. We saw the industry super sector moving across to the MySuper environment much quicker. This ASIC investigation is into the fact that a number of bank-owned super funds have taken until the eleventh hour of the four-year transition period to transfer these funds. 


Why have they done that? This was the subject of a Rainmaker report instigated by Industry Super Australia. Rainmaker concluded that the slow retail transition was most likely a deliberate strategy by retail wealth managers. The transition has had a material impact on the profit margins of some of the major banks. One UBS analyst has said that the profit margins on revenue for the major banks over the past six months fell 8.5 per cent year on year and the MySuper transition was one of the major drivers of the falling profit margins. We see billions of dollars of extra fees being gouged from members as a result of the banks dragging their feet in moving to the low-fee MySuper environment.


We know that there are many other scandals, but I think this just illustrates the point that, when it comes to governance issues and misbehaviour, no credible observer could say that there are genuine governance issues on the industry fund side in comparison to what's been happening with retail banks. We see the ridiculous situation where the minister has said that the purpose of these bills is to lift the standards of all funds to this level. If that's the purpose of it then it really is misdirected, at best. In fact, this is a protection racket for the banks. 


We know that, two years on from the previous attempt to pass these types of bills, the profit-to-member funds have not been idle in reviewing their own governance arrangements. The AIST Governance Code, which applies ASX corporate governance principles to the superannuation and trustee governance context, will be in force on 1 July 2018. Mr Fraser also delivered his review and made recommendations to strengthen the selection process of board members and to ensure that boards had the right mix of skills that they required.


I want to say that I'm not against independent directors as a principle. A number of industry funds have already moved down that track, but it should be left to trustee boards to suit their own circumstances. Where they believe that independent directors would enhance board decision-making then they should be appointed. Many profit-to-member funds, as I said, have adopted such appointments. However, I don't agree with prescribing an arbitrary quota of independent directors and defining 'independence' in legislation. I welcome the work of AIST in developing a governance code and endorse the idea that cognitive independence is what policymakers should strive to achieve. Given all these findings, the Senate should reject this trustee arrangements bill once again. 


A number of the submitters to our inquiry—including, I think, Choice—were very concerned about the fact that the government was throwing the baby out with the bathwater by abandoning the employer and employee governance model and basically leaving a vacuum there. Apart from the one-third director component of the board, the rest of the composition of the board is left open. I think that is very much a backward step. Once again I want to illustrate the difference between what we've got on the industry super fund side and on the bank side. We know that many of the retail bank funds do have a majority of independent directors, but that's in an environment where they've got banking executives sitting on the board of superannuation funds, making decisions about the interests of members—and who is appointing these banking executives to these boards? Of course, it's the banks themselves. Not only do the banks appoint the banking executives; they also appoint the so-called independent directors. When it comes to concerns that we should all have about governance, the focus should very much be on what is going on in the retail super sector. 


When it comes to member outcomes—I have a brief period of time to address this issue; this is a very dense piece of legislation and I won't go through all the details—I am concerned this legislation will not improve protections, accountability and outcomes for members across the sector. In particular, the need to strengthen outcomes for choice products and to improve reporting and accountability of retail RSCs with a large financial firm parent company has not been given due consideration in these bills. In closing, these bills are misdirected; they are a protection racket for the banks and should be rejected.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-11-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:57):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannunation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017. It is always a pleasure to follow my Queensland Senate colleagues from the Labor Party in debates such as this. I have to say, Senator Ketter, you tell a good story. You sound like a banker, you look like a banker and some of your arguments could almost be convincing for someone who didn't understand them. I have to say your colleague from Queensland wasn't quite so urbane. I think I would have purchased a litre of snake oil from him. I think he could sell anything to you if you just go for flowery words. Unfortunately, in both cases, you need to develop some facts about these matters.


I do agree with Senator Ketter in one aspect—that is, there must be transparency and accountability. There's got to be. I heard Senator Watt say that it was important that the representation of workers and employers was maintained. Hang on. We're not talking about a parliament. We're not talking about a football match. We're not talking about a workers' representative and an employers' representative. We're actually talking about people's savings and what the superannuation company can do with those savings. It's not a question of representing one side or the other. It's a question of getting the best financial return. 


I'm sorry Senator Cameron is leaving, because I was going to make a very favourable and complimentary comment about Senator Cameron. I hate to admit it in this chamber, because it will be on the record for all time, but I quite like Senator Cameron. If you take him out of this atmosphere and out of the hothouse atmosphere of the Senate committee process, he's a lovely fellow, good to be with. But I'm not quite sure what Senator Cameron's qualifications were for the position he held as a director for a superannuation company. I think I'm right—and, fortunately, he's gone—that I've heard somewhere in this chamber over the years that I've been here that Senator Cameron was a director of a superannuation company. Now, as I say, I like Senator Cameron; he's a great debater. But I had a look on Wikipedia just to get some background to Senator Cameron to see why he would be a director on a superannuation fund that was trying to maximise the return for those who invested in that superannuation fund. Wikipedia says that Senator Cameron:


… left school at 15 to take up an apprenticeship as a fitter at a local chain-making factory. Shortly after completing his apprenticeship the factory closed …


I don't know if there's any connection between Senator Cameron becoming a tradesman and the factory closing, but that's what Wikipedia says! Mr Cameron, as he then was:


… emigrated to Australia in 1973 … He initially worked at the Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney, before moving to the Liddell Power Station in Muswellbrook—


in the Hunter Valley—


… where he worked as a maintenance fitter. After seven years working at the power station Cameron was elected as the Hunter Valley/New England regional organiser for the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union …


He later became assistant national secretary, was then national secretary of the AMWU for several years and then was elected to the Senate in 2007. I was around at the time. I used to like George Campbell, but I remember how Senator Cameron stabbed poor old George Campbell in the back and came into the Senate.


In that background of Senator Cameron, I'm asking: if that is a union director of a trillion-dollar superannuation fund, what business expertise or financial expertise does he bring as a board member to that particular facility? If I have wronged Senator Cameron—if he wasn't a director—I'll apologise, but I'm pretty certain that's right. I think it became public at one stage. He was on $120,000 a year. I think it only became public because there was a bit of a fight on whether the director's fees, $120,000, belonged to him or belonged to the union that he was representing. I just wonder about someone with that background. I'm sure he was a wonderful fitter and I'm sure he was a wonderful organiser for the union. But does that make him the right sort of person to be a director of a trillion-dollar superannuation fund? Perhaps someone could explain that to me.


Senator Watt spoke a lot about representing the workers and representing the employers. Well, as I say, this isn't the parliament; this isn't a debating society. It's not where you represent someone. What you're there to do as a director is to make sure that the contributions to the fund made by workers get the very, very best return. That's not a question of representing workers or representing employers. It's a question of using every available skill to get the best return for the people whose funds you have control over. I think Labor speakers have this all wrong. It's not a question of representing workers and employers; it's about getting the best result and about accountability and transparency. That accountability and transparency needs to be there and obvious. Senator Watt was saying, 'The union representatives represent all the workers, and so they're there to look after the workers' money.' Can I just alert anyone who might be listening to this debate to the fact that the unions don't actually represent the workers; they represent 10 per cent of the workers. If you've got a union representative on the superannuation company board, supposedly representing the workers because he's a unionist, well, I'm sorry, he's not representing the workers; he's representing 10 per cent of the workers—which means he certainly doesn't represent the 90 per cent of workers who choose not to join a union.


So I think the Labor Party have got this all wrong. It's about the best return for the contributor's money. I would hope that, for whichever superannuation fund I or my wife have, there are directors who know something about high finance, something about international finance, something about exchange rates and something about floating dollars—something really top class. There are many, many people around Australia—very, very good financiers—who understand what money is all about. They should be there—I think that in the retail funds they are there—to get the best return for the contributors to the superannuation fund. They're not there to represent 10 per cent of the workers. They're not there to represent the employers. They're there to get a good deal for those who put their money into the superannuation fund.


I think the Labor speakers on this are simply mouthing the words they've been told to mouth by the unions and the members of the union leadership groups, the union bureaucracy, who, because of their position, happen to be directors of these superannuation companies. They would be drawing in—I don't know—$100,000 or $200,000. It'll all be on the record somewhere, but I do know that $130,000 was spoken about, and that's not a bad return for four or five meetings a year.




Senator Smith:
  Better than the award rate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is a bit better than the award rate—you're right, Senator Smith. I want my superannuation fund to have people who know what they're doing. Whilst I love Senator Cameron—and I'll live to regret that statement, I might say, but he is a nice fellow—when he did his fitter apprenticeship, he joined a company that immediately went broke and then he spent seven years as a maintenance fitter. I'm not quite sure how that qualifies him to deal with high finance. I'm sure he was a very good fitter. Fitting and turning is a very noble and honourable profession. It's not easy in some instances. I have a nephew who has chosen that trade. They're experts at fitting and turning. I wouldn't have thought they're experts at high finance around the world. That's one issue: directors are not there to represent everyone; they're there to get a good return for the money that contributors invest in the superannuation fund.


The other thing that concerns me about the background that has necessitated this bill is that I understand, and there is factual evidence, that over the last 10 years the so-called industry superannuation funds have contributed $53 million of members' money—I repeat that: $53 million of members' money—to the union movement or to the ALP. It is documented, of course, that the money that goes to a union from sources like this does a sort of round-robin circle: it goes to the unions and it's then immediately paid to the ALP to fund election campaigns and to try to keep them in power with their tentacles. So $53 million of contributions have gone to the unions over the last 10 years. Is that accountable? Is that transparent? Why would a superannuation fund be donating $53 million to the unions? Those unions that receive that money then make equally generous donations to the Labor Party, who then use it to try and win elections—and they're pretty good at that.


I wondered when my Queensland colleagues from the Labor Party spoke on this whether they hadn't been given the gee-up by the unions in Queensland running up to the Queensland state election, because I do know that most of the campaign workers for the Labor Party in the Queensland election are not branch members of the ALP, if there is any such a thing—unlike my party. The people working on the booths for my party are actually branch members—ordinary mums and dads, young people, students and retirees out there because they believe in a cause. But I know through experience in just the last few weeks and over many years that the people running the booths for the Labor Party are—would you believe it?—the union organisers, the union heavies, in every state. They are not only from across the state of Queensland; they ship them in from Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia or wherever to man the pre-poll booths and man the booths on the day. There are very few local people, ever, at the booths in Townsville. They're all visiting unionists. We know the one or two local unionists. We know the one or two people locally who are Labor Party members, but there's not many of them. Most of them are people shipped in by the union movement.


I just wonder if the reason that Senator Ketter and Senator Watt are here trying to retain the influence of these union heavies in their board positions on these superannuation funds is they've been given by the union people in Queensland a bit of a hurry up: 'Look, if you guys want us to work for you on the booths, you'd better get into the Senate. Here's a speech we've written for you. You can go and deliver that and say how terrible it would be if this superannuation arrangement was changed.' You could see the passion in Senator Watt's speech on how he wants to retain that privilege for a few union heavies. I repeat: they're not representing the workers, because the unions only represent 10 per cent of the workers—10 per cent! So they're not even representing the workers. They're representing the union heavies, they're representing the ALP and they're representing that privileged group that believe they have a God-given right to be able to interfere with the running of a country or, in the case of Queensland, a state.


I'd like someone to explain where the $53 million from superannuation contributors went. I know it went to the unions, but why? Why would a superannuation fund be making donations to a union? We know that all the unions are there for these days is simply to shovel money through the Labor Party to try and win elections and to keep them in the positions of power and privilege that they currently hold in the state of Queensland and elsewhere around Australia. If there are any more Labor speakers in the debate, it would be interesting for them to indicate why superannuation companies would contribute some $53 million of contributors' money to the unions. Perhaps there is a reason. I've never heard it explained.


The fact sheet is littered with those sorts of things. Charis Mullen has been a director on the board of AusSafe since October 2013, following her nomination by the Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland. She's the campaign coordinator for the AWU's Queensland branch, and she is now the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Jordan in the upcoming election. AustSafe, the superannuation fund of which she's a director, has paid more than $305,000 of members' money to trade unions over the past decade. Why? I would be interested if any Labor speaker could explain that. 


Gary Bullock has been chair of the Intrust Super board since earlier this year. He is the state secretary of United Voice and honorary treasurer of the Queensland Council of Unions. Mr Bullock is on public record about United Voice supporting seven successful ALP candidates in the 2015 state election, going so far as to call them 'the United Voice MPs'. I have to say, with some dismay, that they include the current member—not for long, I hope and expect—for Mundingburra, Ms Coralee O'Rourke, who, according to reports, had her living expenses leading up to the 2015 election paid for by United Voice. Where did United Voice get that money from? Perhaps they got it from that donation from the Intrust Super board. One would be interested to find out why Intrust would have paid—I am told—some $618,000 of members' money to trade unions over the past decade. 


Time, unfortunately, doesn't allow me to go through a series of these examples. I see Senator Watt has rejoined the debate, which is good to see. I'd be interested, Senator Watt, to know if you were ever a director of a—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Macdonald, address your questions through the chair, please.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Chairman, I'd be interested if Senator Watt could tell the chamber whether he has ever been a director of a superannuation fund and, if so, what financial expertise he might have brought to the board. 




Senator Watt:
  I'm an expert on many things but not that.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Senator Watt. That saves me wasting my other 32 seconds on wondering what your expertise is. It hasn't become obvious to me in the time that you've been here. I'm sure it's not financial expertise, but it's not relevant. 


Clearly the whole superannuation industry and the industry funds really do need serious looking at. What's wrong with having independent directors—not workers' representatives or employers' representatives but independent directors—who will look after the money well on behalf of the contributors?

 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:17):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I note that we only have a few minutes left for this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017 before we reach 7.20, so unfortunately I'm probably not going to have the opportunity to really get into the arguments that I was going to breathtakingly make that would blow you away. You may have to wait till tomorrow for that opportunity, Mr Acting Deputy President. 




Senator Watt:
  What time do we come back?




Senator DASTYARI:
  I believe they are selling tickets for it upstairs. It's going to be massive; that's all I can say—huge! 


I think it's important for us to spend a little time having a closer examination of the real intention of legislation such as this. It is unfortunate that, at the heart of so many of the decisions that get made, or the arguments that get pushed, by the government, there is an ideological agenda. I think that these bills, unfortunately, are not devoid of ideology, when really we should be having a debate about a fairly practical piece of legislation around superannuation laws, around strengthening trustee arrangements. What we have here is legislation that does nothing more, in the opinion of many Labor and crossbench senators, than push forward a strong ideological agenda. 


The government, unfortunately, come from a political stream of thought that means they have never really been fans of superannuation. The idea of superannuation is something that the government and the conservative side of politics have consistently opposed in one form or another. Towards the end of the Keating government, there was a proposal to increase superannuation. Over time, this was something that they opposed. The notion that there is going to be a savings base for the nation that is built by workers, protected by workers and controlled by workers is something that, unfortunately, those at their end of town have always argued against. There is a simple proposition at the heart of this. Do you vote to keep money in the pockets of mums and dads saving for their retirement, or do you pursue an agenda that is about increasing and lining the pockets of some of Australia's wealthiest, most successful bankers? That is what the debate here is going to be about—and, in 10 seconds, that's just a snippet.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2017-11-15,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  I rise to speak tonight on the result of the national survey on marriage equality. This is a result that may not be welcomed in some parts of our nation and, indeed, in some first-nation communities. However, the right result has come from the voice of the Australian people. In a modern civil society like Australia, the right stance for our country is to hear the voice of the people and to translate it into good law. The result of the same-sex marriage survey provides political guidance to the parliament and how it should now act. We need to pass a law to reflect these wishes. This does not mean being unmindful of those who have contrary views. However, we have seen enough discrimination. We have seen enough inequality. We have seen enough prejudice. In this place, we have the capacity to make those unions of loving same-sex attracted couples civilly supported, celebrated and legally sound.


Marriage inequality is one form of institutional, systemic discrimination which our country now wants us to fix. Marriage equality of same-sex couples sends a message that you are equal; you are entitled to fairness; you are as Australian as any other Australian; you are a valued human being; and you are loved equally. I hope a positive message can ripple out to all our Australian people that this is now a time for respect, for hope, for understanding and for acceptance. We know bigotry, ignorance and negative discrimination can and does upset and divide families and communities. It does shatter the lives of individuals and needs to be rejected on all occasions. We, the first-nations people, know all too well that stinging feeling of being consigned to a lesser status in our society because of our identity, our race, our experience of rejection and our non-recognition, in truth, as to who we are: the first peoples of this country.


Institutional discrimination has to be overcome by good policy and fair laws. Personal attitudes and beliefs are often harder to deal with, but education and compassion are often necessary. They are often subjective and the result of our beliefs, knowledge and experience as well as our encounters with and treatment by others. Good law in our parliament should work towards resolving such matters—balancing them and ensuring that human beings are put first, not our institutional prejudices. Slowly, our nation is becoming slightly more understanding and more tolerant of differences and diversity amongst its people. We may hold different views but, in our civil society, government has to make laws that are fair, balanced, respectful of difference and diversity and for the common good. The idea that a single point of view is the only view is long gone. Knowledge, understanding and honour require us to rectify the injustices that have plagued our society. The same-sex marriage equality survey tells us that.


I understand and respect the views of fellow Australians, including some first-nation Australians, who may feel that they cannot support same-sex marriage because of their own beliefs, whether those beliefs emanate from their religious faiths or from their understanding of their own social, cultural traditions. I respect their views and value their perspectives. But, in a civil society, different beliefs, values and traditions can be respected without allowing any single view to dominate as the good order of the society. Many first nations peoples who want to see acknowledgement of our own uniqueness in the nation state also want to see respect for those who are different to us in terms of their customs, values and practices. We should be aware of and reflect on the diversity and inclusiveness of our own Indigenous societies, irrespective of our differences. There is more in common that we hold than what divides us. Our national society has to try to reflect this modern mix and composition of ideas, beliefs and values. Kinship connects all human beings so that no-one is less than anyone else. Our protocols embody respect for those who are different, so they are included, not excluded or ostracised. Mutual respect underpins the reciprocity we so often offer to this society but so rarely receive in return.


The Western notion of the marriage contract is a recent construct that has inserted itself into our ancient, ongoing kinship systems and societies. Marriage so often has, historically, been about private property, possessive ownership and the exchange of goods and chattels. Women have often been treated as only equivalent to property. This is still true in some societies today. Today, the same-sex marriage equality survey tells us to move away from that legacy—to treat partners not only as equals but also as equals to others who have married under Australian law. Marriage equality is about precisely that—equality.


It is up to us as individuals, as fellow humans, to do what our conscience tells us, to do what is good, what is true and what is honest. People who love each other and want to celebrate that love and commitment should not be penalised. In our civil society, the burden for the parliament is to seek the common ground, to do what is best for our citizens, to deliver the long-overdue justice to same-sex couples. The nation's voice has told us that Australians support marriage equality. We must now get on and make that happen.


I look forward to seeing more of the respectful attitudes that were portrayed today—when the bill was moved by Senator Smith and in the responses made by the leaders of the various parties. Tomorrow, let us see that respect carried through in a true, just and respectful manner.
