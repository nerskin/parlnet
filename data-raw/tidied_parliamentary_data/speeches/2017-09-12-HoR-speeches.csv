Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (13:30):  Earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition and I met with a group of very special people. We met with Eddie Blewett and his mums—Claire and Neroli—from Tathra in New South Wales and a whole group of rainbow families and their supporters. I'd hoped that since they were last here, about a year ago, the parliament would have done its job and legislated for marriage equality. Sadly, this Prime Minister has instead delivered a ridiculous $122 million postal survey. None of us wanted it, but we are determined to win it. We've already seen the vitriol that this postal survey is inflicting on the LGBTIQ community, Australians, their family and their friends. I know that over the next few weeks that times will be very tough for people like Eddie and his friends, but I want to say to them today that we stand with them and that we've got their backs.


Ballot papers will begin arriving in people's letterboxes over coming days. I urge people to fill in their ballots and post them back as soon as possible; don't get distracted. I urge people to vote 'yes', because I'm voting yes for family like Eddie's, Claire's and Neroli's. I'm voting yes for people I've never met, for someone in a country town who's just coming to terms with their sexuality and who hasn't told anyone yet. I'm voting yes for that person. I'm voting yes because I want a country that supports all its citizens equally. (Time expired).

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:12):  This government is cutting almost $8 billion from our universities. A country that wants a strong economic future and a strong future for its young people doesn't cut $8 billion from its universities. Almost $4 billion will be cut from university funding and another close to $4 billion will be cut from university infrastructure when the Education Investment Fund comes under attack by those opposite if they get their way. This government wants students to pay higher fees and to repay their debts sooner for a poorer quality of education. What a rip-off! It's no wonder that around two-thirds of Australians who were surveyed recently by Universities Australia are opposed to those university cuts and it's no wonder that people in South Australia and Victoria are particularly opposed. For the Liberals and the Nationals—for those opposite—every change to universities during their time in government has been about funding cuts. There's no reform agenda from those opposite. It's always about funding cuts. It's never about helping students.


But, if it's budget savings that those opposite want, we're here to help. We are. We're here to help. How about those opposite dump their $65 billion big-business tax cut? How about those opposite dump their tax cut for those on $180,000 a year or more? There's another $19 billion we can find for them. How about they join us in cracking down on negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions? There's $37 billion that they could save. There you go: well over $100 billion that we could save them if they took some of our sensible suggestions instead of slugging students once again. 


We have been very proud of our record on universities from the Whitlam days onwards, where we made a particular effort to open university education to students with merit, to students who were prepared to work hard and study hard, who were prepared to be judged on their capacity for hard work and on their intellectual capacity, not on their parents' bank balance. That has always been our record. That has always been our approach to university funding, but it has not been the case for those opposite. Those opposite want to return us to a day where only the rich can afford to send their children to university. It's very interesting that they're saying, 'Oh, look at that, look at that: wasting money here, wasting money there.' They've talked about high salaries for vice chancellors—and, actually, some of those salaries are pretty eye-watering. Nothing those opposite are proposing will actually bring these salaries down, but they do want to give those people a $16,000-a-year tax cut on top of the generous salaries. So the only people in this chamber who want to see those on high incomes in the university sector do better are those opposite.


Those opposite have also complained about the money spent on advertising. Well, it is a little bit rich, isn't it, from those opposite, when they're spending $15 million promoting the Prime Minister's favourite slogan of Australia being an innovation nation? So they actually want to cut university funding that delivers innovation but they're prepared to spend $15 million advertising innovation at the same time—I'm sure I'm not the only one who sees the irony in that—or spend $3 million on the now-axed Green Army, or $10 million congratulating themselves on signing free trade agreements.


It is also a bit rich for those opposite to be complaining about universities, which are enormous generators of economic activity in this country and which are enormous generators of export earnings for this country, actually advertising what they do. In fact, Deloitte Access Economics says that university-educated workforce participation added an extra $140 billion to Australian GDP in 2014. International education is a $22 billion export industry for this country. So I actually think it's probably a good thing that we're advertising to attract more overseas students to come to Australia to participate in our excellent higher education system.


Universities directly and indirectly account for about 160,000 full-time-equivalent jobs. It's only those opposite who think that it's a bad idea to be promoting an important industry like that in Australia. We will continue to stand with students, with academics, with university staff and, in fact, with any Australian who's concerned about our future in opposing the cuts of those opposite, in opposing the fact that those opposite want to jack up student fees by 7.5 per cent.


Those opposite want to bring down repayment thresholds so that students who are currently repaying their HELP repayments when they start to earn $55,000 a year would start to repay instead at $42,000 a year, just $6,000 above the minimum wage. If you reduce the repayment threshold to $42,000 a year, what you are effectively doing is asking some young Australians, most often women—let's be frank about it—to face 100 per cent effective marginal tax rates introduced at this budget. Those opposite say it's unfair for people on more than $180,000 a year to face a tax increase because that's a 'success' tax. If you're on $180,000 a year and you have to pay a bit more tax, that is a 'success' tax that will drive educated Australians out of Australia. But if you're earning $42,000 a year and you've just struggled to put yourself through university, and you're hoping that you can get that higher-paying job to pay for yourself to move out of your parents' home, or maybe start to save a deposit for a house or maybe pay the rent, then that's not a 'success tax', that's just fair enough, isn't it? For those people paying 100 per cent effective marginal tax rates, that's just fair enough.


We know also that this government wants to cut funding from the Education Investment Fund. I have travelled around Australia and I have been to university after university where they have proudly showed me the excellent investments that have come from this Education Investment Fund, proudly showed me the difference that this investment has made in providing state-of-the-art buildings and facilities for students—not just for Australian students but, again, to attract students from overseas to study in our excellent institutions. Those opposite want to kill that as well.


There is no more important investment we can make than in our young people—as individuals, from the time of early childhood education, right through a decent school education, in post-secondary education, through TAFE and through universities. Every individual young Australian benefits when we properly invest in our education system. It's not just the young ones. We know that more and more today, Australians won't be doing one job through their working life and they won't be doing half a dozen; they'll have half a dozen, a dozen jobs, in several different careers throughout their working lives and they will need to train and retrain for those opportunities.


If we don't make those investments, we are leaving people behind throughout their working lives and we are robbing ourselves as a nation. Highly successful nations invest in their people, and one of the best investments we can make as a nation in our national prosperity is to have a highly skilled, high-productivity workforce that invents and discovers and innovates—one that uses all of the opportunities of the Asian century, globalisation, automation and artificial intelligence, not to impoverish our people, not to see them washed up on the shores of fate, but to use those great global trends to benefit our people. We can't do it unless we're investing in those same people. We rob ourselves as individuals and as a nation if we don't make these investments. And that applies equally to the wealthiest Australian and to the poorest Australian, because we know that intelligence is not captured at the wealthy end of our population but spread across it.


I'm proud of the fact that when Labor was in government we boosted Indigenous student numbers by 26 per cent, and that there were 36,000 extra students from low-income families. That's the sort of change we need to invest in. (Time expired)

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2017-09-12,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (15:22):  It is an absolute delight for me to be able to speak on the MPI today. I absolutely support the reforms that the Turnbull government is making to higher education.


From a local point of view, the electorate that I represent on the Gold Coast has two universities. In fact, there are three universities on the Gold Coast: Griffith University, Southern Cross University and Bond University. And it's Southern Cross University and Bond University that are in my electorate of McPherson. Southern Cross University is a public university and it has been going from strength to strength. They have embarked on a significant building program, which has been in place for a number of years. They are doing a fabulous job in South-East Queensland, and also in northern New South Wales.


Bond University, a private university, is in the northern part of my electorate, and it has topped institutions from around the country to earn the highest level of student satisfaction. There are a number of criteria that are measured, and the indicators include the quality of the education experience, teaching quality, learner engagement, learning resources, student support and skills development. Bond University is an outstanding university, and it has significantly punched well above its weight for a number of years now. It is a university, clearly, that has high levels of student satisfaction. It is very well regarded in a number of disciplines, particularly law. So I congratulate Bond University. There are many things that I would say that the public sector could learn from Bond University and how it has developed and evolved over the years.


Australia does have a world-class higher education system. It's a modern and a successful system. We have 16 universities in Australia in the top 300 world university rankings for 2017-18, and our Australian universities support about 1.4 million students. Our higher education system provides job and career opportunities for hundreds of thousands of young Australians every year, and the reforms that this government has put forward will ensure that it continues to provide those same opportunities for generations of Australians to come.


Our reform package follows extensive consultation with stakeholders, and I really do congratulate the Minister for Education and Training, Senator the Hon. Simon Birmingham, because he has done a terrific job, making sure that he has consulted widely for well over 12 months, and the reforms that have been put forward are based on that very extensive consultation that he in particular has undertaken. Our reform package focuses on three key issues: improving the sustainability of higher education, providing more choices for students and increasing transparency and accountability. Our reforms are fair. They will continue to drive quality and excellence in higher education and ensure that Australians who want to study have the right support and the right opportunities.


The growth in both student debt and taxpayer costs is significant to us, and it's an issue that we have taken on board. The demand driven system has certainly led to a significant but unsustainable growth in higher education loans that has to be addressed, and our reform package clearly does that.


I'd like to put today's MPI into some context. There is legislation that's currently being debated in the House, and that is the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill. That bill delivers on the Turnbull government's commitment to a stronger, more sustainable and student-focused system that preserves and expands access to education while, importantly, achieving savings that were outlined in the budget. I'd just like to go through some of the key features of the bill that is currently being debated in the House. There already has been some debate, and I understand that that will continue this afternoon.


The bill before the House rebalances the costs of higher education between the government and students by adjusting the relative shares of taxpayer contribution amounts and student contribution amounts for courses, whilst still ensuring that the majority—about 54 per cent, on average—of the cost of a degree is paid for by the taxpayers. It does introduce an efficiency dividend for universities, of 2½ per cent in each of 2018 and 2019, so that universities are sharing in the cost, along with students and taxpayers, of keeping the sector sustainable.


The bill lowers the Higher Education Loan Program, HELP, thresholds for repayment, and it introduces new indexation arrangements to encourage more of the $50 billion in loans to be repaid and to be repaid sooner. It strengthens the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, which supports disadvantaged and under-represented student cohorts to access and to succeed at university.


We will retain the demand-driven arrangements for undergraduate qualifications and we will extend them to sub-bachelor places, with significant safeguards to ensure quality and industry links. We'll provide a subsidy for units of work experience that count towards a Commonwealth-supported qualification. We're allocating subsidies for postgraduate places directly to students, rather than to universities, so that students can exercise choice in their provider. The bill does introduce performance benchmarks for universities, linked to funding, that increase transparency on how funding is used to support student achievement, and the metrics will be developed in consultation with the sector.


The key features of the government legislation are that it's a fair, sustainable package of reforms; there's no fee regulation; the helplines will stay; and accountability of higher education institutions will be increased with expanding access for students. Those are the key features of it. All of us in this House would agree that education is vital to Australia's future successes, but so is lower debt. The Turnbull government's reforms are focused on encouraging quality and excellence in Australian higher education. They ensure that students have the support that they need to succeed while also making sure that the system is sustainable for future generations so the students that are yet to come have the sorts of opportunities that this and other generations have had.


We're going to keep growing our record level of funding for higher education. However, it will be better targeted and provide equitable access for underrepresented groups. It will meet the needs of industry and the community and hold higher education institutes accountable for the taxpayer funding that they receive.


The reforms start from a clean slate. There will be no fee deregulation and no 20 per cent funding cut for universities. We've been through a comprehensive process, including a discussion paper that attracted more than 1,000 submissions, and worked with an expert advisory panel. Out of that consultation—and again I congratulate the minister—we have come up with a responsible suite of reforms. That's in stark contrast to the brash approach from the Labor Party when they were last in government and announced over $6 billion worth of cuts to the higher education sector.


We believe that this gets the balance right. We have a very high-quality higher education system in Australia, and it's important that we build on our current strengths. Education is our third-largest export, and higher education is a key part of that. I was recently in India as part of the Australian Business Week in India program, and it was very pleasing to see that there were a number of our universities at that forum. They were very focused on building opportunities for their university in the Indian market and also on encouraging Indian students to come and study here in Australia. To do that, it's very important that we maintain our high-quality higher education system and that we ensure—as we are doing—that the reforms we are putting in place will ensure that that system is sustainable into the future.

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (15:32):  Rebalancing, efficiency measures, dressing up cuts as reform—the bill to cut university funding, currently before the House, is yet another example of the government dressing up its cuts as so-called reform. There are some $3.8 billion of cuts to university funding, cuts that come on top of cuts of $17 billion in school funding and cuts that come on top of cuts to TAFE of more than $2.8 billion, with further cuts of $637 million slated in this year's budget. These cuts aren't just numbers on a budget paper. These cuts are putting education and training out of the reach of the most vulnerable people in our community.


This government is cutting university funding, increasing student fees and hiking up student debt, forcing students to pay back bigger debts sooner. It is introducing fees for university-enabling courses that are currently free and that under these changes will cost a student $3,200. It is putting financial obstacles in the path of people who can least afford it—people starting out in life, people starting over in life and people who've never had a start in life.


I want to particularly focus on the government's proposed fees for enabling courses. Enabling courses are taken by some of the most disadvantaged people to give them the skills and the confidence they need to go to university. Dr Joy Christensen is a program convener for enabling education at the University of Newcastle Ourimbah Campus. Joy and I went to primary school together. I spoke to Joy this afternoon. There are currently more than 800 students enrolled. They are predominantly from under-represented backgrounds, low SES, regional and remote students, people with disability, people living with mental illness, and students who are predominantly the first in their family to go to uni.


This is what Joy said when I spoke to her today:


We don't want this pathway to be taken away. These students have so many obstacles already, the introduction of fees is a huge obstacle for them. The reason many of them are involved is to improve the financial situation for them and their families. They are taking time away from work, they are taking time away from their families and money away from their families to find out whether they can do this. They won't do it if there is a financial cost.


Joy says:


I am amazed what it has taken many of them to put a foot in the door—


to take a step on a university campus—


they have incredible potential. This program is life changing for them, their families and our community. It transforms lives.


Enabling courses are particularly important in my electorate of Dobell, where around 57 per cent of people of working age did not have the opportunity to complete high school. At the Central Coast Campus of the University of Newcastle, around a quarter of undergraduate students begin their studies through one of these preparation courses. The University of Newcastle, under the government's cuts, will lose $63.2 million of funding over four years. In July, Labor's deputy leader and shadow minister for education, the member for Sydney; Senator Deborah O'Neill; Anne Charlton, Labor's candidate for Robertson; and I visited Ourimbah Campus of the University of Newcastle. I met with Dr Joy Christensen and Associate Professor Seamus Fagan, the Director of the English Language and Foundation Studies Centre, together with Open Foundation students Maureen and James and current Newstep student Claire.


The story I will share with you now, Jackie's story, is typical of the stories that we heard that day. I spoke to Jackie's sister, Sam, today. She gave me permission to speak on behalf of Jackie. Jackie started Open Foundation at Central Coast Campus this year and wants to be a teacher. Jackie finished high school without an ATAR, fell pregnant at 19, is a mum to three children and at 29 years old was working in a bakery earning $15 an hour. Jackie is doing it tough: her middle child, Ryan, has autism and started kindergarten this year. If Jackie were charged $3,200 up front she couldn't start Open Foundation. She wouldn't have taken the first step to a better life. This is unfair. The enabling course is a perfect introduction to a degree. It gives people access to the confidence and support that they need to be able to make a decision, when all they have been told is that they are not good enough, that this is out of their reach.


This is unfair. These cuts must be reversed.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2017-09-12,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray—Chief Nationals Whip) (15:37):  Whilst the heartfelt message of the previous speaker, the member for Dobell, indeed reflects a very serious situation, the fact remains that these reforms to higher education do not represent cuts to the university sector at all. What we are in fact seeing is that the $17 billion for higher education that we currently have in 2017-18 is going to grow by 23 per cent over the next four years, the period that we have in the out years on our forward estimates in our budget. In a sense, this is typical Labor Party posturing whereby they can somehow or other see a 23 per cent increase in university funding as a cut.


This government has been able to work through this reform process knowing that education accessibility not just in the cities but also in regional Australia is critically important. The government recognises that a gap does exist in university provision for remote students, who may wish to remain in their local areas so they can complete their studies where they have grown up. As part of the higher education reform package, the government will provide $15 million over four years to assist with the establishment and maintenance of up to eight community owned regional study hubs right across Australia.


Regional study hubs will provide infrastructure such as study spaces, videoconferencing, computing facilities and internet access as well as pastoral and academic support for the students studying via distance at partner universities. This support, provided by the regional study hubs to students, will address the government's aim of improving accessibility to higher education for students from rural and remote communities. In addition, regional businesses and employers will benefit from an increased pool of skilled graduates in their regions.


In my electorate of Murray, the coalition government has recognised a need to invest in higher education as well, with the University of Melbourne contracted to receive funding of $38.9 million for the period of 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 through the federal government's Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training Program. The University of Melbourne's rural health department will operate across a range of locations in regional Victoria, and its main campus, based in Shepparton, will therefore be a major beneficiary of this funding. As a previous speaker from the coalition mentioned, in the last three years of the Labor government, they proposed to cut more than $6 billion from higher education and research and also introduced the 3.25 per cent efficiency dividend. So, as a regional overview of these reforms, this portfolio supports the Australians living in rural and regional communities through a range of programs.


We also see the HEPPP will be reformed to deliver three funding streams to universities: a loading for each eligible SES student; performance funding based on success rates of low-SES and Indigenous students; and a national priorities pool to give a greater focus on rigorous evaluative research and to encourage collaboration between universities. The Australian government is also going to commit $24 million over four years for the Rural and Regional Enterprise Scholarships program, which will support 1,200 regional and remote students to undertake science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The scholarships are for undergraduate, postgraduate and vocational education students, and they aim to improve access to educational opportunities for regional and remote students.


Students in the regions will also continue to benefit from the investment of more than $280 million over the next four years through regional loading to support the cost of educating students in regional and remote Australia. We understand that over the last few years taxpayers have been funding education, which has grown at 71 per cent under the demand-driven system for higher education since 2009, and that this rate has been twice the growth of the economy.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (15:42):  The issue of debate before the House today is really one of those that encapsulate the lack of vision that the coalition government has for our nation—the short-sightedness, the smallness of ambition. When the Prime Minister challenged the member for Warringah for the leadership of the Liberal Party, he promised a new style of leadership that explained the challenges facing our country and how to seize the opportunities that were open to us. The Prime Minister promised advocacy, not slogans. Instead, this week he's given us name-calling and buck-passing on energy policy, and billions of dollars of cuts from our universities.


These cuts are dumb cuts. There's almost $4 billion of cuts from universities over the next five years in a bill before the parliament this week, including nearly $40 million in cuts over four years from Victoria University in my own electorate. Almost $4 billion is being cut from university infrastructure funding from the Education Investment Fund. And this government's billions of dollars of cuts to our universities represent a double whammy for Australia's economic growth prospects, as they undermine the future of one of our strongest performing export industries and sabotage an engine of economic opportunity for young Australians.


Education is one of Australia's strongest export industries. In fact, in the 2015-16 financial year it was worth about $21 billion—seven per cent of our total exports and about 30 per cent of our services exports. It's one of the few non-commodity bright spots in Australia's trade performance in Asia. But this is an export industry that's built on quality; it relies on Australia's brand as a prestige provider of higher education services, as a high-value exporter of university education. We should not be complacent about our ability to maintain this brand in our region. Australia is already facing increasing competition on this front. The top five source countries of international students in Australia last year were all Asian nations: China, Singapore, Malaysia, India and Vietnam. Yet these are the same nations that are investing heavily in their domestic higher education institutions and they are making significant strides. In 2007 there were just eight Asian universities in the QS World University Rankings, formally the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Ten years later, another four Asian universities have joined them and entered the top 50. Now eight of these top 50 Asian universities are from those five largest source countries for international students at Australian universities. Competition is accelerating for this important export industry. Indeed, just this month we saw Tsinghua University in China move past Melbourne University in these rankings. Unless we invest in the quality of this important sector, our competitors in the region and our biggest export customers will quickly close the gap. Indeed we have already heard warnings from the sector that the government's cuts are a wrecking ball which threatens to demolish one of the best university systems in the world. We cannot be complacent about this golden goose of Australian services exports.


These cuts are also a blow to the important engine of economic opportunity for Australian kids. I feel this acutely as a representative of an electorate containing the University of Opportunity and Success, a Victorian university that has specialised in bringing through those first-generation members of families to attend higher education. These are the students who are most easily dissuaded, the most easily deterred by increases in upfront fees. That's why Labor will oppose the increases in fees being proposed by the government. We will also oppose the Liberals cutting the number of Commonwealth supported post graduate places and the changes to the payment thresholds.


But I want to draw particular attention to probably the meanest proposal in this package—that is, to increase the four enabling courses that are currently free but after these reforms, if they're implemented, will cost students $3,200 a year. These enabling courses are often taken by some of the most disadvantaged people, the most vulnerable trying to get their foot on the higher education ladder to give them the skills they need to go to university. As I say, I have spoken to many of these families in my community; it's not easy. It costs more. They need extra help, but the whole nation benefits when we succeed. The whole nation benefits when we expand access to higher education to more Australians. And that's why I'm extremely proud the previous Labor government got 190,000 more Australians into university.



When last in government, we on this side invested in the sector. We lifted overall investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013 and this is the approach we will need if we are to secure the sector into the future. (Time expired

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:47):  Well, here we go again. We have the Labor Party coming in again claiming there are cuts. They normally put the word 'cruel' in front of them and talk about these so-called cruel cuts' that the coalition are making. We saw it during the end of the last session, where they talked about our alleged cuts to public schools. And I remember the member for Sydney standing at the dispatch box ranting and raving how they were going to pursue us everyday and tell the public about how we're making these cruel cuts to schools. And they have even threatened us with the bunting; that's right, they threatened the bunting in the election campaign. 'Not the bunting,' we said. But they threatened us with the bunting.


What have we heard since then from the Labor Party on schools? What have we heard? Not a beep. And why have we not heard a beep? Because their claim of cuts was completely debunked by the facts. As we know, truth is not something that we associate with those that sit on that side of the chamber. Now let's just have a look at the numbers here for higher education. Labor claim they're cut. The first thing I did was say, 'Let's look at the numbers and let's see where these cuts are.' Labor left office in 2013. We had $14.9 million in spending on higher education. In 2014, the first view of the coalition government, we increased it to $15.3 billion. No cuts there. In 2015, did the coalition make cuts? No, up it went again. It was $16 billion in 2015. So what about 2016? Was there a cut there?


No, there was $16.5 billion in 2016.    Perhaps there was a cut this year? If you listened or if anyone is listening in the parliament, you would think that we cut funding this year. What do we have, finally, with the numbers for this year? In 2017, we have $17.2 billion. In fact, the truth is that, this year, the coalition government is spending 15 per cent more than the last year of the Labor government. That's right. We are spending 15 per cent more than the Labor government were in their last year of government. They come in here and embarrass themselves by talking about cuts. What an embarrassment! They talk about cuts when the numbers show they are clearly increasing. Truth, like mathematics, is not something that is strong on the Labor side. 


What about going forward? Perhaps there are some cuts going forward. Let's look at the numbers going forward? Remember, this year we are at $17.2 billion, 15 per cent more than in Labor's last year in office. For 2018, the coalition has budgeted for yet another increase to $18.6 billion. Up it goes again under the coalition government. In 2019, again, we've budgeted for an increase to $19.2 billion. And in 2020, yet again, there is an increase under the coalition to $20.2 billion. 


So, this story that we hear about cuts over and over from Labor members of parliament is simply untrue. I could use another word that's unparliamentary. Perhaps you have to show intent for that other word, but I don't think the Labor Party actually do their homework. I don't think they actually look at the numbers. I think they just get their talking points from head office and mumble through their talking points: 'They're cutting, they're cutting and they're cutting.' They repeat like parrots. If they looked at the numbers and facts, they would see there's a clear increase under this coalition government.



We are doing the right thing by higher education. Changes need to be made because we have to make the system sustainable going forward. Yes, the end result is no student in this nation that wants to back themselves and get a higher education has to put one cent out of their pocket. The government will back them up-front for all their cost. On average, the government will pay 54 per cent of their cost of education. That is a pretty good deal. We are spending more money. There are no cuts. There is record funding going into higher education, and we're giving every student the opportunity to get into university if they want to back themselves without one cent coming out of their pocket.

Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (15:53):  The member for Hughes says there are no cuts and he's accusing us of misleading the parliament. Universities Australia articles say 'Rankings highlight risk of uni funding cuts' and 'Science would be hardest hit by proposed university cuts'. It is Universities Australia and not the Labor Party. The actual sector is saying that you are cutting. You should do some research, Member for Hughes. 


A pathway to higher education has never been more important for people living in regional Australia. In my electorate, we have so much to do to increase the number of people engaged in higher education. Torrens University Australia Social Health Atlases states that Braddon's school leaver participation in higher education, at an average of 18.58 per cent, is lower than the Tasmanian and national average. Respected economist and University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor's Fellow Saul Eslake has previously said: 


Higher levels of educational participation and attainment won't solve all of Tasmania's economic and social challenges—but they will make them less difficult to solve, not least by sustainably increasing the resources which can be used to solve them.


In my electorate, I have the Cradle Coast Campus of the University of Tasmania, which offers full and associate degrees. It offers a wide range of opportunities for postgraduate study and PhDs in agricultural science through the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture. It works closely with local industry, delivering courses in partnership with the Tasmanian Manufacturing Centre of Excellence for advanced manufacturing in Burnie.


During the 2016 election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition committed $150 million to the UTAS northern transformation project, a project that will transform higher education in my electorate. It will offer even more opportunities for regional students and more study options. UTAS estimates the project will draw more than 12,000 new students and create 3,100 new jobs.


It is somewhat telling that the Prime Minister was shamed into matching Labor's commitments in the dying days of the election campaign. When it comes to accessing higher education opportunities in regional Australia, the coalition doesn't get it. What they do get is cuts to education. They have identified savings, which are cuts, and they certainly do not see education as an investment in our people and in our economy.


This Prime Minister wants to impose an $8 billion cut to universities, charge fees for university enabling courses and reduce the payment threshold for HELP. Overall, these cuts mean $51.3 million will be lost from UTAS. Former UTAS Vice-Chancellor Peter Rathjen has previously been on the public record saying that cuts to UTAS could threaten the future of regional campuses, particularly the Cradle Coast Campus.


These cuts have hit the Higher Education Participation and Partnership Program, HEPPP, which was introduced by Labor, hard. The Liberals and Nationals have already cut nearly $200 million from HEPPP. Under Labor, HEPPP increased Indigenous student numbers by 26 per cent and regional students by 30 per cent, and it supported more than 36,000 extra students from low-income families to attend university.


Embedded in these cuts is a cruel plan by the Prime Minister to start charging fees for university enabling courses. It is almost as if this government does not want to give aspiring students, particularly in regional areas like mine, even the opportunity to attend university. Universities Australia Chief Executive Belinda Robinson recently had this to say about the Prime Minister's cuts:


As our economy changes and old industries face new threats, Australia needs to keep—not cut—our investment in universities to create new jobs, new industries and new sources of income for Australia.


Ms Robinson's message is particularly relevant to the regions where local economies are in transition. Universities Australia also stated that, if the government's legislation and cuts are passed, STEM disciplines will take the biggest hit—35 per cent of the brunt of these cuts—and STEM students will pay higher fees.


Cutting funding, axing programs, putting up fees and reducing the payment threshold for HELP all combine to make it harder and put up more barriers for regional students to obtain a higher education. Young people in regional areas will have to wait for a Labor government to give them a better future.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2017-09-12,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:57):  It's hard to know where to begin with this matter.



Mr Wallace interjecting—




Mr TIM WILSON:
  You are right, it is also hard to follow the member for Fisher. It's hard to know where to start on this matter, because in the end what we have just heard is a sad, myopic understanding of what you actually need to deliver better education and—this is the critical point; listen to the words of those opposite—outcomes for Australian students. There was an obsession and a focus only on inputs, but there is no actual interest in making sure there are good outcomes for those people who go to Australia and invest in building their own career path, their knowledge and their expertise to be successful in life.


That's why I don't accept the terms of this proposition of the government cutting billions of dollars from universities, which the opposition is condemning. It's a completely ridiculous proposition. Firstly, it's not actually based on any evidence and it's not even true. In fact, what we know is that, during the final three years of the previous Labor government, it cut about $6 billion from higher education and research, including its cumulative 3.25 per cent efficiency dividend, which applied to research grants and the Higher Education Participation and Partnership Program. The government's proposed efficiency dividend does not apply to these programs, yet Labor now opposes a measure similar to what it announced in government, which goes to the heart of hypocrisy—let's face it.


More than anything else, it doesn't actually focus on outcomes: making sure that students who go to university get an education and get an improvement.


I'm not sure what the experience is of many members in this place in universities; but, having actually sat on the board of a university, what I know is that just handing out more and more dollops of cash to universities actually doesn’t improve outcomes for students. What actually—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr TIM WILSON:
  That's good; there are other members who apparently have been on boards. They might know the experience as well. But since I have been on the board of Monash University, in the great state of Victoria, I have seen firsthand how the myopia, dependence and chasing government money distracts universities from the core task of actually delivering outcomes for students. In fact, when universities are focused on delivering education services that people demand, and actually put them in the best position to go into the workforce to be able to live a successful life, students quite like it! They actually do understand. They understand, support and appreciate that you need to have equity measures and that, regardless of who you are—your background or your circumstances—if you have merit, talent and ingenuity and if you can make a significant contribution to this country that you can secure the opportunity for tertiary education.


Equity measures are appropriate to make sure that people do not face unnecessary burdens or limitations. That is why what Labor introduced—it was called HECS, and today is called FEE-HELP—still stands today. It doesn't matter who you are; if you are an Australian, you can go to a university and get FEE-HELP and support, and you can be in the best position to graduate. But there is a basic acknowledgement that if you are going to go through the process of getting that tertiary education—which is quite an expensive process for everybody, including Australian taxpayers who contribute a very substantial component of the costs of education—the benefits are both public and private. So the repayment has to involve both public contributions and private contributions.


But what we really need is a tertiary education sector that is export-oriented and focused; one that recognises the potential of the sector to grow and not just to provide services to Australian students—although that is an important part of it—but to be able to provide the services demanded around the world. That doesn't come from becoming lazy and sucking more and more money off the taxpayers' teat. It's about being—let's use those words—'innovative and agile', and being able to develop the sector that people want to invest in. This is at the heart of the criticism of Labor. They would prefer a system dependent on the government, not delivering improvement for student outcomes but delivering for the membership of the National Tertiary Education Union, who are the membership base of many of the people sitting opposite. In the end, they are not interested and have not focused in this debate on how we deliver better student outcomes. (Time expired)

Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (16:03):  It's interesting to reflect on the contribution from the member for Goldstein and how you can have two gents in this place with the same last name that bring very different perspectives to an issue like this. I guess if your perspective on universities is from having sat on a university board and if your approach to universities is in terms of the personal agency and resources that enable them to secure a university education and invest in a university education, then you might well take that approach.


But that is not the perspective of a young Indigenous woman who attends an at-risk high school that has an on-site childcare centre so that young pregnant mums can first finish high school and perhaps aspire to university. That is not the perspective of a young fellow I spoke to at an open office at the weekend, who can't see a way forward in his life. He doesn't understand how he is going to get an education that will enable him to participate in the workforce. He can't see how he will ever have the opportunity to buy his own home. So Labor understands that education has always been the great enabling force in Australian society; the great leveller and the key mechanism for delivering opportunity. And that's why we lifted investment substantially in universities when we were in government.


The member for Gellibrand talked about 190,000 additional students. That included 36,000 additional students from low-income families. It included an increase in Indigenous student numbers of 26 per cent and an increase in regional student numbers of 36 per cent. That's the commitment that we made, just like we make commitments across the full range of the education system, from early childhood and schools through TAFE and apprenticeships and university. From this government, those people who can't secure themselves a spot at university and who can't invest in a university place get $4 billion in cuts to funding. They get an additional $4 billion in cuts to uni infrastructure. They get fee increases of 7½ per cent. They get a lower HELP repayment threshold.


When I started university in 1990, it was the first year that HECS was introduced. The threshold was $22,000, which at that stage was 73 per cent of average earnings. The new threshold, down from $55,000 to $42,000, is less than half of average earnings. It's barely $6,000 above the minimum wage. Two-thirds of new university graduates will be women. Women face the worst of the rising inequality in this country. The gender pay gap is bad enough as it is. Even women with university degrees face a 10 per cent pay gap at the point of graduation, and these changes are going to make those kinds of inequities even worse than they currently are.


In Western Australia, we will see cuts of $75 million to Curtin University, $42 million to Edith Cowan, $26 million to Murdoch University, $50 million to the University of Western Australia and $19 million to Notre Dame, which has a campus in my electorate. The cuts to enabling courses are among the most terrible, short-sighted and mean aspects to these changes. Enabling courses help people who otherwise are very unlikely to go to university to have that chance. I know that's important in West Australian electorates like mine, and others. Murdoch's OnTrack program is delivered in the seat of Brand. Of the participants in OnTrack, 55 per cent are the first in their family to attend university and 56 per cent are from low-SES households, and the success of that program is such that 70 per cent of the people who participate in OnTrack go on to undergraduate enrolment. That's how successful it is. Those people now, instead of getting that assistance, face a $3,200 up-front fee.


This government is making a clear transition from ineptitude to outright harmfulness. Proper support of our education system from top to bottom is critical to our future wellbeing. This government, having walked away from needs based school funding, now seeks to squeeze universities and step down hard on university students. It's a recipe for economic harm. It's a recipe for sharply reduced opportunity and fast-rising inequality. It is a shame.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (16:08):  I'm very happy to discuss this matter today. It is often said that Bennelong is Australia's capital of innovation. This has not happened by accident. It has come about through my electorate's commitment to, and investment in, the local university, which sits at the heart of our innovation district. I refer, of course, to Macquarie University. This university was first founded back in the sixties by a local council with vision to turn the pastures and orchards of Marsfield into a science based industrial area—an innovation zone, before the invention of the buzzword. It was an audacious move and no-one could see it turning into the fastest-growing corner of New South Wales just 50 years later. And here lies the point: knowledge is critical to driving our economic growth, but, in order to be these drivers, our universities must be looking to the far horizon, beyond the petty politics of parliamentary debates and the microscopic duration of election cycles.


Education is vital to Australia's future successes. This government's reform is focused on encouraging quality and excellence in Australian higher education and ensuring students have the support they need to succeed. But it must also make sure that the system is sustainable for future generations so that students yet to come have the sorts of opportunities this and other generations have had. That's why we're going to keep growing our record levels of funding for higher education. However, it will be better targeted and provide equitable access for underrepresented groups, meet the needs of industry and the community and hold higher education institutions accountable for the taxpayer funding they receive.


The reforms start from a clean slate. There will be no fee deregulation and no 20 per cent funding cut for universities. The department has been through a comprehensive process, including a discussion paper that attracted more than 1,000 submissions and worked with an expert advisory panel. Our higher education system is modern and successful. Across the country, we have 1.4 million students, 43 universities and 123 non-university providers. Education is our third-largest export earner and universities are an essential part of this market. And, importantly, graduates enjoy a sustained two to three percentage point advantage in employment rates. The system is in great health. Domestic undergraduate enrolments have grown 118 per cent between 1989 and 2015. However, as a result, taxpayer funding for Commonwealth-supported places in higher education has increased 71 per cent since 2009, effectively growing at twice the rate of the economy.


We must ensure our higher education system promotes excellence and innovation and is sustainable for generations to come. Our focus is on more innovative courses, greater relevance to industry, more transparency for students and more accountability for higher education institutions. We're rebalancing the costs between taxpayers and students to better share the burden and make the system sustainable into the future while ensuring government continues to be the majority funder of student loans. Students will not pay a cent up-front and no longer face deregulated fees. Instead, they will face a modest 7.5 per cent fee increase phased in over four years from 2018 to 2021.


I'd like to end by returning to my cutting-edge university. Our great university sits at the heart of Macquarie Park. The Hearing Hub and the headquarters of Cochlear are both situated on the grounds of the university, and these internationally recognised world leaders interact daily with the students at the university and the businesses at Macquarie Park. The teaching hospital is also unique in its structure and a great asset to our local community, as well as home to some truly revolutionary technologies and skills, not least the life-saving Gamma Knife.


The uni is a linchpin of a group called the Macquarie Park Innovation District. This is a group of companies dedicated to the innovation sector and aiming to increase the output of our cutting-edge suburb. They work together, they collaborate—companies, council and universities—to forward ideas, connect people and design our future. This is how universities should be: not isolated, stuffy or siloed but rather a dynamic part of an innovation and entrepreneurial community.

Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. This bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to introduce a safe harbour for company directors undertaking corporate restructures outside of formal insolvency proceedings and to restrict ipso facto clauses that make it harder for businesses to successfully recover from financial difficulties. It is a bill that promotes a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation to drive business growth and global success and help save local jobs. As a result of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill, the government made some minor and technical attempts to part 2 of the bill to ensure that it operates as originally intended. In addition to these amendments, one other amendment was passed in the other place that enshrined a review of the safe harbour provisions in legislation two years from commencement. The government is confident that this review will confirm the government's position that this legislation will improve our insolvency regime.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (16:14):  Part 1 of schedule 1 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Bill 2017 contains a safe harbour for directors for liability for insolvent trading. That safe harbour is intended to support directors to restructure the business and to continue operating to the overall benefit of the company and the stakeholders. Labor acknowledges the intent of the legislation to ensure that directors who honestly and diligently seek to turn around a business are not prevented from doing so.


Labor moved amendments to the bill to strengthen the safe harbour and to protect against its misuse, including increasing the proof that directors must show. Those amendments were not accepted by the Senate. Labor also moved amendments to require a review of the safe harbour after two years to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. That amendment requires that the review look at the impact of the availability of the safe harbour to directors of companies and at the conduct of directors in the interests of creditors and employees of those companies, as well as any other matters that the minister considers relevant. It must be undertaken by three persons who, in the minister's opinion, possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review, and it requires a written report which must be tabled in each house of the parliament within 15 days after the day on which the report is given to the minister.


This is an important amendment and I commend Senator Gallagher in the other place for her work to ensure that this amendment passed the Senate. Labor will be watching to ensure that the safe harbour does not have a negative effect on workers being paid their entitlements. We will move to make changes if the safeguards in the bill are not effective.


Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill sets out new provisions to stop the enforcement of ipso facto clauses that are triggered when a company enters administration. Labor has supported government amendments to fill gaps that were identified as part of the Senate inquiry and Labor is supportive of part 2 of the amended bill.

Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr GOODENOUGH:
  by leave—The committee examines the compatibility of recent bills and legislative instruments with Australia's obligations under international human rights law. In performing its scrutiny function, the committee may play an important role in enhancing the understanding of and respect for human rights in Australia, as well as ensuring appropriate consideration of human rights issues in legislative and policy development. In my view, the committee is well placed to take on a crucial leadership role in the consideration and oversight of human rights matters. To this end, the committee recently had a very productive meeting with the new president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Professor Rosalind Croucher, and a number of areas of interest were discussed.


Turning to the committee's current report, the majority of new bills considered, 11, were assessed as either promoting human rights, permissibly limiting human rights or not engaging human rights. There are also two matters in respect of which the committee is seeking further information from the relevant minister in relation to human rights compatibility. The report also contains the committee's concluded examination of a number of pieces of legislation, including the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017, the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Payment Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017.


In relation to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Payment Integrity Bill) 2017, the committee initially raised concerns about the compatibility of measures in this bill with the right to social security, the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to equality and nondiscrimination. However, following correspondence with the minister and the provision of further information, the committee has concluded that these measures are likely to be compatible with human rights. This was the basis of the existence of safeguards which appear designed to assist to ensure that the most vulnerable will continue to have access to social security payments to meet basic necessities in a range of circumstances. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the report to enhance their understanding of the committee's work and, with these comments, I commend the committee's report 10 of 2017 to the chamber.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:21):  I rise to my feet to speak on this bill with great joy and gusto. I'm so pleased that the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills is here to be part of this debate. I want to welcome the students from Narromine Christian School in the gallery up there. I'm not quite sure about the school behind me, but the young students up there are our future and education is all about them.


They could be—if they've been sitting in here listening to the matter of public importance—forgiven for thinking all sorts of things about where we stand as legislators on this issue. But before I embark on a detailed examination of the bill before us, I think it's important that we also look at a little bit of history. The Turnbull government has taken responsible measures to try to end the rorts of the VET FEE-HELP scheme that saw such a debacle from those opposite when they were in government. Let me just give you a few statistics, Mr Deputy Speaker: between 2009 and 2016 the number of students accessing the VET FEE-HELP jumped 3,600 per cent, from 5,229 to 193,868. Now, you might think, 'Well, is that such a bad thing?' If you look at it overall, average course costs in that time nearly tripled from $4,000 to $11,300. Loans increased by nearly 6,000 per cent, from $25 million to $1.5 billion.


I say to the young students up there from Narromine Christian School that whilst those opposite have an absolute predisposition to ensuring that all young people should go to university I'm going to take a different tack with you right here and right now, because I'm one who'll stand here and actually say that I don't think all students should go to university. I come from a trade background. I did my carpentry and joinery apprenticeship at Holmesglen College of TAFE and I'm proud of it. I worked as a builder for 10 years, and I'm proud of it. I then went back and did a law degree at uni, and some might say it has all been going downhill from there!




Mr Dreyfus:
  Why aren't you proud of that?




Mr WALLACE:
  Well, some might say it's all going downhill from there. But, I want to encourage the young people from Narromine Christian School and from all schools across the country. You don't have to go to university if you don't want to. If you want to go to university, great, knock your socks off, but you don't have to go to university. The Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills is doing a fantastic job in trying to promote young people into trades. Whether you want to be a bricklayer or a carpenter or a plasterer or a butcher or a baker, there are plenty of other jobs, meaningful employment, available in Australia. To be quite honest with you, you might earn more money as a carpenter or a plasterer or a brickie than you would if you did a business degree. So, whatever you do, challenge your teachers, your vocational instructors and your guidance counsellors.

Back to the bill: this bill is all about making university education in Australia the great system that it is and improving upon the great system that it is. It's more important than ever to protect the future of a system which currently supports 1.4 million students and has 16 Australian universities in the top 300 of world university rankings in 2017 and 2018.


As the member for Fisher, I have one of the newest universities in Australia in my electorate, and that is the University of the Sunshine Coast. It is a fantastic university that's only been going for a little less than 20 years, but in that 20 years it has seen its graduates list almost 20,000 in number. It is a university that I am very proud of because it engages with its local community.


This government is focused on encouraging quality and excellence in Australian higher education and ensuring that students have the support they need to succeed, while also making sure that the system is sustainable for future generations so students yet to come have the sorts of opportunities that this and other generations have had. The Higher Education Reform Package has been developed after substantial consultation and discussion with a broad range of stakeholders and focuses on three key themes: improving the sustainability of higher education, providing more choices for students and increasing transparency and accountability. This government will continue to support the best features of the current higher education system, underpinning a vibrant education export industry, supporting student career aspirations and ensuring that industry has a skilled workforce.


The reforms proposed by the government are fair. They drive quality and excellence and focus on ensuring that Australians who want to study have the right support and the right opportunities. A key challenge is how to make the system sustainable for future generations of students. Since 2009, taxpayer funding for teaching and learning has increased by 71 per cent, twice the growth rate of the economy as a whole. The current funding arrangements are not sustainable, and reform is needed if future generations like those up in the Narromine Christian School are to take advantage of higher education—a world-class higher education—into the future.


A key element of the higher education system is the Higher Education Loan Program, which supports universal, merit based access to higher education in Australia and is one of the most generous student loan schemes in the world. Those opposite would have you believe that the government is attacking that. We are not attacking that at all. We want to ensure that, no matter whether you come from a wealthy family or a non-wealthy family, if you have the ability, the skill, the interest, the talent and the desire to go to university, you have every opportunity, as much as anyone else.


However, the HELP repayments—that is, the Higher Education Loan Program repayments—have not kept pace with the HELP lending growth rate. Due to the income-contingent nature of HELP, debtors do not start making compulsory repayments until their income is above the minimum repayment threshold, currently in 2017-18, set at $55,874. Since 2009, the fair value of student loans has increased from $12.5 billion to $36.8 billion and is expected to increase further to $59.7 billion by 2019-20. The total outstanding student debt underwritten by taxpayers now stands at $50 billion, with a quarter of that not expected to be repaid. 


The Commonwealth supported places which provide places for university students are subsidised by the Australian government so that students are only required to pay a student contribution amount for each unit that they're enrolled in. Universities and other higher education providers set their own student contribution amounts within limits set by the Australian government. It's necessary with increasing enrolments and budget pressures to increase the maximum contribution each student can be asked to make. These reforms will rebalance the contributions made by taxpayers and students to the cost of higher education. After the changes have been implemented, the taxpayer will remain the majority funder of higher education by 2021, providing on average 54 per cent of base funding for the costs of teaching and learning.


The Deloitte cost-of-delivery report undertaken in 2016 showed that universities spent 85 per cent of their total funds for bachelor level courses on teaching and learning in 2015, compared to the 2011 base funding review which found that 94 per cent of base funding for bachelor level courses was spent on teaching and learning. These findings suggest it is reasonable to expect some of these efficiencies should be shared with the government. Effectively, costs per student for teaching and learning have increased by 9.5 per cent since 2010, while revenue per student has risen by 15 per cent over that time. This efficiency dividend equates on average to 2.8 per cent of base funding for teaching and research. When last in government, Labor proposed its own efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent, but you don't hear anything at all about that from the other side. Then Prime Minister Julia Gillard said on 16 April 2013: 


… the number of places has grown, but funding has also gone up per student place.


Money to universities is still going to grow. We've got universities on a growth path.


What we are asking them to do is for one year to accept a two per cent efficiency dividend, and in the second year a 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend.


That means their money would still grow, it just wouldn't grow as fast as they'd obviously wanted …


Once again, you don't hear any of that from the other side. In opposition, Labor is playing politics. I'm sure that won't come as a surprise to anybody who's been around this place long enough. And they are using delaying tactics when they well know what we are proposing is fair, reasonable and necessary. 


HELP is here to stay. The Australian government remains committed to a system of higher education that is affordable for individuals but it must be affordable for the country. Australia has one of the most generous student loan schemes in the world. The Higher Education Loans Program is one that will see young people go to university and pay no up-front fees. We will keep that loan system in place. There will be no up-front student fees. The system of student loans will be protected. Students will only have to pay their loans back when they are earning a high enough income. No eligible domestic student has to pay up-front fees, because they are able to borrow from the government to meet their share of the cost of study. No real rate of interest is charged on their loan. The government effectively absorbs this cost. 


Australia's HELP scheme, which provides assistance for young people and old people to get into university to improve their education, is the envy of the world. It means that anyone who has the ability and motivation to participate in higher education is not prevented from doing so because of the need to pay their tuition fees up-front. We will improve the sustainability of the HELP scheme by introducing new HELP repayment thresholds and rates for all current and future HELP debtors from 1 July 2018. The proposal to index HELP repayment thresholds at CPI will maintain the value of thresholds in real terms, as the thresholds will increase in line with the cost of living, rather than wages. With average weekly earnings typically being higher than CPI, indexation by CPI will slow the growth of repayment thresholds and ensure they remain appropriate when compared to an individual's capacity to repay.


I'll finish off by saying that this government is absolutely 100 per cent committed to providing an effective, world-class higher education university scheme for all Australians, no matter what their socioeconomic background is. (Time expired)

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:36):  I rise in support of Labor's position on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. I represent a community of hardworking people. Traditionally, we have been the tradies, the labourers, the administrators and the retail staffers. We now live in a time when those jobs are changing, and as those jobs change so too does the way in which we educate—especially for people in any community.


It's one year ago today since I got to stand here and address the federal parliament with my first speech. One of the things that led me here was a comment made by a Liberal predecessor of mine as member for Lindsay, former MP Jackie Kelly, who famously declared Western Sydney did not need a university, because we were in pram city. So outraged at her comments was I, as a 20-year-old, that I wrote a letter to my local newspaper about my disgust for such comments. I'm pretty sure this was my first interaction on my political activism journey. The future of work is changing: the jobs are changing and our workforce needs to change. I'm so glad that Kelly's comments were not heeded and that, instead, we have Western Sydney University right in my backyard. It is a university whose alumni I belong to, in fact, along with my mum, who was the first in her family to study and studied as a mature single mum of two kids. This provided me with a great desire to go on to university, and I followed there a few years later.


This isn't a unique story across my community. Sixty per cent of the students who attend Western Sydney University are the first in their families to attend university, and that is a staggeringly high figure. Twenty per cent of the students are considered low-socioeconomic status, and 37 per cent of those students speak a language other than English at home. These statistics indicate the transition my community faces from the traditional jobs we have had and the ones we will need to be prepared for in the future. The changes that the government seeks to make in this bill will diabolically affect my community and my university. In fact, the cuts this lousy bloke who calls himself the Prime Minister wants to make are the second-highest in this country. Western Sydney University will lose more than $98 million in funding over the next four years. This is the highest amount of money being taken out of any university in New South Wales.


For 25 years, Western Sydney University has been at the forefront of addressing the educational inequity facing our community. In Western Sydney, 16.5 per cent of under-34-year-olds have a tertiary qualification, while greater Sydney enjoys a level of almost 25 per cent for the same age bracket. These figures are important. They help businesses to decide where to locate, to know whether the population will be able to support their company with adequately qualified and trained staff. Why on earth would Turnbull support anything that jeopardises the access to university for anybody in Western Sydney? Does he think so little of the people that I represent in Western Sydney that he would callously allow these cuts to take place? Does he think so little of our community and that we're all just a bunch of high-vis-vest-wearing workers who are not capable of university-level study? You only need to look at his actions. He skulked into Western Sydney—I know, right? I'm surprised he even knew the way. He didn't come by public transport, though, to give his press conference—which is a shame, after his famous electioneering train-rides not so long ago, because, if he had, he might've learnt that, where he was headed to, there is actually no train. He went to Erskine Park, he got out there, and he said to the press that he promised plenty of jobs for locals and that we should all live where it takes 30 minutes to get from home to work, to education and to recreational facilities. I mean, really! Thirty minutes! Did he drive, from Erskine Park, 30 minutes in any direction? He might've tried, but I can guarantee he wouldn't have got very far. He made this announcement at TNT, a freight and logistics depot. We know that, on average, one of those warehouses has five jobs for every hectare of land, like this warehouse takes up. Again, it exemplifies my point that the Prime Minister thinks Western Sydney is a community of high-vis-vest-wearing jobs. I have no argument or issue with people working in those fields whatsoever.


But back to his catch-cry of the 30-minute city and being within 30 minutes of educational opportunities: how is that going for the Prime Minister? They just cut $23 million from Lindsay's schools, and now they want to come after our university for $98 million. Apprenticeships have dropped 37 per cent in my area. If you gut Western Sydney uni and it has to continue cutting programs and services, where is our next university within 30 minutes, I ask you, Deputy Speaker? I know it sounds old-fashioned, but someone needs to hand this bloke a map. Across Western Sydney we have campuses located in the south, the north and the west. And I say to the Prime Minister: enough is enough. End the war on Western Sydney. Stop treating my community like we don't matter and start valuing the contributions that come from the educated workforce that Western Sydney can and will happily provide.


Fundamental to making Western Sydney strong is supporting its university and addressing the gaps our area suffers from. The measures announced in this bill will do nothing to support this. The cuts this government proposes for Western Sydney uni will hurt the students out there already doing it tough. The cuts mean that funding for the critical outreach programs which support coming into university from various pathways will go. The cuts put a handbrake on the school engagement program encouraging young students to get into higher education. And the cuts mean that industry-led partner programs will be gone. Obviously, this Turnbull government believes that educational equity gaps should remain.


Disturbingly, these cuts affect jobs, job creation and the critical support required for start-ups and for ideas. Western Sydney University supports 150 Sydney start-ups and small-to-medium enterprises, through its Launch Pad incubator. Some I have been lucky enough to meet—like Stephen Brinks, from 3DBrink, a very successful start-up. Stephen was designing and building 3D printers in his Werrington garage. He had the opportunity to move into the Launch Pad and has grown his business. Now he has the opportunity to give back, and he collaborates with students. Why would the Prime Minister want to see this facility cut, after he famously visited there and referred to it as 'essential'? Now it will be cut to the bone and will be unable to support the start-ups and small businesses in Western Sydney.


On top of these cuts, this Turnbull government will put an end to Western Sydney uni's ability to partner with industry and government in proven job-creation programs. Just one example of this co-investment that the university undertook with the former Labor federal government was the $30 million investment in the Werrington business park. This investment saw 400 high-value jobs come into Penrith. It forges vital links between industry, researchers and students. Great opportunities were delivered to people in my community. But now all we see is Mr Turnbull's 'opportunities'. Well, I have news for him: we don't need your opportunities. We have had to look after ourselves because you cannot be trusted. People in Western Sydney have created their own opportunities, and they know that Labor will support them. Labor will support their jobs, support their pay and conditions, and support investment in the services they need, like universities. But those opposite only see a life of privilege and not one of opportunities being shared.


Opportunities come from investment, not trickle-down tax breaks afforded to big businesses. All these tax breaks—to ensure big businesses and millionaires can enjoy the cosy spoils. The government has decided to destroy any opportunities for students and institutions, especially in Western Sydney. And, for the people in my community, it is absolute proof that we have a federal government devoid of any heart. It isn't a cliche. The Turnbull government is hell-bent on handing out degrees in hard knocks.


Imagine for a moment—close your eyes—that we were here discussing investing $65 billion into our education system, not giving $65 billion in tax breaks to big business. Just let that sink in. Let's have a discussion about that. Imagine how that would trickle down through our nation. Imagine that investment trickling down through every single student across Western Sydney. I would love to have and I would absolutely welcome having that discussion, but we are not having it.


The Turnbull government has decided we should not be the clever country anymore and has decided to dumb us down in the most horrible of ways. This government is creating chaos in my community. We need apprenticeships; we need jobs that keep our graduates in the area where they live; and we need to invest in our education system, not take money from it. The government has gutted funding at all levels of education. You name it; it's on the chopping block. The Turnbull government has already ripped off public education and cut $17 billion from schools, $23 million of which came from my electorate alone. Now the Prime Minister wants to deliver more cuts and raid the pockets of students, with nearly $4 billion of cuts to universities, higher fees for students and bigger debts for students that they will have to repay much sooner.


What does all of this add up to? It adds up to a compromise on teaching, learning and research. But, more importantly, it adds up to dumbing down and the taking away of opportunities. The Turnbull government wants the students of Australia to fix its own broken budget promises. And how are students going to fix them? They're going to start paying back their student loans not at $54,000 but at $42,000. And, for good measure, the government is going to ensure your student fees are higher and universities are restricted in investing in infrastructure, as the Turnbull government steals surpluses that were for future building.


What great opportunities and lessons this government is providing to students! Members opposite are providing some genuine life lessons right up-front. Well, I'm voting to keep Australia clever, even though we have a ridiculously stupid government—and the experts out there know, and they agree with me too. Again we see a bunch of ill-informed MPs coming in here, trampling over decades and decades of research and ignoring it in favour of cuts instead. Take the Innovative Research Universities, which said:


The Australian Government investment in Universities is low by international standards while our students are already paying some of the highest fees in the world for public university education …


Universities Australia said:


Students and graduates will be carrying higher levels of debt into an increasingly uncertain future …


And the Group of Eight said:


We have … reached a tipping point. It remains the fact that we receive less than half of our university funding from Government and this has forced us to be heavily reliant on alternative sources of income to fund the nation building research we must undertake.


At a time when we need investment in the jobs of the future and to be competitive in a global jobs market, we find the Turnbull government throwing lead into the saddles of students, who quite frankly were finding it tough to survive already.


Meanwhile, across the road, across the seas, in Asia, right on our doorstep, they're investing in universities. That's right. I know it seems a bit of an anomaly compared to what this parliament wants to do. Their governments are investing in universities. This was highlighted last week by Universities Australia, which said:


Smart nations understand that public funding in universities is an investment—


an investment, Deputy Speaker—


in long-term national prosperity.


It continued:


It's clear that China is becoming a increasingly strong competitor – which the rankings analysts attribute to its 'high and sustained levels of state funding'. Indeed, China is building the equivalent of almost a new university every week.


And that should be a reflection to those opposite about what we're doing to universities in this country right now.


What a morally bankrupt government we have when it comes to education. I'm waiting to hear them all fall over themselves and come in here and support these cuts. The government are pretty lousy because all they could muster up was less than half-a-dozen government members willing to come in here and spruik their cuts to higher education. I don't blame them, because it is a drastically, diabolically terrible decision.


Western Sydney University is a success story. Why is the Turnbull government stripping it back to its bare bones, leaving Western Sydney with the crumbs yet again? The Prime Minister keeps coming up with three-word slogans like 'an ideas boom'. Well, Prime Minister, it is hard to have an ideas boom when you keep having brain explosions like this one. Can you imagine Mr Turnbull sitting on his balcony at Point Piper penning his little quips, the glare of the sun in his eyes and the rays beaming up from the harbour and all of those yachts? Perhaps Mr Turnbull might like to sit in Western Sydney's peak-hour traffic on the M4 and see if he can get from Erskine Park to Penrith in 30 minutes. I can guarantee he can't.


Western Sydney University is important because educational inequity is a real issue happening right now. A $65 billion tax break to big business with no evidence of payback to the community isn't innovation. Tax handouts to wealthy businesses on the backs of every single student cohort across this country are nothing more than trickle-down idiocy. No jobs, no investment; just dividends to the big end of town. And, if you are in Western Sydney and want to get ahead, this government is happy to stand on you, put you down, confine you to a hi-vis vest and tell you that you do not deserve the same access and same equity of access to anything. We have no equity of access to education, transport or jobs. I am happy to come in here day after day and remind this government of how poorly they are treating Western Sydney. When the next election campaign comes along and Mr Abbott or Mr Turnbull—or whoever is the Prime Minister potentially—come into my electorate, sit in my football stadium, say no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions and no cuts to the ABC and tell this country they have a unity ticket on education, it is the people that I represent who will be the most dudded by this awful, awful government.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (16:50):  There was a time when every galah in the coalition pet shop was talking about the importance of being innovative and nimble. They were talking about the importance of Australia being a clever country and about us projecting ourselves into the economy of the 21st century. Those very same coalition MPs are shortly going to file into this chamber and vote in favour of this bill which does the exact opposite of everything they have been talking about for the last two years. I am, of course, talking about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017, which slashes funding for universities throughout this country to the tune of $3.8 billion. The minister at the table opposite has attempted to tell members of parliament that this is some radical reversal of the Abbott government's fateful 2014 budget, where they attempted to do a complete backflip on the promises they took to the 2013 election. Far from it being a radical reversal of the Abbott policies, this is the Abbott policies in a new guise. 


Let's have a look at the cuts that this bill introduces on a state-by-state basis. Here in Canberra, it is $52.5 million. In my home state of New South Wales, it is $617 million. In the Northern Territory, a place that needs us to be supporting their TAFE and their higher education, they are suffering a cut of $15 million. In Queensland, it is over $400 million. In South Australia, it is $150 million. The list goes on and on and on. There are cuts to funding and to universities in each and every state. In my own university, the University of Wollongong—a fine institution which I will talk a bit more about shortly—there are $45.7 million in cuts as a result of this legislation. I'm imploring those members opposite: don't do what your leader is attempting to convince you to do. Vote in favour of the university students you represent in your electorates, and vote in favour of regional universities because they need your support today more than ever. 


It's time we had a conversation with the Prime Minister about inequality. Every time we raise this he calls us communists. He thinks there's some sort of socialist plot going on. But we need to have a conversation about it. Where we stand today, the richest 10 per cent of Australians own 45 per cent of all wealth. That is 70 times the wealth of the lowest-income brackets. If you compare the amount of money they make year on year, it is a massive seven times the income they earn each year. We have to have a conversation about inequality. If you're in that top 20 per cent of income earners, the chances are that you live in one of our capital cities. If you're in the bottom 20 per cent, the chances are that you're living in regional or remote Australia. Against this background, why is the government and, certainly, any National Party or regional Liberal member, coming in here and proposing to support this bill?


Did you know that in regional Australia we have 13 per cent fewer school leavers participating in higher education than the Australian average? We all know on this side of the House that higher education is the pathway to a higher income and a successful life. But, if we have 13 per cent fewer people in regional Australia participating in higher education, we are reducing the chances of people in regional Australia closing the inequality gap that is growing between people who live in the regions and people who live in the inner cities of this country.


There may be a reason why the Prime Minister doesn't get it. There may be a reason why the Prime Minister cries 'Communist!' every time we start talking about inequality. The reason he doesn't get it is probably that he lives in one of the wealthiest electorates in the country and he is surrounded at his cabinet table by people who live in some of the wealthiest electorates in the country. I'm talking about the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and I'm talking about the Treasurer. 


Just under one in five school leavers in regional Australia participate in higher education, compared to one in two school leavers in the Prime Minister's local area of Waverley. The reason that he doesn't get the fact that we have a massive problem with inequality in this country, the reason that he doesn't understand that this bill is going to exacerbate the problem, not make it better, is that the world that he lives in is a very different world to that which the majority of Australians are living in. He lives in a world surrounded by privilege, while the rest of Australia is living in a world which doesn't enjoy the same sorts of privileges that the Prime Minister enjoys or that his deputy leader and the Treasurer enjoy. Is there any wonder that he cries 'Socialism!' whenever we start to say: 'Excuse me, sir; there are some problems with what you're doing. Excuse me, but not everyone enjoys the same privileges that you do. Excuse me; if you introduce this legislation, real people are going to suffer.' 


In fact, if you live in regional Australia, participation rates in secondary school at age 16 are seven to 10 per cent lower than they are in the Prime Minister's electorate. In regional Western Australia and regional Tasmania, they're also considerably lower, around 20 per cent lower. There are other parts of the country, where people live very different lives to those who are recommending this bill before the House today. We should send a very clear message to this government that we understand the circumstances of people who are living in the outer suburbs of capital cities and the circumstances of people who are living in regional Australia. It's a very different world to the one that the decision-makers in this government are living in. 


We understand their circumstances. That's why we're not going to vote for these massive cuts to university funding. We are not going to vote for an increase in the rate of repayment for the fees that are being proposed in this bill today. We're not going to support their plans to abolish the Education Investment Fund. If you compare the approach of Labor governments over decades to higher education to that of the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, you see the world through the prism of privilege. They vote accordingly. Others see the world through the prism that higher education is an opportunity to improve your lot in life. We put in place the Education Investment Fund, which improved the facilities of universities right around the country, particularly in regional campuses around the country, where millions and millions of dollars was invested, including in my own campus at Wollongong. Millions and millions of dollars was invested. What is this government attempting to do? Abolish that fund so that those funds aren't available to invest in university facilities around the country. 


Not only do we understand the importance of universities as institutions which are educating the workforce and the citizens of a future society; we understand that in regional areas universities are major economic players in their own right. The University of Wollongong in my region contributes around $1.2 billion in total direct and indirect economic contribution to the GDP over the course of a year. More than 5,200 people are directly employed by the University of Wollongong, making it one of the largest employers in the region. For every 1,000 full-time equivalent roles that the University of Wollongong employs, there are probably another 1,000 full-time jobs that are created in the broader Illawarra economy. We can take from that that the 5,000-odd people the University of Wollongong employs are generating a total employment of around 10,000 for the entire Illawarra district. The University of Wollongong is an incredibly important contributor to our workforce, having over 131,000 graduates in its short time in operation across more than 300 different degree strands. It has a significant research arm and is an acknowledged world leader in the areas of engineering and information and communications technology. For every $1 million of value added as a result of the University of Wollongong expenditure, a further $1 million is probably generated in income elsewhere within the economy. This paints the picture of a very important regional economic institution.


A responsible government that understood the circumstances in regional areas—a responsible government that was in tune with regions like my own—would not be cutting $45 million from the funds of this vital economic institution in the Illawarra. We know the result will be staff cuts. We know the result will be increased class sizes. We know the result will be a university struggling to provide the same quality of education it did in the decades before.


If members opposite are going to do something to improve the lot of people living and working in regional Australia, if the coalition parties—the Liberals and the National Party in particular—are going to do something to represent others than those in the privileged classes living in the privileged suburbs of our capital cities, they have to reject this bill. They have to reject this bill because the results of this bill are going to be a disaster for people who are struggling to get themselves a higher education, for people who are struggling to pay off a university debt and for people who are struggling to get a toehold in a university in this country. It is bad legislation. It should be rejected.


I particularly implore members of the Nationals, who are supposed to represent people in regional Australia: do the right thing by your community. Tear yourselves away from your Liberal Party colleagues and reject this bill. You have to do more than beat yourselves on the chest and say, 'We are a tough, independent party.' You have to do more than be lions in your electorate and lambs down here in the parliament when you come and vote on legislation. You have to put those fierce words into action. You have to stand up for your communities. That's why, in a few minutes time, you should march into this chamber and you should sit with Labor members of parliament and stand up for your communities. We're going to do it, and we throw down the gauntlet to you: do the same thing.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (17:03):  I rise today to discuss the impact of the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. It's a bill I absolutely will not support. I reject it outright. It is complex legislation, and that is fitting because we in this place all know that higher education is a complex issue to deal with, with a long list of stakeholders and participants, and there is always great community interest in our universities. Primary, secondary and higher education are as important as each other, and negotiating and creating reform that is complementary across sectors can create long-lasting benefits for the whole community. Education reform is challenging. Higher education reform is challenging.


The reforms in this bill purport to tackle the considerable challenge of funding universities while at the same time managing to fundamentally ignore how universities actually work. This bill displays a kind of wilful blindness to the reality of how universities make the most of their funding and the pressure facing this very important sector and export industry.


If this bill is to help the higher education sector, it should be designed to support the students in the institutions it professes to reform, but it does not do that. This is a bill that should be making universities more accessible to students across the nation, but it isn't. This is a bill which should pay attention to the vast range of activities that a university conducts, but it does not. This is a bill that should bring together relevant stakeholders to the table and develop meaningful, long-term policy for the sector. Again, it doesn't and it fails. Certainly, this bill should ensure the future prosperity of a world-class higher educational institution, and it certainly does not do that. Recent comments published in The West Australian and, of course, around the world say it advocates the exact opposite. The West Australian says:


Australia's performance on international university league tables could fall if the Federal Government pushes ahead with planned reforms, the editor of the Times Higher Education global rankings has warned.


In these rankings, six Australian universities were ranked among the top 100 in the world. Unfortunately, none of Western Australia's universities made the top 100, but UWA moved up 14 places, climbing to 111. The West Australian says:


Times Higher Education global rankings editor Phil Baty said Australia's future rankings could suffer if the Government went ahead with plans to cut funding by 2.5 per cent.


""It is good news that Australia's universities have held steady in this year's table but funding cuts proposed by the government could harm the country's institutions in future editions of the rankings,"" he said.


""The data also shows that Australia's leading institutions are already falling behind peers in mainland China and Hong Kong, which receive high and sustained levels of state funding.""


Mr Baty said figures from the first quarter of this year showed a 15 per cent increase in international student numbers in Australia.


He said Australia could benefit from a potential decline in the number of international students applying to universities in Britain and the US because of Brexit and tightened immigration policies.


So we have the capacity already and we have the model and the opportunity.


The Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, has said Australian universities are punching above their weight on the international stage but they should not rest on their laurels in a competitive world. The education minister asked universities not to rest on their laurels, while this government has been doing exactly that in this policy area and others for four years. Mind you, as laurels are symbols of victory and status, one can't really accuse the Liberal government of much of that. It is laziness in application of policy thought. They've failed to consider the complexities of our third-largest export industry. How does cutting the legs out from our universities help maintain our national rankings? How does it help universities improve on their already excellent performance?


I want to talk about the university experience of students across Australia. For those of us who were lucky enough to go to university—and not many people in my electorate have been to university—it's not about just going to your lectures and going home. It's not a factory; students don't just go in one end and get churned out the other end with a piece of paper. We hope they go into positive learning environments, get to engage with peers, pick up life skills, network and build a strong, positive and well-thought-out foundation for life post graduation. We hope that it sets them up. But this bill does not do any of that. Instead of reforming the sector for the good of the students and the vast university communities, this bill has become a cash grab by the Liberal federal government to repair the budget bottom line at the expense of education and the future of our community.


I've worked in the university sector for over 10 years. Before coming to this place, I operated an international relations think tank, the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia. Before that I was a lawyer for the University of Western Australia and I was chief of staff to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. I have had the remarkable experience of working with students, the UWA student guild, educators, lecturers, heads of state, scientists, cleaners, researchers, heads of government, administrators, artists, Nobel laureates, gardeners, curators and carpenters—so many different people doing so many different things to make a remarkable institution what it is: a place of learning, a place of research, a place of effort and application and a place of beauty where all can seek wisdom should they choose to, and most do. In being director of UWA's centenary celebrations a few years ago, I had the chance to spend time helping a vast community celebrate the contribution of the first free university in the British Empire, a university which promoted equal access to tertiary education for all. It enabled the education of Western Australians and the research which enabled the development of that state's agricultural industry—its second-largest export industry—and the state's mining industry, which is WA's largest export industry.


Of course, now, with five universities, education itself is Western Australia's third-largest export industry. A hundred and five years after UWA first commenced in 1911, there are a further four great WA universities—Murdoch University, Curtin University, Edith Cowan University, and the University of Notre Dame Australia—each playing important roles in educating Western Australians of all ages and international students from many nations. These universities conduct research across a broad spectrum of subjects, and, like unis across the country, they contribute to local communities in hosting community events and providing sporting grounds and facilities. They are significant employers and create centres of activity that support hundreds of small businesses across WA.


Universities are complex, and I haven't even touched on what it takes to put together a university budget, but, mostly from my own experience, I know it's extraordinarily hard work. Simplifying the complexity of universities and all that they do in the community and assuming student contributions only get applied to teaching shows an absurd lack of attention to universities, to what they are and to how they work. For the education minister to say that unis are somehow pocketing the extra cash from student contributions that exceed the costs of teaching shows just how mammothly out of touch this government is with this sector. In July, the education minister described the increase in funding to the sector because of the demand-driven system as a 'river of gold'. How out of touch can you get. I can imagine more than a few university administrators shaking their heads at that comment and thinking, 'If only we could keep hold of that extra revenue and not have to apply it to research programs, or IT infrastructure, or maintaining heritage-listed 85-year-old limestone buildings or a collection of art carefully collected or gifted and curated and which the university holds on trust for the benefit of the public and the benefit of future generations.'


Our universities are not cash cows for this or any other aggressive Liberal government to raid for their budget repair, and neither is the foreign aid program, for that matter. But nothing will stand in the way of this government giving $65 billion worth of tax cuts to the most wealthy—not even those institutions which quite literally build the future of this nation's prosperity.


This government has resolutely ignored the reality of universities. It has not managed to grasp the reality of the implicit cross-subsidy where any funds left over from a teaching program go toward funding critical research. It is a failure to listen to universities. It is a failure to understand how they operate. And it is only one more of this government's many failures in this regard.


If I could, I'd like to speak briefly about Murdoch University in Western Australia. I hope the member for Tangney comes and speaks a bit later on this. I know it's in his electorate and it plays an important role in his community as well as in mine. It is the closest university to Brand and has offered a unique and valuable approach to tertiary education for many of my constituents. It's also close to my family's heart, having been named after my husband's great-grandfather, Sir Walter Murdoch, the founding professor of English at UWA and a local author and philosopher. Established in 1973, Murdoch University offers enabling programs for students who did not achieve the ATAR ranking they had hoped, or, in some cases, those who did not achieve an ATAR ranking at all—programs such as OnTrack. That is—or was—a fee-free program which is approved as a full-time study option by Centrelink.


This bill seeks to replace the enabling loading with a student contribution that will have a disproportionately negative impact on students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in the suburbs south of Brand, in the Peel region, across the seat of Canning as well as in my electorate of Brand. In 2016, there were 296 students from the region taking advantage of this program. This year, there are 453. The replacement of the enabling loading will undoubtedly put an immediate halt to this, flying in the face of the very great positive progress Murdoch University has made in opening up the university experience to people who are already at a disadvantage in comparison to many others around Australia. It is estimated that charging fees for enabling programs will affect more than 350 students across Rockingham and Peel. To rip up the opportunities and dreams of these students is, in my opinion, a national disgrace and should be reconsidered by the government.


Among OnTrack students enrolled at Murdoch University between 2008 and 2014, 55 per cent self-identified as being the first in their family to go to a university, and 56 per cent lived in low-SES denominated areas. Furthermore, and very importantly, 69 per cent of all funded enrolments translated into undergraduate degree enrolments at Murdoch University. That's a good thing for the region, it's a good thing for Western Australia and it certainly is a good thing for the people and potential students of Brand in Western Australia.


I will speak for a couple of minutes to a few of the other measures that are in this bill. We know what an efficiency dividend is, of course; it's a cut. The 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend will take out of an already-stressed sector. There will be an increase in student fees. Now, let's be clear, this increase in fees will not go to any kind of pool that's going to improve the student experience or go to funding facilities to support services to help improved infrastructure. No, it's going to go straight to the consolidated revenue and transform into that $65 billion tax cut for big business. This government is increasing the fees for students and is not applying that increase to the sector itself. Students will pay more and they will get less. Not only will the extra fees go elsewhere, but the 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend—cut—and the 7.5 per cent performance management daylight robbery scheme will all add up to taking more money out of universities to fund tax cuts. It's a disgrace, and it's a failure.


I'm going to reflect a bit on that performance based funding pool that we have no detail about. Earlier, the member for McPherson, I think, said that there was going to be some metrics put around it and that they would be related to student achievement. So here we have another 7.5 per cent to be taken off universities, coming out of their Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding, that will be put into some pool to be distributed in some fashion yet to be determined. That's very helpful for universities, some of which have billion-dollar turnovers and have to plan for these things.


The member for McPherson mentioned student achievement as a possible metric. That sometimes translates to attrition. Attrition of students is regularly and most often out of the control of universities, because students at universities, like all of us, have lives that are complicated. Sometimes they have to give up their studies for health reasons, because they become carers, because they've simply changed their mind or because they're not able to cope; there are so many reasons people do not finish their degree. And students that need the enabling courses that the government is now going to charge for are often those who are at most risk of not finishing their degree and going into that attrition lot of students. So if performance funding is going to be linked to attrition, then unis will find themselves being forced not to enrol students at risk of leaving their institutions—those at risk of not finishing their degree in full. And these are the people, as I said, who do the enabling courses. They are the most vulnerable in our community, the people we need to get into universities and to finish their degree. We need to do all we can to help them out so that they can finish their degree and create a better life for their families and for their future. Universities are highly motivated to keep students enrolled. It's part of their funding. The money flows with the students, so there is no need to have any kind of performance based funding managed around attrition, because that's well and truly dealt with.


I'll conclude by saying that I think these reforms are a disgrace. I've worked in this sector for over 10 years and I have been on the council of a university. I'm proud to have worked in the university sector and I'll do all I can to defend it and to improve the funding model for the universities in the future. (Time expired)

"Leeser, Julian, MP",LP,2017-09-12,"



Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (17:18):  This Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 is fundamentally about one thing—that is, the sustainability of the higher education system. There has been a wonderful and very important expansion of the higher education system under the demand-driven system since 2009 but it has never been on a sustainable basis. It is very important that universities, that students and that the whole higher education system have the certainty and stability that only funding sustainability can provide.


Now the mythmakers and the luvvies would have you believe that nothing happened in higher education until 1972 with the election of the 'Sun King', Gough Whitlam, but that's not true. The greatest expansion in higher education occurred under the prime ministership of Sir Robert Menzies.


Sir Robert Menzies' own story is worthwhile recounting in this regard. Menzies was a country boy who grew up in a one-horse town, went to a one-teacher primary school and won scholarships to high school and then scholarships to university. It was those scholarships and that opportunity to go to university which transformed his life. It allowed him to lead his profession, to lead his party and to lead his nation for a record 16 years. He was an extraordinary prime minister and an extraordinary leader in education. He wanted to give other people the same opportunity that he had had in terms of higher education. That's why he sought to expand universities to the extent that he did. In 1957, he said:


It is not yet adequately understood that a university education is not, and certainly should not be, the prerequisite of a privileged few…We must, on a broad basis, become a more and more educated democracy if we are to raise our spiritual, intellectual and material living standards.


Expanding educational opportunity is actually part of the DNA of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the demand driven system which underpins the growth of higher education was originally a Liberal Party idea. It first appeared in the policy framework in 1992 as part of the first Fightback! policy package. As that package said:


Freedom for institutions, academics and students requires a decisive move away from a centrally administered system to one based on a greatly strengthened student market, in which students can choose their university according to their own judgements and institutions have the flexibility to respond to these choices…Institutions will be free to offer places as they chose in any course with limited exceptions.


That was the first appearance of the demand-driven system.


In October 1999, the then education minister David Kemp proposed a reform to cabinet, and part of this reform was the demand-driven system. As his submission said:


… the package delivers a universal entitlement to higher education for all who can meet entry qualifications. Students will have greater choice about where they study, subject only to meeting admissions criteria, and the range of courses available will be wider and more appropriate as institutions are freed up to respond more directly to demand for particular courses and in particular locations.


Menzies realised that any growth in higher education had to be sustainable growth. That's why, in 1965, in response to some calls for further funding by academics, he said:


If I have one complaint that I can make about my academic friends, it is that some of them – not all of them but some of them – appear to think that there is no limit to what can be produced financially. I've even known one or two like that at Canberra. The sky is the limit, they think. The sky isn't the limit. Considerable financial power doesn't mean inexhaustible financial resources and that is not to be forgotten…the task of a Commonwealth Government in economic and financial policy is to preserve a good economic climate in which growth can proceed from a stable foundation…


It's not just Menzies' academic friends that didn't understand that things needed to be paid for; it's Menzies' friends on the other side of the House that don't understand that. Just like the NDIS and just like school funding, it was the Labor Party that expanded the demand driven system, and that's a good thing, but yet again they've started a system and they haven't made it a sustainable system, because they haven't provided an adequate and sustainable funding source for it.


Towards the end of the last Labor government, they realised that they actually needed to provide a sustainable basis for this. That's why, in government at the end of the Labor years, they proposed their own efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent. The then Prime Minister Gillard, on 16 April 2013, said:


The number of places has grown, but funding has also gone up per student place. Money to universities is still going to grow. We've got universities on a growth path. What we are asking them to do is for one year to accept a two per cent efficiency dividend, and in the second year a 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend. That means their money would still grow, it just wouldn't grow as fast as they'd obviously wanted.


The former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has demonstrated herself to be more economically responsible than those opposite who are opposed to this bill and who do not want to see this particular arrangement, which has provided extraordinary opportunities to students, to be held on a sustainable basis. It's important to remind people that the budget is still in deficit. Every year we're repaying $17 billion of debt. This is despite the fact that we've passed $100 billion worth of budget repair.


What we need to do is to ensure that the opportunity that's provided in the demand-driven system continues, and that people continue to have the opportunity to go to university. Today, 32 per cent of Australians have a bachelor degree or higher, and that is a great result. Our per student funding from all sources is 23 per cent higher than the OECD average, and we should be proud of that. But since 2009, the taxpayer funding for teaching and learning has increased by 71 per cent, that's twice the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and the introduction of the demand-driven system has seen a massive expansion in the number of students going to university, and that's a very good thing. For instance, in 2016 there were 720,970 domestic undergraduate students, and that's compared to 553,083 in 2009. That's a very, very good result. But you can't expand the system if you can't pay for the system. Over time, HELP has also ballooned. The fair value of student loans has increased from $12.5 billion to $36.8 billion, and is expected to increase further to $59.7 billion by 2019-20. The total outstanding student debt underwritten by taxpayers now stands at $50 billion, with a quarter of that—that's 25 per cent—not expected to be repaid. As I said, it's not responsible or fair to establish a system and then not provide for its long-term sustainability.


What this legislation proposes to do is to have an increase in student contributions in relation to their higher education. As we know, students who go to university, who have a higher education experience, are more likely to earn larger salaries and have better jobs over the course of their careers. Over their lifetimes they will earn, on average, between $700,000 and $900,000 more than a person who hasn't gone to university; therefore, it's fair that they should make a bit more of a contribution than they are currently doing. This doesn't mean that they would be contributing more than half—the Commonwealth is still contributing up to half—but that they should contribute a little bit more.


The legislation seeks to increase the maximum student contribution on Commonwealth-supported places, which are otherwise subsidised by the government. The increase in contributions will be phased in from 2018 to 2021, with a 1.8 per cent increase each year from 2018 and culminating to a 7.5 per cent increase in 2021. This will be offset by a reduction in taxpayer funding. These reforms will rebalance the contributions made by taxpayers and students to the cost of their higher education. After the changes have been implemented, taxpayers will remain the majority funder of higher education, providing on average 54 per cent of funding for the costs of teaching and learning.


As I said earlier, we know that one-quarter of the money in the HELP system isn't being repaid, and we need to do something to recoup some of that money. So the legislation is setting the minimum repayment threshold at $42,000, with a repayment rate beginning at one per cent of an individual's repayment income, which is much lower than the current rate of four per cent, which cuts in at a threshold of $54,869. To put this into perspective for a graduate teacher or a graduate nurse, for instance, a graduate teacher on a median full-time salary of $62,900 might currently expect to repay something in the order of $2,830 a year and a graduate nurse earning $58,400 would be expected to repay $2,336 per year. Importantly, from 1 July 2019 the repayment threshold, including the minimum repayment income, will be indexed using the CPI. This will maintain repayment value thresholds in real terms. Indexation by CPI will slow the growth of repayment thresholds and ensure they remain appropriate when compared to an individual's capacity to pay. The other advantage of the HELP reforms is that the proportion of debt not expected to be repaid, as the repayment threshold cuts in lower, reduces from 25 per cent to 18 per cent by 2020-21.


Finally, while eligibility for student loans will be extended to most Australian permanent residents and most New Zealand citizens, these students will no longer have access to Commonwealth subsidies, and this preserves a range of special cohorts, including some New Zealand visa holders who arrived in Australia as children, those permanent residents and New Zealanders who have already commenced on a course of study and Australian humanitarian visa holders.


I want to have a look at the efficiency dividend, which the member for Brand spoke about earlier. This legislation will require subsidies provided under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to be subjected to a 2½ per cent efficiency dividend in both 2018 and 2019. It is to be remembered that, as I said earlier in my remarks, when Labor was in government they proposed their own efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent. The Deloitte cost recovery report, undertaken in 2016, showed that universities spent approximately 85 per cent of their total funding for bachelor-level courses in 2015 on teaching and learning compared to the 2011 base funding review, which found that 94 per cent of base funding for bachelor-level courses was spent on teaching and learning. These findings suggest that it's actually reasonable to expect that some of these efficiencies should be shared with the government.


Effectively, the cost per student for teaching and learning have increased by 9.5 per cent since 2010, while revenue per student has risen by 15 per cent over that time—so a larger revenue and, while there were rising costs, costs have not risen as much as revenue. This efficiency dividend equates to an average of 2.8 per cent of base funding for teaching and research. It's an essential contribution from the revenue benefits of the demand-driven funding system, which have not just been beneficial to individual students but have also been beneficial to universities and the university system as universities have been able to increase their resources and increase their offerings as a result of the extra funding that's come their way.


Some of the most important measures in the bill actually relate to less advantaged students, whose geography or background might disadvantage them in attending university. I think the most important of these is the legislating of the HEPPP program. The HEPPP program is the major equity program. It has never been legislated, and it has often been a source, on both sides, of funding cuts that have occurred from time to time. This government is securing HEPPP by entrenching it in legislation. It's providing a loading of $985 per low-SES student. That will allow universities to provide them with a consistent level of support. Additionally, with performance funding of over $13 million a year, it will provide universities with incentives to ensure that disadvantaged students actually achieve success at university.


These provisions provide funding certainty to universities so that the benefits to low-SES students of accessing higher education are maximised. It's been a bipartisan goal since the Menzies era to increase the number of low-SES students attending university and the number of low-SES students participating in higher education. Yet, despite all of the expansion, on a per capita basis the greatest period in which low-SES students actually participated in the higher education system was the Menzies era. So it's very important that the HEPPP system is maintained on a legislatively secure basis.


We want to collaborate to provide the most effective education experience for all disadvantaged students. That's why we're creating our national priorities pool to support projects that research and trial innovative ideas for the more effective implementation of HEPPP. This will ensure that universities will engage in the long-term planning needed to guarantee accessibility. Such planning and collaboration is absolutely essential if we are to guarantee disadvantaged students a valuable experience of further education. That is very important.


There will also be supports for regional higher education, improving opportunities for students from rural and regional areas to study in regional hubs, for those who can't get to their local regional university, and also for scholarships, particularly directed at STEM courses, of up to $18,000 a year for programs from certificate IV right the way up to PhD. There are also important elements of the package relating to enabling courses, relating to the expansion of the demand-driven system of Commonwealth supported places in approved sub-bachelor courses. Being a sub-bachelor student is often a great pathway in as part of the second-chance university system into the sector. The expansion is a very good thing and will provide further opportunity to more Australians.


In conclusion, is it very important that the demand-driven system is maintained so that it gives opportunities to so many people, but we need to ensure that it is maintained on a sustainable basis.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:34):  I am really pleased to rise tonight, following the member for Brand, because I felt that the member for Brand took this debate to a higher level, to an aspirational level. It was fantastic to hear from somebody who understands the university system but who, most importantly, understands the aspirations of higher education.


We say 'higher education' in this place—we say it every day—but what does it mean? The member for Brand asked some really important questions. She asked the critical questions: what is driving this so-called reform? Is improvement in higher education what's driving this reform? Is access to higher education what's driving this reform? Is excellence in higher education what is driving this reform? Sadly, I believe it is none of the above. What is driving this so-called reform are savings and cuts, because whenever you hear this government say 'savings' you can understand clearly what it means is 'a cut'. 


You have to ask yourself: what would the great thinkers in our history make of this? The bean counters are in charge of learning in this place. We just heard from a member opposite who has had the value of a higher education, and he can turn bean counting into oratory, supposedly. The value of higher education is about the value of our society. It is about what we aspire to be. It is about what contribution we, as individuals and as a collective, are going to make to the rest of the world. If the bean counters are in charge of the learning then we are going to have what we've got here tonight: dumb policy, dumb legislation and dumb cuts, from a government who understands the cost of everything and the value of nothing. 


As someone who came from education, I have spent my life talking to children, young people and adult learners about lifelong learning. What I see in this legislation is the end of the aspiration for lifelong learning for many of the young people and middle-aged people who live in the electorate that I represent here. As a teacher I spent 27 years in schools, working with students towards building aspiration and motivation from prep through to year 12, telling every student that they can learn if they are given the appropriate levels of support and the appropriate levels of challenge. The primary tenet of teaching is a belief that everybody can learn if given the appropriate levels of support and challenge. 


Since coming and joining this parliament I find myself in schools telling children very clearly: 'I'm in the federal Parliament of Australia, and I can tell you that you can do anything,' because when I look around this chamber I can see many of us here who wouldn't have thought that this is where we'd end up. But it does not happen by accident. The people who find themselves in this chamber as members of the House of Representatives in the federal parliament have had aspiration and they have had motivation. They have had supports put into their lives to assist them to reach for the stars. So we here are examples for the young people that we're talking about. 


Tonight we're talking about a piece of legislation that is going to rip away that aspiration and stomp on that motivation that I know is being built in schools in my electorate as we speak. As a former educator, I believe in the transformative nature of education and the transformative nature of higher education in particular. I represent a community where 47 per cent of people are not born in Australia, where 72 per cent of people have at least one parent born overseas and where 56 per cent of people have both parents born overseas. All parents in my electorate want to see their children do well, whether they are from families where no-one has gone to university or whether they are from families with the first person going to university or whether they are from families for whom there's a long tradition of tertiary education. Everybody wants to see their children do well. This is particularly the case in my community. People have come to this country to make the most of our story and to join us here. A lot of what drives them is a relentless drive for their children to get that tertiary education. They are motivated. They are encouraged to achieve as much as possible because in this country, while we have some way to go, there are fewer barriers to a person realising their potential than in a lot of other parts of the world.


People in my electorate work hard so that their children can achieve academic success. Whenever I meet with people at graduation ceremonies, they are hopeful that their kids will be able to access the skills they need to make a better life for themselves. In my electorate, as recently as this weekend I was at a local festival, where I often seek out the mums and the kids to talk to them about what their aspirations are and what schools they're attending. I'm always thrilled to hear from parents that they think that our school system is doing a great job. They think that their child is having that aspiration instilled in them in their classroom and that they're getting appropriately challenged.


I want to talk specifically about the kids in my electorate. I made a call today to friends at Werribee Secondary College. Last year, 2016, of a cohort of 205 students completing year 12, 124 students went on to higher tertiary education, 60 went on to TAFE, 12 are completing an apprenticeship and 16 are in full employment. Of those that went to university, 27 went to Melbourne and Monash, 68 went to Swinburne, RMIT, Deakin and La Trobe, and 23 went on to Vic uni, ACU and other tertiary institutions. That was unheard of 15 years ago in my electorate. I congratulate the teachers involved in those journeys, and the parents with them, to build that aspiration and expectation and to build an understanding that lifelong learning will change lives. But, if this bill passes and this government gets its way, students will be faced with 7.5 per cent higher HELP fees and the threshold for when they begin to pay them back will be lowered—that is right: lowered. The loan repayments currently kick in at around $55K and will be reduced to $42,000. That's just a few thousand dollars more than the minimum wage. Changes to the indexation from average weekly earnings to CPI will also increase the burden on students.


We have to know—I do after four years in this place—that, where there's a change like that, there's a calculated save, so that means a cost to the students. One could be cruelly ironic and suggest that, after the penalty rate cuts, the government is lowering the repayment threshold to account for reduced wages, but surely that would be too cruel. The justifications come back to bean counters looking at education as a cost rather than as an investment—rather than from the point of view of what we as a country should aspire to be: a highly educated population of people committed to lifelong learning so that we can continue to change and shape this nation, change and shape our economy, change and shape our industry and change and shape our science. The bill's practical application risks entrenching poverty and enshrining privilege. It risks locking out our best and brightest because of the family income or the travel costs and the time. All manner of things go into motivating young people to pursue and fulfil their potential. The measures in this bill will make that harder.


Another objectionable measure is the changes for permanent residents and New Zealander students living in Australia. They will be moved from Commonwealth supported places to full-fee places with access to FEE-HELP loans. This is an injustice and I cannot speak too passionately about this. I spent Saturday morning in my electorate at the Rugby Union junior finals. As you can imagine, there were a few Kiwis there—a few taxpaying, hardworking New Zealanders who've spent their lives in this country and are raising their children in this country—and they are furious about this measure. How dare a government in this country determine that their children don't deserve the same chance as the kids they're sitting next to in the classroom? What manner of government cannot foresee what this means? Let me take it from a simple perspective. It means that those families will have to think about sending their child back to live with relatives in New Zealand so that they can access higher education or take on enormous debt by paying full fees. This is unfair and it is cruel.


Let's think about the other ramifications. I know, as a classroom teacher, a senior English teacher and someone who taught years 11 and 12 for years and years, that, if you set up this double class system and say, 'You can go to university, and you can't because of cost,' you've just destroyed my senior classroom, because I've got children I can't motivate. I've got children whose aspiration has been killed before they walk through the door. This is crazy—absolutely crazy. To do this to these people is beyond belief. The impacts will be felt throughout the country. It's just the cruelty of it that I do not understand. I really do feel for those New Zealanders who I know who live and work in my electorate, who work hard every day and whose children go to our schools. They are going to be cut off from the contribution that they might make to this great country.


This legislation is all about cuts. I want to go to one of the areas where we're not sure yet what the ramifications are, but we should have known that this minister, once he had finished gutting schools, would move next to universities. We should have known that, although they couldn't get the last tranche of their changes to higher education through, they would be back with a different version, a slightly adjusted version, but a version with mostly bad news. One of those things is the lack of modelling and the unknown implications of the legislation that's before us. One of those things is, of course, the extension of the demand-driven sector to sub-bachelor for universities. We don't know what impact this will have on our public TAFE sector, which states around this country are desperately trying to rebuild. We don't know what the impact will be on that TAFE sector, and that is a crying shame. This government should have modelled that, and this government should make sure that, whatever it's doing in higher education, it's not doing anything that will stop TAFE being re-established and back in public hands where it belongs. 


The other area that I'm really concerned about—I'll go back to the notion of lifelong learning—is that they are going to now charge people for what has been called an enabling course. In my neck of the woods, we call it a bridging course. They're courses that I have worked on in schools with students who have gone off and got a job and perhaps lost the job. Then they reconnect with the school, and careers counsellors sit with them and say: 'You always had the potential. You just never made the commitment. How about you do one of these bridging courses and pursue the dream you had when you were in year 10 of going to university? Why don't you do that?' These aren't kids from families who can just splash out $3,000. If they've left school, had a job, taken on debts—probably a car loan—and lost their job then their parents are already helping out, and now we're going to put a charge on their bridge to tertiary education. 


It's not just young people. The figures will reflect the number of mums, the number of women with children, who decide to establish themselves in a bridging program with the hope of pursuing tertiary qualifications and being able to cut themselves free from any kind of government support and raise their children on a decent salary.


There are so many elements of this bill that are not good news for Australia. There are elements of this bill that reflect poorly on this government. They reflect poorly because in a time when we should be investing in our young people, in our adults, in our future and in our training, and in a time when we should be aspiring to be the best in the world and we are in a highly globalised and competitive market, it is the time to invest in our people. It is not a time to let the bean counters loose so they can find money for a $65 billion tax cut for multimillionaires and corporations. This is not that time.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:49):  I rise to speak against the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. I do so because if this legislation is carried by this parliament it will undermine tertiary education in Australia as we know it. This bill represents a $3.8 billion cut to higher education in this country. It is a cut that's across the board and a cut that will damage the nature of educational opportunity in this country.


This is a cut, of course, that overwhelmingly will have an impact on young Australians. It is an increase to the average student contribution towards the cost of a degree from 42 per cent up to 46 per cent. It represents a $12,000 decrease to the amount that a graduate is allowed to earn—a decrease to $42,000—before the mandatory repayment of HECS-HELP fees begins. Furthermore, access to Commonwealth supported places for permanent residents and New Zealand citizens studying in Australia will be removed indefinitely. It is ironic, given the debate that has taken place over the citizenship of the Deputy Prime Minister in this country, that they're undermining the ability and capacity of New Zealand citizens to fully participate in Australian society.


It is a concern that across the board this represents an attack on opportunity. Whilst student contributions are increased and repayment thresholds are lowered for all tertiary institutions, including TAFE and vocational education and training students, those worst hit in this latest round of cuts are our universities. Australian universities are about to be subjected to a 2.5 per cent funding cut that Malcolm Turnbull's coalition, in its finest example of doublespeak yet, calls an efficiency dividend. Not to mention the 7.5 per cent hike in student fees over the next four years and the removal of Commonwealth supported places for postgraduate students.


This, of course, is about government priorities—whether a government priority is corporate tax cuts for the top end of town or whether it is providing support for the higher education needs of our country. If Australia is going to prosper in the Asian century, we need to prosper on the basis of how smart we are and how innovative we are, and on the capacity of our human capital to compete in this region. We shouldn't try to compete by lowering wages and conditions and we shouldn't try to compete by undermining the capacity of our population—particularly our young population—but this is what the government would do. This is what this legislation represents.


It also represents, I believe, a fundamental, philosophical divide across this chamber. Those in the Liberal Party seem to believe that education is just about benefitting the individual—that an individual benefits and gets a higher income, and that they should therefore contribute more to that educational opportunity. The problem with that is twofold. Firstly, it doesn't understand or take into account the fact that increasing educational opportunity and increasing the capacity of our population—particularly our younger generations—to make the most of themselves and to educate themselves in ways which both contribute commercially to the economy and contribute to their capacity to make a difference in society, is a benefit for that society as a whole. It's not just about the individual and the benefit to them.


That is a fundamental difference in what Labor has always understood about education: that education is the great enabler. That is why the Hawke government and the Keating government were very proud of the fact that in 1983 some three out of 10 Australian young people completed their Higher School Certificate and, at the end of that period in 1996, that figure was above eight out of 10. That was a great legacy of the Hawke and Keating governments. That followed the great Whitlam government reforms that opened up tertiary education to working-class people.


Many of us who sit in this chamber would be the first people in their families to complete a university degree. I was the first person in my family to complete schooling, let alone a university degree. That means that we maximise the benefit for the individual, but we also maximise the benefit to the economy and to society as a whole by maximising the collective potential of those people who make up our local communities. 


Federal Labor came into office in 2007—something that we will be celebrating in coming months. We increased funding for universities from $8 billion to $14 billion over our six years in office, a $6 billion increase in contributions to universities. During that period, we saw again a massive increase in the number of people who were able to go to university. That changed the composition of the people who were going to universities. People from lower and middle incomes who had been missing out then got that opportunity. 


Labor also has a plan for TAFE and the vocational education and training sector. The last Labor government contributed over $19 billion in Commonwealth funding towards the VET and TAFE sector, including investment in infrastructure and technology upgrades. There is legislation before this parliament to abolish funds that Labor established—the Building Australia Fund, to build transport infrastructure, which was approved by Infrastructure Australia; and the Education Investment Fund, which was for building education infrastructure around the country. They just want to abolish those. 


The reinvigoration of TAFE and VET courses is of particular importance to me. The Design Centre Enmore, one of the most notable TAFEs in New South Wales, resides in the inner west. This centre specialises in industrial design, fashion design and visual design, and has flourished in spite of the cuts to services imposed by the coalition and reinforced by the state government, which has also undermined TAFE. Just down the road, Petersham TAFE in West Street has been forced to close its doors. It specialised in communications. How extraordinary is it that a TAFE centre in a global city like Sydney specialising in communications, giving young people that opportunity, has shut its doors because of cuts by the New South Wales coalition government, reinforced by the attitude of the federal government?


It is because of Labor's proven track record and our belief in higher education that we will oppose the measures in this bill that increase student fees and lower the HECS, HELP, TAFE and VET repayment thresholds. We oppose these changes, just as we opposed and successfully defeated the proposal from Tony Abbott in the last term of government to have $100,000 degrees. We know that the changes proposed in this legislation come at a time when Australians are paying the sixth-highest level of university fees in the OECD. The memory of university fee deregulation is still fresh in the minds of most. Had this plan been accepted, we would have had a two-tiered higher education system—the privileged, who could afford it, and the underprivileged, who could not. One of the great distinctions and divides in Australian politics is between Labor, who believe in creating opportunity, and our conservative opponents, who believe in entrenching privilege. And that is why we see education as the great enabler.


I am concerned with this legislation and the impact that it has on universities. Universities support more than 130,000 jobs across Australia. If you cut an amount of funding from an institution, somewhere down the line a job is lost. If you cut $3.8 billion from the institutions, you could be certain that the jobs lost will be in the thousands. That's important in local institutions like the University of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney, which service my electorate even though they're just outside my boundaries. But it is also critically important for universities like the University of New England, in Armidale, the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong. All of these campuses have had a critical role to play in those local regional economies.


One of the things Australia has been very good at over the years is developing new technology and innovation—whether it be solar technology at the Australian National University or the University of New South Wales or wi-fi and information technology down at the University of Wollongong. Across the board our universities have been world class in innovation, research, ideas and breakthroughs. What we haven't always been good at it commercialising those opportunities and value-adding so that we create the jobs here in Australia. And the real debate should be how we do that, how we maximise the intellectual capacity that we have here into job creation down the line.


This government really isn't interested in that, though. A university campus, a TAFE campus or a school they just see as a target for cuts. Australian electrical engineer Dr John O'Sullivan invented an integral component of wi-fi while looking for a way to measure the mass of a black hole. Dr O'Sullivan undertook his undergraduate degree in engineering at Sydney uni. Australian writer Garth Nix penned the Old Kingdom trilogy, an internationally successful series that raised the bar for science fiction and fantasy writers worldwide. He was a graduate of the University of Canberra. Across the board, there is enormous success that we should be proud of.


This legislation would provide a loss of over $600 million in my home state of New South Wales alone. This legislation is not worthy of support in this parliament. This legislation will undermine our capacity as an economy. It will hurt individuals and their capacity to make the most of themselves in life and provide support to their family. It will undermine our standing on the global stage, where we've been very proud of the high ranking that our universities have reached over recent years. Nelson Mandela said that education is the most powerful weapon with which you can change the world. Nelson Mandela was right. This legislation is wrong.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (18:04):  From 1996 to 1999, Prime Minister John Howard and his education ministers consistently and systematically attacked the Australian higher education system. Two billion dollars was taken from the university system in that period alone. Clearly, cutting university funding is in the Liberals' DNA. The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 would bring about almost double those cuts, $3.8 billion, and, on top of that, $4 billion to go from the education infrastructure fund. The Group of Eight, representing Australia's top universities, describes it as 'the most brutal cuts by a federal government in more than 20 years'. And this comes at a time when the need for post-school education has never been as high.


Right from the start, I want to make clear that the TAFE and university sectors both require fair funding. Both have a vital and complementary role in skilling up the workforce for employment opportunities that lie ahead of us in the 21st century. Let's talk, though, about the impact of these government cuts to university education on students. When Labor were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013—$1 billion a year, every year, of improvement. What was even more significant than that money was that we opened the door to universities to an additional 190,000 Australians. Many of them were the first in their family to go to university.


But this government's decision to increase student fees delivers a blow to aspiring students just like them. In my electorate of Macquarie, students attend universities all over Sydney and beyond—Wollongong, Charles Sturt, Newcastle—but a large number, around 2,000 of them at any one time, attend Western Sydney University, and more than half of them are the first in their family to go to university. This university, Western Sydney University, is the uni that will lose the biggest amount of any university in New South Wales.


I just want you to imagine what it's like to be the first in your family to consider going to university. The current university fees are daunting enough, but this bill means that if you're thinking about university they're going to get worse. I have noticed in my time here that those opposite seem to lack a bit of imagination. It might be hard to imagine, if they were lucky enough to have a whole family of tertiary people around them and have an expectation that university was their path. I was lucky enough to have that expectation, but I see so many kids where that is not the case. So I'm going to ask you to imagine, just for once, Deputy Speaker, what it's like. I'd ask those on the other side to imagine what it's like.


It isn't easy being the first in your family, especially when people quiz you on just what job you'll do when you've got your arts degree or even your master's. And trying to explain what a master's is—that's a whole other conversation. It's hard to explain that the skills you learn, which I know these kids learn, are sometimes as much about the journey of processing huge amounts of information, researching things, taking on new ideas and turning them into a coherent argument. It's as much about that as the actual subject itself. Until you've done your degree, you don't even realise what you've learnt or where it might help you contribute to the world of work. So it can be hard trying to explain to your family that you're just not sure what your major will be, let alone what job you might ultimately do. I see the uncertainty of young people, really capable young people, who are not sure if university is for them, because no-one in their family has ever done it before. It doesn't take much to discourage or dampen that ambition, to deter them from pursuing it and to destroy their confidence in themselves. It's a really intimidating situation.


This government might think you can keep making it harder and harder for people to lift their educational standards, but future employers and our economy will pay a heavy price for this failure to invest in higher education. One of the most short-sighted and mean parts of this bill is around funding for enabling courses. The crushing of confidence is nowhere more apparent than in the decision to introduce fees for enabling courses. Enabling courses help students prepare for university study. These students are overwhelmingly from disadvantaged backgrounds, and, until now, these courses have been free. Even then it's daunting. It's a taste of what might come, and that in itself is intimidating. It's a pathway for students to test and see whether they could thrive in a university environment and whether they're ready for a degree course.


Now the government is trying to make students pay $3,200 for these courses. The member for Dobell and I did some quick calculations, and we worked out a way that this might be able to be removed from this legislation. The cost of the marriage equality survey—that's $122 million—would pay for around 38,000 enabling courses. We think that would be a much better use of money. As it is, these young kids and older people who haven't been to university but who think that it might be a way forward for them to improve their professional standing and to give them a broader job opportunity are now facing a $3,200 bill.


The danger of the change, which will affect in my electorate, on average, about two dozen people who go to Western Sydney University at any one time, is that these people will simply be deterred from even considering entering university. Right now we should be encouraging people, young and older, to be exploring their education options so that they're equipped for the workforce. All this measure will do is marginalise a group of people, stifle their hope and stifle their opportunity. That may well be the aim of those opposite, although I hope not—to keep people in their place and not give them access to ambition. 


I also want you to imagine what impact this bill has on people paying back their HELP debt. After years of subsistence as a student, followed by the time it takes to get a full-time job even with a degree, it can feel good to have a half-decent income, not just a mishmash of casual hospitality jobs that so many students use to support themselves through that study. But, before you've even had a chance to build your savings and get ahead, the repayment kicks in. At $54,869, as it stands now, there is a bit of a buffer, but under this bill you have to start paying back the loan you've accrued when you're earning $42,000. That's only $6,000 above the minimum wage. In Sydney, and in my electorate in particular, that doesn't go very far. When you do the numbers, an income of $51,000 with tax taken out and repayments made means you actually leave someone with $32,000 in disposable income. So, if you adjust those figures down, you are making life really, really difficult. It's another disincentive to people who look to university education to lift their job prospects and earning power that it will become an even longer slog to get your head above water financially. 


As the National Union of Students says, these changes leave young Australians far worse off than generations before them. They point out:


This generation is already faced with a severely insecure job market, low wages and a housing market that is in crisis.


Already they face the sixth-highest university fees in the OECD countries. Their fear is of a lifetime of serious debt. And let's not assume that the students are only interested in the impact on themselves. As the NUS says, higher education is Australia's third-largest export, and expenditure of 0.7 per cent of GDP returns around eight per cent in GDP. So it is a small investment for a big return, and that's just one part of the equation.


One of the other impacts of this bill, inevitably, is that it will likely dent the quality that Australian universities are able to provide, which puts at risk that international reputation. Just this month, eight Australian universities were listed in the top 100 for their ability to produce employable students, something we would all welcome. But the global rankings editorial director, Phil Baty, has said that these cuts to government funding could actually result in Australia's standing falling. He said:


It is good news that Australia's universities have held steady in this year's table but funding cuts proposed by the government could seriously harm the country's institutions in future editions of the rankings.


Mr Baty points out that the data shows Australia's leading institutions are already starting to fall behind peers in mainland China and Hong Kong, who, of course, not only are sources of students for our export dollars but also will compete for those export dollars. So really this bill is not great for the economy. 


Another short-sighted decision in this bill is to cut the Education Infrastructure Fund—the extra $4 billion cut. This fund, established under Labor, has helped create innovative and modern learning and research spaces around the country. I know a bit about three of them. The Australian Centre for Indigenous Knowledges & Education in Darwin—ACIKE—is a collaboration between the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education and Charles Darwin University. This fund allowed a building to be created, a space where Indigenous learning could happen. ACIKE aspires to international renown for excellence in teaching programs, community engagement and research endeavours all through this state-of-the-art learning hub. It is a real asset for Darwin and for higher education in Darwin. 


Another facility funded by the EIF is the nanoscience lab—one of the most advanced research and teaching facilities globally in the field of nanoscience—at the University of Sydney. I know very little about nanoscience, but what I know is that to do the research you need an incredibly stable building. It can't move when the wind blows outside or when the trains run underneath. This centre houses high-level research in one of the most advanced buildings on this planet. It looks into areas of battery technology and the growing field of photonics, where you have laser lights directly interacting with traditional semiconductors, and all this cutting edge technology. 


The third building that has been funded under the EIF that I know of and have familiarity with is what was originally called the Centre for Climate Change and Energy Research—now called the UWS Institute for the Environment—in Richmond on the Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University. Again, this is a place doing world-leading research. In fact, researchers from all over the world move to my electorate to do their research here. I had the privilege of taking the climate change shadow minister, Mark Butler, to this site just a few weeks ago to look at some of the incredible work they're doing on soil biology, genomics and plant and animal interactions.


One of the projects that they're doing is the 'eucalyptus free air CO2 enrichment experiment', otherwise known as EucFACE. This is a series of six metal structures in the Cumberland Plain. They surround patches of bush. They are nine storeys high, with 43-metre cranes hanging above them. In this open structure, which looks a bit like a cylinder with metal prongs sticking up, is native bush, and CO2 is pumped into it. It's pumped in at an elevated concentration similar to that which is predicted to occur in the next 35 years. It is billed as the most complex climate change experiment in the world, and the data that is constantly generated in the soil, in the canopy and everywhere in between is made available to researchers globally. None of this would have been possible without the Education Investment Fund. I can only imagine what new innovations we are going to miss out on because this government has effectively suffocated opportunities for universities to build these incredible spaces. Those are some of the immediate impacts. 


When I look at my local university, Western Sydney University, I see we are going to lose jobs. Those jobs will be based on all the campuses—Penrith, Hawkesbury, Werrington, Parramatta. We're also going to potentially lose the opportunity to nurture SMEs, start-ups and entrepreneurs. This is something the university does out of its surplus funding—a whole $10 million surplus, not very much in the big scheme of things, but that surplus is going to disappear. I worry about the jobs we will lose, the innovation we will miss out on, the opportunities that the students at that university will not have—but, even more than that, the opportunities that will be lost to students who make the decision that they can't face a debt of the size that this bill will land on them. That's actually our economic future we are talking about. We are making a choice in this parliament. If those on the opposite side support this bill, it is an active decision to reduce the opportunity for higher education that students around this country have, and that is shameful.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (18:19):  I'm speaking in opposition to most of the elements of the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 and in support of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Sydney. Pensioners, families, small businesses and school students have all been attacked by this government, and now, with this bill, we can add to that group university students. These are the groups of Australians whose lot in life has been made much harder by this Turnbull government. We've seen skyrocketing electricity prices make life more difficult for families, pensioners, and small businesses. We've seen cuts to school budgets through changes to the Gonski principles and that model of funding introduced by this government. We've seen cuts to health care and Medicare and an ideological attack on universal health care in Australia by this government. We've seen low-paid workers have their incomes attacked through changes to the Fair Work Act and, of course, through cuts to penalty rates that have been cheered on by this Turnbull government. And now we have an ideological attack on the university students of Australia through this bill.


At a time when our economy is stop-start—two steps forward, one step back—when the economy has been spluttering over recent years and when we need to improve our nation's productivity if we're going to boost growth and employment in our community, the worst thing a government can do is underinvest in education, make life harder for students and increase fees for university students. That is exactly what this bill does and it is why Labor opposes it. At a time when we should be investing in education for our young people and ensuring that they have the skills necessary to compete in a much-changed and more competitive marketplace, this government prefers to cut funding for universities and make life harder for students across Australia.


As part of this bill, the maximum student contributions will rise by 1.8 per cent for four years from 2018, resulting in a total 7.5 per cent increase from 2021. The first increase will take effect on 1 January 2018 and will apply to all students, including those who are currently enrolled, and Commonwealth contribution amounts will be similarly adjusted each year from 2018 through to 2021 to reflect increased student contribution amounts in those years. An efficiency dividend of 2.5 per cent per annum will apply to grants made under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme in 2018 and 2019. The efficiency dividend is a contribution from the revenue benefits of the demand-driven funding system. Medical students' loading will be extended to include veterinary science and dentistry units under study in 2018 to improve the funding arrangements for these courses. Currently our students pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. The fee hikes in this bill will make that situation even worse, and our rankings will once again fall in terms of affordability.


In the community that I represent, in Kingsford Smith, we're quite fortunate to have a world-class university in the University of New South Wales at Kensington. I was fortunate to be a student at this university and it's what all kids in the community that I represent aspire to. They dream of being able to get the marks in their HSC to attend the University of New South Wales and get a world-class tertiary education. This bill makes it harder for those kids in our community, particularly those kids that come from a low-socioeconomic background or are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids, because, quite simply, some of them will not be able to afford the fee increases proposed in these bills. Unfortunately, the coalition has made life more difficult for younger people to participate in our society and to get a good job.


Kingsford Smith has the sixth-highest rates of mortgage repayments in the country and the eighth-highest rents. The cost of housing in our community is bringing many young people to their knees. Many times when I walk down the street, I'm approached by young people and their parents saying they simply will not be able to afford to buy a house or to rent in the community where they grew up and where their family networks are, and go to universities in their community, like the University of New South Wales. Joe Hockey's solution to this was just, 'Get a better job,' and the Prime Minister's solution to this is, 'If you've got rich parents, they can chip in and help you buy a house.' We all know that that is not the reality for most Australian families in this country.


In contrast, Labor knows and understands just how difficult it is for people to get an education, but we want to support them. We want to make sure that there is a clear pathway for kids to undertake a decent education in Australia, from early childhood development right through to emeritus professor at university—a pathway such that education and access to education are based on your talents and on your commitment, not on your parents' bank balance. But, unfortunately, this type of reform reintroduces that sort of system into this country.


Now, when Labor was last in government, we increased our investment in universities. We lifted the investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. It was the largest commitment and investment in university education from an Australian government at the time when we left office. We opened the doors to universities for an additional 190,000 Australians, many of whom were the first in their families to get access to a university education. And why did we lift participation in universities? Because it's good for the individual and it's good for the Australian economy. Every single study, every single bit of research, indicates that the more you educate a person then the more productive they become not only in terms of their own personal contribution to the economy but for the nation's income growth and productivity.


Labor is also supportive of the wonderful research that is undertaken at our universities. At the University of New South Wales, we have world-leading research facilities in photovoltaic and solar research and in quantum computing, where Professor Michelle Simmons and her team are leading the world in developing a silicon based quantum computer. The research world is in awe of some of the results that they have received so far.


One of the world's greatest medical teaching resources is at the University of New South Wales, working in collaboration with the Prince of Wales Hospital. This is world-class leading research that has changed the world. It has definitely changed the world. The fact that the University of New South Wales PV and solar research facility has the world record for conversion of sunlight into energy is something that we all should be very, very proud of. And they are housed in a building that was funded by the Labor government through the Education Investment Fund—the Tyree Energy Technologies Building. It has a six-star energy rating, I might add; it is one of the world's most energy-efficient buildings. When you walk into that building you see many, many students undertaking research. They are doing their PhDs and working with some of the best researchers in photovoltaic and solar research anywhere in the world.


When I was there recently—and the member for Port Adelaide joined me there over the last 12 months to have a look at the research that's going on there—one of the researchers who is working there described that facility perfectly to me. He said: 'If you want to work in space research, you want to go to NASA. If you want to work in solar and photovoltaics, you want to work at the University of New South Wales.' You want to work in that Tyree building, funded by the Education Investment Fund that this government is seeking to cut through its cuts to that particular fund and its cuts to university research.


In his 2014 budget reply, Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Labor Party, set an aspiration for Australia to devote three per cent of our GDP to research and development by 2030. Achieving this will require governments, universities and research organisations to work with industry to boost the development and the resources that go into research in this country. And what we're doing here with this bill is the complete antithesis of that; it's the complete opposite of that. Labor believes that every university in Australia should be doing great research, and we've pledged to help our regional outer metropolitan and smaller universities to get a fair go through the Collaborative Research Networks program. As well as working together, Labor wants universities to work better with industry and other end users to spread the benefits of their research and, of course, to encourage entrepreneurialism in students.


We aim to boost the Industrial Transformation Research Program introduced by the previous Labor government, which would have enabled at least four additional research hubs to be funded in each of the five rounds that were coming up. This would have facilitated more industries in transition to have access to excellent research, to improve their productivity and to create the jobs of the future. The bill before us is the complete antithesis of that.


This bill before us is also quite lacking in detail. There is very, very little detail about how the bill will work. The government's new voucher system for postgraduate places is simply a thought bubble. It's an idea without substance. It's a solution without a problem. There are approximately 35,000 postgraduate CSP students in Australia, and the government is proposing to hand over the funding allocation to the minister or some new private body to distribute it. The unis think that this is a poorly thought out idea, and so does Labor. In fact, according to a poll conducted recently by JWS Research for Universities Australia, almost two-thirds of Australians are opposed to what this government is doing when it comes to universities: increasing fees for students, cutting grants for research, cutting funding and making fees rise. Up to 62 per cent of voters are opposed to the changes, compared with 16 per cent who support what the government is doing through this bill.


As quoted by The Guardian today, Universities Australia chief executive Belinda Robertson said the poll showed that cuts contained in the bill were 'way out of kilter with community sentiment'. She said:


Voters don't want to see cuts to universities, which are key drivers of economic growth because they create new jobs, re-skill Australians and secure $24bn a year in export income.


Universities and their students have already contributed almost $4bn to repair the budget over the last six years. Clearly, the Australian community is saying enough is enough: no more uni cuts.


I couldn't have put it better myself. That's exactly what the Australian people are thinking. They're sick and tired of this government attacking pensioners, attacking young families, attacking workers, attacking school students and now attacking university and TAFE students through initiatives such as this. They want to see a government that is fair dinkum about education and fair dinkum about universities and their research, investing in universities and investing in the future. I urge my colleagues to vote down those particular provisions in this bill.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:32):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. What can one say about a government that is hell-bent on deliberately cutting funding to university education? It is hard to believe that the Abbott and Turnbull governments have done and are doing to Australian universities and university students.


When the Turnbull government announced they were going to cut university funding by $3.8 billion over four years and lower the payment threshold for students, I thought the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, was Prime Minister again. This is the same outrageously unfair university package that the Abbott government tried to sell in 2014. All the Turnbull government has done is wrap up the same unfair package in glossy paper and put a fancy tinsel bow on top. No-one is fooled. Everyone can smell this bill for what it really is: an attack on the less fortunate in our community because it promotes elitist education.


Time and time again, coalition governments want to attack universities and university students. For the life of me, I simply cannot understand why, especially when the majority of the Turnbull government front bench have benefitted from a free university education thanks to the Whitlam Labor government. The majority of coalition frontbenchers attended university between 1974 and 1988, when students did not pay any fees. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and front bench members such as Attorney-General George Brandis, Minister for Defence Marise Payne and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott are among those who attended university when a university education was free. In total, eight Turnbull government ministers were at university when students were not charged fees, while another eight would have had at least one year of free university education. Why is this noteworthy? It points to the absolute hypocrisy of the Turnbull government frontbenchers who have benefitted from a free education at university but who want to make savage cuts to universities and students by raising the costs of their degrees and lowering the income threshold.


The Turnbull government will not allow anyone else to reap the same benefits from a university education as they have done. Their degrees have given them greater earning capacity and career opportunities than those people who have not had the opportunity to gain a university qualification. Universities Australia's chief executive, Belinda Robinson, said:


… the Australian community could see it made no sense to cut university funding at a time of rapid and dramatic economic change.


Ms Robinson also said that the government's plan to cut funding to universities is 'way out of kilter with community sentiment'. She went on to say:


Voters don’t want to see cuts to universities – which are key drivers of economic growth – because they create new jobs, reskill Australians and secure $24 billion a year in export income.


Universities and their students have already contributed almost $4 billion to repair the Budget over the last six years. Clearly, the Australian community is saying enough is enough: no more uni cuts.


According to a 2012 report by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, based at the University of Canberra, people with university qualifications are likely to earn more than $1 million more than those without degrees. The irony of this is that a number of the Turnbull government's members started their careers in politics at university. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott enrolled in a combined economics/law degree at the University of Sydney in 1976 and became president of the student representative council in 1978. Nine years later, former treasurer Joe Hockey also became student representative council president at the University of Sydney. Minister for Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg was President of the Monash Law Student Society. Most politicians have had access to a quality university education that has delivered them myriad benefits, and it is time the Turnbull government put all of today's students at the heart of their policies. 


The Group of Eight comprises Australia's top eight universities. A number of the Turnbull government members have attended a Go8 university, so one would think that they would take recommendations made by the Go8 very seriously. Recently, the Group of Eight made a number of recommendations as a result of the independent review into regional, rural and remote education. Not surprisingly, the No. 1 recommendation was


That the Senate block the current Higher Education Reform Bill as this puts at risk a broad range of university capacity-building, including highly successful equity programs.


The same university that Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull attended is recommending that the Senate block his own legislation—recommendations wisely given but, sadly, falling on deaf ears. 


The Group of Eight have also recommended that the federal government ensures that policies to support higher education outcomes for regional students are well designed and adequately and consistently funded. The federal government continues to invest in equity programs over the long term to support regional and remote students, including by increasing the value of the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program to $205.1 million per year as was forecast in Labor's 2012-13 budget for the 2015-16 year. They recommended that the federal government review eligibility criteria for youth allowance and other linked student income support programs to ensure that they provide an appropriate level of support for students from regional areas. There is absolutely no mention of cuts to university funding and no mention of drug testing for those people on Newstart or youth allowance. The members of the Turnbull government have received a big fail on their policy, a fail on their cuts and a fail on their plans for university, which were handed down by the universities that they attended. 


The Turnbull government is cutting $401.8 million from Queensland universities. James Cook University in North Queensland will receive a cut of $37.1 million over four years. Teaching, student programs and university facilities will suffer as a result of these cuts. These cuts will damage Australia's research effort. There is an implicit cross-subsidy to research, accepted throughout the higher education sector, through the Commonwealth grants scheme and this comes on top of the government's attempts to abolish the $3.7 billion nation-building Education Investment Fund. Australia has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD. These cuts will only make our record worse.


Our students already pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. The fee hikes in this bill will only make that record worse as well. Students will be put under pressure with higher fees and paying off larger debts sooner. Students will have to start paying back their loan when they are earning $42,000 instead of $54,869. The Higher Education Loan Program repayments will hit students at a time when they are trying to save for a house or start a family. Forty-two thousand dollars is approximately $6,000 more than the minimum wage.


Lowering the HELP repayment threshold, in combination with tax and transfer measures included in the 2017 budget, will mean that some graduates will face an effective marginal tax rate of more than 100 per cent. Graduates caught between these policies will experience considerable fiscal and financial stress. Graduates earning $51,000, most of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income than someone earning $32,000.


The Turnbull government's disastrous policies go beyond attacking university students. They are also attacking TAFE students. As a TAFE teacher in a previous life, I know just how unfair that truly is. But the government doesn't like to talk about this. The lower repayment threshold for HELP debt will also apply to TAFE and vocational students who took out VET FEE-HELP or VET student loans. This means that some of the hardest working but most modestly paid people in the country will be affected—for example, people with a diploma or advanced diploma qualification, such as early childhood educators, enrolled nurses and technicians.


What is even worse is the move by the Turnbull government to introduce fees for enabling courses, which provide essential skills and confidence to prepare students for university. Students who finish these courses have gone on to become nurses, accountants, doctors and lawyers. These students are overwhelmingly from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. These courses have been free, as they do not lead to a formal qualification. However, this government is trying to make these students pay $3,200 to sit in an enabling course. This shift is mean and unfair because we know that, for a majority of these students, fees and debt are a barrier to study.


And what impact will these cuts have on jobs? Universities support more than 130,000 jobs across Australia. Cuts to universities will put jobs at risk, especially in regional areas—like in James Cook University and Central Queensland University in Townsville. No-one, absolutely no-one, is in favour of the Turnbull government's university cuts. The peak body for universities, Universities Australia, said that an overwhelming majority of vice-chancellors could not recommend that the crossbench support this bill. The NTEU, the sector's union, is opposed to the bill because of the impact that the cuts and fee hikes will have on students. TAFEs are deeply concerned about the impact that changes will have on their ability to offer certain enabling and pathway courses. Student groups are fiercely opposed to increases in fees and changes to loan repayments.


It seems as though the only plan that the Turnbull government has for universities is to cut, cut, cut. It's simply in its DNA to cut education funding—for example, $17 billion in cuts to schools; $2.8 billion in cuts to TAFE, with a further cut of $637,000 in this year's budget; a $3.8 billion cut to Australian universities; and increases in fees and debts for students. The question is: why is this government so hell-bent on these cuts? It is because it wants to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business.


Labor governments are the only governments that will ever fight for a fair and properly funded education system. It is only Labor that has a history of delivering accessible and affordable education for all. Labor understands that governments are supposed to support universities to support students to support the jobs of the future. When Labor were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. Labor also opened the doors to our universities for an additional 190,000 Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to attend university. Why did Labor lift participation in universities? It was because Labor understands that education is the cornerstone to innovation and our economic future. We know that many of the jobs of the future will require a postschool qualification. That's why cutting funding to TAFE and universities is one of the worst decisions a government can make.


Many parents across Australia see a university education as a necessary opportunity to give their children the best career options. Tertiary education is not only the right of a privileged few. If we are to be a nation that is ready for the challenges, innovations and jobs of the future, we must invest in education. The Turnbull government is out of touch in creating a situation where students are required to pay even more for their education while the government gives corporations making millions of dollars a tax cut. The Parliamentary Budget Office is predicting that student fees will soar by 40 per cent as universities recover the costs as a result of the Turnbull government's planned 20 per cent government funding cut.


The Turnbull government must stop recycling former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's policies. Nobody wants the zombified Abbott policies—they were scary enough the first time! Education is a human right. It is not for the few who can afford it. Education is for everyone. In particular, aspiration and access should not be based on your earning capacity or your parents' credit card. In the words chanted by some of the many passionate university students, 'BS, come off it. Our education is not for profit.'

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:46):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. Higher education is very important. I know people of my ilk and many others benefited from the reforms that Gough Whitlam introduced, and many members who have contributed from this side of the House in this debate would have been the first from their families, as I was, to go to university.


The electorate I represent is very multicultural, as everybody knows, but it is not a rich electorate. Mums and dads there work pretty damn hard to make sure their kids get a good education. Education is one of the biggest things that ring true to those people in my community aspiring to create a better life for their families and their children.


The minister, in her second reading speech, boasted of the reforms as being fair, driving equality and excellence, and ensuring students have choice and opportunity. Maybe that was the speaking point she was given, because how does the government think they are convincing anyone that that can be possibly true? This bill aims to cut university funding by nearly $4 billion, hitting students with higher fees and saddling students with bigger debts that they have to pay back at a time they are probably trying to start a family and service a mortgage. The cuts will compromise teaching and learning, undermine research, and slash investment in universities at a time when the government should be investing in both universities and TAFE to guarantee that we as a country have a strong and productive future. Therefore, we on this side oppose the bill and we oppose it on good grounds.


This is an unfair piece of legislation. It does nothing but undermine the integral value of our tertiary education system, and it will act as an impediment for students and their respective futures. To put these cuts in some perspective, New South Wales institutions alone will lose $617.8 million over the next four years according to Universities Australia. That is $617 million out of various economies. New South Wales is fortunate to have a number of regionally based universities, so this will clearly impact on them. A good colleague, Professor Barney Glover, Vice-Chancellor and President of Western Sydney University, summed up the ramifications of these measures when he stated that these changes the government is proposing constitute a significant risk to the sustainability, quality and competitiveness of Australian universities.


These cuts will be delivered by the same people opposite who cut $17 billion from our schools and $637 million from our TAFE colleges, and now they want to do something very similar to our universities. Bear in mind—you only have to go back to 2013—this is the same group of people that said, 'Trust us; we will not cut education.' They also went on to say they would not cut a raft of other things, all of which they have done.


The government seek to justify this because they are committed to handing out $65 billion of tax cuts to millionaires and big business in this country. Just a piece of simple advice: if you can't cut your coat according to your cloth, don't start taking it off universities and don't start taking it off TAFE colleges, because we actually do need them for our future. We need them to develop our human resources for the future prosperity of this nation. So this cut is nothing other than bad, because what it will do is to enshrine a backward-looking approach to tertiary education in this country. As Professor Colin Stirling, Innovative Research Universities Chair and Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, said, 'How can we ask students to contribute more to get less in return?' That's a pretty good question, and it raises another.


When the minister said they consulted widely in bringing forward this piece of legislation, she didn't actually go on to say what the universities said. I would've thought that they were critical stakeholders, and these universities certainly aren't running to champion the minister's view. The government keeps proving that it can't be trusted when it comes to some of the most important investments in this country. Investing in our people must be paramount when it comes to determining the priorities of our investment strategies. As I said, the minister said that the government consulted widely, but she failed to say what anyone in the university sector said. But I don't have to advise you; I think everyone in this room knows that the overwhelming majority of vice-chancellors from Australian universities are opposed to this piece of legislation. Vicki Thomson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight universities, believes that the universities have now reached a 'tipping point', a view which she sums up in the following way:


… on top of the $3.9 billion in cuts we have suffered since 2011, our sector has surely done our fair share of the heavy lifting for Budget repair.


That's the issue with the $65 billion tax cut to big business. If you can't afford to give a tax cut to big business of that magnitude, don't. It's as simple as that. But don't think that you can pay for that tax cut by taking it off the future welfare and development of this country, by taking it off our students and those who produce our quality higher education sector.


When these cuts take place, don't forget: there are going to be many, many casualties out there, particularly in electorates like mine—people who just cannot afford to make the changes necessary to accommodate the financial impost that the government are imposing on people. This bill introduces a funding cut for universities through an efficiency dividend of 2.5 per cent on the university grants for 2018-19. Combined with that efficiency dividend, in the bill there is an increase in the student contribution amount of 7.5 per cent over four years. While 7.5 per cent of Commonwealth grants will be reserved for performance funding—and I have got to say that is a principle which our side actually supports—the approach of this government is nothing but punitive. Unlike what we were told by the minister, it doesn't seem that these could be in any way described as 'modest adjustments'. They are clearly an attempt by the government to shift the responsibility of the cost of higher education primarily to the institutions and students. This government is taking away 7.5 per cent of university funding, in addition to a 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend, which will effectively amount to a 10 per cent structural cut to higher education over the next two years. While Mr Turnbull might like to proclaim that he is all about fairness, a $3.8 billion cut to tertiary education, as proposed in this bill, certainly demonstrates that his priorities lie elsewhere. Universities Australia Chair Professor Margaret Gardner sums it up this way:


If 7.5% of each student's funding will not follow the student, but will flow depending on the minister's assessment of whether a university has met benchmarks determined on a changing set of education indicators, then this money cannot prudently be included in the budget.


In other words, there are no specific parameters which form the guidelines, so how could you actually include that as part of a budget scenario? It's clear that the government has gone about implementing the principle of performance based funding the wrong way. It's a policy that amounts to performance funding simply at ministerial discretion.


At the core of this bill is the extension of demand-driven funding to sub-bachelor places. This is a principle that the university sector and Labor in the past have also advocated, following the recommendation of the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education. The bill introduces, in three parts, demand-driven sub-bachelor places: students accessing sub-bachelor places must not hold a degree, the courses must meet industry needs, and the courses must articulate into undergraduate programs. While the concept of a sub-bachelor course is great for those looking for qualifications that fit outside traditional TAFE and university offerings, there is certainly a big concern in the TAFE sector that the sub-bachelor places could give universities an unfair advantage over the normal offerings of TAFE colleges. The government's proposed restrictions are not sufficient to protect TAFE or to support the integrated tertiary education system.


The bill also introduces measures that seek to introduce fees for enabling courses, lower repayment thresholds for HELP, shift New Zealanders and permanent residents from Commonwealth supported places to full-fee-paying places, and introduce a new allocation system for postgraduate Commonwealth supported places. 


These measures will no doubt have a significant impact in electorates like mine. They will affect those who are most disadvantaged in our society. Unlike what the name of this bill suggests, these measures do not support a sustainable, world-class higher education system that remains affordable and accessible to all who are eligible, regardless of background or circumstance. For instance, in my electorate of Fowler, which I have already described as not a wealthy electorate, Professor Barney Glover said this bill 'may have an unintended impost on, for example, mature aged students, Indigenous students, individuals with interrupted career paths or reduced employment due to child raising or other life events'.


A very interesting scenario was brought to my attention by a police officer in my local area command, which gives a law enforcement perspective to this. Crime Manager Detective Chief Inspector Darren Newman, from Cabramatta police area command, said he believes that this bill would have a devastating impact on my local community—that's the community that he serves. He believes this would be a massive blow to the aspirations of many young people, undermining the extensive work that police have put in communities such as mine. One of the issues that Darren Newman related to me, which is particularly relevant to those newer communities in the country—particularly those from either African or Islander nations who come here—is that the police work very hard with them. The whole idea is not to wait until a crime is committed but to work with the community, show them that there is opportunity and try to make young people more engaged not only with law enforcement but with the community generally. What Darren Newman said to me was that, where you can show a person who comes from another nation where education may not be valued to the same extent that it is in this country that they can achieve a university qualification and they can graduate with a degree, they can go on to do a range of different things. Where you can show that to their peers, there's a very strong argument that it's almost me-tooism for them: 'If they can do this, I can do this too'. And the police who serve my community say this is very significant, to be able to show all of these young people that they can justifiably have the expectation and aspiration to go to university. To simply make that more difficult, to simply take that away and make it less possible for them, creates a significant problem, as the police see it, in a community such as mine.


There's got to be a better way than doing this. On the one hand, they're simply trying to be the economic rationalists out there and trying to actually justify all this, while on the other hand they're trying to give away $65 billion to big business. If you can't afford to make such a donation to big business, don't do it. Maybe you'd do it at a time when you could afford to, but what they are doing here cuts across all those in a community such as mine. It's necessary for their aspirations, for their expectations of what they can actually do to grow in a country such as Australia. We need these young people. We need these people developing. This is the Whitlam strategy played out large.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (19:01):  It's an exciting time for the University of Newcastle.




Mr Butler:
  There has never been a more exciting time.




Mr CONROY:
  Absolutely. The new inner-city campus, NeW Space, has recently opened. The previous Labor government provided $30 million for the new campus, along with contributions from the state government and the university. The building is not only visually stunning; it's a tremendous enhancement to Newcastle's CBD and a proud legacy of the last Labor government and our commitment to the Hunter region. This significant funding commitment from the Labor Party is in stark contrast to the Liberal's approach to tertiary education. Indeed, the University of Newcastle will have its funding cut by a staggering $100 million if the government is able to pass its proposals contained in this legislation we are debating right now.


For the past four years, the government has been trying to shift our universities to a user-pays system that excludes poor and middle-class kids. Labor believes in tertiary education as a great enabler. The economic and social benefits of tertiary education speak for themselves. Access to tertiary education should not depend on the wealth of your parents or young people taking out very significant amounts of debt, and so at a time when the University of Newcastle is celebrating an important milestone, it is very disappointing to see the coalition renewing its attacks on this vital sector.


Before outlining what this bill proposes, I briefly want to draw to the attention of the House some shocking statistics about tertiary education in Australia. Of the world's richest countries, Australia has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities. This is a damning statistic. A nation whose economy has grown every year for over a quarter of a century should be leading with investment in universities and research. The government's proposals will only make our record worse. In relation to fees, Australian students already pay the sixth-highest fees amongst developed countries and, again, the government's proposal will make fees even higher.


The government is proposing the following in this bill: a 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend on university grants; increasing student fees by 7.5 per cent; making radical changes to HELP repayments; reducing the threshold when repayments start from $54,800 to $42,000—this is very serious at a time when wages growth is actually shrinking; making significant changes to enabling programs, which are so important for my Hunter region; and attacking New Zealand permanent residents and citizens, some of whom have lived nearly all their lives in Australia. In speaking on this legislation, I also want to bring to the attention of the House the powerful impact enabling programs have had in the Hunter and the fact that the government is cutting these programs.


The statement released from Universities Australia is a damning indictment on the government's proposal. It states:


There was unanimous opposition to the proposals to cut university funding and lift student fees.


It went on:


An overwhelming majority of Vice-Chancellors agreed they could not recommend that the Senate crossbench pass the legislative package.


This is clearly identifying what the government is doing: cutting funding and increasing fees. They are trying to make our education system further restricted to only the very well-off, just as they are trying to restrict our healthcare system to the wealthy in this country. In Australia, access to university should be based on ability, not on a student's ability or their parents' ability to pay for a degree.


I want to talk about the significant impact this bill will have on the University of Newcastle, my local university. The university, as I said, will be worse off to the tune of $100 million because of these cuts. These aren't Labor's figures. The vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle has confirmed this on the front page of the Newcastle Herald and has recently told a Senate inquiry:


This is really, really tough on universities … We've already contributed to the fiscal efficiencies of the government. You can't continue on that basis.


The University of Newcastle is an icon and a much-respected institution in the Hunter, Central Coast and northern New South Wales. It is a great promoter of economic and social justice. One quarter of students at the University of Newcastle are from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, and almost half are mature-aged students and students who are the first member of their family to attend university. It also has a very significant Indigenous student population—indeed, it ranks first out of Australia's 39 universities for Indigenous enrolments, and we are rightly proud of this. We trained the first Indigenous doctor in this country and we trained the first Indigenous surgeon in this country. Half of all Indigenous medical graduates in this country are produced by the University of Newcastle each year. We've got a great record in that particular area and we are rightly proud of it.


The university is also the largest and oldest provider of enabling programs in Australia, and so it will be particularly impacted by the brutal changes the government is proposing to enabling programs. The government is directly and intentionally limiting the ability of potential mature-aged students and young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds to access tertiary education. Again, this isn't just Labor rhetoric. It has been confirmed by the vice-chancellor, who recently told a Senate inquiry that changes to enabling programs could make it harder for Indigenous students and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds to access higher education. Twenty per cent of enrolments at the university had previously completed enabling courses. Intelligent and keen people who want to go to university and to make a contribution to our society should not be denied the opportunity to access a tertiary education.


My Labor colleagues and I will not tolerate this assault on enabling courses. Labor believes that people from modest backgrounds and people who have lost their jobs and are determined to get further education and training in order to re-enter workforce should be encouraged to seek a university qualification, not discouraged. Our belief is in stark contrast to that of the Liberals. The outcome of these proposed changes will make it harder to get into university, particularly for the many thousands of older Australians who are desperate to get a job, so Labor strongly opposes the changes to enabling courses. The proposal contained in this bill would introduce a fee on some of the most disadvantaged people in the higher education system.


A little more than 40 years ago, the University of Newcastle introduced a groundbreaking program. In 1974, Open Foundation was one of the first university enabling programs implemented specifically to allow people who missed out on matriculation for a variety of reasons a second chance to qualify academically for a place at university to study for a degree. The stories of Open Foundation's alumni are compelling. There are classics scholars like Leanne Glass, who was once a retail worker and who hadn't completed Year 12, and is now in the final stages of writing her PhD thesis. Daniel Frost suffered from a rare, debilitating bone disease that prevented him from completing his HSC, and he has recently graduated with a Bachelor of Business thanks to Open Foundation. Rhea Barnett entered the Open Foundation program as a 24-year-old with no more than a year 10 school certificate, and has recently spent time in Antarctica researching her science and physics honours thesis.


Very famously, Murray Lee, who is now a professor of criminology at the University of Sydney, when he left Belmont High School at age 15 was told he could be a boilermaker or a sign writer. Those were the options he was restricted to under that system, but after working as an electrical tradesman, he completed the Open Foundation course and was able to complete a degree. Professor Lee is of the view that these reforms will fundamentally harm the enabling program and has stated:


Giving people the chance at a career by keeping enabling courses free has got to be a win/win for the individual, and the community.


Labor could not agree more.


Taylah Gray is in the second year of her law degree. She's angry at the government's proposals, which will affect the University of Newcastle's Yapug program, along with Open Foundation and Newstep. Taylah has said:


These programs are free to give people who might have struggled in school or in their lives a chance to try. What is proposed will put up obstacles for people whose lives have been about obstacles.


This is a very sharp and eloquent analysis of the government's plans. Taylah believes people should be given a chance. Labor believes this as well. This proud tradition, and similar programs such as Newstep for younger students at the University of Newcastle, is under very real threat because of the proposals of the Turnbull government.


I want to be very clear on this proposal. The government is targeting enabling courses, which some of the most disadvantaged students in the sector access. This will have an enormously negative impact in the region that I represent and will result in fewer people in the Hunter region having a tertiary education. The change is socially unjust and economically irresponsible, and Labor condemns the government for deliberately targeting people who are trying to get a tertiary education to allow them a better chance of getting a job and making an important contribution to our community and the country.


I now want to discuss the government's changes to HELP repayments. The philosophy behind HELP is that those who finish a degree should only be required to start paying back the loan once they are earning a decent wage. Australians are proud that we are the land of the fair go, and the HELP system is a fundamentally fair system. However, the Liberals want to reduce the HELP repayment threshold from $54,869 to $42,000. This is a very significant reduction, particularly in an economic environment where wages growth is actually negative. The latest HILDA report showed that wages have stopped growing and that since 2012 they have actually declined. Another key fact is that university graduates are getting paid less than in previous years. It is not appropriate, given the current wage environment, to be making these unfair changes and further deterring young and old alike from university. In fact, lowering the threshold to $42,000 means that a university graduate who is unable to find employment in their chosen profession and is instead continuing a full-time job, say, as a baker at Coles or Woolies would actually have to start paying back the cost of their degree. In fact, when you combine it with the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge, which, disgracefully, this government is applying to everyone who earns more than $19,000, it means that people who earn more than $42,000, up to $54,000 in certain scenarios, actually have an effective marginal tax rate of over 100 per cent. Let me repeat that: because of these regressive changes, workers below the average income—some of them below the median income—will have an effective marginal tax rate of over 100 per cent. They will pay more in tax for each dollar spent than they receive. That is a disgrace, it is deeply regressive and it needs to be opposed.


The British Poet Laureate John Masefield once said: 'There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university.' While this sentiment is lovely, universities are far more than this. They are fundamentally important for our economy and our society. The role of the federal government in supporting and investing in tertiary education is essential. There are two clear distinctions between the major parties on this issue. The Liberals want to cut funding to universities and make tertiary education the domain of the privileged. Labor, the party of education, will always support our tertiary sector and ensure widespread and equitable access to universities. The statistics prove this. International studies have shown that mature aged students and those who are entering through a non-conventional pathway are most easily deterred by higher debt levels and greater repayments. They often have fewer years in the workplace to repay that debt. So anything that increases the debt on them or makes them pay that debt back faster is a deterrent to mature aged students retraining and to those who haven't been able to finish year 12. This is a deeply regressive move. When you combine it with the attacks on the enabling courses, I can only conclude that this government is intent on closing the door to tertiary education for working-class and middle-class families—and that's a disgrace. Not only is it an attack on those people, on those Australians, and limiting their potential, but it is actually a deeply illogical move economically because we need every Australian to fulfil their potential. We need every Australian to fulfil their productive potential, to get the best training possible, so that they can make an active contribution to this economy. The policy contained in this bill counteracts that and closes the door on those people. 


When you think about the fabric of this society, with income inequality at a 75-year high, why are we preventing working-class people from getting a good education? Why would we be saying to them, 'You can't fulfil both your potential to contribute to a great society and to earn a wage'? Why are we doing this in a period of high inequality when wages are going backwards? This is a sign, yet again, of a government that is out of touch, a government that has no concern for the vast majority of Australians and a government that says: 'Well, I made it. I might have had wealthy parents, but I made it, so everyone else can.' This is a deeply regressive move. It is a move symbolic of a party stuck not in the 20th century but in the 19th century, where, unless you are part of the squattocracy or you happen to be born into a wealthy family, we don't care about you and we don't care about your future. The vast majority of Australians disagree with that. The vast majority of Australians support a well-resourced and fair tertiary sector. History will condemn this as yet another regressive move from a regressive and reactionary government that, quite frankly, does not care about the vast majority of Australians.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (19:16):  Labor is rightly opposing this bill. We oppose this bill because it is profoundly unfair to young people, especially those from disadvantaged or middle-class backgrounds. This bill will make it even harder for young people from everyday backgrounds to climb the ladder of opportunity through education. 


When I doorknocked over 13,000 houses in the lead-up to the election, people told me that education was the single most important thing. Everyone said it: young people, parents and grandparents but most especially migrants, who come to this country to seek a better life with a laser-like focus on education being the key to a better life for their kids. But, rather than helping young people to fulfil their potential to climb that ladder of life and opportunity and secure a better future, unless they are lucky enough to be from a very wealthy family, this bill will weigh young people down with a lifetime of debt accrued through higher fees as they struggle to climb just a rung or two while being expected to repay these higher debts even earlier. 


As has been said, Australian students already pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. This bill jacks them up by another 7½ per cent. Repaying debts when you earn $42,000 will make it harder—for many people, impossible—to buy a house or provide for a family. I've heard those opposite prattle on with, 'Oh, it's only 10 bucks a week here and 20 bucks there,' and, 'What's another 50 bucks?' The point is that it's in the wrong direction. It makes it more unfair and more unequal, and it is the wrong way to go, especially with stagnating wages, poor graduate employment outcomes and spiralling house prices fuelled by regressive tax concessions. 


We oppose this bill because it will worsen inequality in this country—although the Treasurer says that's not a real thing. LOL! The Bill's Digest states clearly that, when compared to the existing arrangements, the new proposal has a disproportionate impact on lower-income earners. It's a particular problem when you consider it against the backdrop of the broader Liberal budget as a whole. Lower repayment thresholds plus tax rises like the Medicare levy and changes to other transfer payments will mean that some Australians will face effective marginal tax rates of 100 per cent. Using one example, Australians with a HELP debt who earn $51,000—most of whom are women—will have less disposable income than someone earning $32,000 when you take it all into account. This may sound fanciful for out-of-touch Liberal members, but the average graduate salary in Australia is under $55,000. Good luck with saving for a house, repaying a uni debt, saving for or paying off a car, paying rent, paying utilities, paying for food and paying for electricity. God help you if you start a family on that income, and you better hope you don't get sick. What on earth have young people done to deserve this? 


If we as a nation want to ensure that Australia really is the land of the fair go, we need to do more to address all forms of inequality, especially those that are entrenched or intergenerational in nature. Education is the best tool governments have to encourage social mobility. People in my electorate get this. We oppose this bill because it sells out our country's future and takes us in the wrong direction.


In considering these proposals, everyone in this House must have it fixed in their mind just how critical higher education is to Australia's future successes. This is not the kind of thing we're supposed to say, but Australia's best years are not necessarily in front of us. I'm optimistic that they can be, but it's not certain they will be. We are at risk now—and the signs are not good—of being the first generation in modern Australia to leave a worse standard of living for the next generation. That is shameful. It doesn't have to be that way, but it depends on the choices we make today. That is why I and other Labor members feel so strongly that this bill takes our country and our society in the wrong direction. It doesn't just hit student fees; it also locks in large and ongoing cuts to universities.


Education, as has been said, is a critical enabler of our future economic prosperity and security. Modelling by Deloitte shows that university education added an estimated $140 billion to Australia's GDP in 2014 alone. Our region of the world is the fastest growing. This century holds enormous opportunities, but the world does not owe us a living. We can choose to innovate and compete, or we will get left behind. Australia now has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities of any country in the OECD. While our neighbours and competitors and partners in Asia are investing more in education research and creating wealth from that knowledge, our government spends time thinking up new ways to cut school funding, cut universities, threaten research funding, raise fees, burden young people with a lifetime of debt and slug disadvantaged Australians a fee of $3,223 for bridging courses that don't even give them a qualification. That's a real little gem. Nice one, government; well done! These enabling courses are run by some universities to help some of the most disadvantaged students in the country just to have a crack at getting into uni. There are currently no fees. Yet this bill proposes to charge fees, which is particularly harsh for students from a disadvantaged background. They don't get a formal qualification. There is no stakeholder support. It is a brain fart of the minister.


Australia needs an equitable higher education system if our best future is to be realised. Our smartest and brightest minds get the same access to learning opportunities. That's the goal, and we don't deter or punish young people from poor families. This access must not be conditional on the postcode you were born in, the school you went to or your parents' capacity to pay for a house. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order! Member for Bruce, will you withdraw that.




Mr HILL:
  I withdraw 'brain fart'. Is that the bit you meant?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes.




Mr HILL:
  Sorry, I wasn't sure if that is what you meant.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Just withdraw it without qualification.




Mr HILL:
  I withdraw it without qualification. That is why we oppose this bill and hope it dies in the Senate or wherever in the parliament the government sends this kind of rubbish to rot.


I want to make a few remarks about HELP debt levels and repayment. The government is concerned about growth in unpaid student debt. Overall, student debts are increasing significantly due to the growth of higher education, the government's own higher fees, extension of HELP to non-Commonwealth-supported places and so on. Over four years, we now have 2.5 million students—up from 1.7 million students—holding a debt. The amount of debt has gone up from $25 billion to about $49 billion. On current estimates, 23 per cent of those students are not expected to repay anything at all. Unpaid debt is largely with people who haven't earned above the income threshold long enough, and the debt is written off at their death.


On pages 8 to 10 of the Bills Digest is an interesting discussion on the options around this issue. One option is to just accept that this is part of the scheme—an equity measure, if you like—and a percentage won't be repaid. You can take the government's premise that we need to recoup more of this debt—fair enough, that's an argument. But there are two broad arguments. You can do what the government wants to do—lower repayment thresholds to, in effect, push young people into a poverty trap, which is the option the government has chosen—or you could take the interesting but politically much more difficult option of exploring requirements to recoup debts from certain estates.


The Bills Digest notes that many people who die without repaying debts are actually from very wealthy households with wealthy estates. The family arrangements are such that they have never declared enough income to repay their full debt, but they may pass away with significant wealth, whether through superannuation, housing or other assets. This is politically difficult because, if anyone suggests that, the other side may say, 'Oh, it's a death tax, it's a death tax!' which is clearly nonsense. There is a case to look more closely at this. The Bills Digest notes analysis that requiring HELP debts to be repaid, just like tax or social security debts, from estates over $100,000 in value would save $2.83 billion over three years.


Obviously, you'd need to craft such a policy carefully. I think most people would think a higher threshold would be reasonable, as well as appropriate exemptions or delayed payment provisions to protect people like families where a parent dies young or for people with surviving partners and cash flow issues. I understand this is not my party's policy and it's not the government's policy. It was in the discussion paper, to their credit, but there does seem to be a policy case to look at this option further. If difficult choices have to be made, that kind of approach is far less regressive and far less unfair to young people than the government's policy.


In terms of the impact on universities: at a time when Australia should be investing in our universities, this bill would enshrine $3.8 billion of bottom-line cuts. Teaching, student programs, research and university facilities will suffer. You have to admit that the minister is doing his best to earn himself an honorary degree from university in media manipulation and spin. He's all over the shop suggesting to people, 'Oh, this is just a temporary efficiency dividend. There's nothing to worry about. It's just a couple of years. It's just the universities doing their bit for fiscal consolidation and a bit of budget savings. Nothing to see here. Oh, look over there, let's pick on some migrants. Let's have a quiz about other people's relationships. Let's beat up on vulnerable people who rely on welfare to eat and live—that's a good idea. That'll distract everyone while we hack away at education, won't it?'


There are two main measures that comprise the cut when you stop being distracted and look at this bill. Firstly, the efficiency dividend is 2½ per cent in 2018 and again in 2019. From that the universities suffer a direct cut of $384 million in just two years. Monash University, on the border of my electorate—my old university—suffers the largest cut of any Australian university of $104 million over the forward estimates. I don't see the member for Chisholm listed to speak on this. I would suspect she is far too ashamed, given that it's technically in her electorate.


The minister pretends this is a one-off, but it is effectively a great, big, locked-in permanent cut, because when funding eventually gets reindexed it's from the level after the cut. You can't pretend this won't have an effect on teaching quality, and the resultant cuts will damage Australia's research effort. Higher education in Australia is a little bit weird by the world's standards. It's an accepted part of our system that there is a cross subsidy and that you make a bit of a profit off teaching students to fund your research, which is what keeps you in the rankings. That's bad enough, but a further 7.5 per cent is then taken out for performance funding.


We support the principle of performance funding, indeed, we proposed it, but the government is going about it the wrong way. Ripping another 7.5 per cent off universities for a yet-to-be-determined performance-based funding pool is, in prudent budgeting terms, a further cut because there is no detail in the legislation or from the government about how this scheme will operate.


I will quote Monash University Vice-Chancellor Professor, Margaret Gardner, who said:


A university budgets principally on the basis of the number of students enrolled and the average amount of money each student will bring…If 7.5% of each student's funding will not follow the student, but will flow depending on the minister's assessment of whether a university has met benchmarks determined on a changing set of education indicators, then this money cannot prudently be included in the budget.


Universities Australia has said the policy amounted to performance funding at ministerial discretion without any clarity as to the problem to be solved. All this means is that in prudent budgeting terms universities will have to plan for a 10 per cent cut in 2018 and a 10 per cent cut in 2019. We will not write a blank cheque which will force this 10 per cent cut and so future ministers can do what they want or cut that funding completely.


Finally, with regard to the extension of CSP to sub-bachelor courses: I understand this has been supported in principle for years, since the Bradley review in 2008, but that is almost 10 years ago. I have serious concerns about this measure and its impact on TAFE. There's no detail from the government. The landscape has changed a lot in this area. TAFE is under enormous pressure. You've got changes to the VET FEE-HELP loans, which have capped loans and fees. This measure has the potential to seriously erode TAFE revenues further, to make the provision of critical, high-quality TAFE unviable in more areas and to confuse students.


I note that while universities would be given access to CSPs for sub-bachelor places, TAFE does not have access to CSPs for higher education. Personally, I think this move is premature and that it's dangerous to support it at this time. Time doesn't permit me to go into the plans to sneak in massive changes to how postgraduate places are allocated, or the wedge for privatisation, the little gem in there that some other body may allocate these scholarships or the anti-New Zealander, anti-migrant measures. But suffice it to say that there are a lot of very good reasons for why this bill should be opposed. There are a few sensible things in there, and the government could well pull them out and put them in another bit of legislation that we would support and wave through tomorrow, while these other things go to die, as zombies, as they should.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:21):  I rise to my feet to speak on this bill with great joy and gusto. I'm so pleased that the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills is here to be part of this debate. I want to welcome the students from Narromine Christian School in the gallery up there. I'm not quite sure about the school behind me, but the young students up there are our future and education is all about them.


They could be—if they've been sitting in here listening to the matter of public importance—forgiven for thinking all sorts of things about where we stand as legislators on this issue. But before I embark on a detailed examination of the bill before us, I think it's important that we also look at a little bit of history. The Turnbull government has taken responsible measures to try to end the rorts of the VET FEE-HELP scheme that saw such a debacle from those opposite when they were in government. Let me just give you a few statistics, Mr Deputy Speaker: between 2009 and 2016 the number of students accessing the VET FEE-HELP jumped 3,600 per cent, from 5,229 to 193,868. Now, you might think, 'Well, is that such a bad thing?' If you look at it overall, average course costs in that time nearly tripled from $4,000 to $11,300. Loans increased by nearly 6,000 per cent, from $25 million to $1.5 billion.


I say to the young students up there from Narromine Christian School that whilst those opposite have an absolute predisposition to ensuring that all young people should go to university I'm going to take a different tack with you right here and right now, because I'm one who'll stand here and actually say that I don't think all students should go to university. I come from a trade background. I did my carpentry and joinery apprenticeship at Holmesglen College of TAFE and I'm proud of it. I worked as a builder for 10 years, and I'm proud of it. I then went back and did a law degree at uni, and some might say it has all been going downhill from there!




Mr Dreyfus:
  Why aren't you proud of that?




Mr WALLACE:
  Well, some might say it's all going downhill from there. But, I want to encourage the young people from Narromine Christian School and from all schools across the country. You don't have to go to university if you don't want to. If you want to go to university, great, knock your socks off, but you don't have to go to university. The Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills is doing a fantastic job in trying to promote young people into trades. Whether you want to be a bricklayer or a carpenter or a plasterer or a butcher or a baker, there are plenty of other jobs, meaningful employment, available in Australia. To be quite honest with you, you might earn more money as a carpenter or a plasterer or a brickie than you would if you did a business degree. So, whatever you do, challenge your teachers, your vocational instructors and your guidance counsellors. Find out more about what it's like to be a tradesman or a tradeswoman, because that is an equally important path in our lives. If anybody tells you otherwise, you should challenge them on that.


Back to the bill: this bill is all about making university education in Australia the great system that it is and improving upon the great system that it is. It's more important than ever to protect the future of a system which currently supports 1.4 million students and has 16 Australian universities in the top 300 of world university rankings in 2017 and 2018.


As the member for Fisher, I have one of the newest universities in Australia in my electorate, and that is the University of the Sunshine Coast. It is a fantastic university that's only been going for a little less than 20 years, but in that 20 years it has seen its graduates list almost 20,000 in number. It is a university that I am very proud of because it engages with its local community.


This government is focused on encouraging quality and excellence in Australian higher education and ensuring that students have the support they need to succeed, while also making sure that the system is sustainable for future generations so students yet to come have the sorts of opportunities that this and other generations have had. The Higher Education Reform Package has been developed after substantial consultation and discussion with a broad range of stakeholders and focuses on three key themes: improving the sustainability of higher education, providing more choices for students and increasing transparency and accountability. This government will continue to support the best features of the current higher education system, underpinning a vibrant education export industry, supporting student career aspirations and ensuring that industry has a skilled workforce.


The reforms proposed by the government are fair. They drive quality and excellence and focus on ensuring that Australians who want to study have the right support and the right opportunities. A key challenge is how to make the system sustainable for future generations of students. Since 2009, taxpayer funding for teaching and learning has increased by 71 per cent, twice the growth rate of the economy as a whole. The current funding arrangements are not sustainable, and reform is needed if future generations like those up in the Narromine Christian School are to take advantage of higher education—a world-class higher education—into the future.


A key element of the higher education system is the Higher Education Loan Program, which supports universal, merit based access to higher education in Australia and is one of the most generous student loan schemes in the world. Those opposite would have you believe that the government is attacking that. We are not attacking that at all. We want to ensure that, no matter whether you come from a wealthy family or a non-wealthy family, if you have the ability, the skill, the interest, the talent and the desire to go to university, you have every opportunity, as much as anyone else.


However, the HELP repayments—that is, the Higher Education Loan Program repayments—have not kept pace with the HELP lending growth rate. Due to the income-contingent nature of HELP, debtors do not start making compulsory repayments until their income is above the minimum repayment threshold, currently in 2017-18, set at $55,874. Since 2009, the fair value of student loans has increased from $12.5 billion to $36.8 billion and is expected to increase further to $59.7 billion by 2019-20. The total outstanding student debt underwritten by taxpayers now stands at $50 billion, with a quarter of that not expected to be repaid. 


The Commonwealth supported places which provide places for university students are subsidised by the Australian government so that students are only required to pay a student contribution amount for each unit that they're enrolled in. Universities and other higher education providers set their own student contribution amounts within limits set by the Australian government. It's necessary with increasing enrolments and budget pressures to increase the maximum contribution each student can be asked to make. These reforms will rebalance the contributions made by taxpayers and students to the cost of higher education. After the changes have been implemented, the taxpayer will remain the majority funder of higher education by 2021, providing on average 54 per cent of base funding for the costs of teaching and learning.


The Deloitte cost-of-delivery report undertaken in 2016 showed that universities spent 85 per cent of their total funds for bachelor level courses on teaching and learning in 2015, compared to the 2011 base funding review which found that 94 per cent of base funding for bachelor level courses was spent on teaching and learning. These findings suggest it is reasonable to expect some of these efficiencies should be shared with the government. Effectively, costs per student for teaching and learning have increased by 9.5 per cent since 2010, while revenue per student has risen by 15 per cent over that time. This efficiency dividend equates on average to 2.8 per cent of base funding for teaching and research. When last in government, Labor proposed its own efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent, but you don't hear anything at all about that from the other side. Then Prime Minister Julia Gillard said on 16 April 2013: 


… the number of places has grown, but funding has also gone up per student place.


Money to universities is still going to grow. We've got universities on a growth path.


What we are asking them to do is for one year to accept a two per cent efficiency dividend, and in the second year a 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend.


That means their money would still grow, it just wouldn't grow as fast as they'd obviously wanted …


Once again, you don't hear any of that from the other side. In opposition, Labor is playing politics. I'm sure that won't come as a surprise to anybody who's been around this place long enough. And they are using delaying tactics when they well know what we are proposing is fair, reasonable and necessary. 


HELP is here to stay. The Australian government remains committed to a system of higher education that is affordable for individuals but it must be affordable for the country. Australia has one of the most generous student loan schemes in the world. The Higher Education Loans Program is one that will see young people go to university and pay no up-front fees. We will keep that loan system in place. There will be no up-front student fees. The system of student loans will be protected. Students will only have to pay their loans back when they are earning a high enough income. No eligible domestic student has to pay up-front fees, because they are able to borrow from the government to meet their share of the cost of study. No real rate of interest is charged on their loan. The government effectively absorbs this cost. 


Australia's HELP scheme, which provides assistance for young people and old people to get into university to improve their education, is the envy of the world. It means that anyone who has the ability and motivation to participate in higher education is not prevented from doing so because of the need to pay their tuition fees up-front. We will improve the sustainability of the HELP scheme by introducing new HELP repayment thresholds and rates for all current and future HELP debtors from 1 July 2018. The proposal to index HELP repayment thresholds at CPI will maintain the value of thresholds in real terms, as the thresholds will increase in line with the cost of living, rather than wages. With average weekly earnings typically being higher than CPI, indexation by CPI will slow the growth of repayment thresholds and ensure they remain appropriate when compared to an individual's capacity to repay.


I'll finish off by saying that this government is absolutely 100 per cent committed to providing an effective, world-class higher education university scheme for all Australians, no matter what their socioeconomic background is. (Time expired)

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:36):  I rise in support of Labor's position on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. I represent a community of hardworking people. Traditionally, we have been the tradies, the labourers, the administrators and the retail staffers. We now live in a time when those jobs are changing, and as those jobs change so too does the way in which we educate—especially for people in any community.


It's one year ago today since I got to stand here and address the federal parliament with my first speech. One of the things that led me here was a comment made by a Liberal predecessor of mine as member for Lindsay, former MP Jackie Kelly, who famously declared Western Sydney did not need a university, because we were in pram city. So outraged at her comments was I, as a 20-year-old, that I wrote a letter to my local newspaper about my disgust for such comments. I'm pretty sure this was my first interaction on my political activism journey. The future of work is changing: the jobs are changing and our workforce needs to change. I'm so glad that Kelly's comments were not heeded and that, instead, we have Western Sydney University right in my backyard. It is a university whose alumni I belong to, in fact, along with my mum, who was the first in her family to study and studied as a mature single mum of two kids. This provided me with a great desire to go on to university, and I followed there a few years later.


This isn't a unique story across my community. Sixty per cent of the students who attend Western Sydney University are the first in their families to attend university, and that is a staggeringly high figure. Twenty per cent of the students are considered low-socioeconomic status, and 37 per cent of those students speak a language other than English at home. These statistics indicate the transition my community faces from the traditional jobs we have had and the ones we will need to be prepared for in the future. The changes that the government seeks to make in this bill will diabolically affect my community and my university. In fact, the cuts this lousy bloke who calls himself the Prime Minister wants to make are the second-highest in this country. Western Sydney University will lose more than $98 million in funding over the next four years. This is the highest amount of money being taken out of any university in New South Wales.


For 25 years, Western Sydney University has been at the forefront of addressing the educational inequity facing our community. In Western Sydney, 16.5 per cent of under-34-year-olds have a tertiary qualification, while greater Sydney enjoys a level of almost 25 per cent for the same age bracket. These figures are important. They help businesses to decide where to locate, to know whether the population will be able to support their company with adequately qualified and trained staff. Why on earth would Turnbull support anything that jeopardises the access to university for anybody in Western Sydney? Does he think so little of the people that I represent in Western Sydney that he would callously allow these cuts to take place? Does he think so little of our community and that we're all just a bunch of high-vis-vest-wearing workers who are not capable of university-level study? You only need to look at his actions. He skulked into Western Sydney—I know, right? I'm surprised he even knew the way. He didn't come by public transport, though, to give his press conference—which is a shame, after his famous electioneering train-rides not so long ago, because, if he had, he might've learnt that, where he was headed to, there is actually no train. He went to Erskine Park, he got out there, and he said to the press that he promised plenty of jobs for locals and that we should all live where it takes 30 minutes to get from home to work, to education and to recreational facilities. I mean, really! Thirty minutes! Did he drive, from Erskine Park, 30 minutes in any direction? He might've tried, but I can guarantee he wouldn't have got very far. He made this announcement at TNT, a freight and logistics depot. We know that, on average, one of those warehouses has five jobs for every hectare of land, like this warehouse takes up. Again, it exemplifies my point that the Prime Minister thinks Western Sydney is a community of high-vis-vest-wearing jobs. I have no argument or issue with people working in those fields whatsoever.


But back to his catch-cry of the 30-minute city and being within 30 minutes of educational opportunities: how is that going for the Prime Minister? They just cut $23 million from Lindsay's schools, and now they want to come after our university for $98 million. Apprenticeships have dropped 37 per cent in my area. If you gut Western Sydney uni and it has to continue cutting programs and services, where is our next university within 30 minutes, I ask you, Deputy Speaker? I know it sounds old-fashioned, but someone needs to hand this bloke a map. Across Western Sydney we have campuses located in the south, the north and the west. And I say to the Prime Minister: enough is enough. End the war on Western Sydney. Stop treating my community like we don't matter and start valuing the contributions that come from the educated workforce that Western Sydney can and will happily provide.


Fundamental to making Western Sydney strong is supporting its university and addressing the gaps our area suffers from. The measures announced in this bill will do nothing to support this. The cuts this government proposes for Western Sydney uni will hurt the students out there already doing it tough. The cuts mean that funding for the critical outreach programs which support coming into university from various pathways will go. The cuts put a handbrake on the school engagement program encouraging young students to get into higher education. And the cuts mean that industry-led partner programs will be gone. Obviously, this Turnbull government believes that educational equity gaps should remain.


Disturbingly, these cuts affect jobs, job creation and the critical support required for start-ups and for ideas. Western Sydney University supports 150 Sydney start-ups and small-to-medium enterprises, through its Launch Pad incubator. Some I have been lucky enough to meet—like Stephen Brinks, from 3DBrink, a very successful start-up. Stephen was designing and building 3D printers in his Werrington garage. He had the opportunity to move into the Launch Pad and has grown his business. Now he has the opportunity to give back, and he collaborates with students. Why would the Prime Minister want to see this facility cut, after he famously visited there and referred to it as 'essential'? Now it will be cut to the bone and will be unable to support the start-ups and small businesses in Western Sydney.


On top of these cuts, this Turnbull government will put an end to Western Sydney uni's ability to partner with industry and government in proven job-creation programs. Just one example of this co-investment that the university undertook with the former Labor federal government was the $30 million investment in the Werrington business park. This investment saw 400 high-value jobs come into Penrith. It forges vital links between industry, researchers and students. Great opportunities were delivered to people in my community. But now all we see is Mr Turnbull's 'opportunities'. Well, I have news for him: we don't need your opportunities. We have had to look after ourselves because you cannot be trusted. People in Western Sydney have created their own opportunities, and they know that Labor will support them. Labor will support their jobs, support their pay and conditions, and support investment in the services they need, like universities. But those opposite only see a life of privilege and not one of opportunities being shared.


Opportunities come from investment, not trickle-down tax breaks afforded to big businesses. All these tax breaks—to ensure big businesses and millionaires can enjoy the cosy spoils. The government has decided to destroy any opportunities for students and institutions, especially in Western Sydney. And, for the people in my community, it is absolute proof that we have a federal government devoid of any heart. It isn't a cliche. The Turnbull government is hell-bent on handing out degrees in hard knocks.


Imagine for a moment—close your eyes—that we were here discussing investing $65 billion into our education system, not giving $65 billion in tax breaks to big business. Just let that sink in. Let's have a discussion about that. Imagine how that would trickle down through our nation. Imagine that investment trickling down through every single student across Western Sydney. I would love to have and I would absolutely welcome having that discussion, but we are not having it.


The Turnbull government has decided we should not be the clever country anymore and has decided to dumb us down in the most horrible of ways. This government is creating chaos in my community. We need apprenticeships; we need jobs that keep our graduates in the area where they live; and we need to invest in our education system, not take money from it. The government has gutted funding at all levels of education. You name it; it's on the chopping block. The Turnbull government has already ripped off public education and cut $17 billion from schools, $23 million of which came from my electorate alone. Now the Prime Minister wants to deliver more cuts and raid the pockets of students, with nearly $4 billion of cuts to universities, higher fees for students and bigger debts for students that they will have to repay much sooner.


What does all of this add up to? It adds up to a compromise on teaching, learning and research. But, more importantly, it adds up to dumbing down and the taking away of opportunities. The Turnbull government wants the students of Australia to fix its own broken budget promises. And how are students going to fix them? They're going to start paying back their student loans not at $54,000 but at $42,000. And, for good measure, the government is going to ensure your student fees are higher and universities are restricted in investing in infrastructure, as the Turnbull government steals surpluses that were for future building.


What great opportunities and lessons this government is providing to students! Members opposite are providing some genuine life lessons right up-front. Well, I'm voting to keep Australia clever, even though we have a ridiculously stupid government—and the experts out there know, and they agree with me too. Again we see a bunch of ill-informed MPs coming in here, trampling over decades and decades of research and ignoring it in favour of cuts instead. Take the Innovative Research Universities, which said:


The Australian Government investment in Universities is low by international standards while our students are already paying some of the highest fees in the world for public university education …


Universities Australia said:


Students and graduates will be carrying higher levels of debt into an increasingly uncertain future …


And the Group of Eight said:


We have … reached a tipping point. It remains the fact that we receive less than half of our university funding from Government and this has forced us to be heavily reliant on alternative sources of income to fund the nation building research we must undertake.


At a time when we need investment in the jobs of the future and to be competitive in a global jobs market, we find the Turnbull government throwing lead into the saddles of students, who quite frankly were finding it tough to survive already.


Meanwhile, across the road, across the seas, in Asia, right on our doorstep, they're investing in universities. That's right. I know it seems a bit of an anomaly compared to what this parliament wants to do. Their governments are investing in universities. This was highlighted last week by Universities Australia, which said:


Smart nations understand that public funding in universities is an investment—


an investment, Deputy Speaker—


in long-term national prosperity.


It continued:


It's clear that China is becoming a increasingly strong competitor – which the rankings analysts attribute to its 'high and sustained levels of state funding'. Indeed, China is building the equivalent of almost a new university every week.


And that should be a reflection to those opposite about what we're doing to universities in this country right now.


What a morally bankrupt government we have when it comes to education. I'm waiting to hear them all fall over themselves and come in here and support these cuts. The government are pretty lousy because all they could muster up was less than half-a-dozen government members willing to come in here and spruik their cuts to higher education. I don't blame them, because it is a drastically, diabolically terrible decision.


Western Sydney University is a success story. Why is the Turnbull government stripping it back to its bare bones, leaving Western Sydney with the crumbs yet again? The Prime Minister keeps coming up with three-word slogans like 'an ideas boom'. Well, Prime Minister, it is hard to have an ideas boom when you keep having brain explosions like this one. Can you imagine Mr Turnbull sitting on his balcony at Point Piper penning his little quips, the glare of the sun in his eyes and the rays beaming up from the harbour and all of those yachts? Perhaps Mr Turnbull might like to sit in Western Sydney's peak-hour traffic on the M4 and see if he can get from Erskine Park to Penrith in 30 minutes. I can guarantee he can't.


Western Sydney University is important because educational inequity is a real issue happening right now. A $65 billion tax break to big business with no evidence of payback to the community isn't innovation. Tax handouts to wealthy businesses on the backs of every single student cohort across this country are nothing more than trickle-down idiocy. No jobs, no investment; just dividends to the big end of town. And, if you are in Western Sydney and want to get ahead, this government is happy to stand on you, put you down, confine you to a hi-vis vest and tell you that you do not deserve the same access and same equity of access to anything. We have no equity of access to education, transport or jobs. I am happy to come in here day after day and remind this government of how poorly they are treating Western Sydney. When the next election campaign comes along and Mr Abbott or Mr Turnbull—or whoever is the Prime Minister potentially—come into my electorate, sit in my football stadium, say no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions and no cuts to the ABC and tell this country they have a unity ticket on education, it is the people that I represent who will be the most dudded by this awful, awful government.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (16:50):  There was a time when every galah in the coalition pet shop was talking about the importance of being innovative and nimble. They were talking about the importance of Australia being a clever country and about us projecting ourselves into the economy of the 21st century. Those very same coalition MPs are shortly going to file into this chamber and vote in favour of this bill which does the exact opposite of everything they have been talking about for the last two years. I am, of course, talking about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017, which slashes funding for universities throughout this country to the tune of $3.8 billion. The minister at the table opposite has attempted to tell members of parliament that this is some radical reversal of the Abbott government's fateful 2014 budget, where they attempted to do a complete backflip on the promises they took to the 2013 election. Far from it being a radical reversal of the Abbott policies, this is the Abbott policies in a new guise. 


Let's have a look at the cuts that this bill introduces on a state-by-state basis. Here in Canberra, it is $52.5 million. In my home state of New South Wales, it is $617 million. In the Northern Territory, a place that needs us to be supporting their TAFE and their higher education, they are suffering a cut of $15 million. In Queensland, it is over $400 million. In South Australia, it is $150 million. The list goes on and on and on. There are cuts to funding and to universities in each and every state. In my own university, the University of Wollongong—a fine institution which I will talk a bit more about shortly—there are $45.7 million in cuts as a result of this legislation. I'm imploring those members opposite: don't do what your leader is attempting to convince you to do. Vote in favour of the university students you represent in your electorates, and vote in favour of regional universities because they need your support today more than ever. 


It's time we had a conversation with the Prime Minister about inequality. Every time we raise this he calls us communists. He thinks there's some sort of socialist plot going on. But we need to have a conversation about it. Where we stand today, the richest 10 per cent of Australians own 45 per cent of all wealth. That is 70 times the wealth of the lowest-income brackets. If you compare the amount of money they make year on year, it is a massive seven times the income they earn each year. We have to have a conversation about inequality. If you're in that top 20 per cent of income earners, the chances are that you live in one of our capital cities. If you're in the bottom 20 per cent, the chances are that you're living in regional or remote Australia. Against this background, why is the government and, certainly, any National Party or regional Liberal member, coming in here and proposing to support this bill?


Did you know that in regional Australia we have 13 per cent fewer school leavers participating in higher education than the Australian average? We all know on this side of the House that higher education is the pathway to a higher income and a successful life. But, if we have 13 per cent fewer people in regional Australia participating in higher education, we are reducing the chances of people in regional Australia closing the inequality gap that is growing between people who live in the regions and people who live in the inner cities of this country.


There may be a reason why the Prime Minister doesn't get it. There may be a reason why the Prime Minister cries 'Communist!' every time we start talking about inequality. The reason he doesn't get it is probably that he lives in one of the wealthiest electorates in the country and he is surrounded at his cabinet table by people who live in some of the wealthiest electorates in the country. I'm talking about the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and I'm talking about the Treasurer. 


Just under one in five school leavers in regional Australia participate in higher education, compared to one in two school leavers in the Prime Minister's local area of Waverley. The reason that he doesn't get the fact that we have a massive problem with inequality in this country, the reason that he doesn't understand that this bill is going to exacerbate the problem, not make it better, is that the world that he lives in is a very different world to that which the majority of Australians are living in. He lives in a world surrounded by privilege, while the rest of Australia is living in a world which doesn't enjoy the same sorts of privileges that the Prime Minister enjoys or that his deputy leader and the Treasurer enjoy. Is there any wonder that he cries 'Socialism!' whenever we start to say: 'Excuse me, sir; there are some problems with what you're doing. Excuse me, but not everyone enjoys the same privileges that you do. Excuse me; if you introduce this legislation, real people are going to suffer.' 


In fact, if you live in regional Australia, participation rates in secondary school at age 16 are seven to 10 per cent lower than they are in the Prime Minister's electorate. In regional Western Australia and regional Tasmania, they're also considerably lower, around 20 per cent lower. There are other parts of the country, where people live very different lives to those who are recommending this bill before the House today. We should send a very clear message to this government that we understand the circumstances of people who are living in the outer suburbs of capital cities and the circumstances of people who are living in regional Australia. It's a very different world to the one that the decision-makers in this government are living in. 


We understand their circumstances. That's why we're not going to vote for these massive cuts to university funding. We are not going to vote for an increase in the rate of repayment for the fees that are being proposed in this bill today. We're not going to support their plans to abolish the Education Investment Fund. If you compare the approach of Labor governments over decades to higher education to that of the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, you see the world through the prism of privilege. They vote accordingly. Others see the world through the prism that higher education is an opportunity to improve your lot in life. We put in place the Education Investment Fund, which improved the facilities of universities right around the country, particularly in regional campuses around the country, where millions and millions of dollars was invested, including in my own campus at Wollongong. Millions and millions of dollars was invested. What is this government attempting to do? Abolish that fund so that those funds aren't available to invest in university facilities around the country. 


Not only do we understand the importance of universities as institutions which are educating the workforce and the citizens of a future society; we understand that in regional areas universities are major economic players in their own right. The University of Wollongong in my region contributes around $1.2 billion in total direct and indirect economic contribution to the GDP over the course of a year. More than 5,200 people are directly employed by the University of Wollongong, making it one of the largest employers in the region. For every 1,000 full-time equivalent roles that the University of Wollongong employs, there are probably another 1,000 full-time jobs that are created in the broader Illawarra economy. We can take from that that the 5,000-odd people the University of Wollongong employs are generating a total employment of around 10,000 for the entire Illawarra district. The University of Wollongong is an incredibly important contributor to our workforce, having over 131,000 graduates in its short time in operation across more than 300 different degree strands. It has a significant research arm and is an acknowledged world leader in the areas of engineering and information and communications technology. For every $1 million of value added as a result of the University of Wollongong expenditure, a further $1 million is probably generated in income elsewhere within the economy. This paints the picture of a very important regional economic institution.


A responsible government that understood the circumstances in regional areas—a responsible government that was in tune with regions like my own—would not be cutting $45 million from the funds of this vital economic institution in the Illawarra. We know the result will be staff cuts. We know the result will be increased class sizes. We know the result will be a university struggling to provide the same quality of education it did in the decades before.


If members opposite are going to do something to improve the lot of people living and working in regional Australia, if the coalition parties—the Liberals and the National Party in particular—are going to do something to represent others than those in the privileged classes living in the privileged suburbs of our capital cities, they have to reject this bill. They have to reject this bill because the results of this bill are going to be a disaster for people who are struggling to get themselves a higher education, for people who are struggling to pay off a university debt and for people who are struggling to get a toehold in a university in this country. It is bad legislation. It should be rejected.


I particularly implore members of the Nationals, who are supposed to represent people in regional Australia: do the right thing by your community. Tear yourselves away from your Liberal Party colleagues and reject this bill. You have to do more than beat yourselves on the chest and say, 'We are a tough, independent party.' You have to do more than be lions in your electorate and lambs down here in the parliament when you come and vote on legislation. You have to put those fierce words into action. You have to stand up for your communities. That's why, in a few minutes time, you should march into this chamber and you should sit with Labor members of parliament and stand up for your communities. We're going to do it, and we throw down the gauntlet to you: do the same thing.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (17:03):  I rise today to discuss the impact of the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. It's a bill I absolutely will not support. I reject it outright. It is complex legislation, and that is fitting because we in this place all know that higher education is a complex issue to deal with, with a long list of stakeholders and participants, and there is always great community interest in our universities. Primary, secondary and higher education are as important as each other, and negotiating and creating reform that is complementary across sectors can create long-lasting benefits for the whole community. Education reform is challenging. Higher education reform is challenging.


The reforms in this bill purport to tackle the considerable challenge of funding universities while at the same time managing to fundamentally ignore how universities actually work. This bill displays a kind of wilful blindness to the reality of how universities make the most of their funding and the pressure facing this very important sector and export industry.


If this bill is to help the higher education sector, it should be designed to support the students in the institutions it professes to reform, but it does not do that. This is a bill that should be making universities more accessible to students across the nation, but it isn't. This is a bill which should pay attention to the vast range of activities that a university conducts, but it does not. This is a bill that should bring together relevant stakeholders to the table and develop meaningful, long-term policy for the sector. Again, it doesn't and it fails. Certainly, this bill should ensure the future prosperity of a world-class higher educational institution, and it certainly does not do that. Recent comments published in The West Australian and, of course, around the world say it advocates the exact opposite. The West Australian says:


Australia's performance on international university league tables could fall if the Federal Government pushes ahead with planned reforms, the editor of the Times Higher Education global rankings has warned.


In these rankings, six Australian universities were ranked among the top 100 in the world. Unfortunately, none of Western Australia's universities made the top 100, but UWA moved up 14 places, climbing to 111. The West Australian says:


Times Higher Education global rankings editor Phil Baty said Australia's future rankings could suffer if the Government went ahead with plans to cut funding by 2.5 per cent.


""It is good news that Australia's universities have held steady in this year's table but funding cuts proposed by the government could harm the country's institutions in future editions of the rankings,"" he said.


""The data also shows that Australia's leading institutions are already falling behind peers in mainland China and Hong Kong, which receive high and sustained levels of state funding.""


Mr Baty said figures from the first quarter of this year showed a 15 per cent increase in international student numbers in Australia.


He said Australia could benefit from a potential decline in the number of international students applying to universities in Britain and the US because of Brexit and tightened immigration policies.


So we have the capacity already and we have the model and the opportunity.


The Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, has said Australian universities are punching above their weight on the international stage but they should not rest on their laurels in a competitive world. The education minister asked universities not to rest on their laurels, while this government has been doing exactly that in this policy area and others for four years. Mind you, as laurels are symbols of victory and status, one can't really accuse the Liberal government of much of that. It is laziness in application of policy thought. They've failed to consider the complexities of our third-largest export industry. How does cutting the legs out from our universities help maintain our national rankings? How does it help universities improve on their already excellent performance?


I want to talk about the university experience of students across Australia. For those of us who were lucky enough to go to university—and not many people in my electorate have been to university—it's not about just going to your lectures and going home. It's not a factory; students don't just go in one end and get churned out the other end with a piece of paper. We hope they go into positive learning environments, get to engage with peers, pick up life skills, network and build a strong, positive and well-thought-out foundation for life post graduation. We hope that it sets them up. But this bill does not do any of that. Instead of reforming the sector for the good of the students and the vast university communities, this bill has become a cash grab by the Liberal federal government to repair the budget bottom line at the expense of education and the future of our community.


I've worked in the university sector for over 10 years. Before coming to this place, I operated an international relations think tank, the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia. Before that I was a lawyer for the University of Western Australia and I was chief of staff to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. I have had the remarkable experience of working with students, the UWA student guild, educators, lecturers, heads of state, scientists, cleaners, researchers, heads of government, administrators, artists, Nobel laureates, gardeners, curators and carpenters—so many different people doing so many different things to make a remarkable institution what it is: a place of learning, a place of research, a place of effort and application and a place of beauty where all can seek wisdom should they choose to, and most do. In being director of UWA's centenary celebrations a few years ago, I had the chance to spend time helping a vast community celebrate the contribution of the first free university in the British Empire, a university which promoted equal access to tertiary education for all. It enabled the education of Western Australians and the research which enabled the development of that state's agricultural industry—its second-largest export industry—and the state's mining industry, which is WA's largest export industry.


Of course, now, with five universities, education itself is Western Australia's third-largest export industry. A hundred and five years after UWA first commenced in 1911, there are a further four great WA universities—Murdoch University, Curtin University, Edith Cowan University, and the University of Notre Dame Australia—each playing important roles in educating Western Australians of all ages and international students from many nations. These universities conduct research across a broad spectrum of subjects, and, like unis across the country, they contribute to local communities in hosting community events and providing sporting grounds and facilities. They are significant employers and create centres of activity that support hundreds of small businesses across WA.


Universities are complex, and I haven't even touched on what it takes to put together a university budget, but, mostly from my own experience, I know it's extraordinarily hard work. Simplifying the complexity of universities and all that they do in the community and assuming student contributions only get applied to teaching shows an absurd lack of attention to universities, to what they are and to how they work. For the education minister to say that unis are somehow pocketing the extra cash from student contributions that exceed the costs of teaching shows just how mammothly out of touch this government is with this sector. In July, the education minister described the increase in funding to the sector because of the demand-driven system as a 'river of gold'. How out of touch can you get. I can imagine more than a few university administrators shaking their heads at that comment and thinking, 'If only we could keep hold of that extra revenue and not have to apply it to research programs, or IT infrastructure, or maintaining heritage-listed 85-year-old limestone buildings or a collection of art carefully collected or gifted and curated and which the university holds on trust for the benefit of the public and the benefit of future generations.'


Our universities are not cash cows for this or any other aggressive Liberal government to raid for their budget repair, and neither is the foreign aid program, for that matter. But nothing will stand in the way of this government giving $65 billion worth of tax cuts to the most wealthy—not even those institutions which quite literally build the future of this nation's prosperity.


This government has resolutely ignored the reality of universities. It has not managed to grasp the reality of the implicit cross-subsidy where any funds left over from a teaching program go toward funding critical research. It is a failure to listen to universities. It is a failure to understand how they operate. And it is only one more of this government's many failures in this regard.


If I could, I'd like to speak briefly about Murdoch University in Western Australia. I hope the member for Tangney comes and speaks a bit later on this. I know it's in his electorate and it plays an important role in his community as well as in mine. It is the closest university to Brand and has offered a unique and valuable approach to tertiary education for many of my constituents. It's also close to my family's heart, having been named after my husband's great-grandfather, Sir Walter Murdoch, the founding professor of English at UWA and a local author and philosopher. Established in 1973, Murdoch University offers enabling programs for students who did not achieve the ATAR ranking they had hoped, or, in some cases, those who did not achieve an ATAR ranking at all—programs such as OnTrack. That is—or was—a fee-free program which is approved as a full-time study option by Centrelink.


This bill seeks to replace the enabling loading with a student contribution that will have a disproportionately negative impact on students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in the suburbs south of Brand, in the Peel region, across the seat of Canning as well as in my electorate of Brand. In 2016, there were 296 students from the region taking advantage of this program. This year, there are 453. The replacement of the enabling loading will undoubtedly put an immediate halt to this, flying in the face of the very great positive progress Murdoch University has made in opening up the university experience to people who are already at a disadvantage in comparison to many others around Australia. It is estimated that charging fees for enabling programs will affect more than 350 students across Rockingham and Peel. To rip up the opportunities and dreams of these students is, in my opinion, a national disgrace and should be reconsidered by the government.


Among OnTrack students enrolled at Murdoch University between 2008 and 2014, 55 per cent self-identified as being the first in their family to go to a university, and 56 per cent lived in low-SES denominated areas. Furthermore, and very importantly, 69 per cent of all funded enrolments translated into undergraduate degree enrolments at Murdoch University. That's a good thing for the region, it's a good thing for Western Australia and it certainly is a good thing for the people and potential students of Brand in Western Australia.


I will speak for a couple of minutes to a few of the other measures that are in this bill. We know what an efficiency dividend is, of course; it's a cut. The 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend will take out of an already-stressed sector. There will be an increase in student fees. Now, let's be clear, this increase in fees will not go to any kind of pool that's going to improve the student experience or go to funding facilities to support services to help improved infrastructure. No, it's going to go straight to the consolidated revenue and transform into that $65 billion tax cut for big business. This government is increasing the fees for students and is not applying that increase to the sector itself. Students will pay more and they will get less. Not only will the extra fees go elsewhere, but the 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend—cut—and the 7.5 per cent performance management daylight robbery scheme will all add up to taking more money out of universities to fund tax cuts. It's a disgrace, and it's a failure.


I'm going to reflect a bit on that performance based funding pool that we have no detail about. Earlier, the member for McPherson, I think, said that there was going to be some metrics put around it and that they would be related to student achievement. So here we have another 7.5 per cent to be taken off universities, coming out of their Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding, that will be put into some pool to be distributed in some fashion yet to be determined. That's very helpful for universities, some of which have billion-dollar turnovers and have to plan for these things.


The member for McPherson mentioned student achievement as a possible metric. That sometimes translates to attrition. Attrition of students is regularly and most often out of the control of universities, because students at universities, like all of us, have lives that are complicated. Sometimes they have to give up their studies for health reasons, because they become carers, because they've simply changed their mind or because they're not able to cope; there are so many reasons people do not finish their degree. And students that need the enabling courses that the government is now going to charge for are often those who are at most risk of not finishing their degree and going into that attrition lot of students. So if performance funding is going to be linked to attrition, then unis will find themselves being forced not to enrol students at risk of leaving their institutions—those at risk of not finishing their degree in full. And these are the people, as I said, who do the enabling courses. They are the most vulnerable in our community, the people we need to get into universities and to finish their degree. We need to do all we can to help them out so that they can finish their degree and create a better life for their families and for their future. Universities are highly motivated to keep students enrolled. It's part of their funding. The money flows with the students, so there is no need to have any kind of performance based funding managed around attrition, because that's well and truly dealt with.


I'll conclude by saying that I think these reforms are a disgrace. I've worked in this sector for over 10 years and I have been on the council of a university. I'm proud to have worked in the university sector and I'll do all I can to defend it and to improve the funding model for the universities in the future. (Time expired)

"Leeser, Julian, MP",LP,2017-09-12,"



Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (17:18):  This Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 is fundamentally about one thing—that is, the sustainability of the higher education system. There has been a wonderful and very important expansion of the higher education system under the demand-driven system since 2009 but it has never been on a sustainable basis. It is very important that universities, that students and that the whole higher education system have the certainty and stability that only funding sustainability can provide.


Now the mythmakers and the luvvies would have you believe that nothing happened in higher education until 1972 with the election of the 'Sun King', Gough Whitlam, but that's not true. The greatest expansion in higher education occurred under the prime ministership of Sir Robert Menzies.


Sir Robert Menzies' own story is worthwhile recounting in this regard. Menzies was a country boy who grew up in a one-horse town, went to a one-teacher primary school and won scholarships to high school and then scholarships to university. It was those scholarships and that opportunity to go to university which transformed his life. It allowed him to lead his profession, to lead his party and to lead his nation for a record 16 years. He was an extraordinary prime minister and an extraordinary leader in education. He wanted to give other people the same opportunity that he had had in terms of higher education. That's why he sought to expand universities to the extent that he did. In 1957, he said:


It is not yet adequately understood that a university education is not, and certainly should not be, the prerequisite of a privileged few…We must, on a broad basis, become a more and more educated democracy if we are to raise our spiritual, intellectual and material living standards.


Expanding educational opportunity is actually part of the DNA of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the demand driven system which underpins the growth of higher education was originally a Liberal Party idea. It first appeared in the policy framework in 1992 as part of the first Fightback! policy package. As that package said:


Freedom for institutions, academics and students requires a decisive move away from a centrally administered system to one based on a greatly strengthened student market, in which students can choose their university according to their own judgements and institutions have the flexibility to respond to these choices…Institutions will be free to offer places as they chose in any course with limited exceptions.


That was the first appearance of the demand-driven system.


In October 1999, the then education minister David Kemp proposed a reform to cabinet, and part of this reform was the demand-driven system. As his submission said:


… the package delivers a universal entitlement to higher education for all who can meet entry qualifications. Students will have greater choice about where they study, subject only to meeting admissions criteria, and the range of courses available will be wider and more appropriate as institutions are freed up to respond more directly to demand for particular courses and in particular locations.


Menzies realised that any growth in higher education had to be sustainable growth. That's why, in 1965, in response to some calls for further funding by academics, he said:


If I have one complaint that I can make about my academic friends, it is that some of them – not all of them but some of them – appear to think that there is no limit to what can be produced financially. I've even known one or two like that at Canberra. The sky is the limit, they think. The sky isn't the limit. Considerable financial power doesn't mean inexhaustible financial resources and that is not to be forgotten…the task of a Commonwealth Government in economic and financial policy is to preserve a good economic climate in which growth can proceed from a stable foundation…


It's not just Menzies' academic friends that didn't understand that things needed to be paid for; it's Menzies' friends on the other side of the House that don't understand that. Just like the NDIS and just like school funding, it was the Labor Party that expanded the demand driven system, and that's a good thing, but yet again they've started a system and they haven't made it a sustainable system, because they haven't provided an adequate and sustainable funding source for it.


Towards the end of the last Labor government, they realised that they actually needed to provide a sustainable basis for this. That's why, in government at the end of the Labor years, they proposed their own efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent. The then Prime Minister Gillard, on 16 April 2013, said:


The number of places has grown, but funding has also gone up per student place. Money to universities is still going to grow. We've got universities on a growth path. What we are asking them to do is for one year to accept a two per cent efficiency dividend, and in the second year a 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend. That means their money would still grow, it just wouldn't grow as fast as they'd obviously wanted.


The former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has demonstrated herself to be more economically responsible than those opposite who are opposed to this bill and who do not want to see this particular arrangement, which has provided extraordinary opportunities to students, to be held on a sustainable basis. It's important to remind people that the budget is still in deficit. Every year we're repaying $17 billion of debt. This is despite the fact that we've passed $100 billion worth of budget repair.


What we need to do is to ensure that the opportunity that's provided in the demand-driven system continues, and that people continue to have the opportunity to go to university. Today, 32 per cent of Australians have a bachelor degree or higher, and that is a great result. Our per student funding from all sources is 23 per cent higher than the OECD average, and we should be proud of that. But since 2009, the taxpayer funding for teaching and learning has increased by 71 per cent, that's twice the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and the introduction of the demand-driven system has seen a massive expansion in the number of students going to university, and that's a very good thing. For instance, in 2016 there were 720,970 domestic undergraduate students, and that's compared to 553,083 in 2009. That's a very, very good result. But you can't expand the system if you can't pay for the system. Over time, HELP has also ballooned. The fair value of student loans has increased from $12.5 billion to $36.8 billion, and is expected to increase further to $59.7 billion by 2019-20. The total outstanding student debt underwritten by taxpayers now stands at $50 billion, with a quarter of that—that's 25 per cent—not expected to be repaid. As I said, it's not responsible or fair to establish a system and then not provide for its long-term sustainability.


What this legislation proposes to do is to have an increase in student contributions in relation to their higher education. As we know, students who go to university, who have a higher education experience, are more likely to earn larger salaries and have better jobs over the course of their careers. Over their lifetimes they will earn, on average, between $700,000 and $900,000 more than a person who hasn't gone to university; therefore, it's fair that they should make a bit more of a contribution than they are currently doing. This doesn't mean that they would be contributing more than half—the Commonwealth is still contributing up to half—but that they should contribute a little bit more.


The legislation seeks to increase the maximum student contribution on Commonwealth-supported places, which are otherwise subsidised by the government. The increase in contributions will be phased in from 2018 to 2021, with a 1.8 per cent increase each year from 2018 and culminating to a 7.5 per cent increase in 2021. This will be offset by a reduction in taxpayer funding. These reforms will rebalance the contributions made by taxpayers and students to the cost of their higher education. After the changes have been implemented, taxpayers will remain the majority funder of higher education, providing on average 54 per cent of funding for the costs of teaching and learning.


As I said earlier, we know that one-quarter of the money in the HELP system isn't being repaid, and we need to do something to recoup some of that money. So the legislation is setting the minimum repayment threshold at $42,000, with a repayment rate beginning at one per cent of an individual's repayment income, which is much lower than the current rate of four per cent, which cuts in at a threshold of $54,869. To put this into perspective for a graduate teacher or a graduate nurse, for instance, a graduate teacher on a median full-time salary of $62,900 might currently expect to repay something in the order of $2,830 a year and a graduate nurse earning $58,400 would be expected to repay $2,336 per year. Importantly, from 1 July 2019 the repayment threshold, including the minimum repayment income, will be indexed using the CPI. This will maintain repayment value thresholds in real terms. Indexation by CPI will slow the growth of repayment thresholds and ensure they remain appropriate when compared to an individual's capacity to pay. The other advantage of the HELP reforms is that the proportion of debt not expected to be repaid, as the repayment threshold cuts in lower, reduces from 25 per cent to 18 per cent by 2020-21.


Finally, while eligibility for student loans will be extended to most Australian permanent residents and most New Zealand citizens, these students will no longer have access to Commonwealth subsidies, and this preserves a range of special cohorts, including some New Zealand visa holders who arrived in Australia as children, those permanent residents and New Zealanders who have already commenced on a course of study and Australian humanitarian visa holders.


I want to have a look at the efficiency dividend, which the member for Brand spoke about earlier. This legislation will require subsidies provided under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to be subjected to a 2½ per cent efficiency dividend in both 2018 and 2019. It is to be remembered that, as I said earlier in my remarks, when Labor was in government they proposed their own efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent. The Deloitte cost recovery report, undertaken in 2016, showed that universities spent approximately 85 per cent of their total funding for bachelor-level courses in 2015 on teaching and learning compared to the 2011 base funding review, which found that 94 per cent of base funding for bachelor-level courses was spent on teaching and learning. These findings suggest that it's actually reasonable to expect that some of these efficiencies should be shared with the government.


Effectively, the cost per student for teaching and learning have increased by 9.5 per cent since 2010, while revenue per student has risen by 15 per cent over that time—so a larger revenue and, while there were rising costs, costs have not risen as much as revenue. This efficiency dividend equates to an average of 2.8 per cent of base funding for teaching and research. It's an essential contribution from the revenue benefits of the demand-driven funding system, which have not just been beneficial to individual students but have also been beneficial to universities and the university system as universities have been able to increase their resources and increase their offerings as a result of the extra funding that's come their way.


Some of the most important measures in the bill actually relate to less advantaged students, whose geography or background might disadvantage them in attending university. I think the most important of these is the legislating of the HEPPP program. The HEPPP program is the major equity program. It has never been legislated, and it has often been a source, on both sides, of funding cuts that have occurred from time to time. This government is securing HEPPP by entrenching it in legislation. It's providing a loading of $985 per low-SES student. That will allow universities to provide them with a consistent level of support. Additionally, with performance funding of over $13 million a year, it will provide universities with incentives to ensure that disadvantaged students actually achieve success at university.


These provisions provide funding certainty to universities so that the benefits to low-SES students of accessing higher education are maximised. It's been a bipartisan goal since the Menzies era to increase the number of low-SES students attending university and the number of low-SES students participating in higher education. Yet, despite all of the expansion, on a per capita basis the greatest period in which low-SES students actually participated in the higher education system was the Menzies era. So it's very important that the HEPPP system is maintained on a legislatively secure basis.


We want to collaborate to provide the most effective education experience for all disadvantaged students. That's why we're creating our national priorities pool to support projects that research and trial innovative ideas for the more effective implementation of HEPPP. This will ensure that universities will engage in the long-term planning needed to guarantee accessibility. Such planning and collaboration is absolutely essential if we are to guarantee disadvantaged students a valuable experience of further education. That is very important.


There will also be supports for regional higher education, improving opportunities for students from rural and regional areas to study in regional hubs, for those who can't get to their local regional university, and also for scholarships, particularly directed at STEM courses, of up to $18,000 a year for programs from certificate IV right the way up to PhD. There are also important elements of the package relating to enabling courses, relating to the expansion of the demand-driven system of Commonwealth supported places in approved sub-bachelor courses. Being a sub-bachelor student is often a great pathway in as part of the second-chance university system into the sector. The expansion is a very good thing and will provide further opportunity to more Australians.


In conclusion, is it very important that the demand-driven system is maintained so that it gives opportunities to so many people, but we need to ensure that it is maintained on a sustainable basis.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:34):  I am really pleased to rise tonight, following the member for Brand, because I felt that the member for Brand took this debate to a higher level, to an aspirational level. It was fantastic to hear from somebody who understands the university system but who, most importantly, understands the aspirations of higher education.


We say 'higher education' in this place—we say it every day—but what does it mean? The member for Brand asked some really important questions. She asked the critical questions: what is driving this so-called reform? Is improvement in higher education what's driving this reform? Is access to higher education what's driving this reform? Is excellence in higher education what is driving this reform? Sadly, I believe it is none of the above. What is driving this so-called reform are savings and cuts, because whenever you hear this government say 'savings' you can understand clearly what it means is 'a cut'. 


You have to ask yourself: what would the great thinkers in our history make of this? The bean counters are in charge of learning in this place. We just heard from a member opposite who has had the value of a higher education, and he can turn bean counting into oratory, supposedly. The value of higher education is about the value of our society. It is about what we aspire to be. It is about what contribution we, as individuals and as a collective, are going to make to the rest of the world. If the bean counters are in charge of the learning then we are going to have what we've got here tonight: dumb policy, dumb legislation and dumb cuts, from a government who understands the cost of everything and the value of nothing. 


As someone who came from education, I have spent my life talking to children, young people and adult learners about lifelong learning. What I see in this legislation is the end of the aspiration for lifelong learning for many of the young people and middle-aged people who live in the electorate that I represent here. As a teacher I spent 27 years in schools, working with students towards building aspiration and motivation from prep through to year 12, telling every student that they can learn if they are given the appropriate levels of support and the appropriate levels of challenge. The primary tenet of teaching is a belief that everybody can learn if given the appropriate levels of support and challenge. 


Since coming and joining this parliament I find myself in schools telling children very clearly: 'I'm in the federal Parliament of Australia, and I can tell you that you can do anything,' because when I look around this chamber I can see many of us here who wouldn't have thought that this is where we'd end up. But it does not happen by accident. The people who find themselves in this chamber as members of the House of Representatives in the federal parliament have had aspiration and they have had motivation. They have had supports put into their lives to assist them to reach for the stars. So we here are examples for the young people that we're talking about. 


Tonight we're talking about a piece of legislation that is going to rip away that aspiration and stomp on that motivation that I know is being built in schools in my electorate as we speak. As a former educator, I believe in the transformative nature of education and the transformative nature of higher education in particular. I represent a community where 47 per cent of people are not born in Australia, where 72 per cent of people have at least one parent born overseas and where 56 per cent of people have both parents born overseas. All parents in my electorate want to see their children do well, whether they are from families where no-one has gone to university or whether they are from families with the first person going to university or whether they are from families for whom there's a long tradition of tertiary education. Everybody wants to see their children do well. This is particularly the case in my community. People have come to this country to make the most of our story and to join us here. A lot of what drives them is a relentless drive for their children to get that tertiary education. They are motivated. They are encouraged to achieve as much as possible because in this country, while we have some way to go, there are fewer barriers to a person realising their potential than in a lot of other parts of the world.


People in my electorate work hard so that their children can achieve academic success. Whenever I meet with people at graduation ceremonies, they are hopeful that their kids will be able to access the skills they need to make a better life for themselves. In my electorate, as recently as this weekend I was at a local festival, where I often seek out the mums and the kids to talk to them about what their aspirations are and what schools they're attending. I'm always thrilled to hear from parents that they think that our school system is doing a great job. They think that their child is having that aspiration instilled in them in their classroom and that they're getting appropriately challenged.


I want to talk specifically about the kids in my electorate. I made a call today to friends at Werribee Secondary College. Last year, 2016, of a cohort of 205 students completing year 12, 124 students went on to higher tertiary education, 60 went on to TAFE, 12 are completing an apprenticeship and 16 are in full employment. Of those that went to university, 27 went to Melbourne and Monash, 68 went to Swinburne, RMIT, Deakin and La Trobe, and 23 went on to Vic uni, ACU and other tertiary institutions. That was unheard of 15 years ago in my electorate. I congratulate the teachers involved in those journeys, and the parents with them, to build that aspiration and expectation and to build an understanding that lifelong learning will change lives. But, if this bill passes and this government gets its way, students will be faced with 7.5 per cent higher HELP fees and the threshold for when they begin to pay them back will be lowered—that is right: lowered. The loan repayments currently kick in at around $55K and will be reduced to $42,000. That's just a few thousand dollars more than the minimum wage. Changes to the indexation from average weekly earnings to CPI will also increase the burden on students.


We have to know—I do after four years in this place—that, where there's a change like that, there's a calculated save, so that means a cost to the students. One could be cruelly ironic and suggest that, after the penalty rate cuts, the government is lowering the repayment threshold to account for reduced wages, but surely that would be too cruel. The justifications come back to bean counters looking at education as a cost rather than as an investment—rather than from the point of view of what we as a country should aspire to be: a highly educated population of people committed to lifelong learning so that we can continue to change and shape this nation, change and shape our economy, change and shape our industry and change and shape our science. The bill's practical application risks entrenching poverty and enshrining privilege. It risks locking out our best and brightest because of the family income or the travel costs and the time. All manner of things go into motivating young people to pursue and fulfil their potential. The measures in this bill will make that harder.


Another objectionable measure is the changes for permanent residents and New Zealander students living in Australia. They will be moved from Commonwealth supported places to full-fee places with access to FEE-HELP loans. This is an injustice and I cannot speak too passionately about this. I spent Saturday morning in my electorate at the Rugby Union junior finals. As you can imagine, there were a few Kiwis there—a few taxpaying, hardworking New Zealanders who've spent their lives in this country and are raising their children in this country—and they are furious about this measure. How dare a government in this country determine that their children don't deserve the same chance as the kids they're sitting next to in the classroom? What manner of government cannot foresee what this means? Let me take it from a simple perspective. It means that those families will have to think about sending their child back to live with relatives in New Zealand so that they can access higher education or take on enormous debt by paying full fees. This is unfair and it is cruel.


Let's think about the other ramifications. I know, as a classroom teacher, a senior English teacher and someone who taught years 11 and 12 for years and years, that, if you set up this double class system and say, 'You can go to university, and you can't because of cost,' you've just destroyed my senior classroom, because I've got children I can't motivate. I've got children whose aspiration has been killed before they walk through the door. This is crazy—absolutely crazy. To do this to these people is beyond belief. The impacts will be felt throughout the country. It's just the cruelty of it that I do not understand. I really do feel for those New Zealanders who I know who live and work in my electorate, who work hard every day and whose children go to our schools. They are going to be cut off from the contribution that they might make to this great country.


This legislation is all about cuts. I want to go to one of the areas where we're not sure yet what the ramifications are, but we should have known that this minister, once he had finished gutting schools, would move next to universities. We should have known that, although they couldn't get the last tranche of their changes to higher education through, they would be back with a different version, a slightly adjusted version, but a version with mostly bad news. One of those things is the lack of modelling and the unknown implications of the legislation that's before us. One of those things is, of course, the extension of the demand-driven sector to sub-bachelor for universities. We don't know what impact this will have on our public TAFE sector, which states around this country are desperately trying to rebuild. We don't know what the impact will be on that TAFE sector, and that is a crying shame. This government should have modelled that, and this government should make sure that, whatever it's doing in higher education, it's not doing anything that will stop TAFE being re-established and back in public hands where it belongs. 


The other area that I'm really concerned about—I'll go back to the notion of lifelong learning—is that they are going to now charge people for what has been called an enabling course. In my neck of the woods, we call it a bridging course. They're courses that I have worked on in schools with students who have gone off and got a job and perhaps lost the job. Then they reconnect with the school, and careers counsellors sit with them and say: 'You always had the potential. You just never made the commitment. How about you do one of these bridging courses and pursue the dream you had when you were in year 10 of going to university? Why don't you do that?' These aren't kids from families who can just splash out $3,000. If they've left school, had a job, taken on debts—probably a car loan—and lost their job then their parents are already helping out, and now we're going to put a charge on their bridge to tertiary education. 


It's not just young people. The figures will reflect the number of mums, the number of women with children, who decide to establish themselves in a bridging program with the hope of pursuing tertiary qualifications and being able to cut themselves free from any kind of government support and raise their children on a decent salary.


There are so many elements of this bill that are not good news for Australia. There are elements of this bill that reflect poorly on this government. They reflect poorly because in a time when we should be investing in our young people, in our adults, in our future and in our training, and in a time when we should be aspiring to be the best in the world and we are in a highly globalised and competitive market, it is the time to invest in our people. It is not a time to let the bean counters loose so they can find money for a $65 billion tax cut for multimillionaires and corporations. This is not that time.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:49):  I rise to speak against the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. I do so because if this legislation is carried by this parliament it will undermine tertiary education in Australia as we know it. This bill represents a $3.8 billion cut to higher education in this country. It is a cut that's across the board and a cut that will damage the nature of educational opportunity in this country.


This is a cut, of course, that overwhelmingly will have an impact on young Australians. It is an increase to the average student contribution towards the cost of a degree from 42 per cent up to 46 per cent. It represents a $12,000 decrease to the amount that a graduate is allowed to earn—a decrease to $42,000—before the mandatory repayment of HECS-HELP fees begins. Furthermore, access to Commonwealth supported places for permanent residents and New Zealand citizens studying in Australia will be removed indefinitely. It is ironic, given the debate that has taken place over the citizenship of the Deputy Prime Minister in this country, that they're undermining the ability and capacity of New Zealand citizens to fully participate in Australian society.


It is a concern that across the board this represents an attack on opportunity. Whilst student contributions are increased and repayment thresholds are lowered for all tertiary institutions, including TAFE and vocational education and training students, those worst hit in this latest round of cuts are our universities. Australian universities are about to be subjected to a 2.5 per cent funding cut that Malcolm Turnbull's coalition, in its finest example of doublespeak yet, calls an efficiency dividend. Not to mention the 7.5 per cent hike in student fees over the next four years and the removal of Commonwealth supported places for postgraduate students.


This, of course, is about government priorities—whether a government priority is corporate tax cuts for the top end of town or whether it is providing support for the higher education needs of our country. If Australia is going to prosper in the Asian century, we need to prosper on the basis of how smart we are and how innovative we are, and on the capacity of our human capital to compete in this region. We shouldn't try to compete by lowering wages and conditions and we shouldn't try to compete by undermining the capacity of our population—particularly our young population—but this is what the government would do. This is what this legislation represents.


It also represents, I believe, a fundamental, philosophical divide across this chamber. Those in the Liberal Party seem to believe that education is just about benefitting the individual—that an individual benefits and gets a higher income, and that they should therefore contribute more to that educational opportunity. The problem with that is twofold. Firstly, it doesn't understand or take into account the fact that increasing educational opportunity and increasing the capacity of our population—particularly our younger generations—to make the most of themselves and to educate themselves in ways which both contribute commercially to the economy and contribute to their capacity to make a difference in society, is a benefit for that society as a whole. It's not just about the individual and the benefit to them.


That is a fundamental difference in what Labor has always understood about education: that education is the great enabler. That is why the Hawke government and the Keating government were very proud of the fact that in 1983 some three out of 10 Australian young people completed their Higher School Certificate and, at the end of that period in 1996, that figure was above eight out of 10. That was a great legacy of the Hawke and Keating governments. That followed the great Whitlam government reforms that opened up tertiary education to working-class people.


Many of us who sit in this chamber would be the first people in their families to complete a university degree. I was the first person in my family to complete schooling, let alone a university degree. That means that we maximise the benefit for the individual, but we also maximise the benefit to the economy and to society as a whole by maximising the collective potential of those people who make up our local communities. 


Federal Labor came into office in 2007—something that we will be celebrating in coming months. We increased funding for universities from $8 billion to $14 billion over our six years in office, a $6 billion increase in contributions to universities. During that period, we saw again a massive increase in the number of people who were able to go to university. That changed the composition of the people who were going to universities. People from lower and middle incomes who had been missing out then got that opportunity. 


Labor also has a plan for TAFE and the vocational education and training sector. The last Labor government contributed over $19 billion in Commonwealth funding towards the VET and TAFE sector, including investment in infrastructure and technology upgrades. There is legislation before this parliament to abolish funds that Labor established—the Building Australia Fund, to build transport infrastructure, which was approved by Infrastructure Australia; and the Education Investment Fund, which was for building education infrastructure around the country. They just want to abolish those. 


The reinvigoration of TAFE and VET courses is of particular importance to me. The Design Centre Enmore, one of the most notable TAFEs in New South Wales, resides in the inner west. This centre specialises in industrial design, fashion design and visual design, and has flourished in spite of the cuts to services imposed by the coalition and reinforced by the state government, which has also undermined TAFE. Just down the road, Petersham TAFE in West Street has been forced to close its doors. It specialised in communications. How extraordinary is it that a TAFE centre in a global city like Sydney specialising in communications, giving young people that opportunity, has shut its doors because of cuts by the New South Wales coalition government, reinforced by the attitude of the federal government?


It is because of Labor's proven track record and our belief in higher education that we will oppose the measures in this bill that increase student fees and lower the HECS, HELP, TAFE and VET repayment thresholds. We oppose these changes, just as we opposed and successfully defeated the proposal from Tony Abbott in the last term of government to have $100,000 degrees. We know that the changes proposed in this legislation come at a time when Australians are paying the sixth-highest level of university fees in the OECD. The memory of university fee deregulation is still fresh in the minds of most. Had this plan been accepted, we would have had a two-tiered higher education system—the privileged, who could afford it, and the underprivileged, who could not. One of the great distinctions and divides in Australian politics is between Labor, who believe in creating opportunity, and our conservative opponents, who believe in entrenching privilege. And that is why we see education as the great enabler.


I am concerned with this legislation and the impact that it has on universities. Universities support more than 130,000 jobs across Australia. If you cut an amount of funding from an institution, somewhere down the line a job is lost. If you cut $3.8 billion from the institutions, you could be certain that the jobs lost will be in the thousands. That's important in local institutions like the University of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney, which service my electorate even though they're just outside my boundaries. But it is also critically important for universities like the University of New England, in Armidale, the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong. All of these campuses have had a critical role to play in those local regional economies.


One of the things Australia has been very good at over the years is developing new technology and innovation—whether it be solar technology at the Australian National University or the University of New South Wales or wi-fi and information technology down at the University of Wollongong. Across the board our universities have been world class in innovation, research, ideas and breakthroughs. What we haven't always been good at it commercialising those opportunities and value-adding so that we create the jobs here in Australia. And the real debate should be how we do that, how we maximise the intellectual capacity that we have here into job creation down the line.


This government really isn't interested in that, though. A university campus, a TAFE campus or a school they just see as a target for cuts. Australian electrical engineer Dr John O'Sullivan invented an integral component of wi-fi while looking for a way to measure the mass of a black hole. Dr O'Sullivan undertook his undergraduate degree in engineering at Sydney uni. Australian writer Garth Nix penned the Old Kingdom trilogy, an internationally successful series that raised the bar for science fiction and fantasy writers worldwide. He was a graduate of the University of Canberra. Across the board, there is enormous success that we should be proud of.


This legislation would provide a loss of over $600 million in my home state of New South Wales alone. This legislation is not worthy of support in this parliament. This legislation will undermine our capacity as an economy. It will hurt individuals and their capacity to make the most of themselves in life and provide support to their family. It will undermine our standing on the global stage, where we've been very proud of the high ranking that our universities have reached over recent years. Nelson Mandela said that education is the most powerful weapon with which you can change the world. Nelson Mandela was right. This legislation is wrong.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (18:04):  From 1996 to 1999, Prime Minister John Howard and his education ministers consistently and systematically attacked the Australian higher education system. Two billion dollars was taken from the university system in that period alone. Clearly, cutting university funding is in the Liberals' DNA. The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 would bring about almost double those cuts, $3.8 billion, and, on top of that, $4 billion to go from the education infrastructure fund. The Group of Eight, representing Australia's top universities, describes it as 'the most brutal cuts by a federal government in more than 20 years'. And this comes at a time when the need for post-school education has never been as high.


Right from the start, I want to make clear that the TAFE and university sectors both require fair funding. Both have a vital and complementary role in skilling up the workforce for employment opportunities that lie ahead of us in the 21st century. Let's talk, though, about the impact of these government cuts to university education on students. When Labor were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013—$1 billion a year, every year, of improvement. What was even more significant than that money was that we opened the door to universities to an additional 190,000 Australians. Many of them were the first in their family to go to university.


But this government's decision to increase student fees delivers a blow to aspiring students just like them. In my electorate of Macquarie, students attend universities all over Sydney and beyond—Wollongong, Charles Sturt, Newcastle—but a large number, around 2,000 of them at any one time, attend Western Sydney University, and more than half of them are the first in their family to go to university. This university, Western Sydney University, is the uni that will lose the biggest amount of any university in New South Wales.


I just want you to imagine what it's like to be the first in your family to consider going to university. The current university fees are daunting enough, but this bill means that if you're thinking about university they're going to get worse. I have noticed in my time here that those opposite seem to lack a bit of imagination. It might be hard to imagine, if they were lucky enough to have a whole family of tertiary people around them and have an expectation that university was their path. I was lucky enough to have that expectation, but I see so many kids where that is not the case. So I'm going to ask you to imagine, just for once, Deputy Speaker, what it's like. I'd ask those on the other side to imagine what it's like.


It isn't easy being the first in your family, especially when people quiz you on just what job you'll do when you've got your arts degree or even your master's. And trying to explain what a master's is—that's a whole other conversation. It's hard to explain that the skills you learn, which I know these kids learn, are sometimes as much about the journey of processing huge amounts of information, researching things, taking on new ideas and turning them into a coherent argument. It's as much about that as the actual subject itself. Until you've done your degree, you don't even realise what you've learnt or where it might help you contribute to the world of work. So it can be hard trying to explain to your family that you're just not sure what your major will be, let alone what job you might ultimately do. I see the uncertainty of young people, really capable young people, who are not sure if university is for them, because no-one in their family has ever done it before. It doesn't take much to discourage or dampen that ambition, to deter them from pursuing it and to destroy their confidence in themselves. It's a really intimidating situation.


This government might think you can keep making it harder and harder for people to lift their educational standards, but future employers and our economy will pay a heavy price for this failure to invest in higher education. One of the most short-sighted and mean parts of this bill is around funding for enabling courses. The crushing of confidence is nowhere more apparent than in the decision to introduce fees for enabling courses. Enabling courses help students prepare for university study. These students are overwhelmingly from disadvantaged backgrounds, and, until now, these courses have been free. Even then it's daunting. It's a taste of what might come, and that in itself is intimidating. It's a pathway for students to test and see whether they could thrive in a university environment and whether they're ready for a degree course.


Now the government is trying to make students pay $3,200 for these courses. The member for Dobell and I did some quick calculations, and we worked out a way that this might be able to be removed from this legislation. The cost of the marriage equality survey—that's $122 million—would pay for around 38,000 enabling courses. We think that would be a much better use of money. As it is, these young kids and older people who haven't been to university but who think that it might be a way forward for them to improve their professional standing and to give them a broader job opportunity are now facing a $3,200 bill.


The danger of the change, which will affect in my electorate, on average, about two dozen people who go to Western Sydney University at any one time, is that these people will simply be deterred from even considering entering university. Right now we should be encouraging people, young and older, to be exploring their education options so that they're equipped for the workforce. All this measure will do is marginalise a group of people, stifle their hope and stifle their opportunity. That may well be the aim of those opposite, although I hope not—to keep people in their place and not give them access to ambition. 


I also want you to imagine what impact this bill has on people paying back their HELP debt. After years of subsistence as a student, followed by the time it takes to get a full-time job even with a degree, it can feel good to have a half-decent income, not just a mishmash of casual hospitality jobs that so many students use to support themselves through that study. But, before you've even had a chance to build your savings and get ahead, the repayment kicks in. At $54,869, as it stands now, there is a bit of a buffer, but under this bill you have to start paying back the loan you've accrued when you're earning $42,000. That's only $6,000 above the minimum wage. In Sydney, and in my electorate in particular, that doesn't go very far. When you do the numbers, an income of $51,000 with tax taken out and repayments made means you actually leave someone with $32,000 in disposable income. So, if you adjust those figures down, you are making life really, really difficult. It's another disincentive to people who look to university education to lift their job prospects and earning power that it will become an even longer slog to get your head above water financially. 


As the National Union of Students says, these changes leave young Australians far worse off than generations before them. They point out:


This generation is already faced with a severely insecure job market, low wages and a housing market that is in crisis.


Already they face the sixth-highest university fees in the OECD countries. Their fear is of a lifetime of serious debt. And let's not assume that the students are only interested in the impact on themselves. As the NUS says, higher education is Australia's third-largest export, and expenditure of 0.7 per cent of GDP returns around eight per cent in GDP. So it is a small investment for a big return, and that's just one part of the equation.


One of the other impacts of this bill, inevitably, is that it will likely dent the quality that Australian universities are able to provide, which puts at risk that international reputation. Just this month, eight Australian universities were listed in the top 100 for their ability to produce employable students, something we would all welcome. But the global rankings editorial director, Phil Baty, has said that these cuts to government funding could actually result in Australia's standing falling. He said:


It is good news that Australia's universities have held steady in this year's table but funding cuts proposed by the government could seriously harm the country's institutions in future editions of the rankings.


Mr Baty points out that the data shows Australia's leading institutions are already starting to fall behind peers in mainland China and Hong Kong, who, of course, not only are sources of students for our export dollars but also will compete for those export dollars. So really this bill is not great for the economy. 


Another short-sighted decision in this bill is to cut the Education Infrastructure Fund—the extra $4 billion cut. This fund, established under Labor, has helped create innovative and modern learning and research spaces around the country. I know a bit about three of them. The Australian Centre for Indigenous Knowledges & Education in Darwin—ACIKE—is a collaboration between the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education and Charles Darwin University. This fund allowed a building to be created, a space where Indigenous learning could happen. ACIKE aspires to international renown for excellence in teaching programs, community engagement and research endeavours all through this state-of-the-art learning hub. It is a real asset for Darwin and for higher education in Darwin. 


Another facility funded by the EIF is the nanoscience lab—one of the most advanced research and teaching facilities globally in the field of nanoscience—at the University of Sydney. I know very little about nanoscience, but what I know is that to do the research you need an incredibly stable building. It can't move when the wind blows outside or when the trains run underneath. This centre houses high-level research in one of the most advanced buildings on this planet. It looks into areas of battery technology and the growing field of photonics, where you have laser lights directly interacting with traditional semiconductors, and all this cutting edge technology. 


The third building that has been funded under the EIF that I know of and have familiarity with is what was originally called the Centre for Climate Change and Energy Research—now called the UWS Institute for the Environment—in Richmond on the Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University. Again, this is a place doing world-leading research. In fact, researchers from all over the world move to my electorate to do their research here. I had the privilege of taking the climate change shadow minister, Mark Butler, to this site just a few weeks ago to look at some of the incredible work they're doing on soil biology, genomics and plant and animal interactions.


One of the projects that they're doing is the 'eucalyptus free air CO2 enrichment experiment', otherwise known as EucFACE. This is a series of six metal structures in the Cumberland Plain. They surround patches of bush. They are nine storeys high, with 43-metre cranes hanging above them. In this open structure, which looks a bit like a cylinder with metal prongs sticking up, is native bush, and CO2 is pumped into it. It's pumped in at an elevated concentration similar to that which is predicted to occur in the next 35 years. It is billed as the most complex climate change experiment in the world, and the data that is constantly generated in the soil, in the canopy and everywhere in between is made available to researchers globally. None of this would have been possible without the Education Investment Fund. I can only imagine what new innovations we are going to miss out on because this government has effectively suffocated opportunities for universities to build these incredible spaces. Those are some of the immediate impacts. 


When I look at my local university, Western Sydney University, I see we are going to lose jobs. Those jobs will be based on all the campuses—Penrith, Hawkesbury, Werrington, Parramatta. We're also going to potentially lose the opportunity to nurture SMEs, start-ups and entrepreneurs. This is something the university does out of its surplus funding—a whole $10 million surplus, not very much in the big scheme of things, but that surplus is going to disappear. I worry about the jobs we will lose, the innovation we will miss out on, the opportunities that the students at that university will not have—but, even more than that, the opportunities that will be lost to students who make the decision that they can't face a debt of the size that this bill will land on them. That's actually our economic future we are talking about. We are making a choice in this parliament. If those on the opposite side support this bill, it is an active decision to reduce the opportunity for higher education that students around this country have, and that is shameful.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (18:19):  I'm speaking in opposition to most of the elements of the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 and in support of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Sydney. Pensioners, families, small businesses and school students have all been attacked by this government, and now, with this bill, we can add to that group university students. These are the groups of Australians whose lot in life has been made much harder by this Turnbull government. We've seen skyrocketing electricity prices make life more difficult for families, pensioners, and small businesses. We've seen cuts to school budgets through changes to the Gonski principles and that model of funding introduced by this government. We've seen cuts to health care and Medicare and an ideological attack on universal health care in Australia by this government. We've seen low-paid workers have their incomes attacked through changes to the Fair Work Act and, of course, through cuts to penalty rates that have been cheered on by this Turnbull government. And now we have an ideological attack on the university students of Australia through this bill.


At a time when our economy is stop-start—two steps forward, one step back—when the economy has been spluttering over recent years and when we need to improve our nation's productivity if we're going to boost growth and employment in our community, the worst thing a government can do is underinvest in education, make life harder for students and increase fees for university students. That is exactly what this bill does and it is why Labor opposes it. At a time when we should be investing in education for our young people and ensuring that they have the skills necessary to compete in a much-changed and more competitive marketplace, this government prefers to cut funding for universities and make life harder for students across Australia.


As part of this bill, the maximum student contributions will rise by 1.8 per cent for four years from 2018, resulting in a total 7.5 per cent increase from 2021. The first increase will take effect on 1 January 2018 and will apply to all students, including those who are currently enrolled, and Commonwealth contribution amounts will be similarly adjusted each year from 2018 through to 2021 to reflect increased student contribution amounts in those years. An efficiency dividend of 2.5 per cent per annum will apply to grants made under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme in 2018 and 2019. The efficiency dividend is a contribution from the revenue benefits of the demand-driven funding system. Medical students' loading will be extended to include veterinary science and dentistry units under study in 2018 to improve the funding arrangements for these courses. Currently our students pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. The fee hikes in this bill will make that situation even worse, and our rankings will once again fall in terms of affordability.


In the community that I represent, in Kingsford Smith, we're quite fortunate to have a world-class university in the University of New South Wales at Kensington. I was fortunate to be a student at this university and it's what all kids in the community that I represent aspire to. They dream of being able to get the marks in their HSC to attend the University of New South Wales and get a world-class tertiary education. This bill makes it harder for those kids in our community, particularly those kids that come from a low-socioeconomic background or are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids, because, quite simply, some of them will not be able to afford the fee increases proposed in these bills. Unfortunately, the coalition has made life more difficult for younger people to participate in our society and to get a good job.


Kingsford Smith has the sixth-highest rates of mortgage repayments in the country and the eighth-highest rents. The cost of housing in our community is bringing many young people to their knees. Many times when I walk down the street, I'm approached by young people and their parents saying they simply will not be able to afford to buy a house or to rent in the community where they grew up and where their family networks are, and go to universities in their community, like the University of New South Wales. Joe Hockey's solution to this was just, 'Get a better job,' and the Prime Minister's solution to this is, 'If you've got rich parents, they can chip in and help you buy a house.' We all know that that is not the reality for most Australian families in this country.


In contrast, Labor knows and understands just how difficult it is for people to get an education, but we want to support them. We want to make sure that there is a clear pathway for kids to undertake a decent education in Australia, from early childhood development right through to emeritus professor at university—a pathway such that education and access to education are based on your talents and on your commitment, not on your parents' bank balance. But, unfortunately, this type of reform reintroduces that sort of system into this country.


Now, when Labor was last in government, we increased our investment in universities. We lifted the investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. It was the largest commitment and investment in university education from an Australian government at the time when we left office. We opened the doors to universities for an additional 190,000 Australians, many of whom were the first in their families to get access to a university education. And why did we lift participation in universities? Because it's good for the individual and it's good for the Australian economy. Every single study, every single bit of research, indicates that the more you educate a person then the more productive they become not only in terms of their own personal contribution to the economy but for the nation's income growth and productivity.


Labor is also supportive of the wonderful research that is undertaken at our universities. At the University of New South Wales, we have world-leading research facilities in photovoltaic and solar research and in quantum computing, where Professor Michelle Simmons and her team are leading the world in developing a silicon based quantum computer. The research world is in awe of some of the results that they have received so far.


One of the world's greatest medical teaching resources is at the University of New South Wales, working in collaboration with the Prince of Wales Hospital. This is world-class leading research that has changed the world. It has definitely changed the world. The fact that the University of New South Wales PV and solar research facility has the world record for conversion of sunlight into energy is something that we all should be very, very proud of. And they are housed in a building that was funded by the Labor government through the Education Investment Fund—the Tyree Energy Technologies Building. It has a six-star energy rating, I might add; it is one of the world's most energy-efficient buildings. When you walk into that building you see many, many students undertaking research. They are doing their PhDs and working with some of the best researchers in photovoltaic and solar research anywhere in the world.


When I was there recently—and the member for Port Adelaide joined me there over the last 12 months to have a look at the research that's going on there—one of the researchers who is working there described that facility perfectly to me. He said: 'If you want to work in space research, you want to go to NASA. If you want to work in solar and photovoltaics, you want to work at the University of New South Wales.' You want to work in that Tyree building, funded by the Education Investment Fund that this government is seeking to cut through its cuts to that particular fund and its cuts to university research.


In his 2014 budget reply, Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Labor Party, set an aspiration for Australia to devote three per cent of our GDP to research and development by 2030. Achieving this will require governments, universities and research organisations to work with industry to boost the development and the resources that go into research in this country. And what we're doing here with this bill is the complete antithesis of that; it's the complete opposite of that. Labor believes that every university in Australia should be doing great research, and we've pledged to help our regional outer metropolitan and smaller universities to get a fair go through the Collaborative Research Networks program. As well as working together, Labor wants universities to work better with industry and other end users to spread the benefits of their research and, of course, to encourage entrepreneurialism in students.


We aim to boost the Industrial Transformation Research Program introduced by the previous Labor government, which would have enabled at least four additional research hubs to be funded in each of the five rounds that were coming up. This would have facilitated more industries in transition to have access to excellent research, to improve their productivity and to create the jobs of the future. The bill before us is the complete antithesis of that.


This bill before us is also quite lacking in detail. There is very, very little detail about how the bill will work. The government's new voucher system for postgraduate places is simply a thought bubble. It's an idea without substance. It's a solution without a problem. There are approximately 35,000 postgraduate CSP students in Australia, and the government is proposing to hand over the funding allocation to the minister or some new private body to distribute it. The unis think that this is a poorly thought out idea, and so does Labor. In fact, according to a poll conducted recently by JWS Research for Universities Australia, almost two-thirds of Australians are opposed to what this government is doing when it comes to universities: increasing fees for students, cutting grants for research, cutting funding and making fees rise. Up to 62 per cent of voters are opposed to the changes, compared with 16 per cent who support what the government is doing through this bill.


As quoted by The Guardian today, Universities Australia chief executive Belinda Robertson said the poll showed that cuts contained in the bill were 'way out of kilter with community sentiment'. She said:


Voters don't want to see cuts to universities, which are key drivers of economic growth because they create new jobs, re-skill Australians and secure $24bn a year in export income.


Universities and their students have already contributed almost $4bn to repair the budget over the last six years. Clearly, the Australian community is saying enough is enough: no more uni cuts.


I couldn't have put it better myself. That's exactly what the Australian people are thinking. They're sick and tired of this government attacking pensioners, attacking young families, attacking workers, attacking school students and now attacking university and TAFE students through initiatives such as this. They want to see a government that is fair dinkum about education and fair dinkum about universities and their research, investing in universities and investing in the future. I urge my colleagues to vote down those particular provisions in this bill.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:32):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. What can one say about a government that is hell-bent on deliberately cutting funding to university education? It is hard to believe that the Abbott and Turnbull governments have done and are doing to Australian universities and university students.


When the Turnbull government announced they were going to cut university funding by $3.8 billion over four years and lower the payment threshold for students, I thought the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, was Prime Minister again. This is the same outrageously unfair university package that the Abbott government tried to sell in 2014. All the Turnbull government has done is wrap up the same unfair package in glossy paper and put a fancy tinsel bow on top. No-one is fooled. Everyone can smell this bill for what it really is: an attack on the less fortunate in our community because it promotes elitist education.


Time and time again, coalition governments want to attack universities and university students. For the life of me, I simply cannot understand why, especially when the majority of the Turnbull government front bench have benefitted from a free university education thanks to the Whitlam Labor government. The majority of coalition frontbenchers attended university between 1974 and 1988, when students did not pay any fees. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and front bench members such as Attorney-General George Brandis, Minister for Defence Marise Payne and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott are among those who attended university when a university education was free. In total, eight Turnbull government ministers were at university when students were not charged fees, while another eight would have had at least one year of free university education. Why is this noteworthy? It points to the absolute hypocrisy of the Turnbull government frontbenchers who have benefitted from a free education at university but who want to make savage cuts to universities and students by raising the costs of their degrees and lowering the income threshold.


The Turnbull government will not allow anyone else to reap the same benefits from a university education as they have done. Their degrees have given them greater earning capacity and career opportunities than those people who have not had the opportunity to gain a university qualification. Universities Australia's chief executive, Belinda Robinson, said:


… the Australian community could see it made no sense to cut university funding at a time of rapid and dramatic economic change.


Ms Robinson also said that the government's plan to cut funding to universities is 'way out of kilter with community sentiment'. She went on to say:


Voters don’t want to see cuts to universities – which are key drivers of economic growth – because they create new jobs, reskill Australians and secure $24 billion a year in export income.


Universities and their students have already contributed almost $4 billion to repair the Budget over the last six years. Clearly, the Australian community is saying enough is enough: no more uni cuts.


According to a 2012 report by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, based at the University of Canberra, people with university qualifications are likely to earn more than $1 million more than those without degrees. The irony of this is that a number of the Turnbull government's members started their careers in politics at university. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott enrolled in a combined economics/law degree at the University of Sydney in 1976 and became president of the student representative council in 1978. Nine years later, former treasurer Joe Hockey also became student representative council president at the University of Sydney. Minister for Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg was President of the Monash Law Student Society. Most politicians have had access to a quality university education that has delivered them myriad benefits, and it is time the Turnbull government put all of today's students at the heart of their policies. 


The Group of Eight comprises Australia's top eight universities. A number of the Turnbull government members have attended a Go8 university, so one would think that they would take recommendations made by the Go8 very seriously. Recently, the Group of Eight made a number of recommendations as a result of the independent review into regional, rural and remote education. Not surprisingly, the No. 1 recommendation was


That the Senate block the current Higher Education Reform Bill as this puts at risk a broad range of university capacity-building, including highly successful equity programs.


The same university that Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull attended is recommending that the Senate block his own legislation—recommendations wisely given but, sadly, falling on deaf ears. 


The Group of Eight have also recommended that the federal government ensures that policies to support higher education outcomes for regional students are well designed and adequately and consistently funded. The federal government continues to invest in equity programs over the long term to support regional and remote students, including by increasing the value of the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program to $205.1 million per year as was forecast in Labor's 2012-13 budget for the 2015-16 year. They recommended that the federal government review eligibility criteria for youth allowance and other linked student income support programs to ensure that they provide an appropriate level of support for students from regional areas. There is absolutely no mention of cuts to university funding and no mention of drug testing for those people on Newstart or youth allowance. The members of the Turnbull government have received a big fail on their policy, a fail on their cuts and a fail on their plans for university, which were handed down by the universities that they attended. 


The Turnbull government is cutting $401.8 million from Queensland universities. James Cook University in North Queensland will receive a cut of $37.1 million over four years. Teaching, student programs and university facilities will suffer as a result of these cuts. These cuts will damage Australia's research effort. There is an implicit cross-subsidy to research, accepted throughout the higher education sector, through the Commonwealth grants scheme and this comes on top of the government's attempts to abolish the $3.7 billion nation-building Education Investment Fund. Australia has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD. These cuts will only make our record worse.


Our students already pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. The fee hikes in this bill will only make that record worse as well. Students will be put under pressure with higher fees and paying off larger debts sooner. Students will have to start paying back their loan when they are earning $42,000 instead of $54,869. The Higher Education Loan Program repayments will hit students at a time when they are trying to save for a house or start a family. Forty-two thousand dollars is approximately $6,000 more than the minimum wage.


Lowering the HELP repayment threshold, in combination with tax and transfer measures included in the 2017 budget, will mean that some graduates will face an effective marginal tax rate of more than 100 per cent. Graduates caught between these policies will experience considerable fiscal and financial stress. Graduates earning $51,000, most of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income than someone earning $32,000.


The Turnbull government's disastrous policies go beyond attacking university students. They are also attacking TAFE students. As a TAFE teacher in a previous life, I know just how unfair that truly is. But the government doesn't like to talk about this. The lower repayment threshold for HELP debt will also apply to TAFE and vocational students who took out VET FEE-HELP or VET student loans. This means that some of the hardest working but most modestly paid people in the country will be affected—for example, people with a diploma or advanced diploma qualification, such as early childhood educators, enrolled nurses and technicians.


What is even worse is the move by the Turnbull government to introduce fees for enabling courses, which provide essential skills and confidence to prepare students for university. Students who finish these courses have gone on to become nurses, accountants, doctors and lawyers. These students are overwhelmingly from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. These courses have been free, as they do not lead to a formal qualification. However, this government is trying to make these students pay $3,200 to sit in an enabling course. This shift is mean and unfair because we know that, for a majority of these students, fees and debt are a barrier to study.


And what impact will these cuts have on jobs? Universities support more than 130,000 jobs across Australia. Cuts to universities will put jobs at risk, especially in regional areas—like in James Cook University and Central Queensland University in Townsville. No-one, absolutely no-one, is in favour of the Turnbull government's university cuts. The peak body for universities, Universities Australia, said that an overwhelming majority of vice-chancellors could not recommend that the crossbench support this bill. The NTEU, the sector's union, is opposed to the bill because of the impact that the cuts and fee hikes will have on students. TAFEs are deeply concerned about the impact that changes will have on their ability to offer certain enabling and pathway courses. Student groups are fiercely opposed to increases in fees and changes to loan repayments.


It seems as though the only plan that the Turnbull government has for universities is to cut, cut, cut. It's simply in its DNA to cut education funding—for example, $17 billion in cuts to schools; $2.8 billion in cuts to TAFE, with a further cut of $637,000 in this year's budget; a $3.8 billion cut to Australian universities; and increases in fees and debts for students. The question is: why is this government so hell-bent on these cuts? It is because it wants to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business.


Labor governments are the only governments that will ever fight for a fair and properly funded education system. It is only Labor that has a history of delivering accessible and affordable education for all. Labor understands that governments are supposed to support universities to support students to support the jobs of the future. When Labor were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. Labor also opened the doors to our universities for an additional 190,000 Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to attend university. Why did Labor lift participation in universities? It was because Labor understands that education is the cornerstone to innovation and our economic future. We know that many of the jobs of the future will require a postschool qualification. That's why cutting funding to TAFE and universities is one of the worst decisions a government can make.


Many parents across Australia see a university education as a necessary opportunity to give their children the best career options. Tertiary education is not only the right of a privileged few. If we are to be a nation that is ready for the challenges, innovations and jobs of the future, we must invest in education. The Turnbull government is out of touch in creating a situation where students are required to pay even more for their education while the government gives corporations making millions of dollars a tax cut. The Parliamentary Budget Office is predicting that student fees will soar by 40 per cent as universities recover the costs as a result of the Turnbull government's planned 20 per cent government funding cut.


The Turnbull government must stop recycling former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's policies. Nobody wants the zombified Abbott policies—they were scary enough the first time! Education is a human right. It is not for the few who can afford it. Education is for everyone. In particular, aspiration and access should not be based on your earning capacity or your parents' credit card. In the words chanted by some of the many passionate university students, 'BS, come off it. Our education is not for profit.'

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:46):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. Higher education is very important. I know people of my ilk and many others benefited from the reforms that Gough Whitlam introduced, and many members who have contributed from this side of the House in this debate would have been the first from their families, as I was, to go to university.


The electorate I represent is very multicultural, as everybody knows, but it is not a rich electorate. Mums and dads there work pretty damn hard to make sure their kids get a good education. Education is one of the biggest things that ring true to those people in my community aspiring to create a better life for their families and their children.


The minister, in her second reading speech, boasted of the reforms as being fair, driving equality and excellence, and ensuring students have choice and opportunity. Maybe that was the speaking point she was given, because how does the government think they are convincing anyone that that can be possibly true? This bill aims to cut university funding by nearly $4 billion, hitting students with higher fees and saddling students with bigger debts that they have to pay back at a time they are probably trying to start a family and service a mortgage. The cuts will compromise teaching and learning, undermine research, and slash investment in universities at a time when the government should be investing in both universities and TAFE to guarantee that we as a country have a strong and productive future. Therefore, we on this side oppose the bill and we oppose it on good grounds.


This is an unfair piece of legislation. It does nothing but undermine the integral value of our tertiary education system, and it will act as an impediment for students and their respective futures. To put these cuts in some perspective, New South Wales institutions alone will lose $617.8 million over the next four years according to Universities Australia. That is $617 million out of various economies. New South Wales is fortunate to have a number of regionally based universities, so this will clearly impact on them. A good colleague, Professor Barney Glover, Vice-Chancellor and President of Western Sydney University, summed up the ramifications of these measures when he stated that these changes the government is proposing constitute a significant risk to the sustainability, quality and competitiveness of Australian universities.


These cuts will be delivered by the same people opposite who cut $17 billion from our schools and $637 million from our TAFE colleges, and now they want to do something very similar to our universities. Bear in mind—you only have to go back to 2013—this is the same group of people that said, 'Trust us; we will not cut education.' They also went on to say they would not cut a raft of other things, all of which they have done.


The government seek to justify this because they are committed to handing out $65 billion of tax cuts to millionaires and big business in this country. Just a piece of simple advice: if you can't cut your coat according to your cloth, don't start taking it off universities and don't start taking it off TAFE colleges, because we actually do need them for our future. We need them to develop our human resources for the future prosperity of this nation. So this cut is nothing other than bad, because what it will do is to enshrine a backward-looking approach to tertiary education in this country. As Professor Colin Stirling, Innovative Research Universities Chair and Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, said, 'How can we ask students to contribute more to get less in return?' That's a pretty good question, and it raises another.


When the minister said they consulted widely in bringing forward this piece of legislation, she didn't actually go on to say what the universities said. I would've thought that they were critical stakeholders, and these universities certainly aren't running to champion the minister's view. The government keeps proving that it can't be trusted when it comes to some of the most important investments in this country. Investing in our people must be paramount when it comes to determining the priorities of our investment strategies. As I said, the minister said that the government consulted widely, but she failed to say what anyone in the university sector said. But I don't have to advise you; I think everyone in this room knows that the overwhelming majority of vice-chancellors from Australian universities are opposed to this piece of legislation. Vicki Thomson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight universities, believes that the universities have now reached a 'tipping point', a view which she sums up in the following way:


… on top of the $3.9 billion in cuts we have suffered since 2011, our sector has surely done our fair share of the heavy lifting for Budget repair.


That's the issue with the $65 billion tax cut to big business. If you can't afford to give a tax cut to big business of that magnitude, don't. It's as simple as that. But don't think that you can pay for that tax cut by taking it off the future welfare and development of this country, by taking it off our students and those who produce our quality higher education sector.


When these cuts take place, don't forget: there are going to be many, many casualties out there, particularly in electorates like mine—people who just cannot afford to make the changes necessary to accommodate the financial impost that the government are imposing on people. This bill introduces a funding cut for universities through an efficiency dividend of 2.5 per cent on the university grants for 2018-19. Combined with that efficiency dividend, in the bill there is an increase in the student contribution amount of 7.5 per cent over four years. While 7.5 per cent of Commonwealth grants will be reserved for performance funding—and I have got to say that is a principle which our side actually supports—the approach of this government is nothing but punitive. Unlike what we were told by the minister, it doesn't seem that these could be in any way described as 'modest adjustments'. They are clearly an attempt by the government to shift the responsibility of the cost of higher education primarily to the institutions and students. This government is taking away 7.5 per cent of university funding, in addition to a 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend, which will effectively amount to a 10 per cent structural cut to higher education over the next two years. While Mr Turnbull might like to proclaim that he is all about fairness, a $3.8 billion cut to tertiary education, as proposed in this bill, certainly demonstrates that his priorities lie elsewhere. Universities Australia Chair Professor Margaret Gardner sums it up this way:


If 7.5% of each student's funding will not follow the student, but will flow depending on the minister's assessment of whether a university has met benchmarks determined on a changing set of education indicators, then this money cannot prudently be included in the budget.


In other words, there are no specific parameters which form the guidelines, so how could you actually include that as part of a budget scenario? It's clear that the government has gone about implementing the principle of performance based funding the wrong way. It's a policy that amounts to performance funding simply at ministerial discretion.


At the core of this bill is the extension of demand-driven funding to sub-bachelor places. This is a principle that the university sector and Labor in the past have also advocated, following the recommendation of the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education. The bill introduces, in three parts, demand-driven sub-bachelor places: students accessing sub-bachelor places must not hold a degree, the courses must meet industry needs, and the courses must articulate into undergraduate programs. While the concept of a sub-bachelor course is great for those looking for qualifications that fit outside traditional TAFE and university offerings, there is certainly a big concern in the TAFE sector that the sub-bachelor places could give universities an unfair advantage over the normal offerings of TAFE colleges. The government's proposed restrictions are not sufficient to protect TAFE or to support the integrated tertiary education system.


The bill also introduces measures that seek to introduce fees for enabling courses, lower repayment thresholds for HELP, shift New Zealanders and permanent residents from Commonwealth supported places to full-fee-paying places, and introduce a new allocation system for postgraduate Commonwealth supported places. 


These measures will no doubt have a significant impact in electorates like mine. They will affect those who are most disadvantaged in our society. Unlike what the name of this bill suggests, these measures do not support a sustainable, world-class higher education system that remains affordable and accessible to all who are eligible, regardless of background or circumstance. For instance, in my electorate of Fowler, which I have already described as not a wealthy electorate, Professor Barney Glover said this bill 'may have an unintended impost on, for example, mature aged students, Indigenous students, individuals with interrupted career paths or reduced employment due to child raising or other life events'.


A very interesting scenario was brought to my attention by a police officer in my local area command, which gives a law enforcement perspective to this. Crime Manager Detective Chief Inspector Darren Newman, from Cabramatta police area command, said he believes that this bill would have a devastating impact on my local community—that's the community that he serves. He believes this would be a massive blow to the aspirations of many young people, undermining the extensive work that police have put in communities such as mine. One of the issues that Darren Newman related to me, which is particularly relevant to those newer communities in the country—particularly those from either African or Islander nations who come here—is that the police work very hard with them. The whole idea is not to wait until a crime is committed but to work with the community, show them that there is opportunity and try to make young people more engaged not only with law enforcement but with the community generally. What Darren Newman said to me was that, where you can show a person who comes from another nation where education may not be valued to the same extent that it is in this country that they can achieve a university qualification and they can graduate with a degree, they can go on to do a range of different things. Where you can show that to their peers, there's a very strong argument that it's almost me-tooism for them: 'If they can do this, I can do this too'. And the police who serve my community say this is very significant, to be able to show all of these young people that they can justifiably have the expectation and aspiration to go to university. To simply make that more difficult, to simply take that away and make it less possible for them, creates a significant problem, as the police see it, in a community such as mine.


There's got to be a better way than doing this. On the one hand, they're simply trying to be the economic rationalists out there and trying to actually justify all this, while on the other hand they're trying to give away $65 billion to big business. If you can't afford to make such a donation to big business, don't do it. Maybe you'd do it at a time when you could afford to, but what they are doing here cuts across all those in a community such as mine. It's necessary for their aspirations, for their expectations of what they can actually do to grow in a country such as Australia. We need these young people. We need these people developing. This is the Whitlam strategy played out large.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (19:01):  It's an exciting time for the University of Newcastle.




Mr Butler:
  There has never been a more exciting time.




Mr CONROY:
  Absolutely. The new inner-city campus, NeW Space, has recently opened. The previous Labor government provided $30 million for the new campus, along with contributions from the state government and the university. The building is not only visually stunning; it's a tremendous enhancement to Newcastle's CBD and a proud legacy of the last Labor government and our commitment to the Hunter region. This significant funding commitment from the Labor Party is in stark contrast to the Liberal's approach to tertiary education. Indeed, the University of Newcastle will have its funding cut by a staggering $100 million if the government is able to pass its proposals contained in this legislation we are debating right now.


For the past four years, the government has been trying to shift our universities to a user-pays system that excludes poor and middle-class kids. Labor believes in tertiary education as a great enabler. The economic and social benefits of tertiary education speak for themselves. Access to tertiary education should not depend on the wealth of your parents or young people taking out very significant amounts of debt, and so at a time when the University of Newcastle is celebrating an important milestone, it is very disappointing to see the coalition renewing its attacks on this vital sector.


Before outlining what this bill proposes, I briefly want to draw to the attention of the House some shocking statistics about tertiary education in Australia. Of the world's richest countries, Australia has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities. This is a damning statistic. A nation whose economy has grown every year for over a quarter of a century should be leading with investment in universities and research. The government's proposals will only make our record worse. In relation to fees, Australian students already pay the sixth-highest fees amongst developed countries and, again, the government's proposal will make fees even higher.


The government is proposing the following in this bill: a 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend on university grants; increasing student fees by 7.5 per cent; making radical changes to HELP repayments; reducing the threshold when repayments start from $54,800 to $42,000—this is very serious at a time when wages growth is actually shrinking; making significant changes to enabling programs, which are so important for my Hunter region; and attacking New Zealand permanent residents and citizens, some of whom have lived nearly all their lives in Australia. In speaking on this legislation, I also want to bring to the attention of the House the powerful impact enabling programs have had in the Hunter and the fact that the government is cutting these programs.


The statement released from Universities Australia is a damning indictment on the government's proposal. It states:


There was unanimous opposition to the proposals to cut university funding and lift student fees.


It went on:


An overwhelming majority of Vice-Chancellors agreed they could not recommend that the Senate crossbench pass the legislative package.


This is clearly identifying what the government is doing: cutting funding and increasing fees. They are trying to make our education system further restricted to only the very well-off, just as they are trying to restrict our healthcare system to the wealthy in this country. In Australia, access to university should be based on ability, not on a student's ability or their parents' ability to pay for a degree.


I want to talk about the significant impact this bill will have on the University of Newcastle, my local university. The university, as I said, will be worse off to the tune of $100 million because of these cuts. These aren't Labor's figures. The vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle has confirmed this on the front page of the Newcastle Herald and has recently told a Senate inquiry:


This is really, really tough on universities … We've already contributed to the fiscal efficiencies of the government. You can't continue on that basis.


The University of Newcastle is an icon and a much-respected institution in the Hunter, Central Coast and northern New South Wales. It is a great promoter of economic and social justice. One quarter of students at the University of Newcastle are from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, and almost half are mature-aged students and students who are the first member of their family to attend university. It also has a very significant Indigenous student population—indeed, it ranks first out of Australia's 39 universities for Indigenous enrolments, and we are rightly proud of this. We trained the first Indigenous doctor in this country and we trained the first Indigenous surgeon in this country. Half of all Indigenous medical graduates in this country are produced by the University of Newcastle each year. We've got a great record in that particular area and we are rightly proud of it.


The university is also the largest and oldest provider of enabling programs in Australia, and so it will be particularly impacted by the brutal changes the government is proposing to enabling programs. The government is directly and intentionally limiting the ability of potential mature-aged students and young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds to access tertiary education. Again, this isn't just Labor rhetoric. It has been confirmed by the vice-chancellor, who recently told a Senate inquiry that changes to enabling programs could make it harder for Indigenous students and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds to access higher education. Twenty per cent of enrolments at the university had previously completed enabling courses. Intelligent and keen people who want to go to university and to make a contribution to our society should not be denied the opportunity to access a tertiary education.


My Labor colleagues and I will not tolerate this assault on enabling courses. Labor believes that people from modest backgrounds and people who have lost their jobs and are determined to get further education and training in order to re-enter workforce should be encouraged to seek a university qualification, not discouraged. Our belief is in stark contrast to that of the Liberals. The outcome of these proposed changes will make it harder to get into university, particularly for the many thousands of older Australians who are desperate to get a job, so Labor strongly opposes the changes to enabling courses. The proposal contained in this bill would introduce a fee on some of the most disadvantaged people in the higher education system.


A little more than 40 years ago, the University of Newcastle introduced a groundbreaking program. In 1974, Open Foundation was one of the first university enabling programs implemented specifically to allow people who missed out on matriculation for a variety of reasons a second chance to qualify academically for a place at university to study for a degree. The stories of Open Foundation's alumni are compelling. There are classics scholars like Leanne Glass, who was once a retail worker and who hadn't completed Year 12, and is now in the final stages of writing her PhD thesis. Daniel Frost suffered from a rare, debilitating bone disease that prevented him from completing his HSC, and he has recently graduated with a Bachelor of Business thanks to Open Foundation. Rhea Barnett entered the Open Foundation program as a 24-year-old with no more than a year 10 school certificate, and has recently spent time in Antarctica researching her science and physics honours thesis.


Very famously, Murray Lee, who is now a professor of criminology at the University of Sydney, when he left Belmont High School at age 15 was told he could be a boilermaker or a sign writer. Those were the options he was restricted to under that system, but after working as an electrical tradesman, he completed the Open Foundation course and was able to complete a degree. Professor Lee is of the view that these reforms will fundamentally harm the enabling program and has stated:


Giving people the chance at a career by keeping enabling courses free has got to be a win/win for the individual, and the community.


Labor could not agree more.


Taylah Gray is in the second year of her law degree. She's angry at the government's proposals, which will affect the University of Newcastle's Yapug program, along with Open Foundation and Newstep. Taylah has said:


These programs are free to give people who might have struggled in school or in their lives a chance to try. What is proposed will put up obstacles for people whose lives have been about obstacles.


This is a very sharp and eloquent analysis of the government's plans. Taylah believes people should be given a chance. Labor believes this as well. This proud tradition, and similar programs such as Newstep for younger students at the University of Newcastle, is under very real threat because of the proposals of the Turnbull government.


I want to be very clear on this proposal. The government is targeting enabling courses, which some of the most disadvantaged students in the sector access. This will have an enormously negative impact in the region that I represent and will result in fewer people in the Hunter region having a tertiary education. The change is socially unjust and economically irresponsible, and Labor condemns the government for deliberately targeting people who are trying to get a tertiary education to allow them a better chance of getting a job and making an important contribution to our community and the country.


I now want to discuss the government's changes to HELP repayments. The philosophy behind HELP is that those who finish a degree should only be required to start paying back the loan once they are earning a decent wage. Australians are proud that we are the land of the fair go, and the HELP system is a fundamentally fair system. However, the Liberals want to reduce the HELP repayment threshold from $54,869 to $42,000. This is a very significant reduction, particularly in an economic environment where wages growth is actually negative. The latest HILDA report showed that wages have stopped growing and that since 2012 they have actually declined. Another key fact is that university graduates are getting paid less than in previous years. It is not appropriate, given the current wage environment, to be making these unfair changes and further deterring young and old alike from university. In fact, lowering the threshold to $42,000 means that a university graduate who is unable to find employment in their chosen profession and is instead continuing a full-time job, say, as a baker at Coles or Woolies would actually have to start paying back the cost of their degree. In fact, when you combine it with the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge, which, disgracefully, this government is applying to everyone who earns more than $19,000, it means that people who earn more than $42,000, up to $54,000 in certain scenarios, actually have an effective marginal tax rate of over 100 per cent. Let me repeat that: because of these regressive changes, workers below the average income—some of them below the median income—will have an effective marginal tax rate of over 100 per cent. They will pay more in tax for each dollar spent than they receive. That is a disgrace, it is deeply regressive and it needs to be opposed.


The British Poet Laureate John Masefield once said: 'There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university.' While this sentiment is lovely, universities are far more than this. They are fundamentally important for our economy and our society. The role of the federal government in supporting and investing in tertiary education is essential. There are two clear distinctions between the major parties on this issue. The Liberals want to cut funding to universities and make tertiary education the domain of the privileged. Labor, the party of education, will always support our tertiary sector and ensure widespread and equitable access to universities. The statistics prove this. International studies have shown that mature aged students and those who are entering through a non-conventional pathway are most easily deterred by higher debt levels and greater repayments. They often have fewer years in the workplace to repay that debt. So anything that increases the debt on them or makes them pay that debt back faster is a deterrent to mature aged students retraining and to those who haven't been able to finish year 12. This is a deeply regressive move. When you combine it with the attacks on the enabling courses, I can only conclude that this government is intent on closing the door to tertiary education for working-class and middle-class families—and that's a disgrace. Not only is it an attack on those people, on those Australians, and limiting their potential, but it is actually a deeply illogical move economically because we need every Australian to fulfil their potential. We need every Australian to fulfil their productive potential, to get the best training possible, so that they can make an active contribution to this economy. The policy contained in this bill counteracts that and closes the door on those people. 


When you think about the fabric of this society, with income inequality at a 75-year high, why are we preventing working-class people from getting a good education? Why would we be saying to them, 'You can't fulfil both your potential to contribute to a great society and to earn a wage'? Why are we doing this in a period of high inequality when wages are going backwards? This is a sign, yet again, of a government that is out of touch, a government that has no concern for the vast majority of Australians and a government that says: 'Well, I made it. I might have had wealthy parents, but I made it, so everyone else can.' This is a deeply regressive move. It is a move symbolic of a party stuck not in the 20th century but in the 19th century, where, unless you are part of the squattocracy or you happen to be born into a wealthy family, we don't care about you and we don't care about your future. The vast majority of Australians disagree with that. The vast majority of Australians support a well-resourced and fair tertiary sector. History will condemn this as yet another regressive move from a regressive and reactionary government that, quite frankly, does not care about the vast majority of Australians.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (19:16):  Labor is rightly opposing this bill. We oppose this bill because it is profoundly unfair to young people, especially those from disadvantaged or middle-class backgrounds. This bill will make it even harder for young people from everyday backgrounds to climb the ladder of opportunity through education. 


When I doorknocked over 13,000 houses in the lead-up to the election, people told me that education was the single most important thing. Everyone said it: young people, parents and grandparents but most especially migrants, who come to this country to seek a better life with a laser-like focus on education being the key to a better life for their kids. But, rather than helping young people to fulfil their potential to climb that ladder of life and opportunity and secure a better future, unless they are lucky enough to be from a very wealthy family, this bill will weigh young people down with a lifetime of debt accrued through higher fees as they struggle to climb just a rung or two while being expected to repay these higher debts even earlier. 


As has been said, Australian students already pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. This bill jacks them up by another 7½ per cent. Repaying debts when you earn $42,000 will make it harder—for many people, impossible—to buy a house or provide for a family. I've heard those opposite prattle on with, 'Oh, it's only 10 bucks a week here and 20 bucks there,' and, 'What's another 50 bucks?' The point is that it's in the wrong direction. It makes it more unfair and more unequal, and it is the wrong way to go, especially with stagnating wages, poor graduate employment outcomes and spiralling house prices fuelled by regressive tax concessions. 


We oppose this bill because it will worsen inequality in this country—although the Treasurer says that's not a real thing. LOL! The Bill's Digest states clearly that, when compared to the existing arrangements, the new proposal has a disproportionate impact on lower-income earners. It's a particular problem when you consider it against the backdrop of the broader Liberal budget as a whole. Lower repayment thresholds plus tax rises like the Medicare levy and changes to other transfer payments will mean that some Australians will face effective marginal tax rates of 100 per cent. Using one example, Australians with a HELP debt who earn $51,000—most of whom are women—will have less disposable income than someone earning $32,000 when you take it all into account. This may sound fanciful for out-of-touch Liberal members, but the average graduate salary in Australia is under $55,000. Good luck with saving for a house, repaying a uni debt, saving for or paying off a car, paying rent, paying utilities, paying for food and paying for electricity. God help you if you start a family on that income, and you better hope you don't get sick. What on earth have young people done to deserve this? 


If we as a nation want to ensure that Australia really is the land of the fair go, we need to do more to address all forms of inequality, especially those that are entrenched or intergenerational in nature. Education is the best tool governments have to encourage social mobility. People in my electorate get this. We oppose this bill because it sells out our country's future and takes us in the wrong direction.


In considering these proposals, everyone in this House must have it fixed in their mind just how critical higher education is to Australia's future successes. This is not the kind of thing we're supposed to say, but Australia's best years are not necessarily in front of us. I'm optimistic that they can be, but it's not certain they will be. We are at risk now—and the signs are not good—of being the first generation in modern Australia to leave a worse standard of living for the next generation. That is shameful. It doesn't have to be that way, but it depends on the choices we make today. That is why I and other Labor members feel so strongly that this bill takes our country and our society in the wrong direction. It doesn't just hit student fees; it also locks in large and ongoing cuts to universities.


Education, as has been said, is a critical enabler of our future economic prosperity and security. Modelling by Deloitte shows that university education added an estimated $140 billion to Australia's GDP in 2014 alone. Our region of the world is the fastest growing. This century holds enormous opportunities, but the world does not owe us a living. We can choose to innovate and compete, or we will get left behind. Australia now has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities of any country in the OECD. While our neighbours and competitors and partners in Asia are investing more in education research and creating wealth from that knowledge, our government spends time thinking up new ways to cut school funding, cut universities, threaten research funding, raise fees, burden young people with a lifetime of debt and slug disadvantaged Australians a fee of $3,223 for bridging courses that don't even give them a qualification. That's a real little gem. Nice one, government; well done! These enabling courses are run by some universities to help some of the most disadvantaged students in the country just to have a crack at getting into uni. There are currently no fees. Yet this bill proposes to charge fees, which is particularly harsh for students from a disadvantaged background. They don't get a formal qualification. There is no stakeholder support. It is a brain fart of the minister.


Australia needs an equitable higher education system if our best future is to be realised. Our smartest and brightest minds get the same access to learning opportunities. That's the goal, and we don't deter or punish young people from poor families. This access must not be conditional on the postcode you were born in, the school you went to or your parents' capacity to pay for a house. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order! Member for Bruce, will you withdraw that.




Mr HILL:
  I withdraw 'brain fart'. Is that the bit you meant?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes.




Mr HILL:
  Sorry, I wasn't sure if that is what you meant.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Just withdraw it without qualification.




Mr HILL:
  I withdraw it without qualification. That is why we oppose this bill and hope it dies in the Senate or wherever in the parliament the government sends this kind of rubbish to rot.


I want to make a few remarks about HELP debt levels and repayment. The government is concerned about growth in unpaid student debt. Overall, student debts are increasing significantly due to the growth of higher education, the government's own higher fees, extension of HELP to non-Commonwealth-supported places and so on. Over four years, we now have 2.5 million students—up from 1.7 million students—holding a debt. The amount of debt has gone up from $25 billion to about $49 billion. On current estimates, 23 per cent of those students are not expected to repay anything at all. Unpaid debt is largely with people who haven't earned above the income threshold long enough, and the debt is written off at their death.


On pages 8 to 10 of the Bills Digest is an interesting discussion on the options around this issue. One option is to just accept that this is part of the scheme—an equity measure, if you like—and a percentage won't be repaid. You can take the government's premise that we need to recoup more of this debt—fair enough, that's an argument. But there are two broad arguments. You can do what the government wants to do—lower repayment thresholds to, in effect, push young people into a poverty trap, which is the option the government has chosen—or you could take the interesting but politically much more difficult option of exploring requirements to recoup debts from certain estates.


The Bills Digest notes that many people who die without repaying debts are actually from very wealthy households with wealthy estates. The family arrangements are such that they have never declared enough income to repay their full debt, but they may pass away with significant wealth, whether through superannuation, housing or other assets. This is politically difficult because, if anyone suggests that, the other side may say, 'Oh, it's a death tax, it's a death tax!' which is clearly nonsense. There is a case to look more closely at this. The Bills Digest notes analysis that requiring HELP debts to be repaid, just like tax or social security debts, from estates over $100,000 in value would save $2.83 billion over three years.


Obviously, you'd need to craft such a policy carefully. I think most people would think a higher threshold would be reasonable, as well as appropriate exemptions or delayed payment provisions to protect people like families where a parent dies young or for people with surviving partners and cash flow issues. I understand this is not my party's policy and it's not the government's policy. It was in the discussion paper, to their credit, but there does seem to be a policy case to look at this option further. If difficult choices have to be made, that kind of approach is far less regressive and far less unfair to young people than the government's policy.


In terms of the impact on universities: at a time when Australia should be investing in our universities, this bill would enshrine $3.8 billion of bottom-line cuts. Teaching, student programs, research and university facilities will suffer. You have to admit that the minister is doing his best to earn himself an honorary degree from university in media manipulation and spin. He's all over the shop suggesting to people, 'Oh, this is just a temporary efficiency dividend. There's nothing to worry about. It's just a couple of years. It's just the universities doing their bit for fiscal consolidation and a bit of budget savings. Nothing to see here. Oh, look over there, let's pick on some migrants. Let's have a quiz about other people's relationships. Let's beat up on vulnerable people who rely on welfare to eat and live—that's a good idea. That'll distract everyone while we hack away at education, won't it?'


There are two main measures that comprise the cut when you stop being distracted and look at this bill. Firstly, the efficiency dividend is 2½ per cent in 2018 and again in 2019. From that the universities suffer a direct cut of $384 million in just two years. Monash University, on the border of my electorate—my old university—suffers the largest cut of any Australian university of $104 million over the forward estimates. I don't see the member for Chisholm listed to speak on this. I would suspect she is far too ashamed, given that it's technically in her electorate.


The minister pretends this is a one-off, but it is effectively a great, big, locked-in permanent cut, because when funding eventually gets reindexed it's from the level after the cut. You can't pretend this won't have an effect on teaching quality, and the resultant cuts will damage Australia's research effort. Higher education in Australia is a little bit weird by the world's standards. It's an accepted part of our system that there is a cross subsidy and that you make a bit of a profit off teaching students to fund your research, which is what keeps you in the rankings. That's bad enough, but a further 7.5 per cent is then taken out for performance funding.


We support the principle of performance funding, indeed, we proposed it, but the government is going about it the wrong way. Ripping another 7.5 per cent off universities for a yet-to-be-determined performance-based funding pool is, in prudent budgeting terms, a further cut because there is no detail in the legislation or from the government about how this scheme will operate.


I will quote Monash University Vice-Chancellor Professor, Margaret Gardner, who said:


A university budgets principally on the basis of the number of students enrolled and the average amount of money each student will bring…If 7.5% of each student's funding will not follow the student, but will flow depending on the minister's assessment of whether a university has met benchmarks determined on a changing set of education indicators, then this money cannot prudently be included in the budget.


Universities Australia has said the policy amounted to performance funding at ministerial discretion without any clarity as to the problem to be solved. All this means is that in prudent budgeting terms universities will have to plan for a 10 per cent cut in 2018 and a 10 per cent cut in 2019. We will not write a blank cheque which will force this 10 per cent cut and so future ministers can do what they want or cut that funding completely.


Finally, with regard to the extension of CSP to sub-bachelor courses: I understand this has been supported in principle for years, since the Bradley review in 2008, but that is almost 10 years ago. I have serious concerns about this measure and its impact on TAFE. There's no detail from the government. The landscape has changed a lot in this area. TAFE is under enormous pressure. You've got changes to the VET FEE-HELP loans, which have capped loans and fees. This measure has the potential to seriously erode TAFE revenues further, to make the provision of critical, high-quality TAFE unviable in more areas and to confuse students.


I note that while universities would be given access to CSPs for sub-bachelor places, TAFE does not have access to CSPs for higher education. Personally, I think this move is premature and that it's dangerous to support it at this time. Time doesn't permit me to go into the plans to sneak in massive changes to how postgraduate places are allocated, or the wedge for privatisation, the little gem in there that some other body may allocate these scholarships or the anti-New Zealander, anti-migrant measures. But suffice it to say that there are a lot of very good reasons for why this bill should be opposed. There are a few sensible things in there, and the government could well pull them out and put them in another bit of legislation that we would support and wave through tomorrow, while these other things go to die, as zombies, as they should.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (19:30):  Australia has always been known for its egalitarian society, something that goes back to the decision of Captain Arthur Phillip to distribute food equally amongst the convicts, the soldiers and the freemen. Australia has been known as the land of a fair go, but this concept of an equal society is rapidly disappearing. It is clear that the Australia of 2017 has two tiers. There are two tiers of education, two tiers of health care, two tiers of infrastructure and two tiers of transport. These two tiers are abundantly clear when you look at Sydney, especially at the differential treatment in funding allocations for Western Sydney, including my electorate of Macarthur in south-west Sydney, in comparison to the eastern suburbs, the North Shore and the northern beaches.


Western Sydney is home to over 2.2 million Sydneysiders and is growing rapidly. The Macarthur region of south-west Sydney has a current population of close to 310,000 residents, but it's predicted that by 2036 this region, which takes in my electorate, will have a population of 600,000. This is a huge growth that will put significant pressure on our already underfunded services and our inadequate infrastructure. We hear a lot of promises from this federal government and the New South Wales Liberal government, but we see very little action. The state and federal Liberal governments are more than happy for our area to house a significant proportion of Sydney's population, but they will not provide the funding to ensure equal services are offered.


Infrastructure is a word that slips nicely off the tongue, but it's something that governments have struggled to provide in south-west Sydney for decades. I spent 40 years working in the public hospital system, and I know the pressure that is put on staff because of increasing demands and poor resources. Over the last few years we have seen rapidly increasing population in the Macarthur region, and we are now seeing developments that continue to add to the pressure on our health system at a rapid rate, yet the resources to cope are just not present. Campbelltown hospital has recently been offered by the state government a $600 million package for redevelopment over the next few years, yet Royal North Shore Hospital, in an area already well served for public and private hospitals and healthcare resources, has cost $1.2 billion to be redeveloped. How is that fair? Macarthur has a rapidly developing and enlarging population and very poor health statistics for just about all public health data, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, developmental problems, low birth weight, diabetes et cetera. We have large pockets of disadvantage and we have very poor health infrastructure, yet the amounts offered to redevelop are far below those offered in more conservative and high-income areas. The same argument is true for Nepean Hospital.


On transport, the south-west has continued to suffer from very poor public transport, including a reduction in express trains to the city and to Parramatta, poor parking at railway stations, lack of air conditioned trains and peak-hour overcrowding. The redevelopment of our roads is fragmented and piecemeal and is not adequate to cope even now. Appin Road has been the scene of many fatalities over the last 20 years, yet continued calls to make the roads safe have fallen on deaf ears. Access to the city is hampered by the poor traffic flows along the M5, and the only two-lane tunnel each way is far too small. The recent widening of The Northern Road to Penrith is already too narrow; the road should be at least six lanes, not four.


We of course really need rail infrastructure, yet we still have no commitment from the federal government about the Western Sydney Airport rail link and the state Liberal minister for transport is denying the need for an airport rail link at all. Neither the state government nor the federal government will commit even to setting aside land for the north-south rail from Campbelltown to St Marys.


Western Sydney University faces one of the largest of the proposed efficiency cuts in funding, yet we have much lower tertiary qualification rates—16 per cent in south-west Sydney compared to 24 per cent for greater Sydney—than we should have. With our rapid development we are also seeing lack of support for our native flora and fauna. We have the only disease-free koala colony in the country. Yet the government does nothing. Our public schools are very poorly resourced, and physically the buildings need to be completely redeveloped. It's quite clear that on every measure south-west Sydney has been deprived of infrastructure funding. Yet government policy has increased the disparity. Until this government understands the issues involved, we will continue to see increased inequality and poorer outcomes in health, education and the environment.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (16:01):  I'd like to mention today some of the wonderful projects being undertaken by locals in my electorate of Richmond. It was with great pride that I officially opened the Tyalgum youth precinct on Saturday, 2 September. I was very pleased to have delivered $20,000 in federal funding from the second round of the Richmond Stronger Communities Program towards this outstanding local project. Our local Stronger Communities Program has delivered funding right across the electorate for small capital grants, supporting projects that contribute to the vibrancy and viability of our wonderful region. For this project, Tweed Shire Council, in partnership with the community, identified the need for better facilities in Tyalgum for young people. These improvements have created an important social hub for younger people and indeed other Tyalgum residents. At the official opening, so many locals and visitors attended this wonderful celebration. The skateboarding workshops and demonstrations were the main attractions of the upgraded Tyalgum Memorial Park, alongside circus performance activities, a free barbecue and stalls. Many parents commented to me that the park was such a great asset, because it catered for children of all age groups. In total the $200,000 upgrade was a joint project of Tweed Council and the Tyalgum Community Consultative Group. At the opening I acknowledged their vision and commitment to the design of these wonderful facilities. The Tyalgum community are to be commended for their dedication to their village, with all the work they do alongside the Tweed Shire Council, for this wonderful project. It shows how much we can achieve when we work together.


I'd also like to emphasise the success of the Stronger Communities Program in regional areas such as my electorate of Richmond. The new third round of funding has seen many applications received by the Richmond community consultation committee. I thank everyone on the committee, which is made up of dedicated members of organisations such as the Ballina Shire Council, Byron Shire Council, Tweed Shire Council and local Rotary and VIEW clubs, for their wonderful work and look forward to working with them and the successful applicants. Their task was made very difficult by the very high quality of applications received, yet again. Exciting projects, such as upgrades to tennis, cricket, croquet, outrigger and rowing clubs will provide a much-needed boost to local sporting organisations in the area. Other examples of wonderful projects are upgrades to children's centres, community showgrounds, local arts halls, veterans memorials, and charity organisations, all of which play a pivotal role in providing essential services in our region.


It's important to recognise the vital role of community organisations in building social goodwill and adding vibrancy to our regions. A wonderful amount of work is being done at a local level by these volunteers, who work tirelessly, particularly to raise that 50 per cent cash or in-kind contribution required for the Stronger Communities Program. In closing, I would like to urge the government to support the continuation of programs like the Stronger Communities Program so that not-for-profit organisations are able to access much-needed financial assistance.

Dr McVEIGH
 (Groom) (17:03):  It's an absolute pleasure to rise and speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources consideration of Social issues relating to land-based automated vehicles in Australia. It has been a fascinating inquiry into a future that will encompass all of us and all of our communities. Ours is a generation, I think, wherein many of our parents used horse-driven or drawn modes of transport in their work in their younger years and later in their lives. Like so many in this House, for example, my father rode a horse to school in his younger years. He certainly worked with my grandfather on the family farm with Clydesdale horses as their main source of power on the farm. Our generation will also see and is already seeing the advent of automated vehicles. For our children, I predict that will be their main form of transport and source of power in the workplace in the years to come. In just three generations there will be that transition, and we are right in the middle of it.


So this has been a particularly important and relevant inquiry, and I believe that this report from our committee lays a firm foundation for future considerations of not just the federal government and federal regulators but also our state and local government counterparts. And whilst I for one have had my imagination extended in considering such futures, alongside my committee colleagues, the advice of some witnesses was particularly pragmatic and relevant. Just as marketing myopia blinded those who said that railways would never take over from stagecoaches or that motor vehicles would never replace the horse, so we must now not be blinded in considering these new futures. That particular witness suggested that we can still use the horse and carriage, especially for tourist and special event purposes, but not on freeways, which are designed for the modern motor car. Therefore it is feasible that the driven motor car that we know now can still be used in the decades ahead, but probably not on roads and infrastructure designed and developed specifically for the automated vehicles of the future.


Our report addresses a wide range of social impacts—as it should, given the title of our investigation. There are therefore a number of key considerations in our recommendations, which I'll refer to in just a few moments. We make special mention of issues that present potential benefits for some sectors of the community and challenges for others. Imagine the mobility benefits for the elderly, who can be confident in automated forms of transport that allow them to continue to engage in their communities, their social activities, and normal aspects of life such as shopping that nowadays are not possible for them. Many of them no longer hold a driver's licence, in a society that's currently designed around the driven motor car as we know it today.


Similarly, what are the benefits for the disabled, as well as the specific requirements for them in terms of continued access and facilitation of activities in totally automated vehicle systems of the decades in the future? What are the challenges for those living in regional and remote communities, where automated vehicle infrastructure, such as lane marking, road signs and other common features in urban areas that we'll notice emerging in the coming years, may not be available or even affordable in regional locations? For example, do they remain dependent on traditional motor vehicles only? Or can they expect a hybrid between automated and drivable vehicles so that they can traverse both worlds? Should they expect the same technology as their urban counterparts, perhaps? Our inquiry has considered many such issues with industry and academic experts from right around the country. Our recommendations are therefore very much couched in terms of providing direction for further consideration of these emerging issues at a federal, state and local government level.


I'd also like to address, while I'm discussing this report, the issue of changing job markets. There is significant evidence that, with the advent of automated vehicles, traditional driving jobs in the transport industry—couriers and taxi drivers, for example—may be significantly reduced or perhaps will even disappear in the long term. That future impact on our communities, on our economies, around the country must be investigated in more detail as our knowledge about the impact of automated vehicles improves.


We have during the course of the inquiry heard from a range of motor vehicle manufacturers, both Australian and foreign. While we're all conscious of the transition away from the domestic manufacture of Australian vehicles, it is instructive to consider the future directions our automotive industry is already taking in response. I'm particularly excited that Ford Australia, for example, oversees the 100 per cent design and development of the Ranger-Everest platform of vehicles here in Australia for manufacture in Thailand and distribution around the globe. That's an example of an automotive industry focused on its future in Australia, and it's pleasing indeed to know that these Australian based companies that we know so well, and other global companies that are setting up operations in Australia, will be extending their innovation into automated vehicle systems and technologies for use around the world, as we heard through evidence in this inquiry. I think this is testament to the ingenuity of our current and future local designers and engineers, who can participate and lead these innovations.


Other social issues considered included changes to urban design, particularly parking lots, which we won't need in the long-term, it is suggested; road design; and, of course, resulting changes to town planning. There are also consumer behaviour considerations—those used to public transport and, therefore, not concerned about privacy, while others not as used to that may be, particularly in regional areas. There is the issue of acceptance of other technologies that seem to accompany automated vehicle development, including, in particular, electric vehicles. There is the issue of change in vehicle ownership and the fact that significant private equity may be freed up in the years to come. Will we as individual consumers still own vehicles if there is an automated fleet available to us? Are we responsible for registering them? Will we be responsible for maintaining them? Will we, therefore, need to insure them; and, if not us as individual consumers from a property and personal insurance perspective, who might take up that responsibility?


So our recommendations include a working party with industry and academia to identify specific industry needs, covering: consideration of people with a disability, older Australians and regional Australians; trials of automated vehicles; consistency and regulation across the states, standardisation of road infrastructure in the future across the states to accommodate automated vehicles; the need to work with software and motor vehicle manufacturers; proper public engagement about what this means to all of us; and consideration, as I said, of employment ramifications as well as data security, legal liability and insurance implications in the future.


I thank most sincerely our secretariat for the fascinating program they arranged for this inquiry so that we could truly understand the social issues associated with automated vehicles of the future and the necessary areas for future research and development. I also appreciate the truly bipartisan approach that this committee took to this important area that will impact on all of us in the future and most definitely on all of the communities that we represent in this place.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (17:12):  This is an excellent report. I must at the outset commend the Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources for putting this report together. It is exactly the type of report that is required in a place like this, giving us the opportunity to lift ourselves from day-to-day skirmishes and think about things that will affect our communities across the country, be they city or region based, in the longer term and how we manage that change. So I wanted to commend the committee itself and echo the complimentary remarks made about the secretariat. In particular, I wanted to thank my opposition colleagues who were on that committee. I thank the member for Solomon, the member for Lyons and also the member for Wills for their contribution. 


The reality is that driverless vehicles are coming. They are around the corner. In the next few years, it is more and more likely that you are going to be driving alongside a vehicle that is autonomous. For some people, it will be novel and different. For others, it will be a time saver and a stress saver. But it will also pose a challenge. Not only will it pose a challenge to the 250,000 Australians that earn their living from driving—the truck driver, the bus driver, the taxidriver—but it could also have an impact in ways we haven't considered. These vehicles are likely to actually make an impact on those terrible accident statistics that we see—for example, the human factor believed to be the cause or an influence in 90 per cent of accidents, and the 1,200 Australians who die from car accidents each year. If autonomous or driverless vehicles improve safety then that is a great thing. What impact will that have, for example, on police, who may not necessarily have to be called out so often to accidents, or on emergency departments, who might no longer be required to staff in a particular way as a result of the tragic accidents that occur on our roads?


It goes right down to salespeople when you consider that these days we are more and more prepared to buy a vehicle or other things online without seeing the product. Look at the extraordinary demand for Tesla vehicles—they didn't necessarily need a salesperson to explain to people why these vehicles were necessary. This will change the way in which vehicles are purchased. This is going to have a big impact. 


Are we ready? Are we thinking about this change? The answer is no. We can see a future where cars can drive themselves, but we have in this country no direction. No-one—in particular, this government—is plotting how the country will manage the impact of automation. This change is coming. Automation, we know, will affect a large number of jobs. About 13 out of 19 Australian industry sectors are going to be affected by technological change in some shape or form, and there is absolutely no evidence that we are preparing for this. This is a great report, but the threat to this report is that it will gather dust like other reports before it that have talked about the need to prepare. Those who wrote the report have given a lot of thought to this and have talked to a lot of people. They have come up with some excellent conclusions. The worst thing that can happen to this report is that its recommendations are ignored. We should be very concerned about that.


I have been to Palo Alto and I have sat in driverless vehicles in two forms—there are the ones where someone is behind the wheel, ready to take over, but there are other vehicles that have absolutely no dashboard whatsoever and can drive completely on their own. These are being developed by tech giants like Google. Uber is investing a lot in this in the United States. A lot of firms are thinking about driverless vehicles. It will change the model of car ownership. For example, with ridesharing you can potentially foresee a future where people will be using someone else's vehicle, an autonomous or driverless vehicle, and the cost of using that vehicle will already be sorted out through ridesharing apps that are already in existence right now. What is the impact of that on cities, on the way that we roll out our infrastructure, the way that we move people on our roads and the way we invest to deal with that? You can see that cities will change shape, and it will challenge urban planning as well in the longer term. How are we prepared for that type of event? 


All this will prompt a huge data challenge. Ford, as the report points out, is going to spend $200 million converting an assembly plant into a data processing facility. The CEO of Intel figures that for every eight hours that an autonomous vehicle is operating it is going to generate 40 terabytes of data. This is huge. How will that data be used, and what are the protections in place to prevent people hacking into cars? What's the safety impact of that? There was an instance where a Fiat Chrysler Jeep was deliberately hacked to test the vulnerabilities of the system. It drove off by itself, and then it had the brakes slammed on by another person with a laptop sitting some distance away. They were able to demonstrate that, despite the manufacturer's claims that the vehicle was safe, it could be hacked. People are going to be concerned about the vulnerability of these vehicles. 


We have other concerns about what standards will be enforced and what leadership role government will have. The report traverses legal liability, safety issues, even things like the future of drivers licences and how prevalent drivers licences will be in a future where autonomous vehicles can make their own decisions about how they operate. We've heard already the benefits for mobility, for people who are not able to drive—particularly older people, who will lose their licences due to advancing age. This may open up mobility to people in that type of circumstance. Public transport applications are also important. 


The report devotes a significant amount of time to the employment impacts that these developments might bring. I touched on some of these earlier. There are two things, involving what the government isn't doing and what the government is doing, that will have an impact on employment. While the committee was bipartisan on this, and I respect that, the government do need to be held to account for this. First, they aren't providing any further thought on the impact of automation on work. The employment minister last year released a report that had been authored by the CSIRO—Tomorrow's digitally enabled workforce. I know for a fact that this report is just gathering dust in the Department of Employment. This is not good for the nation in the longer term. What the government are doing that will have an impact is currently cutting $20 billion from support for schools. They already cut $600 million from TAFEs. We are now considering legislation that will cut investment in universities. Automation is going to demand a higher level of skills to be possessed by Australians. At a time when automation will demand a higher level of skills, to deny investment in this area is not only economically irresponsible; it is socially irresponsible as well. The government have to be held to account for that. 


I will end on this quote. When you look at technology—



Government members interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  They have a lot of time to interject but no time to think and no time to act—that's what happens from those opposite. The critical quote that was contained in this report was from Dr Matt Wenham of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, who said that when you look at new technologies, social licence is the key. He said:


Pick your technology; the issue is rarely with the technological aspects—that will be resolved with research that is going on in markets and that sort of work—it is around social acceptance and social licence. If the conversation is not structured properly with the community and people do not understand the issues around this and are not able to feel that they can have a say in how these technologies are deployed, you will have the sort of problems that you had with other technologies. We should not underestimate that social licence.


He is absolutely right. This is a conversation we need to have more with the public. We need to focus more on this issue, but more than anything else we need to prepare. The government is holding back the longer term benefit of automation and technological change, and it's increasing the risk of the downside on people. We as a nation cannot afford that. I commend the report, but I certainly condemn the government for their inaction in this space. 


Debate adjourned.

These vehicles are likely to actually make an impact on those terrible accident statistics that we see—for example, the human factor believed to be the cause or an influence in 90 per cent of accidents, and the 1,200 Australians who die from car accidents each year. If autonomous or driverless vehicles improve safety then that is a great thing. What impact will that have, for example, on police, who may not necessarily have to be called out so often to accidents, or on emergency departments, who might no longer be required to staff in a particular way as a result of the tragic accidents that occur on our roads?


It goes right down to salespeople when you consider that these days we are more and more prepared to buy a vehicle or other things online without seeing the product. Look at the extraordinary demand for Tesla vehicles—they didn't necessarily need a salesperson to explain to people why these vehicles were necessary. This will change the way in which vehicles are purchased. This is going to have a big impact. 


Are we ready? Are we thinking about this change? The answer is no. We can see a future where cars can drive themselves, but we have in this country no direction. No-one—in particular, this government—is plotting how the country will manage the impact of automation. This change is coming. Automation, we know, will affect a large number of jobs. About 13 out of 19 Australian industry sectors are going to be affected by technological change in some shape or form, and there is absolutely no evidence that we are preparing for this. This is a great report, but the threat to this report is that it will gather dust like other reports before it that have talked about the need to prepare. Those who wrote the report have given a lot of thought to this and have talked to a lot of people. They have come up with some excellent conclusions. The worst thing that can happen to this report is that its recommendations are ignored. We should be very concerned about that.


I have been to Palo Alto and I have sat in driverless vehicles in two forms—there are the ones where someone is behind the wheel, ready to take over, but there are other vehicles that have absolutely no dashboard whatsoever and can drive completely on their own. These are being developed by tech giants like Google. Uber is investing a lot in this in the United States. A lot of firms are thinking about driverless vehicles. It will change the model of car ownership. For example, with ridesharing you can potentially foresee a future where people will be using someone else's vehicle, an autonomous or driverless vehicle, and the cost of using that vehicle will already be sorted out through ridesharing apps that are already in existence right now. What is the impact of that on cities, on the way that we roll out our infrastructure, the way that we move people on our roads and the way we invest to deal with that? You can see that cities will change shape, and it will challenge urban planning as well in the longer term. How are we prepared for that type of event? 


All this will prompt a huge data challenge. Ford, as the report points out, is going to spend $200 million converting an assembly plant into a data processing facility. The CEO of Intel figures that for every eight hours that an autonomous vehicle is operating it is going to generate 40 terabytes of data. This is huge. How will that data be used, and what are the protections in place to prevent people hacking into cars? What's the safety impact of that? There was an instance where a Fiat Chrysler Jeep was deliberately hacked to test the vulnerabilities of the system. It drove off by itself, and then it had the brakes slammed on by another person with a laptop sitting some distance away. They were able to demonstrate that, despite the manufacturer's claims that the vehicle was safe, it could be hacked. People are going to be concerned about the vulnerability of these vehicles. 


We have other concerns about what standards will be enforced and what leadership role government will have. The report traverses legal liability, safety issues, even things like the future of drivers licences and how prevalent drivers licences will be in a future where autonomous vehicles can make their own decisions about how they operate. We've heard already the benefits for mobility, for people who are not able to drive—particularly older people, who will lose their licences due to advancing age. This may open up mobility to people in that type of circumstance. Public transport applications are also important. 


The report devotes a significant amount of time to the employment impacts that these developments might bring. I touched on some of these earlier. There are two things, involving what the government isn't doing and what the government is doing, that will have an impact on employment. While the committee was bipartisan on this, and I respect that, the government do need to be held to account for this. First, they aren't providing any further thought on the impact of automation on work. The employment minister last year released a report that had been authored by the CSIRO—Tomorrow's digitally enabled workforce. I know for a fact that this report is just gathering dust in the Department of Employment. This is not good for the nation in the longer term. What the government are doing that will have an impact is currently cutting $20 billion from support for schools. They already cut $600 million from TAFEs. We are now considering legislation that will cut investment in universities. Automation is going to demand a higher level of skills to be possessed by Australians. At a time when automation will demand a higher level of skills, to deny investment in this area is not only economically irresponsible; it is socially irresponsible as well. The government have to be held to account for that. 


I will end on this quote. When you look at technology—



Government members interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  They have a lot of time to interject but no time to think and no time to act—that's what happens from those opposite. The critical quote that was contained in this report was from Dr Matt Wenham of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, who said that when you look at new technologies, social licence is the key. He said:


Pick your technology; the issue is rarely with the technological aspects—that will be resolved with research that is going on in markets and that sort of work—it is around social acceptance and social licence. If the conversation is not structured properly with the community and people do not understand the issues around this and are not able to feel that they can have a say in how these technologies are deployed, you will have the sort of problems that you had with other technologies. We should not underestimate that social licence.


He is absolutely right. This is a conversation we need to have more with the public. We need to focus more on this issue, but more than anything else we need to prepare. The government is holding back the longer term benefit of automation and technological change, and it's increasing the risk of the downside on people. We as a nation cannot afford that. I commend the report, but I certainly condemn the government for their inaction in this space. 


Debate adjourned.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (17:22):  Since I was elected to parliament four years ago, there has rarely been a week in my electorate office when we haven't received complaints about inadequate television reception. I have been actively campaigning for improved communication services in the Lake Macquarie and Central Coast regions, and I have continuously called upon the Minister for Communications and the government to help me in resolving the issue. However, the people of Shortland have been continually ignored by this government. These residents have a right to expect decent television, as television provides us access to news and a connection to our community with locally produced content from regional broadcasters. It is particularly important for people who are elderly and isolated, as free-to-air television remains the most accessible form of telecommunications. 


Inaction by the government prompted me to launch a digital television survey to gain further feedback on the state of television services in Shortland. I received 227 responses, which provided a small snapshot of the area and problems we are experiencing. However, hearing these stories has been overwhelming. So many people have told me they are frustrated and angry, and many have exhausted all their options. I found from the survey that the transition to digital has seen a large decline in satisfaction with television reception. The proportion of respondents who were satisfied with their television service dropped from 83 per cent with analog to 54 per cent with digital since the transition. That's a drop of 30 percentage points. Of the respondents who have had a technician out to improve their service, more than half saw little or no improvement. Let me repeat that: more than half the people who have taken action to get a technician out still can't improve their service.


One example is Mrs Flanagan from Belmont, who has had several technicians out to try and improve her reception since the switch to digital, but nothing has helped. She looks after her grandchildren and is unable to access ABC KIDS for them because of the poor reception. Mrs Flanagan applied to the Australian government to receive access to VAST, viewer access satellite television, to resolve the issue but was rejected because of the new transmission tower in Belmont North. However, multiple technicians have explained to her the new tower offers her no improvement. Another example is Mr Hedley from Caves Beach, who has digital reception so bad that he's had to pay for VAST equipment to be installed. The ability to watch television came at a considerable expense to him. I do not believe it is reasonable or fair that these residents are forced to invest in a satellite service simply to replace what has been delivered for nearly half a century for free. Due to the nature of satellite television, Mr Hedley is now excluded from access to local news content from the NBN channel. 


The government has been aware of the issues for years, as this matter was first raised by me in 2014. In the years since, the government's response to my attempts to resolve the issues have been appalling. I have asked both the former and the current Minister for Communications to refer the digital television issues to the Australian Communications and Media Authority for field testing and for the government and regional broadcasters to start working together to find a solution to these problems. This has not been done. In an act of political hypocrisy,  half a million dollars of federal funding was allocated to upgrading the television transmitter in the nearby Paterson electorate in 2015 in a vain attempt to keep the former member for Paterson in that seat. That failed miserably and the seat was won by Labor in the 2016 election. I had hoped that the then communications minister, the now Prime Minister, would do the same for the people of Shortland, but instead they were ignored. He literally drove through my electorate—which is facing similar or worse television reception problems as those the electorate of Paterson is facing—to make this announcement, which showed outrageous pork-barrelling of a coalition seat. The people I represent deserve better than that. 


Access to basic services like free-to-air television reception in towns less than an hour and a half from Sydney is a basic right of a developed nation. It is a right that should not be politicised. It is a right that is actually fundamental to democracy. This isn't just about watching entertainment. So many constituents in my area get their news from television. That is the way they form conclusions about the political process and it helps them make decisions about who to vote for in elections. They have a right to get free-to-air television. Let me repeat: we are an hour and a half from the largest city in Australia. The fact that so many of my constituents cannot get adequate television reception is a disgrace. And the regional broadcasters must share some responsibility. Media reform legislation that is going through this parliament right now will increase the profitability of those broadcasters. They should invest in television reception for their customers. It is a basic right. To my constituents I say that I will continue to campaign for greater telecommunication services and I will not rest until we get the services we deserve from this unsympathetic and incompetent government. 


I will turn to another communications issue, and that is the appalling rollout of the National Broadband Network in my electorate. The most up-to-date figures from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman show that the postcode with the second highest level of complaints is that of Belmont in my electorate, which also happens to be where my electorate office is located. There are three postcodes on the Central Coast in the top 10 regarding complaints—another of the areas I represent. Let me repeat that: the second highest number of complaints comes from a suburb in my electorate, and three suburbs on the Central Coast, an area I represent, are in the top 10. 


The New South Wales Business Chamber has released disturbing figures about the impact of the botched rollout on small business. The chamber recently conducted a survey and found that 43 per cent of businesses reported they were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the NBN. Thirty-nine of those surveyed reported having to wait more than four weeks for their NBN connection to come online. My electorate office is constantly being contacted by constituents complaining about the rollout of the NBN. Indeed, just last week I was advised that, in a suburb where there had been a full rollout, there is one street which won't have access until 2020. The current Prime Minister—and who knows how long he will last for—is responsible for this mess. He was the shadow minister for communications and then the Minister for Communications and the Arts and he came up with this ridiculous fibre-to-the-node concept—a ridiculous concept that he promised would be rolled out in half the time of fibre-to-the-premises and would deliver comparable speeds. Nothing could be further from the truth. The cost of the rollout has doubled, the speeds are appalling, the service is appalling and my constituents, like constituents around the country, are up in arms. I say this to members opposite: if they claim to represent their electorates they will be voicing the same concerns. Their government is responsible for a botched NBN rollout—a rollout that is putting businesses at risk.


Let me give you another example. A constituent of mine who sells boats had to sleep in his boat dealership for a month because the NBN cut off his alarm system. He was so concerned about the security of his stock, which was worth millions of dollars and was quite portable, by definition, that he had to sleep in his office for a month. Those opposite show contempt for constituents by defending this botched NBN rollout. It will be a national shame and will be the subject of a National Audit Office report in no time—a report that I'm sure will find an incredible waste of money, overpromising of speeds and services and an underwhelming delivery of those services. Communications remains an incredibly important part of my electorate.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CONROY:
  I hear all the yapping over there from the member for Maranoa, who's been here five minutes and can't keep his mouth shut.



Government members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Maranoa!




Mr CONROY:
  He's a cheap shots merchant and a man without any credibility. I'll return to the point. Communications are incredibly important to my electorate, like every other electorate in this country, and this government has botched it up. There's no greater symbol of the fizzer we have as Prime Minister than the communications errors he made when he was communications minister, which continue to dog him. They will hang around his neck like a millstone, because that's what they are. They symbolise an incompetent government—a government unable to deliver—and a government that is not delivering the services one would expect in a developed Western nation. I'm very proud that my party took to the last election very strong communications policies that would have fixed a lot of these problems, and I'm confident that we will take policies to the next election that will do the same thing. I continue to fight for my constituents' communications access: access to free-to-air television—which is a right in a developed Western nation—and access to high-speed broadband, which is not just important from an entertainment point of view but also for doing business, for e-commerce, for education and for e-health. These are things that are incredibly important in an advanced economy, which this government is botching and will continue to botch until we chuck them out.
