"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-26,"—I table a regulation impact statement relating to the explanatory memorandum to this bill, and I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to this bill. This memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 3 March 1998.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  provides yet another example of the poor management by the government of its legislative program and the unreasonable delay that taxpayers face in the implementation of announced decisions by the government in the taxation field. Some measures in this legislation were announced in early 1997, which is more than a year ago, and some were announced in the 1996 budget—that is, more than 18 months ago.
This bill before us today contains an example of gross indolence on the government's behalf. There are some important anti-fraud measures relating to computers and to sales tax. That is a serious problem. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that he would be acting against these fraudulent practices in the 1996 budget—as I said, that was over 18 months ago, and this bill comes before us now.
Labor supports this crackdown, and we will be supporting the measures contained in the bill. However, we are entitled to ask why it has taken so long for such an important measure to come to parliament. How much revenue, for example, has been lost because of the delay? Have any law-abiding businesses, which the government claims will be assisted by this legislation, been, for example, put out of business by the totally unreasonable delay in cracking down on the alleged cheats in some areas of the computer industry?
All we have had from the government is complete silence on those points. We know that last year there were pleas from some sections of the industry to pass the bill quickly to address the problem, but the government just arrogantly ignored them. After much delay from the original announcements of the policy, this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 23 October last year. The opposition was then told that the bill was urgent and would be debated during the next week. This gave us literally the minimum time possible to go through the processes of considering the legislation and then debate the issues in the House.
Despite this totally unreasonable approach by the government, due to the representations by various interest parties, we agreed to pass the legislation expeditiously in the House of Representatives, and we proceeded to do that. This occurred on 28 October, but we noted that some important matters needed to be considered by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee before we were fully satisfied with those proposals. The committee process followed and it reported in early December—three months ago—in plenty of time to be 
 considered by the Senate prior to the rising of the Senate last year.
The reason the opposition believes this bill should have been considered last year comes from being sympathetic to the major beneficiaries of the legislation—namely, those honest firms in the computer industry who were suffering unfair competition from the unscrupulous operators committing sales tax fraud and those infrastructure providers who were wanting to have certainty concerning the infrastructure borrowings regime that is to apply. So Labor happily cooperated with the unreasonable request in an effort to get the issues settled quickly. What happened? The government then did not consider the issues important enough to proceed with, even though it was given all reasonable opportunity to do so. This slovenly approach to important legislation is simply another reason why the government is faring so poorly in the eyes of the Australian public.
Having dealt with the appalling processes preceding this debate, let me now turn to the provisions of the bill. This was the fifth omnibus taxation bill for 1997 but, due to the government's mismanagement, it will only be enacted in 1998. It covers a very wide variety of issues. As well as the sales tax proposals designed to combat fraud relating to computers and related equipment, there are very important capital gains tax provisions which are designed to assist small business. In addition, the government's new and totally inadequate infrastructure borrowing provisions, which again have taken more than a year to be considered by the Senate, are also in the bill.
There are a litany of problems with this proposal compared with Labor's previous scheme. Some of these are: firstly, the funding is completely inadequate. Only $38 million has been allocated for this financial year and an ongoing maximum commitment of $75 million has been set. Basically the government has abandoned the commitment to assist in the private provision of necessary public infrastructure. This compares with the $200 million program introduced by Labor.
Secondly, the scope of the infrastructure projects which can be assisted under the 
 scheme is totally inadequate. This new regime is limited to only road and rail projects as well as transitional arrangements to make up for the damage caused to those projects which were retrospectively thrown out of the previous infrastructure borrowings scheme.
Thirdly, important regional development projects have been delayed or put on hold because of the uncertainty associated with the unreasonable delay concerning this legislation, and the much reduced scope of the new infrastructure borrowings proposal shows that the government really does not want to assist regional development but that the new scheme is merely a charade. To limit the projects to only road and rail projects is to effectively destroy the scheme. The Treasurer knows this and that is obviously what his aim is.
The new legislation excludes energy projects completely. So opportunities in regional Australia in some new and exciting areas such as wind and solar power, which still need some assistance to compete successfully with established power generation sources, are being sacrificed. Similarly, a key energy related stimulus to regional development is the extension and interconnection of gas pipelines throughout regional Australia. There are currently various projects on the drawing boards of the major utilities. Some of these would have been considered in the context of the previous scheme, but now the government has completely cut out those regional projects.
Similarly, the decision to exclude future water and sewerage projects is an inconceivable decision. The National Party is, with this legislation, supporting the removal of support for infrastructure to: clean up inland waterways and coastal environments, for example, by further investment in sewerage systems; to improve the drinking water quality for residents of regional Australia—surely I would have thought that was a priority for anyone in this parliament; and to improve the irrigation infrastructure, some of which is desperately in need of refurbishment for economic and environmental reasons.
In addition to the other changes to the scheme, the arms length arbiter under Labor's scheme, the Development Allowance Authority, has been replaced by the Minister for 
 Transport and Regional Development. So any objective assessment of projects will now presumably be replaced by the kind of pork-barrelling we are seeing concerning the Natural Heritage Fund. This is exactly the type of problem that Labor avoided by keeping the decision making process at arms length from ministers to try to ensure that only the highest quality investments would be assisted—that is, those projects that would proceed on their merits not because the minister could be persuaded to support subsidising a dubious local proposal for electoral advantage.
So here again the coalition has let down regional Australia. There will be few, if any, new projects under this new infrastructure borrowing regime, which does not bode well for the supply of infrastructure to regional Australia generally. We know this government has already cut the national highway funding program; they have cut the funding to Track Australia, that is the rail program—that is for urgently needed investment in rail—by around one-third; and they have cut the untied grants to the states thereby lessening the capacity of the states to invest in regional infrastructure. This new proposal is merely a further measure following the trend of neglect of this government to regional infrastructure.
The bill also proposes to broaden the capital gains tax rollover provisions. These provisions propose to broaden the CGT rollover provisions to allow a rollover where a business is conducted through a company or a unit trust and the company or unit trust is disposed of. Conceptually, this is a logical extension of the current rollover regime which only allows a rollover for the sale of a business when that business is conducted by an individual as a sole trader.
Taxpayers are entitled to ask: why didn't the government introduce an adequate provision in the first place? It must have known that the original proposals ignored the fact that hundreds of thousands of small businesses are conducted through companies and unit trusts and that therefore many small businesses would have been completely excluded from the change the government claims is so vital to small business.
Furthermore, the complexity associated with rollover relief almost beggars belief. This government says that they are interested in reducing complexity, cutting red tape, but their actions are always in the other direction. So far we have had legislation in three separate bills—the No. 1 bill, the No. 3 bill in 1997 and now the provisions of this bill. Why couldn't we have had a complete set of proposals for the parliament to consider in a more rational way? The answer is obviously that they were making policy on the run and had no idea how to properly design the concession.
As well as broadening the scope of the concession provisions, the bill actually contains amendments to the existing rollover provisions. So, despite having had 15 months from the election until the commencement of these provisions, which was last July, the full legislation has not yet been passed by the parliament and already the government is having to come back in here and move amendments to their originally flawed scheme. Let us not forget either that these amendments to the concession have increased the cost by an estimated $90 million per year, so the full cost of the rollover concession is now around $300 million per year.
The Treasurer is continually saying that the tax system is about to fall apart. He is continually painting a false picture that the revenue base is unsure and inadequate. We know there will always be a need to clamp down on tax avoidance and shore up the tax base that is threatened in various ways. We know that and have argued that. Rather than shore up the income tax base, as one would expect if it was in such poor repair—and that is what the government says it is—the government continues to introduce huge holes in the base. Let me give you five examples: family tax initiative of around $1 billion per year; health insurance rebate of $600 million per year; tax rebate for wealthy, self-funded retirees worth $70 million per year; the capital gains tax concession for small business worth almost $400 million per year; and a further $50 million per year in fringe benefits tax concessions. 
Labor is not saying that we oppose all of these initiatives. Far from it. What we are saying is that the rhetoric underlying the government's GST is demonstrably false. There is no crisis in Australia's tax base which is not manageable in the normal way. The only tax crisis facing Australian families will be if they are lumbered with a goods and services tax, something I can guarantee that Labor will not do. In evidence of that, we need more proof than the fact of the government claiming that they will be back in surplus in their budget next year. How can a government with a supposedly broken tax base be in surplus throughout the whole forward estimates period? This is especially ludicrous given that they have voluntarily sacrificed $4 billion from that tax base as I have previously outlined. There is no need for a regressive change to the taxation system in Australia, and the government knows that.
There are issues that need to be addressed, as there always will be, but we do not need to tax families' food and clothing in the process, which is just one part of the impact of a goods and services tax. Mentioning the goods and services tax brings me to the principal revenue matter in this legislation. The bill proposes altering the wholesale sales tax regime which applies to personal computers and related goods to overcome fraud. Wholesale sales tax evasion is apparently a significant problem in the computer industry. Apart from the estimated $80 million per year in evaded revenue, tax evasion also significantly alters the commercial environment through granting an unfair uncompetitive advantage to those engaged in fraudulent practices. I note a report in the Melbourne Age of 14 October last year about a man charged with fraud of over $1 million concerning sales tax on computers. So this is a serious matter which needs to be addressed.
 The measures in the bill will deny the current right to purchase computers and related equipment tax free unless the person has been accredited by the Taxation Office as a person likely to fulfil their proper taxation obligations. The regime has been decided in a generic manner so that other goods can be dealt with under the altered arrangement if 
 there is concern about fraudulent practices with these other goods. Interestingly, it appears as though the government has considered and rejected a multistage tax model—that is, a GST—to deal with this fraud. When faced with a problem that actually might be addressed by one aspect of a GST—that is, the fact that all purchases would be taxed—the government, at the behest of business, does not introduce the GST model of no exemptions but rather simply modifies the quoting procedure from the current unregulated one to one where taxpayers will have to be accredited to be able to continue to quote and hence defer the payment of wholesale sales tax.
 The real question is: why was this multistage tax rejected? We know from media reports on the development of the legislation that the government was trying for a GST style model but that it was rejected. Clearly this rejection occurred because industry would not wear the additional paperwork and costs associated with the cessation of the exemptions which make the sales tax system relatively simple to comply with. Even the government has rejected a GST style solution in this context even though we are constantly told that the GST will solve all of Australia's problems. This is further evidence that the GST is not the answer for Australia's tax system.
 A further proposal in this bill is converting a tax rebate under the CRAFT scheme to a cash payment to employers for certain classes of apprentices. The details of this proposal are unclear at this stage. On the basis that the proposal is revenue neutral, we will not be opposing the proposal. However, if the aggregate level of cash payments which are to replace the tax rebate granted under the CRAFT scheme are less than the tax rebates, this would indicate a lessening in the level of support for apprenticeships, and that would not be supported by the opposition. Finally, there are a plethora of amendments to the new Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to effect technical amendments and to align provisions in the new act with recently enacted legislation. 
I conclude by again deploring the dilatory nature of the government's urgency on this matter. That is a contradiction in terms. They said it was urgent last year. It has taken until now to arrive, some 18 months after they declared in the House of Representatives that they needed this immediately. I think there is a case to answer for the government that some businesses, particularly in the computer field, may well have suffered economic loss because of slowness to repair the provisions on fraud. If they have, then it is directly attributable to the government's failure to move swiftly to close off these loopholes. I think that is unfortunate, but the government should wear the blame. I have indicated, however, that we will support the passage of this legislation because something needs to be done in these areas quickly. I have expressed my views about other provisions in the bill. I move:
At the end of the motion, add "", but the Senate is of the view that the Government should withdraw and redraft Schedule 3 of the bill to properly address the adequacy of the funding for new infrastructure programs, as well as extending eligibility to projects beyond the transport sectors into the energy, water and communication sectors"".",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-26,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 5) 1997 gives effect to a range of measures which were considered by the Senate economics committee. At that time the Australian Democrats reserved full comment until the current Senate debate, but we did indicate some concerns. I will outline these concerns as a basis for fuller explanation of those amendments we will be moving in the committee stage.
We have previously outlined our position in relation to support for private infrastructure borrowing for land transport, during debate on the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill in 1996. We successfully moved changes to that bill to remove tax concessions for private urban road builders.
We can see no economic case for further tax incentives to encourage investment in road, a point very firmly stated in the 1995 Private Infrastructure Taskforce report by the government statutory body, EPAC. The Australian Business Monthly, in its July 1994 
 article, described toll roads as a `licence to print money.'
There is, however, a much better case which can be made for supporting rail transport. It may be necessary to provide tax subsidies to improve the viability of investment in rail, and the Australians Democrats will support this part of the bill. It should be noted, however, that the EPAC report found that direct public investment in infrastructure was more cost effective than public subsidies through tax concessions. Knowing the Treasurer's interest in limiting tax concessions, I would have thought he would have encouraged more direct public investment.
We are disappointed that this bill is being presented at a time when federal government financing of national rail infrastructure has still not been delivered. Despite government assurances of having entered a new era, the Australian rail industry remains hampered by a lack of infrastructure investment and a playing field markedly tilted in favour of road—or maybe I should say markedly cambered. 	The following figures speak for themselves. Between 1975 and 1997, successive federal governments invested $33 billion in roads, and a miserable $1.8 billion on rail. That is a bias towards road over rail of more than 18 to 1. Clearly, rail is the neglected child in the Australian land transport family. As the Australian Railway Association put it, rail is having to deliver 21st century service on l9th century infrastructure. Despite all this, Australia's interstate rail operators maintain a 40 per cent market share of intercapital road and rail freight—indicating the high demand despite the relative weakness of the infrastructure.
The coalition promised to revive rail and to provide $161 million to upgrade the interstate rail line, but they failed to deliver. They have said they will put up this commitment, by a further $75 million, to $250 million over four years. As yet, no money has been forthcoming from the government as these funds only become available on 1 July 1998.
In the case that this funding commitment is maintained and delivered, this is a step in the right direction. Even so, it will be insufficient to bring rail even near parity with road, or to 
 correct rail's severe infrastructure defects. The corridor from Adelaide to Brisbane, through Melbourne and Sydney, is substandard and in desperate need of substantial upgrading—particularly, I understand, on the route between Adelaide and Melbourne. Letting Australia's rail network decay further represents a huge opportunity cost on the existing invested capital.
The new rebate for land transport replaces the old infrastructure borrowings tax concession, which the coalition government abolished last year. The new scheme is much less generous, being capped at $75 million a year, and it is restricted to road and rail transport.
But the reasons for differentially supporting rail, in relation to road, go beyond economic and commercial arguments. Rail is more energy efficient and generally less environmentally damaging. I will quote from an article in the Economist, on 21 February 1998:
Investment in railways is growing because governments accept that the car, the train's chief competitor is running out of space. Congestion and pollution in many countries are now so bad that politicians are obliged to restrain road traffic either by price or by regulation. The economic balance, so long tilted against rail, is beginning to shift.
Australia is clearly experiencing these problems too, as any Sydneysider contemplating a purple sunset from their vehicle, marooned on a clogged arterial, will attest. The Economist  article went on to argue that:
. . . rail freight will revive in the twenty first century, but will not prosper against its road competitors until prices are properly adjusted to reflect environmental and other costs.
I will therefore be moving changes to the bill to delete references to road transport and to direct the capped rebate preferentially to rail projects. It is a direct challenge that we are making to government policy in this regard, and I hope that the Senate will support us in that matter.
I now move to consideration of the provisions of the bill which deal with the prevention of computer sales tax fraud. The Australian Democrats support the government's intention to eradicate loopholes which have provided some companies with an unfair advantage in selling computers on the basis of 
 fraudulent quotation of a sales tax registration number or exemption declarations. I acknowledge also the anticipated extra $80 million tax take, which I hope will be used to redress in some small measure the social deficit created by this government in such areas as health, education, social welfare and the environment.
The Australian Democrats have received a number of representations from small computer operators regarding the implementation of this measure. Their concerns should be well known to government. These relate to uncertainties as to the cost and difficulties of gaining accreditation from the Australian Taxation Office, as a bona fide vendor of sales tax exempt computer equipment. We are hopeful that the ATO will find ways and means of improving that accreditation process. Section 91K of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 5) allows the Taxation Commissioner discretion to refuse accreditation to a vendor on the basis that:
. . . the Commissioner has reasonable grounds for believing that sales tax will not be, or is unlikely to be, paid by the person.
I foreshadow seeking in the committee stage a demonstration from the Assistant Treasurer: firstly, that the new scheme will minimise compliance costs to a level that is a reasonable impost on small business operators; and, secondly, that the scheme will adequately protect the interests of small operators in relation to assessment of their applications by the Taxation Commissioner.
In relation to sales tax and computers, the Australian Democrats have received a number of representations to redress a change of interpretation of tax law by the Australian Taxation Office. Computers leased or purchased by schools are presently sales tax exempt. Until last year, the tax office read this exemption as also being extended to computers leased by schools to parents solely for the education of their children. These computers, the ATO has decided, are now subject to sales tax. The Australian Democrats are looking into this matter and are considering whether, at some future date, to move amendments to sales tax law. We do not, however, intend to move amendments to this 
 bill because we believe that the matter needs further consideration.
One of the reasons we believe it needs further consideration is that at present we are advised that supplying the exemption for leasing for schools could cost the tax office between $175 and $200 million, which translates back to about 500,000 computer units, we think. I think that such a figure is likely to be a gross exaggeration, but I still do think that large sums of money require us to take care on this issue. We would be appreciative of government looking into it and advising us further in due course.
We are mindful that parents of children at non-government schools would generally be more able to take advantage of those previous favourable tax arrangements for leasing computers than parents of children at government schools. Any action we take on this matter would try to ensure that government assistance would be directed fairly to allow computer access to children of all financial means and backgrounds.
The Democrats will also be moving amendments to this bill to redress the government's policy failures in the area of youth unemployment. These will be moved by my colleague, Senator Stott Despoja who has responsibility in that area. The Democrats will move firstly to extend the family tax rebate to the 46,000 families whose family income has been reduced by up to $60 a week as a result of the government's youth allowance deeming children unemployed up to age 21, or in higher education up to age 25, as dependants of their parents. Secondly, we will move an amendment to reverse the 1997 budget decision to cut after-tax subsidies for employers by $83 million for taking on apprentices by retaining the tax exemption for up-front incentives under the CRAFT—Commonwealth rebate for apprentices in full-time training—scheme.
Thirdly, we will move an amendment to prevent the education minister watering down training standards for apprenticeships and traineeships by allowing bodies other than state training authorities or industry training bodies to approve training courses. The need for these changes exposes, in our view, the 
 shoddiness of the government's training policy agenda to this date.
The Democrats' family tax initiative will start removing the inconsistency between government social security and tax policy where students up to 25 years are treated as dependent on their parents under the youth allowance parental means test, but are not treated as dependants for the purposes of the family tax system.
You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the youth allowance bill passed the Senate only after Senator Harradine received assurance from the Prime Minister that families would be looked after in tax reform. The problem is that the 46,000 families affected cannot wait that long. The youth allowance takes effect on 1 July and tax cuts which would assist that situation are likely to be several years away.
The amendment to reinstate the tax exemption for apprenticeship incentives will reverse the $440 cut in the value of the incentives for small businesses during an apprenticeship which the government estimates would save it $133 million. I will speak at greater length in the committee stage. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill with those amendments that we put.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-26,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  contains three major issues. The collection of sales tax on sale of personal computers is fairly non-contentious. It is something the industry has looked for in order to ensure that all businesses are on equal footing.
The next issue is capital gains tax, with an extension of the capital gains roll-over relief. Originally this seemed to be sold as a retirement measure to allow small businesses to sell their business without paying full capital gains tax and provide for their retirement, or to roll the money from a sale over into superannuation or some other investment vehicle. Then it was extended to rolling over in terms of sale of assets or a business to buy similar assets or businesses. But the criteria remained that the businesses must somehow be productive enterprises actually producing goods and services, and that the sale must be of those 
 businesses or active assets of those businesses, with the purpose of buying similar assets or businesses.
Now we see a further extension well beyond any normal sense of either rolling over a small business or selling a small business for retirement. The government wants to lose $90 million of taxpayers' money by exempting from capital gains tax some people who sell shares in their business, or to unit trusts which operate a small business. I know this will pass with ALP support, so I will say that I do not think, in this period of economic slash and burn of all social programs and crack-down on students, youth, the aged, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and anyone else who is vulnerable, that expansion of relief of capital gains is a good idea.
I recognise that it may help some people who could legitimately be called small business people. I wonder how many real battlers would be included in that. In any case, I think this is part of a general shift away from income based taxes and taxes on capital generally, and a shift of the tax burden to consumption. As such, this is a problematic measure and we will not support it. The prospect of a GST, by any name we care to give it, will directly increase the level of taxation paid by the poorer section of the community, all of whom must consume to live, regardless of their income. Unless we are talking about axing taxes overall, and therefore axing the ability of government to provide some public services, then we will have to put quite substantial taxes on goods. There is no way I will be convinced that anyone making less than the average weekly wage will pay less tax if the level of government revenue is to be maintained.
A primary reason to increase consumption taxes is precisely to increase the tax burden to ordinary consumers, so that it can be decreased to those who use their money as a tool for investment and creation of wealth. Further measures to reduce capital gains taxes are completely in line with that objective.
The third major aspect of this bill is the new infrastructure borrowing provisions. These are the flip side of the earlier changes last year to the old infrastructure borrowing 
 scheme in which the provision of incentives for private infrastructure provision for power, rail, sewerage and other areas were eliminated. A new scheme was announced which would provide funding only to land transport. When this occurred last year, there was a measure of outrage. Not only were projects such as co-generation facilities being axed from the scheme, but the major focus of the new scheme was to be government subsidies for private motorways. Even the Labor Party saw the folly in that. But this government loves roads and loves privatising things even more.
The Greens still find the changes unacceptable. Some of the projects in the old scheme were not ones we would support, but certainly there is an opportunity to include power projects that work actively to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Continuing support for co-generation could be augmented by support of power generation from renewable sources—wouldn't that be nice? This would be particularly beneficial in rural communities where often power generation is not by coal but by diesel generator. Many of the power plants in more remote towns are most likely to be operated by private industry since there is no commitment at all by public utilities to make sure these services are available at the prices we currently see.
There is significant scope for incentives for a wide range of projects which represent innovative solutions to significant and widespread technical problems facing our population. We need energy. We need to find ways of producing that energy without producing large levels of pollution which have both local and global impact. We also need to find ways for both remote homesteads and remote towns to have power without subsidising the massive expense of either overextended grids or diesel power plants.
We also need to address the problem of water. Water is in short supply and many rural towns have very primitive means of treating sewage or waste water. This waste water frequently ends up polluting both ground water reserves and rivers. There are significant improvements in sewage treatment that have been developed and are in use in 
 some towns. Support for such infrastructure projects are another area where incentives may be considered a real benefit. I would also like to point out that, since the problems of pollution from energy production and water use are common to any concentration of people virtually anywhere in the world, solutions we develop here have obvious commercial value, including export value—unlike private motorways.
Private motorways have seemed like a good deal to various governments, but more often than not the deals governments do to get such projects up mean that, if there is a profit, the private sector wins and, if there are problems, the public loses. Currently, there are a number of private motorways that are in very poor shape as a result of insufficient funds. In any case, from the Greens' perspective, we do not support a transport system in which each person wishing to go to work or to the shop has to go for several miles taking their own private tonne of steel around with them. This seems neither healthy and efficient nor sustainable. It is far better, first, to have an urban structure that supports walking or cycling rather than driving and, second, to have reliable, frequent and inexpensive public transport for journeys that are too long for walking.
We, therefore, support urban restructuring programs, such as elements of the previous better cities program, or support rail and bus services. To the extent that we can support any of the government's current infrastructure scheme, we can support only the rail section. We would like it to be pushed to explicitly include light rail systems, which form relatively inexpensive options for public mass transport.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-26,"—I rise to address one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 . I know that the general position of the Australian Democrats has already been eloquently outlined by Senator Andrew Murray on our behalf. Today we are debating an omnibus tax bill with which the Senate has a great opportunity. We have, I believe, a rare opportunity to actually make 
 an impact on this government's anti-unemployed policies. I wish to discuss only two aspects of the bill. The first of these is a measure it contains to repeal the tax exemption for apprenticeships and the second is a measure I intend to move to complete some unfinished business arising out of the common youth allowance legislation.
The bill before us proposes to eliminate the tax exempt status of payments under the CRAFT scheme—the Commonwealth rebate for apprentices in full-time training. Under this scheme, the Commonwealth pays $2,500 to employers as an incentive to take on new apprentices. Half of this was paid up front with the other half being paid as the apprenticeship progressed. The payment was tax free. However, in the 1997 budget the government announced that the tax-free status of CRAFT payments would be abolished. To compensate for this, employers would receive a $1,500 payment on completion of an apprenticeship. This, according to the budget papers, would return to the employers the `approximate value' of the old CRAFT exemption.
Immediately the Democrats were a little concerned that the new arrangements may not actually achieve this approximate value. Why? Because the numbers do not add up. The budget papers say that the abolition of the CRAFT rebate will save around $135 million, yet the replacement extra incentive payments will cost only $52 million. That is a gap of around $83 million. In other words, the value of incentives paid to employers will fall by $83 million over the next three years. So I ask the government: what is the `approximate value' in that? Where is it?
Take the case of a larger company or a larger business, the after tax value of the commencement and progression payments for an apprenticeship fall from $2,500 now to around $1,600—a drop of $900 tax. When the apprenticeship is completed, which usually takes around three to four years, the after tax value of the final payment will be $960. So the approximate value is achieved only three to four years later than it is now. Does the government honestly believe that that will encourage companies, specifically larger 
 businesses, to take on more apprentices? I doubt it.
For smaller businesses, the vast majority of which are unincorporated, the situation is even worse. The after tax value of early payments is reduced from $2,500 to $1,288—a drop of more than $1,200. Three to four years later, the after tax value of the final payment will be a further $773, but they are still worse off to the tune of $427 over the life of the apprenticeship. That I suspect goes some way towards explaining the $83 million budget saving.
So the question for the Senate becomes, why on earth should we cutting subsidies for apprenticeships by $83 million at this particular point in time. The Democrats do not believe it is an appropriate time to make such cuts, if indeed at all. Perhaps the argument would be acceptable if the number of apprenticeships was rising rapidly, but it is not. In fact, apprenticeship starts have fallen sharply over the past two years: from 49,742 in 1995 to 43,930 in 1996, to just 40,495 in 1997. Clearly, when apprenticeships are falling around 18.4 per cent over two years, now is not the time to be cutting incentives for new apprenticeships.
The second matter I wish to address—and I will do so in the committee stage; I will actually move some amendments following the common youth allowance debate—is that Senators may recall that, as a consequence of that new legislation as of 1 July 1998—and it is very difficult to estimate the exact number of families and young people who will be affected by these measures, but using government estimates, as we have all along—as many as 46,000 young unemployed Australians and their families will be left out of pocket. This is because the government believes that if a young person is unemployed then, obviously, they cannot be regarded as an independent adult at the age of 18. In fact, the government has set the age of independence for a young person who is unemployed at 21. Similarly, we find these ages of independence quite concocted as they apply to students, and that debate saw the redefining of the age of independence for a young person or a student as 25—quite outrageous. Youth allowance 
 eligibility is to be based on parental income, not the income of the young adults. So, if the family earns more than a paltry $23,400 per annum, then this government will start taking money away from them.
The Democrats believe, and we said this throughout the debate on the common youth allowance legislation, that this is a remarkable attack on Australian families—not only on young people, but on their families, specifically, lower and middle income families. Let us face it, $23,400 per annum is not even average earnings; it is a very small amount for a parental means test, or any means test for that matter, to kick in. But it follows on from the extraordinary decision in previous budgets to deem young Australians in higher education as, of course, not mature enough to be regarded as independent adults capable of leaving the family financial unit until they turn 25. That particular measure, which we strongly opposed, that is, the defining of independence at age 25 for young people in education and training, cost about 8,000 Australian families a collective $62 million this year alone.
When it comes to giving out income assistance, this government regards young Australians as children, still dependent on their families until age 21 if they are unemployed, up until the age of 25 if they are in higher education. However, when it comes to giving families some form of assistance, primarily in terms of family tax rebates or social security payments to keep their dependants, the government then changes its tune and says these people cease to be child dependants at age 18.
Clearly, there is a huge inconsistency in treatment here. Indeed, Senator Harradine was so concerned about this particular matter and the impact it would have on families that during the youth allowance debate he had a chat with the Prime Minister, and possibly the Social Security Minister, and the Prime Minister assured him that he would fix this problem in the context of tax reform debates and discussions. With his concerns alleviated, Senator Harradine then voted to cut the incomes of thousands of families across Australia. We do not know what is in that tax 
 reform package. We have had no guarantees from the government or the Prime Minister specifically. We have had no specifics outlined as to what might be in that package. We do not know when it will start. What we do know though is, that from 1 July this year, potentially 46,000 Australian families will lose money because adult children are regarded as dependants, but are denied access to the family tax rebate relief in respect of those children.
So, as an interim measure, until the as yet unspecified tax relief arrives or kicks in, the Democrats will be moving to extend to those families, and to the roughly 8,000 families who had their Austudy cut last year, the benefit of the basic family tax rebate. True, receiving a mooted $200 annual rebate after losing up to $90 a week youth allowance is small fry, but at least it is a start. At least it moves the definition of family in the tax system closer to the new emerging definition of family and adult status, independent status, the government is using in the social security system. I understand this government is all for consistency in legislation, so let us have a bit of consistency here.
The Democrats will be interested to see, of course, how Senator Harradine approaches this amendment to be moved by the Democrats. It is entirely consistent with his comments during the youth allowance debate and it provides some measure of relief to those 46,000 Australian families he spoke about so passionately during his speech in the second reading debate on the common youth allowance legislation. I certainly hope that all senators, including Senator Harradine, will not be parties to what we consider a mean-fisted approach by government that says we will include young adults in families to take money off them, but will exclude them when we are giving them some form of assistance.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-26,"—I will necessarily be brief in my summing up. At the outset, may I thank all of those honourable senators who contributed to the debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 . I need to respond, however, to a number of matters that 
 were raised by contributors to this debate and particularly to the accusation made by Senator Cook at the opening of the debate when he said that the government for some reason had delayed or stalled bringing on this bill. I must say I find that accusation to be—I will not say an act of hypocrisy, because that is unparliamentary—rather bizarre coming from the Australian Labor Party.
The history of this bill is that it was introduced last year. It is a complicated matter. We are trying to replace a failed piece of legislation from the previous government with a regime that is sustainable and delivers benefits to Australia. This bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. That committee delayed its reporting date twice—once from 25 November to 26 November and then further to 2 December.
If this chamber had dealt with the legislative program in a sensible way instead of taking days and weeks to deal with bills that could have taken hours, this bill would have been passed and certainty would have been returned to the people affected and Australia well before Christmas last year. The reason it is being debated now, halfway through the third sitting week of 1998, instead of in November or December last year, is that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber chose to speak for hundreds of hours on other bills making it impossible for this bill to be debated in 1997. Had Australian Labor Party senators and other senators decided to curtail debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill for a few hours, you would have been able to—
—Oh!
—For even an hour or two, Senator Forshaw.
—An unimportant matter, is it?
—No, it is a very important matter—60 something hours worth of importance. It is a matter of priorities.
I say to Senator Cook and his colleagues that they should not come whingeing to us that they cannot return certainty to taxpayers because we, for some reason, have not been 
 diligent in trying to get this legislation through when we have been asking for it week after week, day after day. They come in here and say that we have been in some way negligent when they spent 60 something hours on one bill. Last year, the Australian Labor Party ensured that the Senate spent 100 hours passing three pieces of legislation. The hypocrisy is breathtaking.
As Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, I know that we wanted Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) before Christmas. There was no way in the world that the Australian Labor Party was going to give it to us. We will probably have this debate when Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) comes in. If they have their way, they will delay Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) until late this year. In case they come in here and say, `Why didn't you do this in April?', I put it on the record that we want that bill passed before Easter. Labor is saying, `No, you cannot have it. We want you to send it off to a committee.' That bill was introduced last December.
—Have you finished your amendments yet?
—If you want to talk about amendments, Senator Evans, you go back through the Hansard  and pull up Senator Bob McMullan, senator for the ACT, and see how many entries you get about bringing in amendments to tax laws amendment bills in this place in the six years before you got here. Every day you would get a new amendment. The officers here would know because most of them were sitting here at the time.
It is complete hypocrisy for the Australian Labor Party to say that we could not get our tax laws through because we are a bit slow. We are ready to do Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) next week. We would have done Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) last December if those opposite had allowed us to do so.
There are a number of other matters that were raised in the debate. I think they are all matters that can be dealt with in detail during the committee stage. I therefore conclude by 
 thanking honourable senators for their contributions.
Senator Chris Evans interjecting—
—Senator Evans, there are two things that I have a close involvement with in this place. One is trying to manage the government's program through this place and the other is being Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. I know very well that we wanted Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and I know very well why we did not get it. For Senator Cook to come in here and say that it was our fault is absolutely absurd. If Senator Cook can say that with a straight face then he is a very clever man and he would make a very good poker player. I would like him on my side. What a joke.
There are other matters that were raised in the debate. We do not have time to discuss them now. I would like to see the second reading vote taken before the luncheon adjournment. I undertake to senators to deal during the committee stage with the detailed matters that were raised during the debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Amendment agreed to.

—Order! It being almost 12.45 p.m., we will move to the consideration of non-controversial legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we support the passage of the Ballast Water Research and Development 
 Funding Levy Bill 1997  and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 . A couple of my colleagues wish to make some comments on this very important legislation. I will make some brief remarks. The bills establish a levy to be collected from ships entering Australian ports to provide funds for the strategic ballast water research and development program. The levy amounts to be collected are of the order of $210 for bulk carriers and $140 for other ships, including tankers of 50 metres or greater in length.
The funds will be used for the purposes of conducting further research into the problems associated with discharge of ballast water and hull fouling on ships entering Australian ports. The research is directed to finding ways of improving the management and the treatment of ballast water. There have been identified serious problems associated with the discharge of ballast water in Australian ports. Indeed, in 1994, just prior to entering this parliament, I visited the CSIRO fisheries establishment in Hobart and saw some of the work being done there. I was given an excellent briefing on the harmful exotic species that can come into this country and be released into our waters as a result of the discharge of ballast water. In turn, those exotic species can devastate our fishing industry. I am sure my colleagues Senator Sherry, particularly, and Senator O'Brien will be able to comment further on the problems that have occurred in Tasmania in the shellfish industry and the fishing industry as a result.
This is also legislation that brings to fruition initiatives started by the previous Labor government. In particular, Senator Sherry was very involved in that process in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am conscious of the time and indicate, on behalf of the opposition, that we support the passage of these bills. We also note that the government has proposed minor amendments to the levy collectionbill—they are technical amendments—which we accept.",SENATE,<title>BALLAST WATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I have in my hand a sample of ballast 
 water taken from a ship. It was presented to me in my capacity as chair of the ballast water working group when I was parliamentary secretary. All I can suggest is that I would not drink it.
—It looks like good old Adelaide tap water.
—I can assure you, it is significantly worse than Adelaide tap water. What is significant is that there are 154 million tonnes of this water coming into the Australian jurisdiction every year.
I want to make a few comments. Obviously, we are speaking in support of this legislation, and I congratulate the government for the initiative of proposing a levy to support ballast water research. Australians have a very significant and justified interest in this issue. Until recent years, ballast water has not been recognised as a significant environmental issue but, fortunately, that recognition is growing.
Australia, as an island continent, has enjoyed relative isolation from exotic pests and diseases. As a major exporter, we are a net importer of considerable amounts of ballast water. In fact, 121 million tonnes—on the last figures I have available for 1991-92—was discharged from more than 6,000 vessels arriving in Australia's 40 ports. These vessels come from some 300 ports in 53 countries.
Seaborn transport is unfortunately a haven for unwanted aquatic organisms which effectively hitchhike their way around the globe. There are at least 15 unwanted aquatic organisms that have made their way to Australia via ships' ballast. Some of these are already having an adverse effect on the marine environment.
With respect to my home state of Tasmania, perhaps the best known of these is the Northern Pacific sea star, scientifically known as asterius amurensis—which is believed to have been in Tasmanian waters since 1986, causing havoc in Tasmania's shellfish farming industries—and a brown kelp known as Undaria pinnatfida from Japan, and that has spread along Tasmania's east coast, with a significant adverse effect on the abalone industry. From time to time, toxic algal blooms also cause 
 the closure of seafood production areas in various parts of this country.
Domestically, we are also vulnerable to the movement of organisms in ballast water between our ports. The introduced species that I have referred to relocate around the country in ships' ballasts. Any strategy must limit the risk of translocation of these and other introductions between Australian ports. Australia's efforts on this issue have seen ballast water placed not just firmly on Australia's agenda but also on the international agenda, and much has been done in this country in the last 10 years.
I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service which, more often than not, receives criticism rather than praise. They have been at the forefront of developments on ballast water and over the last decade they have been responsible for the organising of symposiums and conferences, and coordinating the work of the ballast water working group that I had the good fortune to be a part of. I must say, it was not an issue I had any particular interest in or even dreamt of becoming involved in when I entered politics. That ballast water working group set out a strategy for research, for the management, for the control of ballast water and the various unwanted aquatic organisms.
One of the central issues that we had to address was how to fund the research into the management of ballast water. Certainly, when we were in government, the working group received significant funding from industry. I cannot recall the figures in detail offhand, but I would like to acknowledge that the industry, and particularly the shipping industry, voluntarily contributed significant amounts of money towards the research into the ballast water problem.
At that time, we considered the option of a levy on the industry, and that is what is contained in the bills that we are now considering. It was felt, initially at least, that we should see what degree of cooperation we would receive from the shipping industry particularly in this regard with respect to financing, and then look at a levy at a later 
 date to assist the funding of research and management into this very important area.
Certainly, in considering a levy, it was felt that if the problem is to be dealt with in an equitable financial way, the entire industry would have to pull its weight. That is one of the reasons why we are considering the levy strategy today.
As I said, ballast water management is a major environmental issue. I can confidently say that Australia is leading the world in respect of research and management of this very significant environmental problem. I am certainly pleased with the recognition of the work done when Labor was in government. I am also pleased to see this government continuing to prioritise ballast water research and management, as is reflected in the legislation we are considering today. It is a major environmental issue and it is pleasing to see that major recognition being continued by the government. It is a great pleasure to support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>BALLAST WATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-26,"—In following Senator Sherry, I think it is important to acknowledge that a number of people have had a role to play in this matter. Hopefully, I will touch upon the value of both Senator Sherry's and Senator Collins's work earlier, and that of the government in introducing this legislation.
We have before us two bills that, on the face of it, appear to be quite simple. The first, the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill, is to set criteria for, and details of, the imposition of a levy on certain ships entering Australian ports in order to provide funds for the strategic ballast research and development program. The second, the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill, actually imposes the levy on those ships.
While the bills are simple, the research effort they will fund—the development of strategies to prevent the spread of unwanted aquatic organisms through the ballast water released from ships—is far more complex and very important. Both the problem and the research effort under way to deal with that problem are very important to Tasmania because, as Senator Sherry said earlier, the 
 waters around Tasmania already suffer from problems associated with introduced exotic marine species.
Brown kelp, which, as Senator Sherry said, comes from Japan, was discovered on the east coast of Tasmania in 1989. It is a real problem for abalone sites as well as oyster and mussel farms. The North Pacific seastar, which has been present in Tasmania's Derwent Estuary since the early 1980s, is a problem which has spread along about 200 kilometres of the Tasmanian coastline, further putting at risk Tasmania's shellfish industry. It is suspected that both these pests were introduced by ballast water. 	So there is an environmental imperative and an economic imperative in Tasmania to develop strategies to ensure that no further exotic pests are introduced into our coastal waters.
As I said earlier, these bills are also important for Tasmania as we have in that state one of the top four major research centres in the field of ballast water research in the world—the Centre for Research on Introduced Marine Pests, CRIMP. It is vital that this research centre, which is located in Hobart, is successful in attracting some of this additional funding generated by the levy to continue its important work.
The centre has a key role in the Australian ballast water research program. In 1996-97 the program was funded by the international shipping industry and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. In 1997-98 the Commonwealth provided a further $1 million. This levy will provide a further $1 million per annum for the implementation of the program in 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
The outcomes of this research program are central to the development of effective ballast water management policies. The program is focused on the development of a risk assessment framework as an effective management tool for the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, other relevant agencies and state port authorities. As I said, CRIMP has played a central role in all of this.
Knowledge both in Australia and internationally regarding the scientific and technological issues relating to the management of ballast water are not well advanced. However, 
 because of the initiatives taken by the former government and now, I am pleased to say, carried on by this government, research in Australia is being accumulated far more quickly than in the past. Tasmania, through the Centre for Research on Introduced Marine Pests, together with the additional funding from the arrangements we have before us, will continue to be at the forefront of this effort to manage ballast water and the problems it brings with it.",SENATE,<title>BALLAST WATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-26,"—It is not normally the case for a piece of legislation like this to attract such attention, but I must thank my colleague Senator Ray for drawing my attention to this matter being listed on the business sheet because it is a very important piece of legislation. Having participated last year in an inquiry into marine and coastal pollution, I wanted to dwell for a few moments on the importance of this legislation.
The report on marine and coastal pollution that was brought down by the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee in October last year clearly identified the problems at our doorstep in respect of ballast water from ships.
My colleague Senator Sherry referred to some earlier figures. By way of an update on those figures, in order to look at the enormity of the problem—and this came out in a submission to the committee from AQIS—there are 150 million tonnes of ship ballast water discharged into Australia's 64 international ports each year by 10,000 vessels from 300 overseas ports. The AQIS submission went on to say that there are 34 million tonnes of ballast water being moved by domestic shipping each year from one Australian port to another. What we have here is a major problem at our doorstep. The report was fairly comprehensive in its analysis of the problems caused by ballast water. It stated:
There is no known case of successful eradication of an established exotic marine species.
The report went on to say:
According to SOMER, the most cost-effective treatment for infected or suspect tanks is ocean exchange of ballast waters by emptying and refilling ballast tanks. 

But it also went on to say:
Recent Australian research into methods of using heat generated by ships' engines to kill marine organisms in ballast water has been promising and trials are under way.
This bill adds to the research that will take place. That was one of the things that was highlighted to me in the inquiry—that is, the general lack of research that we conduct into our marine environment. So this is undoubtedly very welcome legislation that the government is bringing forward today, and I commend the legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BALLAST WATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-03-26,"—I thank honourable senators for their comments. It is important to realise that this debate has reflected the importance of research and development to the minimisation of the risks to Australia's coastal waters from the introduction of marine pests and disease pathogens via ships' ballast water. It has also recognised the very important contribution made by the shipping industry to fund research and development aimed at more effective ballast water management arrangements. I am pleased to see their support for resolving the risks which are posed by ships' ballast water to the environment. That support is to be commended and is testimony to the important partnership between industry and government, and it complements the government's commitment to Australia's coastal environment through the oceans policy and the clean seas initiative.
The legislation allows the collection of $2 million over two years for the strategic ballast water research and development program developed by the advisory council and administered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The research and development program has several exciting projects planned, and I only hope that the research projects do something to lessen the colour of the water that was demonstrated by Senator Sherry. That was indeed an alarming indicator of the problem we need to tackle, so I do thank him for providing that very graphic illustration.
It is important to point out that in 1990 Australia was the first country to introduce national ballast water management guidelines for international vessels visiting an Australian port as first port of call. This government has endorsed the management strategy and in 1996 appointed an Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council to advise and assist it in implementing the strategy. The research and development program is a key element of this.
It is important to point out also that this is the first voluntary shipping levy for ballast water research and development in the world and it will be the subject of discussion at the International Maritime Organisation meeting next week. We have also been prominent in that organisation in securing a target date of the year 2000 for the introduction of a mandatory international regulatory framework through a new ballast water annex to Marpol, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. This levy will make it possible to achieve more effective ballast water management arrangements and also enable us to work towards a total solution to the ballast water problem. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-26,"—The opposition supports the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . It is a bill which has changed its name since it was in the House of Representatives, when it was called the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997. This is because there was a government amendment which sought to remove the proposed reduction in the entry threshold for goods imported through the post, leaving it at the existing $1,000 threshold. That was to take into account the views of the current Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into the area—views which are also likely to recommend further changes in the future. We do not oppose the amendment which is now incorporated in the bill before the Senate.
The bill also seeks to amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to correct an anomaly in the exercise of Customs' power of the examination of mail arriving into Australia from external territories. The bill also makes several technical amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901.
As I said, these are minor amendments. We do not oppose the bill, but we do indicate that we acknowledge the reference to the Australian Postal Corporation in the bill. We recognise Australia Post as a successful government business enterprise and, in doing so, put on record once again our opposition to the National Competition Council's report into Australia Post—a report which recommended the dismantling of the reserve letter service, by opening up competition in the business and international letter market. Having said that, can I say that the actual amendments in this legislation are minor and we do not oppose them.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-26,"—The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997  is not considered to be controversial. I want to put something in perspective in relation to Australia's view and the international view on chemical weapons. I guess part of the pressure for the amendments in the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill is because of the international issues relating to Iraq, but that perspective should include reference to a report which was written by Alan Friedman, from New York, entitled The Middle East: Washington gave green light to Iraq sales . The report stated:
The official admitted that the equipment went to IRAQ because the policies of the Reagan and Bush administrations permitted trade and were aimed first at bolstering Mr Saddam Hussein during the 1980-88 war with Iran and later (in 1988-90) at selling the Iraqi president technology in an attempt to encourage him to be more moderate.
There seems to be some evidence that the Iraqi crisis in 1990 had some very important commercial considerations for the United States. The reason I mention this is that I do not think those commercial considerations are a thing of the past. I would like to read from a small, half-page article written by Paul McGeough, from the West Australian  newspaper, on 26 February 1998. He said:
While the struggle for control of chemical and biological weapons intensifies in the Gulf, another arms race has already been decided. The United States has a dominant role in the region's thriving arms bazaar, though Britain and France have also cornered a reasonable slice. The end of the Cold War in the 1980s heralded a slump for arms 
 dealers, until Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Since then the region has spent more than $130 billion on the most sophisticated weapons available. The Washington-based International Institute for Strategic Studies rates oil-rich Saudi Arabia as the region's biggest arms buyer . . . Second was Egypt, with more than $3 billion. The institute's figures show the US controlled almost 43 per cent of the international arms trade in 1996, more than the combined sales of the increasingly competitive Britain and France. More than two-thirds of US weapons sales are in the Middle East, where tension has been high through the 1990s because of setbacks to the Israeli peace process, concern about Iran's nuclear and missile programs, Iraqi intransigence and fundamentalist violence in Algeria. The White House has helped protect the interests of American defence contractors and their workers. Bill Clinton has become the first President to order expressly that the evaluation of proposed arms deals includes their impact on the defence industry. Under Mr Clinton, US contractors have consolidated their stranglehold on the world market. Contractors such as Lockheed have pressured the Pentagon for permission to upgrade the technology on offer to would-be buyers in the Middle East. The Washington Post reported last year that Mr Clinton urged United Arab Emirates leader Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Nahayan to buy American when he wanted 80 new jet fighters in 1995. A Pentagon team was dispatched to a big arms fair in the UAE. The US Army assistant secretary for research, development and acquisition, Gilbert Decker, worked the American pavilion to support big US contractors. Mr Decker told the Post: ""If we don't deal, someone else will, and it might not be in as controlled a Manner.""
Gosh, have we heard that before? The article continued:
But the UAE placed its first-batch order for 34 combat aircraft with the French dealer Dassault Aviation. The deal was expected to be worth $8 billion. US enthusiasm for the arms trade belies historic ironies. In the l970s, Islamic revolutionaries in Iran acquired US weapons, so the US and its allies armed Iraq—only to be facing their own weapons in the Gulf crisis. The renewed tension since then has prompted a flood of arms imports. Saudi Arabia is estimated to spend about a third of its budget on defence. Oman spends about half.
I would just like to make it clear that there are three countries in the world which are acknowledged as having chemical weapons. They are the United States, Russia and Iraq, but there may well be lots of other countries that have not come clean.
I just wonder when was the last time UNSCOM demanded to inspect the Pentagon in the United States. With all the hand-on-heart statements that we have heard about the outrage when United States weapons inspectors were not originally welcomed into the presidential palaces of Iraq, I just wonder whether or not this perspective has been put to the community of the world and the community of Australia.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-26,"—Madam President, on 24 March Senator Harradine asked me a question about 
 imported blood products. I have received an answer from Minister Wooldridge and I ask that the answer be incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
SENATOR HARRADINE: My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can me minister confirm that the CSL and the department are negotiating a lucrative arrangement which would be quite financially favourable to the recently privatised CSL? Will the arrangement involve the importation of plasma into Australia to allow CSL to establish a large blood products pool? If so, how can the government provide an absolute guarantee of protection for those Australians who are to be treated with products derived from plasma imported into Australia by CSL?
Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Could you confirm there are negotiations going on for the establishment of the large blood products pool by CSL? If so, then what consultations have actually taken place with blood transfusion services, hospitals, consumer organisations, relevant members of the medical profession and others? When is a final decision on this particular matter to be made?
Minister Wooldridge has provided me with the following answer. There is no intention to establish a large pool of blood or plasma products manufactured from foreign plasma for general use. From time to time small amounts of finished foreign product are imported into Australia for individual use when domestic products are not available or are clinically contra-indicated. In addition, between 1995 and 1997 an overseas Rh(D) immunoglobulin was imported to supplement a shortfall in domestic production
However, because demand for most plasma products is increasing faster than the Red Cross can collect plasma, there are currently no significant reserves of key plasma products. The Australian health care system, like many overseas counterparts, is vulnerable to a crisis that results in a major but temporary reduction in domestic supply or production. Patient lives can be put at risk if alternative products are not readily available. Therefore, contingency plans are being considered, including the establishment of a minimum national reserve of key products (which could be made from foreign or domestic plasma) and encouraging foreign manufacturers to register products for use in Australia in such circumstances.
Whatever strategy is adopted to deal with a critical shortage, the welfare of patients will be paramount and the use of foreign products, or products made from foreign plasma, will only be considered where 
 the Therapeutic Goods Administration is satisfied that the products are safe and efficacious.
Consideration of the options is at an early stage and a decision is not expected in the near future. Once the options have been fully developed, key bodies such as the Red Cross Society, State health authorities and medical colleges will be consulted. Minister Wooldridge would be happy to arrange for the Department to provide a more detailed briefing for Senator Harradine as the options are developed.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Imported Blood Products</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1

That the Senate take note of the report.
I table the 28th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation entitled Choice of Fund . The government's initiative to introduce choice of fund is considered by many people to be the most significant change to Australia's superannuation system since the introduction of the compulsory superannuation guarantee system. The government first announced its choice of fund policy prior to its election in 1996. Indeed, the coalition has long supported greater freedom of choice for superannuation contributors.
Subject to the passage of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997, of which this is part, from 1 July 1998 employers will be required to offer new employees a choice about where their compulsory superannuation guarantee payments are paid. From 1 July 2000, continuing employees who were employed prior to 1 July 1998 must also be offered a choice of fund.
The committee encountered considerable support for the broad concept of the choice of fund. Witnesses told the committee that a major advantage of the choice proposal was that it would increase awareness of investment alternatives and understanding of the need to plan retirement savings. It was also considered that implementing choice would require individuals to have greater knowledge of retirement savings options and increase 
 their motivation to understand its importance. With choice and control, individuals are more likely to feel a sense of ownership and take an active interest in savings for their retirement.
However, it is fair to say that many groups considered the government's timetable for introducing choice of fund to be very tight. Many witnesses questioned whether there is sufficient time remaining to put all the necessary arrangements in place. It was clear that there was deep division between the specialist providers of financial products who are anxious that choice proceed in accordance with the government's announced timetable and others who advocate a delay or propose that choice be optional for a limited period and that choice be limited to investment within a fund.
The committee found that there is general acceptance for the view that for the choice of fund proposal to succeed employees must be in a position to exercise informed choice. I should note that the government is also on record as having stated that it is important that people make an informed choice.
Informed choice requires that employees understand the consequences of the decisions they make and choose funds that best suit their personal circumstances and their requirements.Informed choice requires two essential conditions to be satisfied. They are adequate education about the choice of fund and disclosure by funds of all relevant information such as returns, risks, fees, charges that should influence the employee's decision.
In order to make good decisions employees may need education about choice of fund, its benefits and its dangers. Most witnesses called for education programs to ensure consumers make an informed choice. Many cast doubt on whether such an education campaign is achievable in the relatively short time before the legislation is scheduled to come into force. However, the government has assured the committee that the necessary education measures are being developed and will be in place.
Employees will also need access to useful, comprehensive information about the fund alternatives so that they may make valid 
 comparisons. The information about fund alternatives that funds and employers will provide to employees who are offered choice will be in the form of key feature statements. The form of the key feature statements has yet to be finalised. The government will shortly be releasing regulations that will determine their final form.
Key feature statements should incorporate clear warnings about the consequences of choosing a fund, such as the adequacy and coverage of the insurance and the possibility that insurance cover, where formally provided, may lapse. The statements should also incorporate a clear explanation about the relative risks associated with each option.
It is also likely that, despite the best efforts of education campaigns by the government and others, a large number of people will not exercise their right to make a choice of fund. During the inquiry the committee received evidence that many people will not be able to understand the concepts or the information put before them. It is also true that the understanding of superannuation in the general community still remains low.
People who do not feel able to make a choice or are unwilling to do so will have their contributions directed into a default fund. This default fund must provide adequate protection for those people who cannot or are unwilling to exercise choice. Several witnesses made recommendations to the committee about the desirable features of default funds. While the committee makes no recommendation in this regard, the default fund is a matter that responsible employers should consider carefully.
In closing, I think that the choice of fund proposal offers a number of opportunities and benefits. Employees will have the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to determine where their employer contributions go. They will be able to shift their future contribution away from under performing funds. However, it is important to emphasise that choice of fund does not mean that people feel obliged to change their funds. It is important the information provided to employees, who are offered choice, does not create an atmosphere that encourages change just for change sake. 
 Many people would be better off by staying with their current fund. We must, at all costs, avoid the mistakes made in the United Kingdom and Chile where choice of fund has led to many poor choices being made.
I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the staff of the committee, particularly the secretary, Mr Peter Hallahan, who has had to work extraordinary hours to meet the very tight deadline in getting this report to hand. I think it is a commendable report. Under the circumstances, it comprehensively covers the issues involved. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Superannuation Committee</title>,Committees,29,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-03-26,"—I join with Senator Watson in congratulating the staff of the committee, particularly Peter Hallahan, who had a great deal thrust on him when he was not quite ready for it. He has done a great job to get it all ready and tabled by today. I also acknowledge Senator Watson's comments about how comprehensive the report is in dealing with the evidence put before us.
The Labor senators on the committee have put in a minority report. We support the principle of choice but we do not believe that the government's preferred model of choice is appropriate or that it meets a number of principles, in that it does not ensure that employees make the choice. This is really about employer choice. The government's model takes the power to choose where their superannuation funds go from the hands of employees and gives it to employers.
There was a lot of debate, during the hearings about the purported economic benefits of superannuation choice. There was broad agreement among committee members and in the evidence that everybody favours investment choice. I do not think there was a great deal of argument: a lot of funds are already moving in that direction and we have seen evidence of the benefits of investment choice. The Labor senators are recommending that we introduce investment choice reasonably quickly, as a first step and as part of an education process, so that the people who own the money in the funds understand why they should pay more attention to their reports. Certainly, in my time as a superannua 
 tion officer, the greatest trouble I encountered was getting members to actually read the information that the funds supplied. That will be critical to a successful implementation of choice.
It would be fair—and kind—to say that there was a naive view about the benefits of the competitive process which would be unleashed by this legislation. When they appeared before the committee, I asked Commonwealth Bank officials if they could guarantee the price of their retirement savings vehicle—the RSA—would be the lower than it was today. Surely, I asked an official, if we have all these winds of competition, the cost to the consumer of an RSA would be reduced. He was not able to give me that assurance. In fact, he was quite embarrassed about the fact that he could not give me that assurance.
So I say to those who came before the committee and advocated choice—on the basis that the benefits will accrue to the customer—that the challenge is there to prove that it can happen. Many witnesses came before us and demonstrated why fees would go up and why returns would go down in the new world of competition. We heard evidence that funds would have to significantly increase—possibly double or even triple—their existing marketing budgets to compete in a choice environment. Funds told us their administration fee would almost certainly double to cope with these increases. Legal costs would be substantially higher under this new regime. To many people who currently get a very low-price product, the cost structures were going to be substantially increased.
The situation at the moment with returns is that superannuation is an allowable matter before the IRC. Therefore, the minimum award requirements, in general—in most industry funds, certainly—are that payments be made monthly by the employers. This government is seeking to take that out as an allowable matter. It wants to fall back on the minimum current requirements of the SGC legislation, which is one payment a year.
The difference between getting paid monthly and getting paid yearly was calculated, on behalf of the committee, by the Institute of Actuaries. Their supplementary submission 
 showed that, as a result, the return over a lifetime would be three to four per cent less. That one simple change, of taking away the minimum requirement of a monthly payment, had a compounding effect: not getting your money into your account monthly meant not getting the interest on interest earned. Just the one payment a year would see a three to four per cent less return, on retirement—just from one stroke of a pen. The results will be: costs up, returns down—that is the brave new world of competition of choice.
The most significant arguments the committee faced were over education; and whether or not the consumers—the workers, whose money it was—would be able to understand the information they would be supplied with. Under this legislation, when you go for a job now—after 1 July if you are a new employee—you will be faced with four key feature statements of up to six pages per set. Although I have spent four or five years in the industry, I know that I would never be able to wade through four sets of six pages—trying to understand and compare apples with apples. Other people who testified before the committee said that they too, after 17 years in the industry, were not able to make meaningful comparisons between the key feature statements from the super funds.
The government acknowledged the evidence before the committee that education would be a problem. We asked the government what test it was going to do before introducing choice, to measure the success of an education campaign. We said:
You are going to spend dollars and cents—taxpayers' money—to educate people about choice of fund. Acknowledging there is a problem—are you going to test the market to see if you have been successful?
To this day, the government still will not give a commitment to actually test whether or not people have understand and benefited from the education campaign. What is the point in saying, `We need to educate'; if you do not then test to see if you have been successful?
There is one point of concern beyond that. Twice now, I have sought information from the Taxation Office about the amount of money that the previous Labor government 
 spent—in 1992 and 1994—on its national advertising campaigns to publicise the benefits of superannuation. These are just statistics which should be readily available inside the Taxation Office.
A month later, I still have not received that information. I am told it has been given to Senator Kemp's office for Senator Kemp to decide whether to release, which I am very surprised about. You have to ask yourself why they will not show how much the previous Labor government spent on what, at that stage, was the biggest single change in superannuation policy in the country's history. This is as big, if not bigger. Why don't they want to tell us how much was spent on that last education campaign?
You can only conclude one thing: because the amount of money they are going to spend on this campaign is substantially less. They are not serious about an education campaign. If they were serious about an education campaign, you would be able to look at what happened in previous years and judge it against what they are proposing now. They will not give any indication of what they are proposing now. They will not give any indication of what was done before. That is very disappointing. I hope that information, perhaps with the help of some other senators in the chamber at the moment, is able to be more forthcoming than it currently is, because that is of real concern.	Finally, in the last couple of minutes remaining to me, I want to respond to a comment—
—A pretty quick couple of minutes!
—A very fast couple of minutes! Senator Watson referred to the default fund. This is critical. Labor senators believe there should be minimum default standards, minimum insurance cover and minimum investment choice. That means that if you are 17 or 18 years old and you do not understand the process or just decide it is all too hard and you get lumped into an RSA at 17, you are not going to be substantially worse off.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-03-26,"—I rise to speak on this report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannua 
 tion and to support the comments made by Senator Watson. In particular, I note that this relates to one of the most important pieces of legislation that will come before the Senate. It is a very important report. Choice of funds has been at the forefront of the coalition's policy for a number of years.
I listened carefully to Senator Conroy. His comments reflect the very narrow view which he has of industry, as seen through the industry fund. I do not know whether his comments related to the industry fund he belonged to and represented, but they represented a very narrow view of superannuation throughout Australia. There are many other people besides those in industry funds who are requesting and requiring choice of fund, and have been doing so for a long time.
I say to Senator Conroy that I know from my experience in the industry, which probably goes back a little further than his, although I know that his was extensive, that I came across a number of people in my time in the superannuation industry who were self-employed, particularly those in rural areas who, in order to supplement their income because times were so tough, would do some casual work for a couple of months of the year. They found that, although they had their own superannuation fund, contributions made on their behalf during the time of this casual employment had to be put in another fund, and in those days, by the end of the year, it had completely disappeared because of the cost of fees and charges. So there are many other people around Australia who are waiting for choice of funds to become available to them so that they can maximise the amounts they are putting away for their retirement income.	It may be that they have casual employment with three or four different employers and this choice of fund may enable them to make sure that all the contributions towards their retirement go into one fund.
I was amazed to hear Senator Conroy talk about education because, to the best of my memory, award superannuation came in in 1989. I think it had to be in place by 1989; I know it started earlier than that but I think it was about September 1989 before it became 
 compulsory and then in 1992 or 1993 the SGC started.
—Are you committed to a national TV program?
—If education was so important and if people are so ill informed in 1998, where on earth was the education that should have been put in place by the previous Labor government? Where was the education over a period of almost 10 years from the time when award super first came into being? The education process that was put in place by the previous government was practically non-existent.
One of the reasons why education did not matter was that many of those who were running industry funds did not believe that education was necessary because a person did not have an opportunity to make an informed choice. There was no need to be educated because the employee had no say at all, anyway, so why educate them?
—And keep it a secret. There is choice but it is a secret.
—We have to try to correct the wrongs of the previous government, which failed to educate employers and employees in regard to superannuation. We are now going to offer them choice. You will find that once people have some ownership of and control over their own destiny, they will be much keener to become educated.
Senator Bishop interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I listened carefully to Senator Conroy's contribution without interjecting, although I disagreed with much of what he said, so I would appreciate the same courtesy. As far as the principle of choice is concerned, we believe it is up to the individual to be entitled to exercise that choice if he so desires.
There need to be some safeguards, and that is why this government chose not to introduce unlimited choice, because there was pressure from some areas to have unlimited choice. That would have been very difficult to manage and that is why there is choice in the policy put forward by the coalition—enough 
 choice so that people will be able to choose for themselves what is best for their future.
Senator Conroy also made a statement which I found quite fascinating. He said that in the new world of competition, fees will go up and returns will go down. That shows how much experience Senator Conroy has had with the real world. He calls it the new world. I would say: look at the real world. I spent some time working in this industry at a time when fees and charges were exorbitantly high. It was partly because of competition and the work of industry funds that forced those charges and fees to come down. I think it was the best thing to happen to superannuation for a long time.
The world of superannuation is a very competitive business and people are getting good returns. People have fee structures which are more in tune with what should be happening with superannuation. In the long run competition will ensure that fees do not go up; fees will remain low. That will have some long-term effect on returns, so that returns will improve.
When talking about unlimited choice, we must remember that there will be unlimited choice provided the employer offers it. It is one of the options that employers can offer. A small employer with two or three employees may choose to give those employees unlimited choice, which will be in their best interests if they are casual employees and have other funds they can channel all their retirement savings into. If the employer is prepared to offer unlimited choice, that is the best way for them to go.
This report is very important because it has enabled us to gather information from all those people who have concerns. I am concerned about the opposition's tactics in trying to stall the legislation with respect to choice. We all know that the start-up date in the legislation is 1 July. Those involved in the superannuation industry need some certainty. The opposition's stalling of this piece of legislation is increasing the uncertainty in the community of both employers and employees.
The tactic of delaying the legislation for as long as possible in order to make it more difficult for those people involved in the 
 industry is one that the opposition should be ashamed of. Let the debate take place in the chamber. Let the chamber decide whether or not this legislation will pass—I do not know whether or not it will be passed—because then at least there will be some certainty for those involved in the industry, both employers and employees, so they will know on 1 July what their obligations and options will be.
It is incumbent on the opposition to push this legislation forward as soon as possible. Let the chamber make a decision. If the opposition waits until the budget session in May and this legislation is passed by the chamber without amendment, it is basically saying to all those people in the community involved in the preparation of providing superannuation as employers, or choosing options as employees, `We are going to limit the time completely so that you have less than two months to put all the arrangements in place and to make sure that any education process that needs to be put in place can be put in place.'
I urge the opposition to take a good look at itself in terms of the legislation which will be coming before the chamber and deal with it as soon as possible so that it knows what the outcome of the vote in this chamber will be. The opposition will be judged by the community on any stalling tactics that it uses. It is something the opposition will have to wear if it decides to delay the bill unnecessarily.
The report is quite a lengthy one. I think it is fair to say that the views of both sides expressed to the committee have been reported in great detail. Lots of people felt that the start-up date would be difficult and that a good education process needed to take place. This has been well presented and I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Superannuation Committee</title>,Committees,29,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank you for your indulgence in taking the chair so that I can speak in this debate. I did have the opportunity, in the absence of Senator Nick Sherry, to be a member of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and to partake in its hearings. I can assure Senator Ferguson and the government that by no means are these stalling tactics, in spite of how one may 
 interpret them from the other side. A welter of evidence was given to the committee that, regardless of the outcome, there should be a delay in the implementation of the issue of choice of fund. Senator Conroy has already outlined our position in terms of choice of fund. What we do not agree with is the model.
A number of important issues came before the committee in the taking of evidence. The most alarming, as far as I was concerned, was in the area of education. As Senator Watson who chaired the committee would know, I repeatedly asked of those appearing before the committee the problem in relation to literacy and numeracy. We were given evidence, which to my knowledge has not been refuted, that in the vicinity of 48 per cent of Australians, according to an ABS survey—so it was a reliable survey, one would hope—are at the bottom level in literacy and numeracy skills. They rest in level 1 and level 2 on a scale of one to five and it could be best said that they have difficulty in reading and doing basic computations which many of us take for granted.
—So we cannot introduce it until we have educated all of them?
—I am not saying that at all, Senator. What I am saying is that we have a difficulty if, as we heard in evidence—virtually universally—people must be in a position to make an informed choice. It was interesting to hear Senator Watson this evening use the words `informed choice' because I think that, across parties, everyone will agree that if a proper choice is to be made by those accessing superannuation, the proper choice must be on an informed basis.
It is on that basis that I am concerned primarily about the issue of education and the fact that 48 per cent have lower literacy and numeracy skills. What is even more concerning, however, is that in the vicinity of 2 million to 2½ million people are at level 1 or were at level 1 in that survey. To me, this means that the process of education, the process of making these people able to interpret—

When they appeared before the committee, I asked Commonwealth Bank officials if they could guarantee the price of their retirement savings vehicle—the RSA—would be the lower than it was today. Surely, I asked an official, if we have all these winds of competition, the cost to the consumer of an RSA would be reduced. He was not able to give me that assurance. In fact, he was quite embarrassed about the fact that he could not give me that assurance.
So I say to those who came before the committee and advocated choice—on the basis that the benefits will accrue to the customer—that the challenge is there to prove that it can happen. Many witnesses came before us and demonstrated why fees would go up and why returns would go down in the new world of competition. We heard evidence that funds would have to significantly increase—possibly double or even triple—their existing marketing budgets to compete in a choice environment. Funds told us their administration fee would almost certainly double to cope with these increases. Legal costs would be substantially higher under this new regime. To many people who currently get a very low-price product, the cost structures were going to be substantially increased.
The situation at the moment with returns is that superannuation is an allowable matter before the IRC. Therefore, the minimum award requirements, in general—in most industry funds, certainly—are that payments be made monthly by the employers. This government is seeking to take that out as an allowable matter. It wants to fall back on the minimum current requirements of the SGC legislation, which is one payment a year.
The difference between getting paid monthly and getting paid yearly was calculated, on behalf of the committee, by the Institute of Actuaries. Their supplementary submission 
 showed that, as a result, the return over a lifetime would be three to four per cent less. That one simple change, of taking away the minimum requirement of a monthly payment, had a compounding effect: not getting your money into your account monthly meant not getting the interest on interest earned. Just the one payment a year would see a three to four per cent less return, on retirement—just from one stroke of a pen. The results will be: costs up, returns down—that is the brave new world of competition of choice.
The most significant arguments the committee faced were over education; and whether or not the consumers—the workers, whose money it was—would be able to understand the information they would be supplied with. Under this legislation, when you go for a job now—after 1 July if you are a new employee—you will be faced with four key feature statements of up to six pages per set. Although I have spent four or five years in the industry, I know that I would never be able to wade through four sets of six pages—trying to understand and compare apples with apples. Other people who testified before the committee said that they too, after 17 years in the industry, were not able to make meaningful comparisons between the key feature statements from the super funds.
The government acknowledged the evidence before the committee that education would be a problem. We asked the government what test it was going to do before introducing choice, to measure the success of an education campaign. We said:
You are going to spend dollars and cents—taxpayers' money—to educate people about choice of fund. Acknowledging there is a problem—are you going to test the market to see if you have been successful?
To this day, the government still will not give a commitment to actually test whether or not people have understand and benefited from the education campaign. What is the point in saying, `We need to educate'; if you do not then test to see if you have been successful?
There is one point of concern beyond that. Twice now, I have sought information from the Taxation Office about the amount of money that the previous Labor government 
 spent—in 1992 and 1994—on its national advertising campaigns to publicise the benefits of superannuation. These are just statistics which should be readily available inside the Taxation Office.
A month later, I still have not received that information. I am told it has been given to Senator Kemp's office for Senator Kemp to decide whether to release, which I am very surprised about. You have to ask yourself why they will not show how much the previous Labor government spent on what, at that stage, was the biggest single change in superannuation policy in the country's history. This is as big, if not bigger. Why don't they want to tell us how much was spent on that last education campaign?
You can only conclude one thing: because the amount of money they are going to spend on this campaign is substantially less. They are not serious about an education campaign. If they were serious about an education campaign, you would be able to look at what happened in previous years and judge it against what they are proposing now. They will not give any indication of what they are proposing now. They will not give any indication of what was done before. That is very disappointing. I hope that information, perhaps with the help of some other senators in the chamber at the moment, is able to be more forthcoming than it currently is, because that is of real concern.	Finally, in the last couple of minutes remaining to me, I want to respond to a comment—
—A pretty quick couple of minutes!
—A very fast couple of minutes! Senator Watson referred to the default fund. This is critical. Labor senators believe there should be minimum default standards, minimum insurance cover and minimum investment choice. That means that if you are 17 or 18 years old and you do not understand the process or just decide it is all too hard and you get lumped into an RSA at 17, you are not going to be substantially worse off.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-03-26,"—I rise to speak on this report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannua 
 tion and to support the comments made by Senator Watson. In particular, I note that this relates to one of the most important pieces of legislation that will come before the Senate. It is a very important report. Choice of funds has been at the forefront of the coalition's policy for a number of years.
I listened carefully to Senator Conroy. His comments reflect the very narrow view which he has of industry, as seen through the industry fund. I do not know whether his comments related to the industry fund he belonged to and represented, but they represented a very narrow view of superannuation throughout Australia. There are many other people besides those in industry funds who are requesting and requiring choice of fund, and have been doing so for a long time.
I say to Senator Conroy that I know from my experience in the industry, which probably goes back a little further than his, although I know that his was extensive, that I came across a number of people in my time in the superannuation industry who were self-employed, particularly those in rural areas who, in order to supplement their income because times were so tough, would do some casual work for a couple of months of the year. They found that, although they had their own superannuation fund, contributions made on their behalf during the time of this casual employment had to be put in another fund, and in those days, by the end of the year, it had completely disappeared because of the cost of fees and charges. So there are many other people around Australia who are waiting for choice of funds to become available to them so that they can maximise the amounts they are putting away for their retirement income.	It may be that they have casual employment with three or four different employers and this choice of fund may enable them to make sure that all the contributions towards their retirement go into one fund.
I was amazed to hear Senator Conroy talk about education because, to the best of my memory, award superannuation came in in 1989. I think it had to be in place by 1989; I know it started earlier than that but I think it was about September 1989 before it became 
 compulsory and then in 1992 or 1993 the SGC started.
—Are you committed to a national TV program?
—If education was so important and if people are so ill informed in 1998, where on earth was the education that should have been put in place by the previous Labor government? Where was the education over a period of almost 10 years from the time when award super first came into being? The education process that was put in place by the previous government was practically non-existent.
One of the reasons why education did not matter was that many of those who were running industry funds did not believe that education was necessary because a person did not have an opportunity to make an informed choice. There was no need to be educated because the employee had no say at all, anyway, so why educate them?
—And keep it a secret. There is choice but it is a secret.
—We have to try to correct the wrongs of the previous government, which failed to educate employers and employees in regard to superannuation. We are now going to offer them choice. You will find that once people have some ownership of and control over their own destiny, they will be much keener to become educated.
Senator Bishop interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I listened carefully to Senator Conroy's contribution without interjecting, although I disagreed with much of what he said, so I would appreciate the same courtesy. As far as the principle of choice is concerned, we believe it is up to the individual to be entitled to exercise that choice if he so desires.
There need to be some safeguards, and that is why this government chose not to introduce unlimited choice, because there was pressure from some areas to have unlimited choice. That would have been very difficult to manage and that is why there is choice in the policy put forward by the coalition—enough 
 choice so that people will be able to choose for themselves what is best for their future.
Senator Conroy also made a statement which I found quite fascinating. He said that in the new world of competition, fees will go up and returns will go down. That shows how much experience Senator Conroy has had with the real world. He calls it the new world. I would say: look at the real world. I spent some time working in this industry at a time when fees and charges were exorbitantly high. It was partly because of competition and the work of industry funds that forced those charges and fees to come down. I think it was the best thing to happen to superannuation for a long time.
The world of superannuation is a very competitive business and people are getting good returns. People have fee structures which are more in tune with what should be happening with superannuation. In the long run competition will ensure that fees do not go up; fees will remain low. That will have some long-term effect on returns, so that returns will improve.
When talking about unlimited choice, we must remember that there will be unlimited choice provided the employer offers it. It is one of the options that employers can offer. A small employer with two or three employees may choose to give those employees unlimited choice, which will be in their best interests if they are casual employees and have other funds they can channel all their retirement savings into. If the employer is prepared to offer unlimited choice, that is the best way for them to go.
This report is very important because it has enabled us to gather information from all those people who have concerns. I am concerned about the opposition's tactics in trying to stall the legislation with respect to choice. We all know that the start-up date in the legislation is 1 July. Those involved in the superannuation industry need some certainty. The opposition's stalling of this piece of legislation is increasing the uncertainty in the community of both employers and employees.
The tactic of delaying the legislation for as long as possible in order to make it more difficult for those people involved in the 
 industry is one that the opposition should be ashamed of. Let the debate take place in the chamber. Let the chamber decide whether or not this legislation will pass—I do not know whether or not it will be passed—because then at least there will be some certainty for those involved in the industry, both employers and employees, so they will know on 1 July what their obligations and options will be.
It is incumbent on the opposition to push this legislation forward as soon as possible. Let the chamber make a decision. If the opposition waits until the budget session in May and this legislation is passed by the chamber without amendment, it is basically saying to all those people in the community involved in the preparation of providing superannuation as employers, or choosing options as employees, `We are going to limit the time completely so that you have less than two months to put all the arrangements in place and to make sure that any education process that needs to be put in place can be put in place.'
I urge the opposition to take a good look at itself in terms of the legislation which will be coming before the chamber and deal with it as soon as possible so that it knows what the outcome of the vote in this chamber will be. The opposition will be judged by the community on any stalling tactics that it uses. It is something the opposition will have to wear if it decides to delay the bill unnecessarily.
The report is quite a lengthy one. I think it is fair to say that the views of both sides expressed to the committee have been reported in great detail. Lots of people felt that the start-up date would be difficult and that a good education process needed to take place. This has been well presented and I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,29,2
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-26,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank you for your indulgence in taking the chair so that I can speak in this debate. I did have the opportunity, in the absence of Senator Nick Sherry, to be a member of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and to partake in its hearings. I can assure Senator Ferguson and the government that by no means are these stalling tactics, in spite of how one may 
 interpret them from the other side. A welter of evidence was given to the committee that, regardless of the outcome, there should be a delay in the implementation of the issue of choice of fund. Senator Conroy has already outlined our position in terms of choice of fund. What we do not agree with is the model.
A number of important issues came before the committee in the taking of evidence. The most alarming, as far as I was concerned, was in the area of education. As Senator Watson who chaired the committee would know, I repeatedly asked of those appearing before the committee the problem in relation to literacy and numeracy. We were given evidence, which to my knowledge has not been refuted, that in the vicinity of 48 per cent of Australians, according to an ABS survey—so it was a reliable survey, one would hope—are at the bottom level in literacy and numeracy skills. They rest in level 1 and level 2 on a scale of one to five and it could be best said that they have difficulty in reading and doing basic computations which many of us take for granted.
—So we cannot introduce it until we have educated all of them?
—I am not saying that at all, Senator. What I am saying is that we have a difficulty if, as we heard in evidence—virtually universally—people must be in a position to make an informed choice. It was interesting to hear Senator Watson this evening use the words `informed choice' because I think that, across parties, everyone will agree that if a proper choice is to be made by those accessing superannuation, the proper choice must be on an informed basis.
It is on that basis that I am concerned primarily about the issue of education and the fact that 48 per cent have lower literacy and numeracy skills. What is even more concerning, however, is that in the vicinity of 2 million to 2½ million people are at level 1 or were at level 1 in that survey. To me, this means that the process of education, the process of making these people able to interpret—

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-26,"—There has never been any doubt that the government's waterfront strategy is nothing more than a political campaign. It was built on detailed and expensive public opinion polling and a carefully constructed political public relations campaign. It is a campaign being implemented through a newsletter put out by Mr Reith's ministerial office that deals in trivia and hearsay. It is a campaign built on personal attacks on individuals in the union movement.
It is a campaign built on misinformation. It is a campaign designed to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia and to erode the authority of the ACTU. It is a campaign about sacking people. It is not a campaign built around good public policy. It indeed is not a campaign built on fact, and it is not a campaign built on ongoing reform on the waterfront, because that can only be achieved if all parties are working together in pursuit of a common goal, as was the case in the WIRA reform program.
In the past couple of days we have seen what I described as the Reith plan begin to unravel because there is not solid policy foundation and it does not enjoy the support of stevedores or the workers. The level of support from users is now dissipating, if it ever was there at all. I just remind the Senate of that plan which was spelt out in a minute from the most senior waterfront reform officer 
 in Mr Reith's department. That minute advised:
What would be needed for the MUA's influence on the waterfront to be significantly weakened would be for a range of effected service users and providers to take decisive action to protect or advance their interests.
It continued:
Stevedores would need to activate well prepared strategies to dismiss their workforce, and replace them with another, quickly, in a way that limited the prospect of, for example, the Commission ordering the reinstatement of the current workforce.
Let me go to part 1 of the plan—that is, to get the users to attack the Maritime Union of Australia. On ABC radio yesterday the Executive President of the Australian Peak Shippers Association, Mr Frank Beaufort, laid the blame for the current problems on the docks at the feet of Patricks management, not the Maritime Union. It is important to note that this body represents about 80 per cent of shippers in this country—shippers in areas such as dairy, horticulture, cotton, timber, meat, wool and rice. Mr Beaufort said that there will continue to be problems on the docks as long as Patricks remains in the stevedoring business. He said that the turmoil in the docks was being driven by Patricks. And of course Patricks is being driven by Mr Reith.
I noted that today in order to illustrate widespread support for the Reith plan the minister read out a handful of letters from anonymous authors. He did not, however, get up and read from a handful of letters from major users of the ports attacking the MUA and supporting the government, because he could not. That support is not there. While a number of employer organisations came out in support of the government, in reality they would have been given little choice. So it would appear that phase one of Mr Reith's plan is now under some pressure.
One possible reason for this that I have touched on in an earlier debate but it bears repeating is that many users are putting the costs of a full-scale industrial war against the benefits that might flow from the campaign to smash the MUA. While there may be some isolated examples where stevedores charge users $200 to move a container for large 
 contract users in Melbourne, for example, the actual cost is about $70. Whilst isolated examples of charging $200 a container no doubt exist, that is not the norm.
The main exporters putting product across the wharves are facing much lower charges—charges which, on information that I have, are as low as $70 per container. That is 30 per cent below the cost Mr Reith said could be achieved if the union was forced from the docks. So there is no saving in his campaign. The savings are already there by his figures. That $70 represents two per cent of the total transport costs or only 0.2 of one per cent of the value of a typical container in the case of one of the big users of the Melbourne waterfront, according to information that has been given to me.
What of the second part of Mr Reith's plan of getting a stevedore to sack its entire work force and replace that work force before the Industrial Relations Commission could reinstate the sacked workers—that is, beat the system, in fact, to act outside the terms of Mr Reith's own legislation? It appears to me that Patricks were prepared to act as Mr Reith's lieutenant in this exercise of union bashing, not for any reason of reform or efficiency but because the company was in trouble. In that case it felt, no doubt, that it had to choose.
In a story in today's Australian the Sea Land stevedoring company was quoted as saying that Patricks attempt to blame the union for its low productivity on the waterfront was a smokescreen for its own poor management. The General Manager of Sea Land, Mr Andrew Andrews, said that the company had included the union in its plans right from the start and would continue to use union labour when it commenced its operations in Brisbane in July. He was quoted as saying that the company had not found the MUA to be a barrier to reform. He went on to say:
We're very bullish on the attitude of the union in that they're very receptive to change. I just don't understand the people who are finding it—
that is, the union—
a road block to changing things.
I quote also from the Chief Executive of P&O, which is the other major stevedoring 
 company on Australia's waterfront. The Chief Executive, Richard Hein, is reported by AAP as saying:
We are not about tearing up our agreements and setting out to destroy the MUA.
Clearly, it is not the employers who are out to smash the unions but it is this government—Mr Reith in particular and, no doubt, Mr Howard. Patricks chose to carry out the Reith plan and it appears that it is now paying an increasingly high price.
In my view, the faltering performance of Patricks has led to Mr Reith inviting the National Farmers Federation to take up the mantle. It appears that the NFF is struggling as well. On this morning's AM Mr McGauchie said that he had still not signed up any business and he was forced to organise a teleconference last night to shore up his support in the bush.
 The attitude of the National Farmers Federation to the interests of its own membership was best illustrated by the following question and answer. Mr McGauchie was asked:
If you are not using fighting funds in this exercise why not open up the fighting fund books for the past three years?
He replied:
. . . one of its—
that is, the fighting funds—
great strengths is its mystery.
I take that to mean that the use of that money must remain a mystery not only to the public but also to farmers who actually donated the money.
 I also want to refer to the March issue of the P&O newsletter. There is an article in that publication on crane rates for a vessel called the Kasuga. That is a vessel which, I understand, was the subject of stevedoring activity in Singapore and in two Australian ports all under the control of P&O, so they know what the crane rates were. That article said that in Singapore there were 1,298 moves at a crane rate of 28.8 TEUs per hour using four cranes. In Adelaide, the same vessel saw one crane achieve 338 movements at a rate of 28.6 TEUs per hour. In Fremantle, one crane achieved 608 moves at a rate of 26.8 TEUs 
 per hour. In other words, there was no great difference.
In my view, this illustrates partly the fact that this has been a political exercise from day one as far as the Howard government is concerned. The stevedores and increasingly the users of the ports are indicating that the political games are not substitutes for good public policy and sustainable economic reform. I would say that this exercise by the minister will fail. Unfortunately, a lot of people are going to suffer while it is being played out.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Waterfront</title>,Adjournment,30,1
