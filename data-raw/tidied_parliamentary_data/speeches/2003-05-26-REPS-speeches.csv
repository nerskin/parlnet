"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled 2003 Review of Migration Regulation 4.31B, together with the minutes of the proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I thank the House. I am very pleased to be here today to present the report on 4.31B as it applies to certain people who have sought refugee status in Australia by applying for a protection visa. Those people who have had their applications refused by the department of immigration may apply to the Refugee Review Tribunal for the review of those refusals. If the tribunal agrees that the applicants do not meet the definition of refugees in the United Nations Refugee Convention then the review applications are unsuccessful and the regulation allows for a fee of $1,000 to be charged. The purpose of this fee is to deter people from making applications for review of decisions merely in order to prolong their stay in Australia. The regulation is due to expire at the end of June 2003 as a consequence of a sunset clause. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs requested that the committee review the regulation and report on it prior to 30 April 2003.
This is the third review of the regulation undertaken by this committee. The committee sought submissions through advertising the inquiry and by contacting all of those who had provided comment to its two previous reviews, in 1999 and 2001. The committee received nine submissions and heard evidence from four organisations in the course of those two public hearings. Many submissions argued against the continuation of the fee, some urged that it be continued and increased and others believed that the fee should not exist. In 2001-02, there were some 5,734 applications to the Refugee Review Tribunal for it to review the department's rejection of protection visa applications. The tribunal did not support 5,487 of the applications for review. Those applicants thus became liable for a fee of $1,000. Among this group were those who had a genuine belief that they had grounds for seeking a protection visa but were found not to meet the Refugee Convention definition.
Asylum seekers with a legitimate fear of human rights abuse may fall outside the scope of the Refugee Convention. The tribunal's rejection of their claim does not mean that they were attempting to abuse the protection visa arrangements. Nevertheless, there is abuse. All of the submissions to the committee which commented on the issue of abuse agreed that it existed, and the committee therefore examined a range of existing and proposed strategies to combat abuse. One of the incentives for applicants to make use of the appeal process is that it takes time, and some applicants in particular may, for economic or lifestyle reasons, be content to have their stay in Australia extended by using the appeal process even if they have to eventually leave. It appeared to the committee that measures which reduced the duration of the tribunal process would reduce the attractiveness of making unfounded refugee applications.
The committee had in the course of its work in this parliament visited the Refugee Review Tribunal and witnessed hearings there. The committee saw that the testing of applicants' bona fides is not always a short, simple task, particularly as new evidence may emerge between the initial protection visa application and the subsequent tribunal hearing. The committee therefore recommended that additional resources be made available to the tribunal to provide for more expeditious hearing and finalisation of cases appearing before it. The committee noted that the fee had not been increased since it was introduced in 1997 and that its relative value had therefore eroded—and potentially its deterrent effect. The committee therefore recommended that the fee be raised to match that of the Migration Review Tribunal, which is currently $1,400. The committee also concluded that the fee was probably achieving its purpose and therefore recommended that the regulation remain in operation for a further two years, to be reviewed again in 2005.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of those who gave proposals and submissions to the committee. I particularly want to thank the deputy chair, the member for Oxley, for his work and the committee for their fine work on the first report of this parliamentary sitting and for the cooperative spirit in which the contending interpretations and views were offered and debated. I would also like to thank the secretariat of Richard Selth, Steve Dyer and Peter Ratas for their extremely efficient assistance with the inquiry arrangements and the processes. I commend this report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I am pleased to be speaking on the 2003 Review of Migration Regulation 4.31B. Three recommendations have come out of the committee. Firstly, we have recommended that migration regulation 4.31B remain in operation subject to a further two-year sunset clause to commence on 1 July 2003 and that its operation be reviewed again by this committee in 2005. Secondly, we have recommended that the fee applied under the regulation be raised to $1,400 from $1,000, which is in line with the fee levied for an application for review by the Migration Review Tribunal. Finally, the committee have recommended that additional resources be made available to the Refugee Review Tribunal to provide for the more expeditious hearing and finalisation of cases coming before it.
I think these three recommendations are valid and warranted under the circumstances. I understand that there are some people who believe that it would be easier to just waive the fee. The task that we put forward to DIMIA was to come back to us at this review period with further evidence and statistical data which could give us, the committee, some guidance on how we should deal with this fee. Of particular concern to the committee was that the fee should be a deterrent to those who would make false claims, or non bona fide claims, but certainly not be a deterrent to, or in some way impede applications made by, people who are bona fide. I think that this can be achieved and is being achieved by what is currently in place. It is important to note, too, what the fee does in operation. If somebody does apply for a review under the RRT, they have to pay the fee within seven days. If they choose not to pay the fee, they then owe the Commonwealth a debt and are subsequently listed, if they do not pay that debt, on the MAL system, the movement alert list. I think that is quite important to note.
There were a number of responses: nine submissions were taken by the committee. Three supported the retention of the fee; the others were against the retention of the fee. Two of the submissions proposed modifications. For each of those we looked at the merits of what was put before us and came to our conclusions. The conclusions of our committee were that, while we disagreed with some of the submissions and some of the evidence that was put before us, we also felt that there was enough weight of evidence that the fee should remain in place.
I could not speak on this issue without at least noting that in any system some abuse is always going to exist. I just want to put on the record that Amnesty concurred with this, stating that, like asylum determination systems everywhere else, Australia's was subject to a certain level of abuse and there were some non-genuine applicants. This is not to say that the vast majority are not genuine but that there need to be some mechanisms put in place that can deal with those who would be non bona fide. 
The biggest issue for me personally—and, I believe, for the committee as a whole—was the issue of expeditious processing. This is probably the most critical part. People should not stay within the system for extended periods of time going for review purely to try to remain in Australia when they know they are not entitled to. Currently, the RRT is comprised of about 40 full-time officers and about 25 part-time officers. Between them, they finalised in 2001-02 nearly 6,000 cases. (Time expired)

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—The A Better Future for Our Kids Bill 2003 establishes an Australian commissioner for children and young people that could have a lasting, positive impact on the future of our kids.
It makes the basic point that if we do not value our children we cannot ever hope to protect them.
The bill looks at ways of ensuring that children's needs are understood and that their interests, rights and welfare are taken into account by the community and by our governments. It particularly aims to help protect our children from child abuse.
This bill's time has come.
Over recent years, the range of distressing and, frankly, awful revelations of child abuse, particularly sexual abuse, in our community has created a level of anger, fear and mistrust.
We must do something to tackle child sexual abuse.
We as politicians must take some action for the future.
Labor is absolutely determined that some good must come from the Governor-General controversy, and my challenge to the Prime Minister is for him to get on board with this initiative.
Federal Labor announced our commitment to establish a commissioner for children back in May 2002, and since then we have worked to develop the detail of this bill.
I would like to briefly highlight the main purpose and objects of establishing a children's commissioner.
They are:
·	To provide national leadership and advocacy on children's and young people's issues;
·	To monitor and promote the wellbeing of children and young people, particularly those who are vulnerable or disadvantaged;
·	To encourage understanding of the interests, rights and welfare of children and young people; and
·	To encourage the participation of children and young people in the community.
An independent advocate for children who listens to, works with, values and appreciates children is vital.
The bill's basic principles are:
·	That every child is a valued member of society;
·	That the family has primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of its children and should be supported in that role;
·	That every child is entitled to be protected from abuse, exploitation and discrimination;
·	That every child is entitled to form and express views and have those views taken into account; and
·	That in decisions involving children the child's best interests are of primary concern.
Establishing a commissioner would signal an important change in our community.
It would signal to children that we as adults think that they matter—that we value their childhood and that we will listen to their fears and needs.
Building confidence in our children is one of the best ways to ensure that they are not victimised or abused. Once children's voices are truly heard in our community, we have made an important step down the path to building a safer and more child friendly society.
I want to specifically mention two important functions that we have outlined for the commissioner:
·	The commissioner will put in place a national `working with children' check to apply across the whole country in all areas of work and volunteering where adults have unsupervised care of our children; and
·	The commissioner will develop a national code for the protection of children, including attaching conditions to government funding so that only organisations with adequate procedures for the prevention and handling of child abuse matters can receive public money.
Both these steps will help make our children safer and our organisations better.
Of course, establishing a commissioner is only one part of the action that must be taken—and we do not mind debating better forms or additions or changes that will help.
But our idea to establish an Australian commissioner for children and young people is a good idea and could make a difference.
And a better future for our kids is too important for the Prime Minister to ignore our proposal just because it comes from the Labor Party.
I urge the Prime Minister to take this matter seriously enough to allow a full and proper debate of Labor's proposal in this House.
Australia's children deserve no less.
In the current circumstances, we are looking to the Prime Minister to take some leadership on these issues.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—Just as Simon Crean's Riverbank initiative in his budget reply showed that one party, the Labor Party, is serious about saving the Murray, the Kyoto Protocol Ratification Bill 2003 tells the Australian people that there is one party in this place which is serious about tackling climate change, and that is the Labor Party. This is a bill which tells Australian farmers that we care about the impact of droughts and floods on them; we care about those CSIRO projections that say that increasing temperatures will lead to increased severity and increased frequency of droughts and floods in the years ahead. This is a bill which tells the residents of Queensland and Queensland's tourism industry that we care about the impact of global warming on coral bleaching through increased water temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef. 
This is a bill which tells the people of Victoria and the Victorian tourism industry that we do not intend to see a loss of snow cover on Victoria's Alps with all that that means for Victoria's tourism, alpine cover and our recreational activities in the alpine area. This is a bill which tells people in Western Australia, particularly in the south-west and west, that we understand that their climate has been changing over the course of the past couple of decades and that we are concerned about the impact of increased temperatures, reduced rainfall and increasing droughts in that area.
This is a bill which tells residents in the tropics that we do not want to see an increased risk of tropical diseases, such as dengue fever or even malaria, which some of the research tells us is likely to occur if we allow climate change to go unchecked. This is a bill which tells the insurance industry that we understand the impact that increased severity of extreme weather events will have on the insurance industry and their capacity to meet claims. Recently, I was in Sutherland shire visiting the emergency services area. They understand the great irony of having to battle floods only a matter of weeks after they were battling bushfires in the same terrain. Those disasters will occur not only in Sutherland shire but in other parts of Australia if we do not act to control and do not act to do everything we can to curb climate change. 
This is a bill which tells Australian business that we understand that they should be entitled to be part of the new business order which seeks to engage in trade in carbon emissions, buying and selling carbon credits, and that we should be part of the clean development mechanism. We understand that there is a risk to Australian business, that they will be locked out of global trade in these matters if Australia does not ratify the Kyoto protocol. We understand that many Australian businesses now support ratification of the Kyoto protocol because they understand that that is good for business and necessary for them to move ahead. 
Finally, this is a bill which tells the Australian people and the rest of the world that the Labor Party believes in being good international environmental citizens. I and other Labor Party members are ashamed of our international reputation on environmental matters, including climate change. Last year, I had the honour of visiting the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and I listened to what all the European countries are doing not only to ratify the Kyoto protocol but also to play their part in reducing and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. We heard stirring calls for ratification of the Kyoto protocol from countries as small as Tuvalu, which is threatened by flooding due to increased sea level rises, and from countries like Germany, which is impacted on by floods. We listened to what all those other countries are doing. They want to play their role, yet we have Australia saying, `Because the United States does not want to ratify, we are not prepared to ratify.' That is a disgraceful and unacceptable international position for us to take. We need to support the Kyoto protocol. We need to support the collective international effort to curb climate change. We need to be good and responsible international environmental citizens. It is in our interests and in the interests of the entire world.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—When the parliament rose at the end of budget week, the death toll from SARS in Taiwan was 28. Today it is 72. I congratulate Taiwan on its achievements in the health care field in the last 50 years and on its willingness to use its knowledge and resources to assist countries less fortunate or those suffering from some form of disaster. Many of us have had the opportunity to visit Taiwan, which is an island roughly the size of Tasmania. It has a population of 23 million people, with the highest life expectancy in Asia. It had the first universal health insurance system in Asia, with 97 per cent coverage, and it has eradicated many infectious diseases. It is a physically and scientifically developed country with one physician for every 649 people, and 18,265 health care institutions.
Yet all these medical professionals and facilities have no access to the information and alerts to infection provided by the World Health Organisation. Because of politics, and only because of politics, Taiwan has been refused observer status in WHO. I stress that I am not talking about actual WHO membership for Taiwan, just non-voting observer status, contributing all the way to the development and dissemination of medical information. Exclusion even from the observer category means exclusion from all World Health Organisation information, including the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the mechanism by which the WHO transmits reports of current outbreaks to, and receives reports from, professionals throughout the world.
Unfortunately the seriousness of this exclusion has been dramatically demonstrated to the world with the SARS outbreak. It took seven weeks from Taiwan's first request to WHO for scientific assistance before China agreed and WHO actually provided some assistance. How many people were endangered, infected or died because of that delay? The reality of today's globalisation means that those endangered during the delay were not just Taiwanese—it dramatically increased the world danger and therefore affected Australians.
We all know that there are political sensitivities involving China and Taiwan and that China insists that there be no political recognition of Taiwan as an independent state. I do not want to touch on those sensitivities today or in any way enter that debate. My proposal that Taiwan—as a health entity, not a country—be granted observer status with WHO has nothing whatever to do with politics but everything to do with world health and Australian health, because infection recognises neither political boundaries nor political agreements in a highly mobile world.
To grasp the repercussions of banning Taiwan—a major transport hub with 23 million people and a sophisticated health system—from access to WHO, let us look at a couple of statistics for 2002. Taiwan had 7.85 million outbound travellers; 2.19 million inbound travellers; 304,000 migrant workers from other parts of Asia; and, $US243 billion worth of foreign trade, including in animals, animal products and food. The data on these movements does not sit comfortably with the WHO executive board's determination in 2001, which said:
The globalisation of infectious diseases is such that an outbreak in one country is potentially a threat to the whole world.
Because Taiwan currently has no status with WHO, even as an observer, WHO ignored Taiwan's need for help with SARS. Politics got in the way of world health and world safety, and politics got in the way of the interests of the people. As Tommy G. Thompson said to the World Health Assembly on 19 May:
One lesson of SARS is that public health knows no border—and no politics.
While any loophole in the global network endangers the global community, disease is no longer the only imperative. Now the possibility of biological and chemical terrorism must also be considered in global health care.
Taiwan is already active in providing international assistance. That assistance includes El Salvador and Afghanistan and medical teams in a number of African countries. From 1995 to 2002, Taiwan donated $US120 million to medical and humanitarian aid in 78 countries. I firmly believe in this motion that Taiwan be allowed to participate as an observer in WHO. I want our people to be safe when they travel overseas or to Taiwan and I want the Taiwanese people to be safe.
—Before I call for a seconder, let me point out to the member for Fairfax that I was in conversation with the Leader of the Opposition, as he may have observed. As a result I did not call on the member for Fairfax to move the motion.
—I move:
That this House calls on the Government to:
(1)	congratulate Taiwan on its substantial achievements in the field of health and its many contributions to world health care;
(2)	acknowledge that Taiwan's contributions to world health care could be made much more effectively and with much broader scope under the auspices of the World Health Organisation (WHO);
(3)	acknowledge the need for a fully-integrated global health care system and the undesirability of Taiwan's exclusion from this system, particularly in the light of the current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome crisis;
(4)	recognise therefore, that Taiwan's participation as an observer in the WHO would not only benefit the people of Taiwan, but also leave no loophole in the world health care network; and
(5)	help Taiwan find appropriate and feasible ways to participate meaningfully in the WHO.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—This motion on Taiwan and the World Health Organisation is well timed. Over the weekend, dramatic news came in the form of another 80 reported cases of SARS in Taiwan and a further eight deaths. In examining the spread of the dreadful SARS virus throughout Asia, one of the most alarming facts is that, despite Taiwan's great efforts in this area, the virus continues to spread there. It is extremely regrettable, as the member for Fairfax said, that politics has been able to get in the way of globalised concerns about health. Unfortunately, in the last few weeks, the World Health Assembly in Geneva yet again failed to get on the agenda—for the seventh time, under Chinese pressure on this vital issue—an item to let Taiwan gain observer status at the World Health Organisation. Surely those of us who support a one China policy, who support China being part of the World Trade Organisation and who want China to be part of the world economy can at the same time say that this denial of basic health information by the World Health Organisation to an island of 23 million people cannot be tolerated in a globalised world. The failure of the WHO to act on the SARS epidemic in Taiwan in my view impinges on the organisation's ability, in an era of globalisation, to ensure the health of peoples in all its member states. It harms the medical welfare of the 23 million people of Taiwan, who are excluded from the organisation, and limits Taiwan's ability to share its resources in the health field with other people.
In my view it is quite inconceivable that there is no flow of WHO information, medical advice and supplies to the 23 million people of Taiwan because of this non-involvement of the World Health Organisation. After all, Taiwan has a population larger than that of 75 per cent of the WHO member states. Taiwan is excluded from the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. Through this mechanism, the WHO transmits reports of current outbreaks to, and receives important health data from, public health professionals and global surveillance partners worldwide. This lack of information sharing has had consequences previously, so it is not simply about this issue of the SARS virus. We remember the enterovirus epidemic that struck Taiwan in 1998. It came from Malaysia and infected over 1.8 million Taiwanese people, hospitalised 400, caused the deaths of 80 and resulted in $1 billion in economic losses.
Now the Australian government has made the peculiar Yes, Minister response to Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO, saying that it will consider the admission of Taiwan to the World Health Organisation when there is a consensus on that admission. Surely it is in the interests of a globalised world, in the interests of people who are travelling between Australia and Taiwan on business and as tourists, in the interests of people who are travelling from Taiwan to mainland China and in the interests of all of us that Taiwan has access to the latest health information, particularly how to deal with the SARS virus.
I note that the Chinese government now takes the SARS epidemic and cover-up very seriously. The health minister, Zhang Wenkang, and the Beijing mayor, Meng Xuenong, were both cashiered by the Chinese government for their failure in this SARS outbreak in China. As Mr Lampton, Director of China Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS and the author of The Politics of Medicine in China in 1977, said in the Wall Street Journal recently:
... Messrs. Hu and Wen have sought to be more populist leaders calling for more social and economic equality and paying more attention to those elements of Chinese society left behind in the last 25 years' rush to riches.
The new leadership in China really has the chance, by tackling China's failure to handle the SARS outbreak, to tackle the health care inequities that underlie China's role in the current crisis. One contribution the new Chinese leadership should initiate is a more open-minded attitude to Taiwan being part of a globalised health system through observer status at the World Health Organisation.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Health Organisation: Taiwan</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—I am pleased to rise today in support of the member for Fairfax's motion. I am pleased to see that there are so many members in the chamber today whilst this motion is being debated—members who are associated with the Australia-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group. What we are talking about here is not a political issue; it is a health issue, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Taiwan has been seeking to fulfil its responsibilities to its constituents—23 million people—and as a responsible member of the world community by being admitted as an observer at the World Health Assembly in Geneva. Unfortunately, as heard previously, this has been rejected for the seventh time.
Taiwan's population is larger than 75 per cent of the World Health Organisation member states. Taiwan is an important Asian trade and transportation centre, with hundreds of thousands of inbound and outbound commuters each year. This application to be admitted with observer status is not prerequisite on having UN membership or participating in the World Health Organisation. Already the Cook Islands and Niue are both full members of the World Health Organisation, despite the fact that neither is a UN member state. Obviously, Taiwan understands Australia's one China policy. We are not talking about that today; we are talking about the health concerns. Taiwan is seeking observer status in the WHO as a health entity, without seeking to change any government's one China policy. It is an important request and, unfortunately, the SARS virus has highlighted these concerns and how important it is for Taiwan to be admitted as an observer to the World Health Organisation. Media reports today indicate that the death toll in Taiwan has now reached 72, which is an absolute tragedy. A number of new cases have been confirmed today.
It is interesting that, from the time of Taiwan's first SARS case in March 2003, they began contacting the World Health Organisation to report the situation and to request advice and assistance. The World Health Organisation, however, did not respond to their communications and gave them no support. They referred to Taiwan as a province of China and were dealing directly with China. They are quite within their rights, of course, to do that, but there is virtually no communication between mainland China and Taiwan at this stage, so any information that was provided to China was not passed on to Taiwan. It was some time until the World Health Organisation agreed to allow two experts to travel to Taiwan to assist them in their battle against SARS. Of course, this is a world problem; it is not just a problem for Taiwan. Every effort that can be made to ensure that all areas are given up-to-date information and assistance is important because Taiwan have important trading cultural links with Australia. There are many hundreds of thousands of travellers who travel to Taiwan and through Australia, and we have seen how quickly the SARS virus can be transmitted throughout the world.
I know that Taiwan is an advanced society. I have had the privilege of visiting Taiwan. The Taiwanese have excellent medical facilities, and all they were seeking was further information and assistance from the rest of the world through the World Health Organisation to assist them in dealing with the SARS virus. In conclusion, I would also like to pay tribute to Vanessa Shih from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office for keeping us all informed of what is happening in Taiwan with the tragic SARS virus. I am very pleased to see that Vanessa is actually in the chamber today to hear this debate.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Health Organisation: Taiwan</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I am proud to stand up in the House today and be associated with the honourable member for Fairfax's motion. I thank him for raising the issue. I, like many in the House, have visited Taiwan—I have been there twice—and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Taiwanese people. I have seen first-hand the excellent standard of living enjoyed by all Taiwanese. As a key member of the global community, Taiwan is keen to play an important role in the various international forums—and so it should. Unfortunately, due to the crazy international political set-up with regard to China—and, unlike other members, I am going to raise the issue, because I think it should be dealt with sooner rather than later—and the so-called one China policy, most nations refuse to tackle this issue but pussyfoot around it, hoping it will all go away. It is a bit like the situation with regard to Palestine and Israel: it is all too hard. Depending on who is trading with whom, you bow and genuflect and then you turn your back and do something else.
Many in this House have reservations about the effectiveness of the United Nations and the many agencies that are part of the United Nations, and I am one of them. Their inability to respond quickly and effectively to various crises around the world has been highlighted recently in the war against Iraq. We now have a ludicrous situation where a nation, Taiwan, with a population of 23 million—and half the size of my little home state of Tasmania—is totally excluded from participation in any of the World Health Organisation fora. This is a ridiculous situation when you think of some of the mickey mouse countries that are part and parcel of the UN and its various agencies.
I cannot believe that China refuses to allow the World Health Organisation to include Taiwan in the World Health Organisation's fora even as an observer. We had the stupid situation where China had to give permission for the World Health Organisation to send representatives to visit Taiwan to deal with the outbreak of SARS. As honourable members have mentioned, we now have a situation where the number of people with SARS in Taiwan is up to 82. Goodness knows how many hundreds of Taiwanese people are hospitalised, and there are probably thousands locked away in quarantine in order that the SARS epidemic will not spread. For goodness sake, we are talking about a health risk to tens of millions of people that needs to be addressed sensibly. As the US Health and Human Services secretary said:
One lesson of SARS is that public health knows no border—and no politics.
Of course it does not, but it is ludicrous for China to be in a position to say to the World Health Organisation, `We'll let you go and visit a country of 23 million people that is contributing to this worldwide, almost pandemic, outbreak.'
We have seen the devastating effect of SARS—even though we have not had any cases here in Australia—on our tourism. It is costing tens of millions of dollars, especially to Queensland and the Sydney area. Qantas has laid off 1,500 people, because of the economic impact of SARS on Australia. At least the Americans have had the gumption to stand up and say, `We support Taiwan.' What have we done? We have pussyfooted behind the one China policy and said, `It's all too hard.' For goodness sake, let's get realistic. I probably never will get an invitation to China but I do not care. This is an issue that needs to be dealt with. It is a global issue. We should get together. The World Health Organisation should say, `Come in Taiwan. Be an observer; you're part and parcel to this problem. You're trying to solve it.' It is almost like the case of leprosy, years ago—isolate them, forget about them and hope it will all go away. I am proud to be associated with the Taiwanese people and their endeavours, and I will work tirelessly to convince as many people as possible in this House to say to the foreign minister, `Support Taiwan's admission to the World Health Organisation, at least with observer status and hopefully as a full member.' I thank the House for the opportunity to put my views today.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Health Organisation: Taiwan</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—I rise to speak on Taiwan and the World Health Organisation. Article 1 of the Constitution of the World Health Organisation states one of its key objectives as being:
... the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health.
Given that objective, it is most disappointing that time after time Taiwan's bid for observer status at the World Health Organisation has been defeated, as recently as last week, effectively depriving Taiwan's 23 million people of the objectives that should apply to all people that `all peoples should have the highest possible level of health'. This is not a political issue; it is a health and humanitarian issue for Taiwan's 23 million people and for the world more broadly.
There is no reason at all for Taiwan not to be given observer status and, in fact, there is every reason that it should be accorded that status. It has a strong record in taking seriously its own role in improving the health of its own people and health more broadly around the world. Firstly, there is the high standard of health care in Taiwan itself, its commitment to health research and its research into life-saving pharmaceuticals. Secondly, there is its commitment to sharing its resources and its knowledge with other people in need around the world. Between 1995 and 2002, Taiwan spent $120 million in humanitarian and/or medical aid in many countries around the world. It has medical teams working in a number of Third World countries attempting to raise the level of health in those countries. It is actively involved in international programs aimed at the eradication and reduction of a number of diseases—malaria, AIDS, yellow fever and tuberculosis.
The political arguments about statehood are not relevant in this context. The World Health Organisation's constitution talks about the rights of all peoples to the `highest possible level of health'. Observer status has been given to other non-state entities; observer status certainly should be given to Taiwan. Increasingly, international movement around the world means that we are all more susceptible to the international spread of disease. There is no sense at all for a country of 23 million people, especially a country that is such an important economic hub—a hub of trade and travel in the Asian region—to be excluded. The spread of SARS shows what can happen.
It is appalling that Taiwan's report to the World Health Organisation in March received no response until May. They should have been assisted far earlier. Had that happened fewer than 72 deaths from SARS in Taiwan might have been possible. Had that happened the spread to other countries may have been reduced. It is deplorable that it was two months before any assistance was received from the World Health Organisation. There is no guarantee that in the future we might not be subjected to more virulent and more deadly viruses than the SARS virus. For the sake of the people of Taiwan, the people of the Asia-Pacific region and of the world community, we need to have Taiwan granted observer status so that the potential spread of such diseases can be restricted and, indeed, eliminated if possible.
Taiwan's bid for observer status in the World Health Organisation has received widespread and appropriate support from the international community. This has included the European parliament, the US Congress and a number of other national parliaments as well as a number of major professional medical organisations such as the World Medical Association, the British Medical Association, the British Lancet and the International Paediatric Association. These organisations support the inclusion of Taiwan. Let me read comments from a couple of these organisations. In March this year, the US State Department said:
We support the goal of Taiwan's participation in the work of the World Health Organisation, including observer status, and have long worked closely with Taiwan authorities to advance that objective.
In May this year, the 108th Congress of the United States Senate and House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill supporting `Taiwan's appropriate and meaningful participation in the World Health Organisation'. The Council of the European Union working group for the Asia-Pacific region issued the comment that they endorse Taiwan's approach to request the World Health Organisation Director-General for participation in World Health Organisation activities. The European parliament said:
... Taiwan's record in improving health conditions and the life expectancy of its population is impressive. Taiwan should be given the right and opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the work of the World Health Organisation.
For the sake of Taiwan's 23 million people, for the sake of the world community, it is imperative that a way is found for Taiwan to participate in the World Health Organisation.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I wholeheartedly support this motion moved by the honourable member for Fairfax. The motion sets out four things that the House calls on the government to do. First of all, the House calls on the government to congratulate Taiwan on its achievements in the field of health and world health care. The Taiwanese people are an innovative and industrious people. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the field of health. They have much to offer, and any impediment in their way should be removed. The second part of the motion acknowledges Taiwan's contribution to world health care and indicates that that could be much more effective if Taiwan was able to participate in the World Health Organisation. I think that is a pretty clear point that has already been made in the debate.
The third part of the motion acknowledges the need for a fully integrated global health care system and highlights that the current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome crisis, the SARS crisis, is an absolute example of the requirement for that. These sorts of public health issues in the global sense know no borders. They are not interested in the politics of the situation. For a country of 23 million people to be somehow isolated from a world effort for a disease that, as has been illustrated by this debate, concerns us all is a nonsense. It is important not only for the Taiwanese people but also for the people within our region that there is a requirement to get over the impediments that affect the way in which Taiwan can actively take part in global public health issues.
The fourth part of the motion recognises that Taiwan's participation as an observer in the World Health Organisation not only benefits the people of Taiwan but also leaves no loophole in the world health care network—the point that I have just illustrated. The fifth and final point asks this House to call on our government to help Taiwan find appropriate and feasible ways to participate meaningfully in the World Health Organisation. The House is asking the government to be proactive on this issue, not reactive. This is not an issue where we should wait for a consensus to develop; we need to be actively involved in trying to find ways in which we can get through this impasse.
In my time in this place, I have been lobbied on many issues that are of a foreign affairs nature. But this issue has always struck me as a fairly modest request by a government that should be able to be resolved. The Taiwanese people have only asked that they be given an observer status that would enable them to participate in the WHO and the World Health Assembly. The present political problems between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan are no impediment for Taiwan to be involved in other organisations. For example, they are involved in the World Trade Organisation as a customs territory, in the International Olympic Committee as a sports organisation and in APEC as an economy. That is why they, in this debate, have coined the phrase `public health entity'. They see this not as a question of sovereignty, not about membership of the World Health Organisation, but about participation.
As I said, I believe this is something that the wider world community should be able to work towards. It is interesting that motions by the European parliament and the United States administration, after motions in the Senate and the House of Representatives, have indicated support. One has to ask, after the events of last week at the World Health Organisation when, for the seventh time, Taiwan was denied observer status, what is the problem? Whilst we have tried to be divorced from the political aspect of this and tried to make it just a question of the public health aspect, perhaps we need to engage with the People's Republic of China and ask them to consider that there would be an advantage in the political debate if they were to indicate their support for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organisation, with observer status, as a way of commencing meaningful dialogue, the type of dialogue that will be required to eventually see a resolution to the political problems that exist. It is a nonsense and a public administration fiction for the World Health Organisation to send observers on the basis that they gain permission of mainland China on the basis that Taiwan is a province of China. This is something that we should all support. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Health Organisation: Taiwan</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—I rise to support this motion before the House which, at its heart, seeks to ensure that the 23 million people of Taiwan are accorded access to the international system of health care that we in Australia and those in most corners of the globe are entitled to receive. Since its establishment in 1948, the WHO has been at the forefront of international efforts to improve the health of the world's citizens and reduce the dreadful toll from disease, particularly in those developing nations that lack the resources to undertake these tasks from within their own resources. 
Without question, the fight against diseases like malaria, cholera, smallpox, leprosy and HIV/AIDS have all been strengthened by the work of the WHO, sometimes with spectacular results. I think of the eradication of smallpox in this context. Just last week, we witnessed the successful conclusion of negotiations that have led to a treaty on tobacco control for the first time.
The WHO was established because the international community recognised that access to high quality health care is a fundamental right. Equally, the nature of the spread of disease makes absolutely necessary the cooperation of health authorities, both regionally and globally. These axioms are recognised in the constitution of the WHO which has, amongst its principles, the statement that:
The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.
Article 1 of that constitution also makes clear that the objective of the WHO is to secure these rights for `all peoples.' These are noble and correct principles. Yet, this motion is before our parliament because the WHO is failing in meeting those objectives while the people of Taiwan remain excluded from the workings and councils of that organisation.
All of us in this place are familiar with the history of the tension that exists between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China. Most in this chamber are members of political parties that have been clear in their support for Australia's longstanding One China policy. However, these two factors should not mean that the people of Taiwan are penalised in an area as basic and fundamental as the provision of those health care services. I would remind the House that what this motion seeks, and what the Taiwanese also ask for, is no more than observer status at the WHO—not full membership, but at least the opportunity to attend and learn from that organisation's programs and meetings.
This motion acknowledges that the Taiwanese government and other local Taiwanese authorities manage what is an excellent health care system. Earlier this year, I had the great privilege to travel to Taiwan as a guest of its government and parliament. While there, our delegation visited the Tzu Chi University in the east coast city of Hualien, which includes a major medical school. From that experience I can say that many Australian medical students would envy the resources and quality of education provided in Taiwan to its aspiring medical professionals. Therefore, some may ask whether the WHO may actually add value to what is already a high quality health care system in Taiwan and whether advancing observer status for the Taiwanese government is worthy of our attention.
Leaving aside for a moment the WHO's core objective of assisting all people and the universality of what it regards as a fundamental human right, the motion before the House draws attention to practical reasons why the people of Taiwan would directly stand to benefit from their government's participation in the WHO—namely, the practical example of the SARS epidemic. Unfortunately, Taiwan has not been immune from the impact of SARS, which has struck around the world with little regard to the quality of the local health system. Over 70 people have died in Taiwan already from SARS and perhaps more than 10 times that number have contracted the disease.
The World Health Organisation has correctly played a leadership role in coordinating international efforts to contain SARS and to provide vital advice to those nations and medical authorities that have had to cope with the disease and the associated public concern. That assistance has been provided to every region where the disease has been discovered, both quickly and efficiently—that is, unless you happen to live in Taiwan. Taiwan's status as falling outside the WHO and the diplomatic environment in which these matters are considered has meant that WHO support for Taiwanese medical authorities has been slow in coming and low key. This week, as the World Health Assembly meets in Geneva at its 56th congress, Taiwan will again be excluded despite the prominence that SARS has had at those deliberations. SARS has demonstrated that these kinds of diseases, which respect no borders or the vagaries of international politics, can affect places no matter whether their health systems are well developed or still developing. The people of Taiwan should not be excluded from the benefits of the international system established to counter these types of threats to human life and welfare. 
Australians and Taiwanese have long had friendly and close relations. We have benefited from the economic relationship that exists between our two economies and we have all welcomed the emergence of Taiwan as one of the region's strongest and most vibrant democracies. Just as the WHO has allowed other entities—like the Holy See, the Order of Malta, the Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Palestinian Authority—to become observers, it should do the same for our friends in Taiwan.

I did not engage in any formal vetting procedure—to my knowledge, that has not been done in relation to any other appointments of Governors-General—for a number of apparent reasons: I was well acquainted with Dr Hollingworth, he was a person who had become a public figure and he had served governments of both political persuasions. I formed a view about his character, and I heard nothing adverse about his character. He was obviously very well known in the circles of the Anglican Church. I know many people who are also connected with circles of the Anglican Church and I did not hear anything to suggest that he would be other than a totally suitable person.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censure the Prime Minister for his failure to make appropriate checks and inquiries before his appointment of Dr Hollingworth as Governor-General and his failure to dismiss Dr Hollingworth once evidence of his actions in covering up a known paedophile became known. In particular, that this House censures the Prime Minister for:
1.	his failure to understand that it is unacceptable for anyone in authority to cover up child sex abuse;
2.	his failure to make proper checks and exercise proper judgment before appointing Dr Hollingworth;
3.	his failure to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment in February last year when Dr Hollingworth admitted he acted inappropriately in the handling of child sex abuse cases;
4.	his failure to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment when he appeared on Australian Story and implied that an inappropriate relationship between a priest and a 14 year old girl could be initiated by the child;
5.	his failure to recognise what child sex abuse is and thereby condoning the cover-up of child sex abuse and the blaming of victims of child sex abuse;
6.	his failure to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment when the Aspinall Report made further adverse findings against Dr Hollingworth;
7.	his failure to confront allegations of rape and in seeking to cover them up;
8.	his failure to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment for allegations that were proven, yet acting belatedly on allegations that were not proven but had become public;
9.	his failure to speak to the Australian public immediately following Dr Hollingworth's resignation;
10.	his failure to resolve the status of Dr Hollingworth's appointment immediately following the withdrawal of the allegation of rape made before the Supreme Court of Victoria; and
11.	his failure to protect the integrity and dignity of the highest office in Australia by not admitting he got it wrong and by not displaying leadership in removing the Governor-General 15 months ago.
We have heard the Prime Minister say today that it was an error of judgment on the Governor-General's part. It was more than an error of judgment on the Governor-General's part. He covered up for a known paedophile; he has admitted it, and the Anglican Church found that to be the case. It does not matter whether this was in 2003 or in 1993. He failed in his duty. The simple proposition is that a person in authority should not be able to cover up for paedophilia. The error of judgment, Prime Minister, was yours: in appointing him in the first place, having failed to make the appropriate checks—we heard the Prime Minister duck and weave all through question time today about whom he consulted and what checks he made—and, fundamentally, in failing to act to remove the Governor-General when these allegations came to the fore in February 2002 and the Governor-General refused to resign.
We asked a number of questions today as to what checks the Prime Minister had made. What did we hear the Prime Minister admit? He consulted four of his colleagues. Prime Minister, we would like to know who those four colleagues are. We know the Treasurer was not one of them, because the Treasurer has already put you in it by saying you made this decision alone. Who were the four that you consulted? More importantly, you failed to address—
—The Leader of the Opposition.
—the question I asked in relation to inquiries that we believe the Prime Minister or his office made of the Anglican diocese of Brisbane concerning Dr Hollingworth's activities. Prime Minister, you made great play of the question of why you would be making those inquiries 12 months before. I specifically asked you whether, at any time within the 12 months prior to the appointment, such inquiries were made by you or on your behalf of any person within the organisation of the Anglican diocese of Brisbane concerning Dr Hollingworth's activities and performance in his role as Archbishop of Brisbane. I think, given what we know now in terms of the litany of allegations going back over a long period of time under Dr Hollingworth's stewardship, that it beggars belief that inquiries made would not have turned up something. What we want to know is what they did turn up.
The Prime Minister has been evasive every time he has been asked this question at press conferences, and he was evasive again today in question time. This—the very act of appointment, the first stage—does go to the Prime Minister's judgment and that is why this parliament is entitled to know. The Prime Minister is going to take this censure motion. So, now that I have had the opportunity to explain more fully what I have been after, the obligation is on the Prime Minister to explain what checks he made and what inquiries were made on his behalf, in particular of the Anglican diocese of Brisbane. And do not fudge it, Prime Minister. Answer the question. The Australian public is entitled to know, because it is your error of judgment that is at issue here. The Governor-General has resigned. The Prime Minister should have acted sooner to seek his termination. Of that there is no question, and I made this call in February 2002. But the truth of the matter is that we want to know what checks and inquiries were made at the beginning.
We then move on to the circumstances in which the allegations themselves became very public in February 2002. It was on 21 February that, on the basis of the information I had available, on the basis of discussions I had with the Governor-General and the Prime Minister, and on the basis of earlier conversations I had had with the Governor-General, I gave my advice as to the best way he should be dealing with this issue. I have no qualms about that. I was concerned that the office of Governor-General be protected, but I was more concerned that the victims of child sexual abuse be properly dealt with and that we deal with them in a humane way. A head of state who had been embroiled in controversy should have taken the lead in that regard and, whether that involved admitting all of the fault and saying that we had to move on and take steps beyond that, that was my advice to him at the time. He did not adopt that advice, and it is for him to make that judgment call.
I say that for this reason: I have no malevolence against the person, Dr Hollingworth. I do not. I have known him for many years and I have worked with him. I respect the work he has done for the community in the past. I have every sympathy for him in the current circumstances, particularly the circumstances of his wife's illness. But that is a completely separate issue from the failure of the archbishop to act on complaints which he established were true. He chose to exercise Christian forgiveness to the priest rather than carry out his pastoral responsibility to the victims. That is the fundamental problem with this: the Governor-General got it wrong. He got it wrong some time ago. He admitted he got it wrong 15 months ago and yet he still remained in the position because the Prime Minister was prepared to cover up for him. The second error of judgment on the Prime Minister's part—his first was the failure to check the records—was the failure to act when he should have acted in February last year.
It was not just the allegations that the Governor-General admitted to. He then compounded the problem, while in office, in that famous episode of Australian Story, in suggesting it was the girl who commenced the relationship. This was totally wrong. In terms of the Prime Minister asking, `What has this man done wrong in the office of Governor-General?' that is one thing that he did dreadfully wrong. He sought to shift the blame, and he did it on television. He then compounded the problem at that bizarre doorstop just before he flew out of the country, as this first controversy was enmeshing the nation, back in February. That was another error of judgment by the Governor-General. We are used to these errors of judgment, but what we are not prepared to condone is the Prime Minister simply saying, `It was the Governor-General who made errors of judgment; I am a cleanskin.'
The Prime Minister's answer today that he did not seek the dismissal of the Governor-General but that it was for the Governor-General to decide goes to show that, if the Governor-General had dug in, we would still have him in office now. The Prime Minister, by his very answer today, is saying he would not have dismissed the man. Why? It is not because it would have been the correct decision to dismiss him; it is because he is too stubborn as Prime Minister. He knows he made a mistake but he will not admit it. The Prime Minister knows he made a mistake in the appointment and he knows he made the further mistake in failing to act back in February last year.
The simple truth is this: nothing new has emerged in the last 15 months that we did not know at the time the call for the Governor-General to resign was first made. I challenge the Prime Minister today to tell us what additional information there is that justifies a resignation today that did not justify a resignation 15 months ago. In the absence of a resignation today, if the Governor-General had failed to act, I believe it would have been appropriate for a dismissal to be made. The Prime Minister would have been under enormous pressure to do so. That is why he has been in hiding for the past three days, not wanting to be out there in public telling the Australian people what conversations he had with the Governor-General or telling the Governor-General that, if he did not act on his own, he would be forced to advise the Queen accordingly. This Prime Minister is so stubborn that he does not want to admit he got it wrong—he got it wrong about the appointment and he got it wrong about the call in February last year.
The huge issue around this is not just the Prime Minister's failure of judgment; it is the signal it sends to the victims of child sexual abuse. This Prime Minister is prepared to condone, in the highest office in the land, for 15 months after the problem is admitted publicly, a person who covered up for a known paedophile. This person, whose judgment was questioned in the Anglican church inquiry in terms of recall, fundamentally covered up for a known paedophile. What sort of a signal does it send to the Australian public, in particular to the victims of child sex abuse, when the Prime Minister continues to stand by his man and say that he has done nothing wrong? Covering up for a known paedophile is wrong, Prime Minister—you know it and everyone in Australia knows it. The problem is that you were prepared to condone it. That is what the Prime Minister stands guilty of today.
The Governor-General has gone, and should have gone a long time ago, but another important set of ramifications flows from the circumstances surrounding this. I will come to those in a minute, but I want to also make this very salient point. Why is it, Prime Minister, that you chose to stand aside the Governor-General for an allegation that was not proven but were not prepared to have him stood aside for an allegation that was proven? We all know now that the Prime Minister was told by the Governor-General in December that there was a rape allegation against the Governor-General. That was a completely separate issue from the circumstances that should have seen him resign back in February, but there was nevertheless another error of judgment by the Prime Minister. He had a belief that, if an allegation of rape against the head of state could be kept secret, you could get away with it. That was the Prime Minister's judgment, because as soon as the allegation became public the Prime Minister accepted that the Governor-General should stand aside. If it were true when it became public, why didn't he exercise that judgment when it was privately known to him? No-one else in the country knew about this back in December; I certainly did not know about it. But we know that the Prime Minister knew.
The Prime Minister's judgment to yet again cover up for his man, his appointment, has also been exposed. That is what the Prime Minister stands condemned for today, and that is why this censure should pass. This is the Prime Minister's judgment. His failure to act, his preparedness to cover up and his preparedness to sweep away proven allegations of paedophilia and the covering up associated with that send a signal to the Australian community.
There is another opportunity today, Prime Minister, in terms of dealing with the victims of child sexual abuse: to support the private member's bill introduced in this parliament today by the member for Gellibrand. It is a private member's bill that says that we as a community have to learn from this shocking episode and that we have to make a commitment to our families and to our young children that as best we can ensure it this will not happen again. It says we should establish a children's commissioner so at the national level we can coordinate the prosecution of these cases and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. It says we should establish a code of conduct that says that any organisations in receipt of Commonwealth funding have to sign up to a code which, amongst other things, requires that if allegations of child sexual abuse are made they have to be referred. Had such a code existed, Dr Hollingworth would have had no choice. He could not have exercised the Christian prerogative on its own; he would have had an obligation under a code that his church had signed up to to actually report it. The third thing we call for in this bill is a check such that parents in future know that anyone working with their kids has been given approval.
—You might like to interject, I say to the member for Dawson, but this is a serious issue around the country. Whilst I am here today censuring the Prime Minister, I think it is terribly important that we put forward constructive initiatives. I hope that you listen to the content of them, because we will want to try and bring this legislation on for implementation. I hope in the spirit of bipartisanship arising from this tragic episode we can do something for the victims of child sexual abuse and say that it has not all been in vain. I hope we can say to them, `We cannot obliterate the pain that you have gone through, we cannot wipe out the hurt that you and your families have had to put up with, we can't make it easier for you to deal with the shame and the anger that has built up inside, but we can try and make sure it doesn't happen again.' That is why I say to you: look carefully at the bill that the member has introduced and be prepared to look objectively at this sorry, tawdry exercise so we can say, `We won't let it happen again.'
The other thing I would suggest to the Prime Minister—and I conclude on the point from which I began—goes to the question of the appointment of our next Governor-General. Let us learn from the mistakes. Let us not have a circumstance in which the Prime Minister consults just four unnamed colleagues—at least, that is all he has fessed up to. We will wait and see whom he really did consult and what advice he really got. I am suggesting that we put in place, and the Prime Minister agrees to, a new mechanism whereby we establish a consultative committee consisting of the head of his department, the most recent retired Chief Justice of the High Court and a community representative appointed by the Prime Minister to draw up a short list of candidates for Governor-General, that we advertise the position and draw expressions of interest that go to that committee and that the Prime Minister be left to appoint the Governor-General from the short list. If he appointed a candidate not on the short list, he would have to explain to the House the reasons why. This again is a constructive initiative to deal with the morass that we have come from. Most importantly, the Prime Minister deserves censure for the way in which he has terribly handled this. (Time expired)

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—I thank the House and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for moving this censure motion. You do not normally do that, but he has provided me with an added opportunity to deal with some of the more absurd propositions that have been advanced not only in his motion but also during question time. The first thing I would like to deal with, and it goes very much to the spirit of what is in the motion, is the matter raised by the member for Gellibrand, which arose out of a news conference I had on 19 February last year. I was asked a question, and the question ran as follows:
Leaving the Governor General aside may I ask your views on a moral question?
The questioner then went on to ask my view on a legal question. I was not reluctant on this occasion to give it. He said:
Firstly, is it a crime for an adult male to have a sexual encounter with an underage female and secondly if that happens is it an excuse on the part of the adult male that the child led him on?
The answer I gave was as follows:
Laurie I haven't checked the state of the criminal law now but I do remember when I was at law school that it was a defence to a carnal knowledge charge that if the person in question who may have been under the age of 16 was between the ages of 14 and 16 and there was a reasonable belief on the part of the accused that the person was in fact above the age of consent. Now beyond that I can't offer an opinion on that because I don't know all of the facts and the circumstances.
That was a straight statement of fact. It goes on:
JOURNALIST:
[inaudible] offer an opinion?
PRIME MINISTER:
Well I will offer an opinion, I find anything to do with the interference of children abominable, disgusting, and it's something that repels and is repulsive to all Australians and, you know, I think the community should be united in its hostility to it. I deplore breaches of trust that occur whether it's in a church organisation or any kind of school and it's not limited as some reports would have had it in the past to schools run by the Catholic Church or the Anglican Church. Sadly it's occurred in government schools as well in years gone by. So I mean it makes my flesh creep.
That is what I said. After another question, in which the journalist finally said, `and a moral one', I said:
Well I don't think older men should take advantage of underage girls, no I don't.
—That was a separate question.
—The member for Werriwa! The Prime Minister will be heard in silence.
—In my language, that is the attitude I had.
—The member for Gellibrand has forgotten her status in the House, and so has the member for Batman.
—I regard it as absolutely reprehensible of the Leader of the Opposition to counsel and procure the asking of such a question. But of course that is typical of the Leader of the Opposition—and you noticed the muted reactions from those who sat behind him as he delivered his withering attack on me and the Governor-General regarding this appointment. Let me, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, take him through a few realities about the appointments of governors-general in this country. Let me inform the House that I followed the same procedure that was followed regarding the appointment of Dr Hollingworth as was followed, in my understanding, by Mr Keating in relation to the appointment of Sir William Deane.
—I warn the member for Blaxland, since he understands no other language!
—It was the same procedure that was followed by Prime Minister Bob Hawke in the appointment of Bill Hayden as Governor-General, the same procedure that was followed by Ben Chifley in the appointment of Sir William McKel as Governor-General, and the same procedure followed by Gough Whitlam in the appointment of Sir John Kerr as Governor-General. In other words, I have followed exactly the same procedure. To my knowledge, they followed it in the past because that was the constitutional custom and convention.
We had a vote in this country in November 1999, and the Australian people voted in favour of retaining the present constitutional monarchical system. Some in the parliament voted yes and some in the parliament voted no. I allowed my colleagues a free vote. It was the right thing to do. I respect the fact that many of my colleagues do not share my antirepublican sentiments. The fact is that the majority of the people voted in favour of the present system. As the New South Wales Premier said on radio this morning, the core of the present system is prime ministerial government. The core of the present system would be undermined if there was anything in the nature of a popular election for the appointment of what is, after all, an important but nonetheless executive power in the country, and a ceremonial position. I hold very strongly to the view that the constitutional convention should continue to be observed.
In recommending the appointment of Dr Hollingworth, I believed I was recommending a person of high intelligence, a person with a proven record of service to the community, a person who was skilful in handling public situations and a person who had led, in my understanding, by reasonable standards a morally correct life. I am not a person who sets himself in some kind of pious moral judgment over others. We are all flawed individuals. In the course of this debate we have had a fair amount of delivery of speeches suggesting that there are some in the community who stand above all others. I am in awe of the perfect judgment of so many of my fellow Australians! I am in absolute awe! I wish I had that capacity to avoid errors of judgment. Of course I have been guilty of errors of judgment in my life. Who amongst us could suggest that they have not been guilty of errors of judgment? Who amongst us could stand before any audience in this country and say, `Oh, no, my judgment has always been flawless; I have always been absolutely perfect. I've never allowed my charity towards somebody to overcome my better judgment'? None of us. None of us could honestly stand before their mirror or their maker and possibly make that kind of assertion.
—The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence. The same courtesy will be extended to the Prime Minister.
—I am certainly not going to do that. Let me also say this in relation to the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition: I accept responsibility for Dr Hollingworth's appointment. I have never sought to avoid it. I made a bona fide judgment on the information I had at the time. That judgment at the time was justified; that judgment was supported by many people in the community. His appointment was very widely welcomed and his appointment was very widely welcomed because he was seen as a man who had served the underprivileged with dedication and commitment for all of his adult life. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has so miserably said about him, either here or on previous occasions, can take from Peter Hollingworth a record of decades of service to the underprivileged in this country. Nothing that has happened will stop me saying that to this parliament or to any section of the Australian people. We can stand here in our ivory castle of parliamentary privilege and we can attack people, but we ought to take account of the totality of their lives—we ought to take account of the total contribution that they have made.
If you look at the life of Peter Hollingworth, you see a person who has made a contribution to the relief of suffering. He is a person who deeply regrets, obviously, the great error of judgment he committed in relation to the priest Elliot and the matters that were canvassed in the report of the Brisbane Archdiocese of the Anglican Church. He very deeply regrets that. I think all of us would know that, and to say that and to express an understanding and sympathy for him in no way diminishes our abhorrence of child abuse. It is quite reprehensible of the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that, because we do not adopt in full his condemnation of Dr Hollingworth, in some way we are soft on child abuse. That has been the gravamen and the miserable, baseless levels to which the accusations of the opposition have fallen today. They can do nothing better than to conjure up that kind of implication and that kind of suggestion.
—The member for Werriwa is warned!
—Of course the government and I, in particular, were not being soft on child abuse in taking the view I took in relation to Dr Hollingworth. I was merely stating what I believed to be a correct judgment: that he had not done, in the office of Governor-General, anything to warrant his removal from that position. That is a judgment I made last year, it is a judgment I made again a few weeks ago, and it is a judgment that I stand by. In the end, Dr Hollingworth decided that the best thing for the office was for him to go. He did the right thing. He did the proper thing by the office and he deserves the respect of this parliament, not the denigration of the opposition, for having taken that decision.
Let me say two other things about the office. We have heard a lot about the dignity, the respect and the prestige of the office. One of the great mistakes of history is for people to impute that, because there has been a controversy, the controversy is automatically transferred to the office. I do not believe the office of Governor-General has been weakened by what has happened. For his information, may I through you, Mr Speaker, inform the Leader of the Opposition that we have not, much to his disappointment, had a constitutional crisis over the past few days. I did not feel yesterday, as I watched St George defeat South Sydney by 16-14, that we were going through a constitutional crisis. I believed quite the contrary. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the system—
Opposition members interjecting—
—The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence; we will extend the same courtesy to the Prime Minister.
—If a method of parliamentary selection and removal of the Governor-General or a president of Australia had been in place on this occasion, I wonder whether the matter would have been resolved as easily, as smoothly and with such stability as it has been on this particular occasion. Some of my colleagues around me might disagree with me on that. I would respect their views and I would not try to dragoon them into holding an alternative point of view, but I put that on the table. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, far from demonstrating that the system needs radical change, it may well demonstrate that, in the words of Paul Kelly—hardly a pro-monarchist; very much a pro-republican—in the Australian this morning, the system had shown `subtlety and flexibility' in the way in which the issue had been handled. So disappointment to the Leader of the Opposition and no constitutional crisis; that is disappointment No. 1. Disappointment No. 2 for the Leader of the Opposition, having heard the muted response from his colleagues behind him, was there was not much traction for him out of the issue either.
Once again, we have seen the opposition leader go right over the top. Instead of settling for a conventional attack on the Prime Minister and the Governor-General, he goes right over the top. He makes allegations of a cover-up; I did not cover up anything in relation to the matters that came out in February last year. Everything was on the record that had come out in February last year. I made a judgment in February last year that I was not required to act, and I repeat for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition that the judgment was that the Governor-General had not behaved in a way, since assuming his office, to warrant my recommending to the Queen that his commission should be revoked. That judgment was right then, and it remained right until the time of his resignation. I defend that judgment. I am prepared to be held accountable for that judgment, and I believe that judgment to be correct.
I have been asked about the rape allegations against Dr Hollingworth. I make this point to the Leader of the Opposition: when they were first made in December, they were bare allegations contained in a solicitor's letter. It would have been absurd for the Governor-General to stand aside on the basis of such a letter, especially as he denied the claims. In the course of the court proceedings, a suppression order was sought and obtained by the now tragically deceased lady, then there was a suppression order obtained by the Governor-General. It was always on the understanding, and was made plain in the Governor-General's videoed statement, that if leave to bring the action out of time had been granted then the suppression orders would have been lifted. There was no cover-up. The law worked; the system worked; the process worked, and any suggestion that Peter Hollingworth got a preference because of his position is bunkum. The first suppression order was obtained by the now tragically deceased lady, and the cover was only blown on everything improperly by the member for Melbourne, who shamefully put the questions on notice. I reject them, I reject the censure motion, and I reject the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—The Prime Minister yet again showed, at the beginning of his response to this censure motion, that his first response always is to go to the legal niceties and never to the essence of this issue, which is that child abuse is wrong. What this Prime Minister does not get is that covering up child abuse is wrong. Through his inability to deal with it, he has shown a very serious error of judgment in this very sorry saga.
We have heard a lot about the word `innocent' over the last few days. The people to whom it most applies are the children in our community. We all know that they are the most vulnerable. They are the ones who do not wield any power or authority; it is adults who do that. Children explicitly rely on us as adults to protect them from harm, and it is a distressing fact that so often we fail to provide that protection. The trauma and devastation that we have heard so much about, which has been suffered by those who have been victims of child sexual assault, stays with them for a lifetime. Many have found in their adult lives that they are scarred by deep emotional problems as a direct result of their horrific experiences. But what has been particularly traumatic for many who have survived such attacks has been the process of denial and cover-up they have faced when seeking some acknowledgment of and justice for what has happened to them, often over a very long period of time.
It is very hard for most of us to imagine the courage it must take for a victim of child sexual assault to come to terms with what was done to them as a child and to confront their abuser. How much harder must it be when they believe their attacker has been sheltered from justice by a major social institution and by people in high office? It is essential that all children—in fact, anyone who is abused—know that they can turn to those in authority and be believed and cared for. They must know that it is in their interests, rather than those of the abuser or the reputation of any institution of which they may be a part, that their story will be listened to. Tragically, though, it is apparent that all too often victims of child sexual abuse have been let down by us, with their claims dismissed, their cases covered up and their attackers sheltered from public scrutiny. Because of this, child sexual abuse runs to the core of our morality as a society. The way we treat victims of abuse reflects directly on how we regard the most vulnerable and innocent in our society and the importance we attach to their safety and their security.
It is a moral issue that we all know goes to the heart of society. Yet, at every tortuous twist and turn of the public debate that led to yesterday's resignation by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister has refused to act. He has hidden behind the law and invoked legal niceties to avoid dealing with the profound legal issues that this episode has thrown up. As early as 21 February last year, it was apparent to all of us—certainly to those on this side of the parliament—that Dr Hollingworth's position had been made untenable by persistent allegations that he had failed to deal properly with complaints of child sexual abuse while Archbishop of Brisbane. The Leader of the Opposition called for the Prime Minister to act. We said he should advise the Queen to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment. Instead we saw the Prime Minister's first attempts to hide behind legal semantics. Initially he said the Governor-General had not been given an opportunity to respond to these allegations, and then he dismissed the idea of an independent inquiry into the allegations. On 18 February last year, the Prime Minister said:
This business of every time an allegation is made against somebody then you immediately rush out and have an independent inquiry, that's just a way of trying to throw further mud.
The Governor-General of Australia was the subject of some of the most serious allegations that can be made against a person, and the Prime Minister dismissed calls for an inquiry as a mud-slinging exercise. Three days later the Prime Minister invoked another legalistic formulation to dodge the hard moral issue at the core of this controversy. He said:
There are no grounds to advise, on the information now available to me, Her Majesty to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment.
He also said:
I don't find any material evidence that Dr Hollingworth has been soft on child abuse.
Further:
... I cannot exercise my prerogative of final and sole advice ... based on unreasonable smearing of somebody's reputation. I have to base it on a sense of fairness and justice ...
According to the Prime Minister and many of his ministers, Dr Hollingworth was guilty of nothing more than errors of judgment and, as we have heard so often, a poor choice of words. The Prime Minister's determination 16 months ago to keep Dr Hollingworth in office was not just a breathtaking failure of leadership; it also betrayed a deep moral misjudgment. The Anglican Church had to hold the inquiry that the Prime Minister should have commissioned. It found that Dr Hollingworth had, in his own words, committed a serious error of judgment in failing to dismiss a confessed paedophile from the Anglican Church. This was the material evidence that the Prime Minister said he could not find. But, instead of taking on board the findings of the inquiry, the Prime Minister again retreated behind legalese. Instead of taking the findings of the inquiry seriously, he claimed he had found no evidence of any deliberate misconduct by the Governor-General in his then office as Archbishop of Brisbane. So, in less than a year, the Prime Minister's measure of Dr Hollingworth's conduct transformed from `material evidence'. Once the material evidence had been found, the test changed to `deliberate misconduct'. How he twists and turns.
Prime Minister, it is obvious from Dr Hollingworth's comments on ABC television last year—and, of course, now we see again in the contents of a letter that he wrote just recently to the Archbishop of Brisbane, Phillip Aspinall—that he still fails to grasp the nature of child sexual abuse. In both instances, he implied that it was the victim—in both cases, a 14-year-old girl—who had initiated a relationship with the abusive adult. This is a critical part of this whole sorry saga. Whether or not a child seeks to initiate a sexual relationship, it is the adult who bears sole responsibility, first morally, Prime Minister, and then legally. The power and authority of the adult and the vulnerability of the child mean that any sexual relationship between the two is one of abuse. That is why child sexual abuse is wrong. It is a simple proposition, but one that Dr Hollingworth seems to have been unable to grasp.
But where Dr Hollingworth has shown through his actions that he simply does not get it, the Prime Minister has shown through his conduct that he has been prepared to cover up. That is what we are so distressed about on the part of those victims of child sexual abuse who have had cover-up for far too long. They have been subjected to what is now almost 18 months of evasion and so much cover-up by this Prime Minister as he has tried to squirm his way out of this political mess. Forced to decide between the morally correct course of action to terminate Dr Hollingworth's appointment and toughing it out for political reasons, the Prime Minister has taken the latter course. As a result, we know that the office of Governor-General has been diminished, but I would say that this is a minor note compared with the message that the Prime Minister's moral turpitude has sent to victims of child sexual abuse.
What his moral turpitude has told them is that the practice of cover-ups and conspiracies of silence that has immeasurably added to their suffering extends to the highest office in this land. The Prime Minister has, for the past 18 months, put the interests of his appointment above those of victims of sexual abuse—exactly the same crime that Dr Hollingworth was found to have committed by the Anglican Church inquiry. But the Prime Minister is, of course, not alone in his moral bankruptcy on this issue. Like a compliant chorus over there, members of the government have surrendered their moral judgment as well. Once again, they have obediently taken their marching orders from the Prime Minister, one after the other. The minister for immigration thought Dr Hollingworth should be forgiven, while the minister for workplace relations peddled the line that the Governor-General was guilty of nothing more than an `error of judgment' and had done nothing wrong while being in vice-regal office.
Yesterday, the minister for education, who so prides himself on values, declined repeated opportunities on national television to say that child sexual abuse is wrong. That is the essence of this: child sexual abuse is wrong. But, after repeated questioning yesterday, the minister—who originally welcomed Dr Hollingworth's appointment as `inspired'—could not bring himself to even mention the issue of child sexual abuse and again passed up the opportunity to condemn the cover-up of abuse. This is the standard of morality to which this government, in its efforts to avoid political embarrassment, has fallen. This is how far it has fallen. It has locked itself into what can only be described as a moral nether world, where the rights of victims of child sexual abuse are sacrificed in the name of politics. That is why this Prime Minister stands censured today.
The Prime Minister might have wanted to portray this whole episode as one involving principles of law. But Australians do not need lawyers to tell them that child abuse is wrong. They do not need lawyers to tell them that the Prime Minister should have acted 16 months ago. If he had, the level of trauma and distress that so many victims of sexual abuse have already been through may have been reduced. But, by choosing to tough it out, which is exactly what the Prime Minister has done, he and his government not only have added to their pain but have severely undermined the trust and respect felt by many for those filling the highest offices in this land—not only the office of Governor-General but the office of Prime Minister and the office of senior ministers of this government who, one after the other, have refused to acknowledge that child abuse is wrong, that cover-up of child abuse is wrong and that cover-up and protection of paedophiles is wrong.
This is a truly dangerous and terrible legacy that this government has left us. It has meant that so many people who are victims of child sexual abuse do not feel that they will get the protection that they deserve when they come forward. We censure the Prime Minister for the cover-up that he has been engaged in and for the way in which he continues to turn to a legal answer rather than recognising the moral basis on which this criticism has been based for the last 15 or 16 months. He stands censured by this parliament and by the Australian people for not acting to remove a Governor-General who failed to protect children in their greatest hour of need.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,9,1,speech
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2003-05-26,"—In rejecting the censure motion on the Prime Minister, I want to say at the outset that I regard child sexual abuse and domestic violence as truly horrendous, as I think all of us in this place would. But let me say this: the Prime Minister has my total and absolute respect for his integrity in relation to the needs of the nation's children—their economic needs, their social needs, their educational needs and their safety needs. Any attempts to dent his standing in these matters are, I think, grossly unfair and grossly unreasonable. They will be seen to be such by the Australian people, for I would have thought that, if there is one thing that political friend and foe alike would have acknowledged about the Prime Minister, it is his very deep love of children and his very real interest in their circumstances and in what their nation has to offer them.
I am sure it will titillate the opposition, but I am one of those who were consulted by the Prime Minister. I am quite happy to say that. He first rang me when I was in China pursuing gas deals. I, of course, have no intention of revealing in this place all of the conversation we had, but I do want to refer to one germane part of that conversation and of those that followed it. It was that I had never heard and was certainly not able to pass on any remarks which went to impropriety on the part of Dr Hollingworth. The member for Brisbane will recall that he and I participated in a forum in Brisbane once on rural poverty, which Dr Hollingworth had convened. In the dealings that I have had with him, the fundraising events and so forth from time to time in Brisbane, I have always found that he was regarded in terms of his own principles and behaviour as a man who set the highest of personal standards, and so I do record that.
I would be the first to say that child abuse is truly awful. Like domestic violence, it represents such a serious breakdown in human relationships that it threatens the very fabric of our society. Tragically, I suspect that is particularly the case in too many of our Indigenous communities. The previous speaker made the allegation that the Prime Minister, far from accepting the seriousness of child abuse, was prepared to try to sweep it under the carpet—to cover up. I think that is a grossly unfair allegation and that it fails the test of even the most superficial of scrutiny. It ought to be recorded that last year the Prime Minister placed child protection on the Council of Australian Governments' agenda—the COAG agenda. The Prime Minister put it on the national agenda with the state premiers.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Order! I remind the member for Gellibrand that she may wish to vote on this motion.
—I hear from the other side, `And then he did what?' The truth is that the states were not very interested in it. That is the truth. Despite the fact that overwhelmingly they have responsibility for the institutions, particularly in relation to child welfare, that oversight the wellbeing of the nation's children, they were not particularly interested in Commonwealth involvement, although it was agreed—and I think this is very important—that the Commonwealth would work with the states and the territories on Indigenous child protection. That is happening; it is long overdue. I, as a member in this place, have one of the highest levels of Indigenous people amongst my constituents of any in this place, and some of the statistics which point to the level of abuse, particularly of pre-teenage girls in Indigenous communities, are absolutely terrible. Progress is being made and I believe that is a good thing. But the point of this exercise is to say that it was the Prime Minister who put it on the COAG agenda. This is in distinct contradiction to the claim made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Prime Minister was not prepared to tackle this issue and that he sought, in fact, to cover it up.
As I mentioned, in the circles that I have moved in, in my contact with Dr Hollingworth and, indeed, in terms of my own active involvement as a member of the Anglican Church, I have never heard any claim—and I was able to say that to the Prime Minister at the time—of impropriety on his part, particularly in relation to his attitude towards what could only be termed as abuse of sexuality and all that that might encompass. I have to say that I do see, though, more self-righteousness around on this than I am comfortable with, and there is quite a bit of it. I do think that some of it actually comes from an area that I would like to say a few things about: a desire on the part of some to attack the Christian Church in this country. I think this is quite an important issue that ought to be traced through. I do think that it ought to be noted that Dr Hollingworth, in the tradition of the Anglican Church, has shown great concern for the vulnerable, the weak and the oppressed.
Tracing through some historical figures in that great tradition, people like John Newton come to mind. He was a man who referred to his belief that a wretch like him could be saved. From what? He was saved from a despicable and utterly appalling record as a slave-trader and a sexual abuser of the vulnerable. He was responsible for the horrible trade and directly responsible for the abuse and the death of very large numbers of people. But he turned away. I heard the term `Amazing Grace', and that is the hymn that he is remembered for. He turned away from all that, having seen the light. I want to say this about him. We judge him now on balance to have been a huge contributor.
—Order! The member for Jagajaga was heard in silence. The same courtesy will be extended to the Deputy Prime Minister.
—We form a weighted and balanced view, a total view, of the contribution that he made to a more humane, caring and just society. He in turn greatly influenced another man by the name of William Wilberforce, who spent his life seeking the abolition of the slave trade, of slavery itself—and they were different things—and also of other things such as the fair treatment by the British East India Company of the natives in India, which probably contributed to the fact that that nation has survived as a democracy to this day rather than having torn itself apart. That work led further to another great Anglican churchman's contribution to our culture's values. Lord Shaftesbury spent a lifetime standing up for vulnerable children, in particular getting them out of the coal pits, where they were required to work from the ages of eight and nine for 12 hours a day, and ensuring that they got an education.
I think that these men ought not to be forgotten. It ought not to be forgotten that the church, when being true to its charter, has always stood against oppression, violence and abuse and for the weak, the oppressed and the vulnerable. I do not think that it ought to be forgotten either—I make no apology for saying these things in this House—that Dr Hollingworth has been soundly in that tradition of standing for the oppressed and the vulnerable. We ought to be prepared to form balanced judgments and to take everything into account. Think of his work for the poor, I remember him being extensively quoted at this dispatch box on this side of the House by a Labor Prime Minister when I first came into this place. He was expounded upon in terms of the points of view that he was putting on behalf of his work with the Brotherhood of St Laurence, where he sought to reach out to the poor, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable. He was appointed Chaplain of the Brotherhood of St Laurence in 1964, and he stayed with them—I understand not even purchasing a home of his own so that he could live in relatively humble circumstances amongst the disadvantaged—for no fewer than 25 years. Who of us can claim to have given up such a time in our lives in the pursuit of better outcomes for the poor and the weak, but most of all, in this context, for the vulnerable? He is widely recognised as a passionately outspoken champion of the disadvantaged and, in many ways, I think his work has been quite groundbreaking.
In that context I again make this plea: in passing judgment on him we should balance things in totality. He has acknowledged his serious error of judgment, and it was a serious error of judgment. All of us are grappling with this problem. I do not think I am known as someone who lacks compassion for children or an abhorrence of child abuse—I do not think I fall into that category—and I freely say to this place that I am still grappling with the enormity of this problem, how it is that we have unleashed this monster in our society, particularly in our Indigenous community, and what we do to address it. I am still grappling with it. I do not blame others who are still grappling with it at all. I would say to them, if they are grappling with it, `Good on you for not wanting to brush it under the carpet.' It is a very serious issue; it is a very hard issue to come to grips with. Many of us need to be very careful lest in some way we, as parents and as community leaders, have contributed to, or are continuing to contribute to, a softness or to an opening up of inappropriate values and approaches that encourage child abuse or domestic violence. We have to be very cautious indeed. I would counsel great caution in passing judgment on one who turns away from something that he has acknowledged was a mistake. On a personal note, I would always want to be treated fairly in that regard—I believe I have treated others fairly; I hope I have—lest I find one day that I have committed some serious error of judgment.
I want to refer very clearly in that context to something the Prime Minister said. The fact is that the Governor-General has paid a very terrible price for an error of judgment. It ought to be remembered that he has not abused children; he has not been some sort of pervert himself. He has made a serious error of judgment. He has suffered, is suffering and I suspect will continue to suffer hugely for it, notwithstanding his public acknowledgment of that error. I believe it is time now to stop hounding him. He has courageously put the office ahead of his own interests and he should be recognised for that—just as he is entitled to a balanced account and assessment of his life's work in which he has arguably done more for others than a great majority of us could ever hope to achieve. He is entitled to our forgiveness now that he has taken it upon himself to fulfil the painful role of falling on his own sword.
But to return to the Prime Minister, who is the object of this censure motion today, I want to say this: many of these attacks are deeply personal. I think the House will forgive me if I say that I do know the Prime Minister at a personal level. I do know that he is not a man who would take the sexual abuse of children lightly in any way, shape or form. I believe that the overwhelming bulk of Australians would accept that as a given. I do not believe he is a man who would seek to cover up. Quite frankly, I know that he has thought very deeply—even to the point of a touch of agonising at times, and who could blame him for that?—about this matter in all of its complexities in his desire to see a fair judgment and fair outcomes. In my view he deserves no censure in this place today. This censure motion should be roundly rejected. I do not particularly want to introduce politics into this debate; it ought to be too serious for it. But, frankly, I believe this whole matter smacks of opportunism. I believe that the Prime Minister deserves to see this censure motion roundly rejected today and I believe, in the same vein, that Dr Hollingworth now deserves our respect and understanding for his courageous decision to step aside.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,9,1,speech

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—Mr Speaker, on 13 May I asked you a question about the availability of press clippings on the Department of the House of Representatives intranet site, and you kindly responded to me in a letter dated 15 May. I need to preface my question by saying that all senators, of course, get a daily service of Media Monitors clippings. In your reply, Mr Speaker, you say that `there are other avenues for members to access press clippings online, such as the direct feed from AAP news service, the ParlInfo database of newspaper clippings and various newspaper web sites'.
The AAP, as I understand it, actually runs a news service wherein its reporters report the news. There is available on AAP a press release service, but this in no way constitutes a press clipping service. If a press clipping service is available on AAP, I would be most grateful if the staff might indicate to me or show me how it might be accessed.
In relation to the ParlInfo Library database of newspaper clippings, it is true that they are available, principally as a search engine. I would emphasise that a search engine is not a newspaper clipping service. However, if I were to access this service today, 200 items would come up. I would have to click on each item at least twice, print that story, double-click twice and go to the next story, which would take an inordinate amount of time. Unless staff can show me a much quicker way of doing it, I believe there is no way of accessing all those clippings at any one time. The clippings are sourced from Media Monitors, to which the Library subscribes.
Mr Speaker, I am more than happy to have some of my printing entitlement used by the Senate for them to print up Media Monitors.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2003-05-26,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the recent announcement of the Carr Labor Government to declare 65,000 hectares of land as 15 new National Parks, State Conservation Areas and State Forest reserves;
(2)	is concerned that this declaration may be in breach of the Regional Forest Agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth;
(3)	is concerned that the removal of this land from production will impact upon timber resources required to sustain employment in timber communities and the future viability of those communities; and
(4)	is concerned that substantial Commonwealth and New South Wales Government funds invested under FISAP will be placed at risk as a result of this declaration.
I am putting this motion to the House because I am concerned about the future of the $256 million timber industry in the north-east of New South Wales and the 1,400 people employed in it. In March this year the New South Wales Labor government made an announcement locking up 65,000 hectares of forest in the north-east region of the state. This declaration has very serious economic and environmental repercussions, which I ask the House to recognise in this motion. It is important to note that this declaration was made in the context of the New South Wales state election. It was made at the height of that election, a time when the Carr Labor government was seeking Greens preferences. Conservation is a very important environmental issue. However, this decision to lock up 65,000 hectares of forest was born of cynical political opportunism in the heat of a general election rather than any real concern for the environment.
The regional forest agreement, or RFA, was finalised in 2000. It was an agreement between the Commonwealth and the state governments on the conservation, protection and logging of forests. The purpose of the RFA was to provide some security over the next 20 years to the forest industry. In the process of making the regional forest agreements, areas were assessed for their conservation value. Certain forests were specified as having little or no conservation value, and the industry was allowed to log in these areas. The agreement was to deliver unprecedented security to the industry and the workers within it, and, through security, the confidence to invest in an industry that would be viable in the long term. It also incorporated a significant forest industry assistance package. It was a balanced outcome and it represented more than three years of detailed scientific analysis and stakeholder and community consultation. That security has been thrown out the window with this declaration, and confidence has been severely damaged.
The Premier of New South Wales, Premier Carr, said in this announcement that his government would continue to guarantee the minimum allocation to the industry, totalling some 269,000 cubic metres of timber per annum over the next 20 years. The Premier has said that the declaration of these areas as national parks, state conservation areas and state forest reserves—the declaration locking up these areas—will not affect the supply of timber. A total of 219,000 hectares has now been reserved and taken from the guarantee given to the industry under the RFA. The guarantee has been breached by the Carr Labor government. It was a guarantee of sufficient forest to supply 269,000 cubic metres of timber to the industry per annum. Bob Carr says that taking this amount of land will not affect the supply of timber.
Premier Carr's contention is not possible physically, mathematically or ecologically. It will mean that the supply that has been guaranteed to the timber industry will fall. The result of that will be that foresters will have to get their timber supply from a decreased area. The pressures on the remaining land to meet production targets cannot be good for the environment. We currently have a deficit of forest product imports of some $1.7 billion. We should be encouraging sustainable forest industries for the economic prosperity of the country as well as for sensible environmental outcomes. The effect of putting the squeeze on our domestic sources of production will be that we will have to import more. This means that we are potentially encouraging a shift in production from the managed to the unmanaged forests of the world. Hence, from a global perspective, environmental outcomes following Bob Carr's declaration could be far worse.
I have sighted Bob Carr's signature on the RFA document, an agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales which was intended to be binding on the parties. These recent declarations call into question the value of the signature of Bob Carr. They call into question the value of commitments made by the New South Wales government. After more than three years of a painfully detailed process of scientific research and evaluation, the RFA was reached, concluding that these areas now being reserved and locked up by the New South Wales government had little or no conservation value. Then suddenly in March, in the heat of the New South Wales state election, it appeared that they do have conservation value—the conservation of Bob Carr's Labor government.
The environmental basis upon which the declaration has been made is shaky at best. One of the areas to be locked up is Pine Creek Forest in my electorate. Much of this area is plantation timber. Much of the forest to be locked up is not native to the area—for instance, gympie messmate from Queensland is grown there. A reasonable person would presume that forests of high conservation value should at least be native to the area rather than made up of imported species.
One of the long-standing sawmilling companies in my electorate, which is located right in the heart of the region, will be affected by this. They employ around 50 people. They believe that their quota will be halved. At least eight people will lose their jobs at the sawmill within 12 months. The House might be interested to know that the supply of timber to this mill is already low and the mill operates without a great deal of certainty as to where its next load of timber will be coming from. This is something of concern for business stability and, of course, jobs. There have been occasions when mills have run out of timber altogether, and I have also been told of instances where demand has been met by trucking in timber from the south of the state. The flow-on effects will be disastrous for the fragile local rural economy. Of course if you halve the mill's quota that will impact on associated industries, such as the transport industry, which carries the timber from the mill.
The Carr Labor government's proposals are currently before the New South Wales parliament. That legislation also proposes to limit the rights of enjoyment to land held under perpetual leases in New South Wales. It proposes to give the environment minister in New South Wales powers that will interfere with the quiet enjoyment and exclusive possession of perpetual lease land.
I wish to speak of two constituents in my electorate who hold their lands under perpetual lease: Mr Jim Freeman and Mr Terry Tibbitt. They are very concerned about loss of property rights. No straight answers have been forthcoming from the Carr Labor government to clarify what rights perpetual leaseholders will have under these changes. This is an issue of concern for Mr Tibbitt, Mr Freeman and others throughout New South Wales who are having their property rights interfered with.
Is this issue significant? The House might note that a report by the New South Wales Lands Department in 1989 said that there were 22,000 perpetual leases held in the state. I understand that that covers about 38 per cent of the land area of New South Wales. Those leases carry with them certain economic expectations and enjoyment rights which are vested in the lessees. These will be eroded under the legislation. Compensation may be payable to these lessees and to many participants in the timber industry who have planned their businesses into the future on the basis of a certain level of supply—some 269,000 cubic metres of timber which was guaranteed under the RFA signed by Bob Carr on 31 March 2000. Some have spoken of over $200 million in compensation being payable.
Bob Carr has abandoned the perpetual leaseholders as well as the timber industry. He has broken the spirit of the RFA entered into with the federal government, which was carefully designed to ensure ecologically sustainable management of forests in the north-east of New South Wales and certainty for forest based industries and communities in the north-east region.
Point No. 4 in the motion addresses the issue that, due to Bob Carr's actions, the Commonwealth's investment in FISAP is at risk. The House might note as background that FISAP—the Forestry Industry Structural Adjustment Package—is a program set up to provide structural adjustment assistance to forest industry businesses and workers. It is a strategy for helping those participants adjust to the RFA entered into in 2000 and either remain viable players in the industry or exit.
The RFA was an agreement between the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments. It was signed by Premier Carr and the Prime Minister. The agreement committed both governments to see to the administration and management of the forests in New South Wales for the following 20 years. It also committed both governments to assist the industry through FISAP.
Significant Commonwealth funds have been spent on FISAP. To date, some $60 million has been injected into the industry through the package. This money is at risk because of the forests declaration. The funds put into the industry have been an investment by the Commonwealth in the next 20 years of the industry. If demand for timber cannot be met, the mills will shut down. This will put the Commonwealth's investment under FISAP at very substantial risk indeed.
The House should note that the actions of Bob Carr are without scientific basis, attack the foundations of the RFA, place substantial Commonwealth investment under the FISAP program at risk and may ultimately result in negative environmental outcomes. In commending this motion to the House, I ask members to consider the families of the workers who will be affected by Carr's declaration and the timber communities, industries, businesses and individuals who have made investments and will suffer from the breaking of the promise of certainty by Bob Carr.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—From what I heard in the speech by the member for Cowper, it appears that the way he is approaching this announcement by the Carr government is nothing more than scaremongering on his part. Let us remember that the announcement made recently by the Carr government was in fact keeping an election promise that was made very public during the last campaign, only a couple of months ago. I remind the member for Cowper and his National Party colleagues that the result of that election campaign was that the Carr government was re-elected with an overwhelming majority and given great support by the people of New South Wales. That support came in response to very heavy campaigning around these sorts of environmental issues, so it is clear that the Carr government has a mandate for the decisions it is taking in putting these measures in place.
It was a very significant announcement by the Carr government. The idea of the announcement is to protect the remaining forest icons in north-east New South Wales while ensuring sufficient timber to maintain long-term supply agreements and industry jobs. The announcement that was made recently is all about keeping the government's election commitment. That commitment will protect the remaining forest icons in north-east New South Wales, and that will protect virtually all old-growth forests on public land. This level of protection is unparalleled in Australia.
Areas to be transferred include Wollumbin, which adjoins the Mount Warning National Park and protects rainforest, including the World Heritage listed Amaroo rainforest and old-growth; the Whian Whian forest; Chaelundi, which will add to one of the largest areas of old-growth forests left in north-east New South Wales and is an important habitat for the tiger quoll, the powerful owl and the sooty owl; Little Wonder, which will act as an important corridor to link the New England wilderness area and Dungirr National Park, protect old-growth and rainforest and act as an important habitat for the powerful owl, the tiger quoll and the giant barred frog; and Jilliby, which will protect 40 threatened and significant fauna species such as koalas, the long-nosed potoroo and yellow-bellied and squirrel gliders. I guess the point I am making by listing those areas of forest is to spell out just how significant that announcement is and that it is about protecting forest icons in New South Wales.
Of course it goes beyond just the aesthetics. The government's moves will significantly improve the level of protection of biodiversity within the north-east reserve system, including the protection of threatened or regionally significant plant and animal species and the protection of forest ecosystems, rainforest and old-growth. This announcement is very significant. It is part of the Carr government's very serious commitment to the environmental protection required in his state. I again remind members opposite that these promises, made during the election campaign, were given resounding support by the public of New South Wales.
I would also like to go over some of the other commitments from the Carr government which just go to show that this is a government that has demonstrated the ability to work cooperatively with industry, environment groups and the primary industry sector to come up with ways of getting the best outcome for all these sectors. One of the great examples of the Carr Labor government is the Sustainable Energy Development Authority which, through its partnership approach with industry and environment groups, has delivered new industry sectors in the renewables area that have led to more jobs. In fact, SEDA has fantastic figures. Since 1996, the work of SEDA and its business partners has attracted $620 million in investment in New South Wales.
The Carr Labor government has also worked very cooperatively with scientists from the Wentworth Group, landholders in New South Wales and environmental groups to come up with cooperative approaches to halting land clearing and improving the salinity situation in that state. The Carr government has a proud record of these sorts of partnerships, and I think it is purely scaremongering on the part of the members opposite today to suggest that this will not continue in the forest industry. Quite apart from that, it is a significant environmental measure from the Carr government and should be applauded.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—The Carr government's decision to declare 65,000 hectares of land in northern New South Wales as 15 new national parks, state conservation areas and state forest reserves demonstrates Bob Carr's real attitude towards forestry and the timber industry in general. The signing of regional forest agreements followed extensive studies and the addition of hundreds of thousands of hectares of new reserves. Fewer than two years after pen was put to paper, Carr was prepared to just abandon the deal without consultation.
Before the New South Wales state election on 22 March, I predicted in a media release that Carr was moving towards trying to set up a cosy preference deal with the Greens in Monaro. It is with no pleasure that I can now say that I was right. At the eleventh hour, after the Greens said that they would not do a preference deal with Labor in Monaro, there was a sudden turnaround. A media release at the time from the Greens candidate said:
We are willing to preference the ALP if there is a public announcement that:
No New South Wales native forest will be used for charcoal production or biomass burning;
There will be an immediate moratorium on logging in the CRPs already identified, being Deua, Badja, Nalbaugh, Cathcart, Monga, Wandella, Coolangubra, Murrah and Yurammie, a reduced logging regime for the Clyde River catchment, and a commitment to the creation of National Parks out of these CRPs within twelve months;
Recognises that woodchipping of native forests is both economically and environmentally unsustainable;
There will be a package for any timber workers displaced by the moratorium and the creation of these Parks which includes:
An option for Government buy-back of machinery;
Six months salary and/or immediate reemployment in the new Parks in restorative and maintenance areas.
Interestingly, we have not heard those sought-after assurances stated publicly. But we do know the preference deal did occur, to the great advantage of the Labor candidate and now state member Steve Whan.
It would be fair to say that this had a major impact on the final outcome of the election result in Monaro. On election day, I was handing out how-to-vote cards in Eden for the former National Monaro MP Peter Webb. A former federal member for Eden-Monaro, Bob Whan, father of the Labor candidate, was also there. The Greens were nowhere to be seen, probably because they were not game enough to show their heads in that area considering the job losses they were involved in with Carr.
But the Greens still had how-to-vote cards, and this is how it worked: a lady who obviously did not want to vote Labor or National came along, and Bob Whan sidled up to her and said, `Are you looking for a Greens how-to-vote card?' She obviously said yes, and out of Bob Whan's back pocket came the Greens how-to-vote card. He said, `Here you are; here is a Greens how-to-vote card.' I said to him, `Great symbolism, Bob: got the Greens in your back pocket.' That is what happened. What we want to know is what promises were made by the ALP, because they did the deal but they did not make the public announcements. The people of Monaro deserve to know how Labor plan to deliver those promises without destroying more jobs in the region.
The recent federal budget saw an extension of the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package. This means that around $31 million of FISAP funding will now be available in the next two years to promote investment and employment in the native forest industry. The focus for FISAP now will be on processing and marketing initiatives to ensure our industry is not only sustainable but also internationally competitive and focused on value adding. Despite the pressures on this year's budget, the Howard government has recognised the importance of the native timber industry to the viability of many rural and regional communities as well as to the national economy. Extending FISAP for a further two years represents a clear demonstration of this commitment and will benefit rural and regional communities like many in Eden-Monaro.
At the same time, Bob Carr seems determined to lock up more forest area to keep the Greens onside. With one hand, we give timber companies assistance with FISAP funding to stay in business after the industry shake-up in recent years, then Carr forces them out of business for a bunch of preferences. This demonstrates how the New South Wales Premier is prepared to put votes well ahead of people. For these reasons, I strongly endorse the motion moved by the member for Cowper. I notice that the ALP opposite cannot find a member of parliament from New South Wales who is prepared to speak on this motion. They put up somebody from Capricornia and now somebody from Victoria who have no idea about the RFA process at all.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,"<title>Environment: Parks, Conservation Areas and Reserves</title>",Private Members' Business,12,1,speech
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I rise to talk about the motion moved by the member for Cowper relating to the regional forest agreement process. Unbeknownst clearly to the member for Eden-Monaro, I do know something about this issue. He would have to concede that this is a national issue—that is, it is a federal matter dealing with all the state governments and the Commonwealth. This issue is important to this country because we need to find a way to get the right balance for an ecologically sustainable future but, at the same time, we need to ensure that employment in regional areas is protected wherever possible. The difference between those on this side and those on the other—
—I hear the member for Eden-Monaro making some comments across the chamber. We do not know what how-to-vote card he was handing out on New South Wales election day but, as there was no Liberal candidate running, I presume it was for another political party. The fact is that the Labor Party and Labor governments deal with these issues by looking at the balance between ecologically sustainable outcomes and employment. We have concerns for workers in this industry and, at the same time, we have concerns to ensure that the forests are protected and there for our children and their children.
Therefore, the RFA has an impact on my electorate as well. Indeed, a large proportion of the Wombat Forest is in the electorate of Burke, and I therefore have concerns about the way in which the RFA was debated, obviously in a term prior to my election to office. It has an impact on the way in which my communities are going to cope with the changes. I have spent quite a significant amount of time discussing these issues with the major employer in Wombat Forest—Black Forest Timbers—their work force and the environmentalists in the region. Clearly there are some concerns about whether their future is a bright one. So that there is no mistake from those opposite, can I say that I do have concerns about jobs in the region, and I meet them directly. When I turn up to a workplace, I do not just go into the boss's office; I talk to the workers. That is what we do on this side of the House—we speak to the workers directly. I have concerns about where we can find work for those workers if they are to lose their jobs and how they can acquire the skills to ensure that they maintain employment. It is a big issue for us on this side of the House.
I will not take the word or the assertion of the mover of the motion that the Carr government has been in any way in breach of the regional forest agreement, but I can say this: everyone would agree that we need to ensure that there is some certainty for everybody in this area. There needs to be certainty to ensure that the communities are happy and that there is proper environmental protection. There needs to be certainty so that there can be some decent investment, which will ensure that there is regional employment and that that employment is sustainable. That can only be endured if the plan put down by state and federal governments is ecologically sustainable. That is the underpinning of this area of policy. Therefore, the attempt to have a few shots at the Carr government has missed the point. Clearly, the mover and the speakers from the government on this issue should have focused their energies on looking at ways that we can get that balance right. 
Just for the record, and by way of contrasting the comments made by the member for Eden-Monaro, interestingly, even though this Bracks government made decisions to ultimately close the Wombat Forest and, indeed, made a decision to close the Otway State Forest, the Greens in the area split their tickets in preference to the Liberals. That is, they put them on the preferred area of their how-to-vote cards. I do not know what arrangement was undertaken there between the Liberal Party and the Greens, but I agree that, on occasions, there should be greater scrutiny of the way in which the Australian Greens preference. Clearly it is not always policy pure. Quite often there is scrutiny of the major parties and the way in which they preference. I listened with interest to the comments made by the member for Eden-Monaro. I draw the attention of the House to the fact—and certainly I was most disappointed—that the Greens could not clearly see that in relation to our area we were the preferred party and the preferred government of Victoria.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—I rise today to support my colleagues from New South Wales in this debate concerning the future of the timber industry. This is an industry with a long history in the electorate of Paterson. Gloucester, Bulahdelah, Dungog, Stroud and Booral are all towns in Paterson where timber has created many jobs. Gloucester is, in fact, celebrating its centenary year. For many of those 100 years, there has been some very good economic and employment times, thanks to the timber industry. Unfortunately we are here today to debate the announcement by the New South Wales government to make 65,000 hectares of land into 15 new national parks, state conservation areas and state forest reserves. It is an announcement that has sent shivers into the timber industry and created further insecurity for the sector. In making deals with the Greens, the New South Wales government have foolishly failed to listen to the people in the industry and have once again shown their contempt for forestry jobs. In recent years, timber mills have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in their own businesses to ramp up the technology they need to remain competitive and viable. The decision to lock up another 65,000 hectares of land will mean that mills will have further resources stripped away from them. The certainty of supply has gone and now, more than ever, jobs are on the line.
This industry has been waiting for over four years for security and now it faces this new tidal wave of resource insecurity. Millers are saying that these reforms will mean supply cuts of up to 50 per cent. Booral have already suffered a reduction in supply from 184,000 cubic metres to 165,000 cubic metres. But what about the smaller mills and companies like Newell's Creek Sawmill, Relf's Sawmill in Bulahdelah, Gorton's at Coolongolook or, indeed, the Nicholas sawmill in Booral? Where are they going to get their timber and how are they going to survive with supplies diminishing?
And what will be the cost to our local communities? It could mean compensation payments to the industry of up to $238 million, and again it will be the taxpayers who will be paying very heavily for deals between the New South Wales Labor Party and the Greens. It again highlights poor policy in a desperate grab for preferences. The timber industry's dislike for this policy was clearly shown at the recent New South Wales election, where the seats of Clarence, South Nowra and Bega all showed that support for Labor had dropped significantly. These are areas that rely heavily on the timber industry, and voters clearly showed at the ballot box that they do not want the reforms.
At issue is the sustainable management of forest areas, thrown out the window by the New South Wales government and replaced by political decisions aimed at attracting city voters. It is a scandalous situation, when you consider that the New South Wales government brag about their green policies in the creation of millions of hectares of national park since coming to office. It is scandalous to have seen some of the worst bushfires in history exacerbated by the state government's mismanagement of national parkland. The Hunter region has seen significant destruction of property through fires in Port Stephens, Gloucester and the Great Lakes regions. Here in Canberra no-one will forget the fires that ravaged this community. The New South Wales government have demonstrated that they cannot properly manage the land they have locked up in national parks as it is, let alone an additional 65,000 hectares of land.
They would have you believe the land they are locking up is pristine old-growth forests. Yet the fact is that it is mostly managed regrowth timber areas. The industry is concerned that the decision by the New South Wales government to add another 65,000 hectares of national park is actually a breach of the regional forest agreement. This regional forest agreement went through this parliament in 2002, after 50 hours of debate, two Senate committee inquiries and three previous attempts to pass RFA bills through the parliament over four years. Since that agreement went through, the Commonwealth has invested a significant amount of money through the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package to support and encourage the forestry industry. In 2002-03, that investment in FISAP is around $47.4 million. The question is: is that investment going to waste, when the Carr government continue down the path of their reforms and effectively shut down the forestry industry?
Since November 2001, the Commonwealth has invested over $812,000 in the timber industry in Paterson alone and this has significantly helped the local industry by securing jobs. Local timber mills in my electorate of Paterson are concerned about their future and their security. I support this motion before us today because I care about our timber industry. It is an industry that has been searching for security for far too long and I fear that political decisions being made by the New South Wales government will do nothing but cause the loss of further industry jobs.
Finally, I note that there has not been a single speaker in this debate on the timber industry from the Labor Party in New South Wales, and the member for Hunter has been noticeable by his absence in this debate. Clearly he does not stand up for jobs in New South Wales—and, importantly, nor for the jobs of those in the CFMEU in his electorate.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,"<title>Environment: Parks, Conservation Areas and Reserves</title>",Private Members' Business,12,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I support the decision of the Carr Labor government to declare 65,000 hectares of land as 15 new national parks, state conservation areas and state forest reserves. The Carr Labor government has got the balance between jobs and the environment right. Sustainable development means that in the long run you protect the environment but you also ensure that jobs are created, including value adding jobs. I would prefer to have the sorts of decisions made by the New South Wales environment minister, Bob Debus, and my friend the secretary of the CFMEU forestry division, Craig Smith, who have worked together in partnership to ensure the best result for the environment and the best result for jobs. 
This decision has got the support of people from New South Wales—such as, since the election on 22 March, the new state Labor member for Monaro, Steve Whan, who will continue the work that Labor state members have done—which is why Labor has got such massive endorsement right across New South Wales. We have seen National Party and Liberal Party members rejected in regional New South Wales and again we saw the loss of Tamworth to another Independent, joining Independents in Northern Tablelands and Dubbo.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is therefore adjourned and will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—My purpose this afternoon is to address the House on an issue which is of interest and concern to some elements of the Alice Springs community—that is, the establishment of an after-hours general practice, which is planned to be opened mid-year. The Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services has been working with the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, local GPs and the Central Australian Division of Primary Health Care to ensure that after-hours services are available. Substantial contributions are being made towards this exercise by both the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth governments. This new facility will be housed in the hospital premises, where the Northern Territory government will refurbish the former eye clinic hospital and let it rent-free to the new service.
The value of the Territory's contribution is approximately $140,000 over two years—being $75,000 for a one-off refurbishment, $20,000 in ongoing operational costs each year and $12,000 per annum in rental revenue forgone. The Commonwealth is contributing in excess of $260,000 over two years to establish the new after-hours service and to extend the existing Central Australian Aboriginal Congress service.
The interest that has been aroused in the community about this is not about the fact that the service is being established but about the fee structure which is being proposed. This clinic, it is hoped, will take the weight and the pressure off the public hospital's emergency department and provide a more appropriate service to many who do not need emergency service. The fee structure for the clinic is proposed to be $70 per visit and $50 for concession card holders. Some argue that this fee may result in a more appropriate service, but it is clear that there will be a large number of people who will not be able to afford this payment and who will continue to use the hospital's emergency department for after-hours general practice type consultations.
I was of the understanding that the purpose of the clinic was to divert people away from the public hospital who could otherwise be general practice patients. The difficulty we have here is that a large number of those people who ought to be going to general practices other than the emergency services at the hospital will not be attracted by the proposition of paying a $70 up-front fee or a $50 up-front fee if they are cardholders. I understand that if they are tourists the fee will be around $100. The issue which raises its head here is that the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments have invested in an after-hours service that will, in a sense, not deliver any bulk-billing services after hours to the people of Alice Springs. This is clearly an indicator of the failure of the government's health policy, because at the moment there are no bulk-billing private practices in Central Australia. Central Australian Aboriginal Congress is a bulk-billing practice, but it is not a private practice in the same sense as the other three private practice clinics in Alice Springs.
From the clinic's point of view it is an understandable position. Why should they charge fees which are less than they would otherwise charge in their private clinics during a working day? Because if they charge $60 or $70 as an up-front fee when people attend the clinic during the day, to provide a service at a lesser cost at an after-hours corporate clinic, where there are a number of practices involved, would in fact mean that they would be diverting patients away from their own commercial enterprise. There may be some truth in this argument. Nevertheless, it raises a very serious question. What we are now being led to believe is that in this new practice there is no attempt by the Commonwealth or the Northern Territory governments to induce these doctors to put their fees down.
Recently there have been discussions about the Trade Practices Act and doctors setting fees in these types of practices. It is clear, as a result of advice, that GPs may agree on patient fees in light of a decision by the ACCC on 19 December to grant an authorisation to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. In very simple terms, it seems that the ACCC will allow GPs in partnerships with corporate members to agree on patient fees without risking a breach of the act. I might make this observation: they might agree on a $70 fee or they might agree on a $40 fee, but in the case of Alice Springs we are being told that the fee which will be set will be equivalent to the highest fee charged in Alice Springs. I would argue that in this type of practice we ought to be insisting that the fees be minimal. I appreciate the point which is made by those people in general practice in Alice Springs about this diverting away from their own practices, but we are talking about a considerable investment of government funds, of taxpayers' funds, for the provision of after-hours service. I think there is a fair expectation on behalf of the community that the fees which are set in this sort of service mirror the support which has been given by the federal government and the Northern Territory government.
It is very important that we do appreciate, however, that this particular service is important because there are very few after-hours services in Alice Springs. Because there is a paucity—in fact, nil—of bulk-billing medical practices in Central Australia, there is no competition for these practices which are charging up-front fees, and the Commonwealth government has brought no pressure upon these practices to bulk-bill. I understand the arguments which are made by some about the issue of bulk-billing. But there are many people in my constituency, many people in Central Australia, who are relatively poor—and for them to front up with $70 will be a big ask. I also appreciate that there are others who, in the normal course of events, are prepared to pay this sort of money and able to pay this sort of money. But the bottom line is—and I refer to the response by the Leader of the Opposition to the government's budget—that the issue here is really about the way the Medicare system has been eroded by the government over the years since it was elected, since 1996.
This after-hours service allows an uncapped income for doctors. They are guaranteed $50 an hour, whether or not they see a patient, for simply being there, for four hours. Then they will receive 60 per cent of all the takings from the patients. So if the clinic sees two patients per hour for four hours—that is, eight patients at $70 an hour per patient—the doctors' income will be $140 per hour or $560 for four hours. If the clinic sees three patients per hour then the doctors will earn $185 an hour or $740 per four-hour session. I understand the argument about the market and I understand the argument which has been put to us by the members of the private practices in Alice Springs about the need for them to have parity in their charging. But I make this observation: this is an exercise where the taxpayers are investing considerable resources to provide an after-hours service to the general population of Alice Springs. What we may well see here is a lessening demand on the emergency services at the Alice Springs Hospital, but the people who will no longer go to the Alice Springs Hospital are the very same people who will go to those general practices in the course of their everyday consultations.
I ask the doctors involved in this exercise: why won't they accept the capping of fees? Will they allow differential fees being charged by different doctors in this practice? For example, if a doctor normally charges $40 up-front, should they be able to, if they are required and asked to, charge $40 up-front—or should they accept the fee which they would now receive by charging $70 up-front? This practice is one which is welcomed by the Alice Springs community. I will be very interested in monitoring its performance over the next few months, just to see what impact it does have on the calls on the emergency services of the Alice Springs Hospital. But I make this point and this observation: this reflects very poorly on the federal government's health policy. There is a need for us to understand that there is a responsibility on the medical profession to understand that the money which is put in by taxpayers deserves a return—and the return ought to be a public service which does not demand the highest possible fee that doctors are able to charge in the market in Central Australia.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Alice Springs After-Hours General Practice</title>,Grievance Debate,13,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. The budget we are about to begin debating here in the parliament, the public has, in an economic sense, stopped debating. The budget was an economic non-event but it may well mark something of a watershed in Australian politics. The government would have you believe this was a steady as she goes budget, the big features being the tax cut and a few other measures to do with security, health and education. However, this budget is about much more than that. Both the government and the opposition have had much to say, in the budget speech and in the reply delivered by the Leader of the Opposition, about Medicare and about tertiary education. While the subject matter was the same—Medicare and tertiary education—the approaches were significantly different. That is why this budget has the potential to be a watershed: it demonstrates more starkly than any other budget for many years the political choices facing Australia.
The government's budget and the opposition's reply demonstrated that there are clear and important differences between the parties—differences both in our immediate policy prescriptions and in our underlying values. This budget demonstrates clearly the choices and priorities of each side of politics. It presents clear choices and priorities for Australian voters, and for that reason it has sharpened the edge of political debate between the parties and in the community in Australia. In some ways that is a very healthy development, although the manner in which it was brought about by the government has been a cause of some concern.
One particular aspect of this budget that I want to focus on today is that this is a budget that betrays the battlers. The Prime Minister's most famous boast used to be that he would look after the Aussie battlers. It was a mantra that he thought showed his common touch and his concern for ordinary Australians. He does not make this boast anymore; we have not heard it for a long time. There is no wonder about that. The Prime Minister's betrayal of the battlers in this budget reflects his core beliefs about the role of government. The budget brings into the open an ideological agenda that has always been a core political belief of the Prime Minister but which, until recently, he has kept in the shadows.
This budget reveals that this government is pursuing an ideological agenda of shifting costs and responsibilities from government to individuals. One of the lessons that I think needs to be learnt from the assessment of and commentary on this budget is that people use the word `reform' very loosely these days. It is as if it is a synonym for change. Not all change equals reform. The changes to Medicare and to higher education—and they are significant changes—are not reform. Reform carries with it the implication of improvement and progress. These are definitely changes, but they are a long way from being reforms.
The consequence of the agenda that the government has outlined is deeply disturbing. It undermines a crucial value that has traditionally been very strong in Australian society: the value of fairness. This budget confirms that under this Prime Minister most Australian families are getting less and less help from the government for services once considered an essential part of the government's role. The biggest losers, across the broad range of policy issues, are working families earning more than $30,000 a year. These Australians are the backbone of the economy—the nation is built on the backbone of their hard work. They aspire to a better life for themselves and particularly for their children. It is a cruel hoax for the government to pretend to be interested in them when it betrays their interest at every turn. Their losses are driven by an insidious pattern to the Howard government's policy changes. In many key areas of this budget, most importantly in health and education, the government is withdrawing support and transferring the burden to families.
The bills we are dealing with tonight translate the main spending decisions announced in the budget into law. They do this by appropriating money from the consolidated revenue fund for the business of government. The opposition, of course, will not oppose the bill—we have never opposed appropriation bills. It is strangely ironic to hear the Prime Minister talking about Senate obstructionism. He is the one person in this parliament who was associated with and supported the proposition, while a member of parliament, that the then opposition should use its numbers in the Senate to block supply. That in the same career he could say with equanimity, `I support the right of the Senate to block supply but I am opposed to it defeating any of the legislation I put forward,' is the high point of something for which there is a well-known Australian phrase—which is unparliamentary—that means you say one thing but you do another. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a well-known word for it but I do not think you would allow me to use it—but every Australian knows what it is. We will not be exercising that double standard. We will not be opposing the bill. However, in the light of the criticisms I have mentioned, we will be moving a second reading amendment. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for:
(1)	Its obsession with shifting the cost of health and education from the budget to Australian families;
(2)	Imposing higher costs of doctors visits on families without concession cards and a 30 per cent hike in essential medicine prices;
(3)	Allowing HECS fees to rise by 30%, introducing a loan scheme with a 6% interest rate and doubling the number of places reserved for full fee paying students;
(4)	Its cynical attempt to distract the public from these higher costs by offering miserly tax cuts of $4 a week for the average family;
(5)	Its failure to address the complexity of superannuation and its determination to offer super cuts only to the wealthiest families;
(6)	Its willingness to deliver tax cuts to corporate Australia while imposing a record tax burden on Australian families;
(7)	Its failure to protect the superannuation savings of Australian families by protecting them from corporate greed;
(8)	Its decision to hire yet more tax officials rather than take steps to ease the BAS compliance burden on small business; and
(9)	Its failure to provide leadership on environmental issues and in particular its failure to address water reform”.
In moving that second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition, I want to focus for a while on this issue of the budget betraying the battlers. In speaking to the National Press Club on this matter last week, I outlined several important ways in which the budget betrayed the battlers. I will refer to them briefly on this occasion. Most damaging of all are the changes to Medicare. The budget demonstrates that the government's goal is not reform of Medicare but Medicare's destruction. The government's Medicare changes will make most Australians pay three times for their health care: by paying a Medicare levy, by purchasing private health insurance and then by paying every time they see a doctor. By contrast, the measures announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply speech aim to staunch the wound created by the government's changes. More importantly, they are the first step towards Labor's long-term objective of saving Medicare—starting with the goal of lifting the average national rate of bulk-billing back to 80 per cent, the level at which it stood when the Howard government came to office.
The changes to higher education in the budget will further shift the burden of paying for education from the government to Australian families. As a result of the massive increase in HECS fees already made prior to this budget under the Howard government, Australian families are paying $900 million more this year towards higher education than they were in 1996. Yet the government's main idea for increasing funding to Australian universities is to make students and their families pay even more.
The tax cuts offered in this budget will disappear in the blink of an eye. The significance of the tax cuts is only that they provide clear evidence that John Howard and Peter Costello felt the need to respond to the widely accepted fact that they run the highest-taxing government in history.
The budget papers also reveal that the Prime Minister's much-touted baby bonus is a flop. The baby bonus was the centrepiece of the government's family policy in the 2001 election. When it was introduced last year, the baby bonus was expected to provide $335 million in assistance to families in its first two years, but the budget papers show the estimated benefit from the baby bonus in its first two years has slumped to $230 million—that is, 31 per cent less than expected and $105 million less in support for families than was promised. It appears the fall has occurred because substantially fewer women than the government originally estimated have taken up the baby bonus. This is not surprising. The baby bonus, after all, provides the biggest benefit to those who need it least and fails to provide financial support when it is most needed, and the average baby bonus payment is only $680 per year—or less than $2 per day—which is less than one-third of the amount paid to the most well-off. The poor take-up of the baby bonus is yet another sign of the government's mistaken priorities. The so-called Howard battlers on low to middle incomes have been hit from all directions by the budget, and they certainly will get very little benefit from the baby bonus.
All those reasons are reasons we put on the public record on budget night and last week. Today I want to outline a couple more areas where the budget betrays the battlers. Firstly, I will go to the issue of golden handshakes. The revelations last week about the payout to former BHP Billiton chief executive Brian Gilberston, which could total as much as $50 million, highlight the government's failure to take steps to impose constraints on excessive executive payouts. The opposition leader in his budget reply speech outlined our proposal to end tax deductibility for businesses for the portion of a redundancy payment that exceeds $1 million. The government has been performing the most amazing contortions in seeking to justify its inaction on this issue. We had, for example, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, at the weekend in a television interview saying that it was moving into `dangerous territory' to use the tax system to dissuade companies from making excessive payments to executives.
Unfortunately, apparently nobody has told the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer that her government, the government of which she is a member—and the tax system for which she has responsibility to this parliament—has for seven years retained a law introduced by the previous Labor government which denies tax deductions to companies making excessive contributions to superannuation. That is good policy and it is appropriate that the government should continue it, but how can the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer say that denying tax deductibility to excessive golden handshakes is a dangerous precedent which should not be pursued but continue to deny it for excessive superannuation payments? If it is all right to limit tax deductions for excessive contributions to superannuation, what is wrong with limiting tax deductions for other golden handshake retirement payments?
Bizarrely, in that same interview, Senator Coonan applauded the action of shareholders in British company GlaxoSmithKline, who voted to reject an executive pay deal. I agree with her that that was a good decision. But she seems to be unaware that her government, through the portfolio of which she is an office holder, has rejected amendments moved by the Labor Party here in Australia that would have allowed Australian shareholders the same opportunity as the shareholders of GlaxoSmithKline. She thought it was a terrific idea for shareholders in the UK, but she voted against it in Australia. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: the budget betrays the battlers on golden handshakes too.
Let me turn to the very important issue of jobs, because another way the budget betrays the battlers is, when properly analysed, through its gloomy prognosis of the outlook for employment. There is a disturbing warning within the budget figures of the risk that unemployment will rise above current levels of around six per cent. The level of jobs growth usually follows changes in the growth of the economy, which is what you would expect. But statistics indicate that it usually occurs with a lag of around a year—about 12 months after growth slows, you see the consequential slowing in employment. The budget forecasts that non-farm GDP will grow 2.75 per cent in 2003-04, with no fall in unemployment. The budget unemployment forecasts do not go out beyond 2003-04. However, an analysis of the statistics suggests that there is a serious risk that the economy will follow the usual pattern of employment slowing in the year after a slowdown in economic growth. If this occurs, unemployment is likely to rise above six per cent in financial year 2004-05.
There are warnings not in the budget but in commentaries about and subsequent to the budget that the outlook could be worse still than the budget predicts. The budget forecasts are based on the assumption that the Australian dollar will remain at a value of US60c on average over the year. But a Macquarie Bank research report last week argued that the recent rise in the Australian dollar is becoming an increasingly important risk to growth. Macquarie Bank warns that a sustained 10 per cent rise in the dollar could directly cut economic growth by around half a percentage point. This is because the stronger dollar lowers the return received by exporters and increases prices of imports. If that happens, employment growth is likely to be weaker still than that already implied in the budget forecasts.
Yet the government seems to have no appreciation of this serious risk. If non-farm GDP were to fall by half a per cent to 2.25 per cent, that would not be sufficient growth to sustain unemployment at its current level; 2.25 per cent non-farm GDP would not be sufficient to prevent unemployment from going up. Yet the government seems to have no appreciation of this serious risk. The Treasurer recently on a TV interview dismissed the prospects of employment falling below about six per cent. He seems to have given up on that goal. He seems equally unconcerned about the prospects of it rising higher. That is why on jobs, as in so many other areas, this is a budget that betrays the battler.
Let me speak briefly about Labor's approach to budget policy. Of course we recognise the crucial importance of sound macroeconomic policy—this is the first of what I call the four foundations of sound economic management. Achieving low inflation and low interest rates will be a critical goal for a Labor government. As part of this, we will maintain our commitment to the golden rule of balancing the budget over the economic cycle. As an opposition we have been rigorous in demonstrating, in the lead-up to every election, that we will meet that golden rule. We have done this by providing full costings for all our promises. I have challenged the Treasurer from time to time to come up with any of the savings which we outlined in the Leader of the Opposition's speech on the last sitting Thursday that he believes will not be able to be delivered in full and on time. He has not responded because he knows that all the numbers are the government's numbers, straight out of the budget papers.
Over the four years to 2006-07—that is, the forward estimates period—through redirecting specified parts of the government's Medicare package, opposing the reduction in the superannuation surcharge, not proceeding with the government's changes to public sector superannuation and not proceeding at this stage with the proposed changes to business tax, the opposition have identified $2,884 million of savings—almost $3 billion of savings. And we will achieve further savings by reallocating the unfair and failed baby bonus, which the government has said will ultimately cost more than $500 million a year. This money will go to families, but in a fairer and more efficient way. I have already challenged the Treasurer to find in these figures any saving that is not achievable in full on the timetables we have specified. But of course there has been no reply because, as I said, he well knows that all the figures come from his own budget papers.
That list of savings is not only important in itself; it also demonstrates the opposition's preparedness to make tough savings decisions. More than $3 billion of savings is only the beginning of our effort in identifying our better priorities; there is a lot more to come. Let no-one be in any doubt about our determination to run a sound and sensible budgetary policy and our willingness to make the tough decisions—sometimes the unpopular decisions—to achieve those outcomes. Let no-one be in any doubt either of our determination to do so in a way that redirects the budget priorities to those abandoned in this budget: working families—the battlers that John Howard has abandoned, the battlers that this budget has betrayed.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for your call tonight during the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. The government has abandoned the battlers of Australia? I wonder if the honourable member understands some fundamentals in the budget process that underpin support for the battlers of Australia. I guess the best thing that a government can do is to run a sound, well-managed economy that keeps interest rates at record low levels and inflation way down—that is the best thing that you can do for the people of Australia, and that is what the government have been doing. The government have been doing it because from 1996, when we were first elected, we took the really difficult decisions. The honourable member talks about the opposition taking difficult decisions. Goodness me, I remember those days in 1996, when it was extraordinarily difficult to bring the budget back into line. Thank goodness that the Howard government did it.
Thank goodness, with the experience of the very many unexpected things that have happened over the seven-year period, that we are able to bring back a soundly managed economy that runs budget surpluses. It is to the credit of Treasurer Peter Costello that he, along with the ministry, took those tough decisions and made sure that we were able to run a very soundly based economy. I think this is a period in Australia's history that will be looked back upon by the scholars of history as an indication of how a government, in fact, can run a soundly based economy. 
The fundamentals underpinning the budget are protecting, securing and building Australia's future by taking responsible decisions to protect the Australian economy. A lot of talk goes on about, `You could do this,' or, `You could do that,' but fundamentally the budget that was delivered on 13 May did just that, and thank goodness it did. There are a lot of nuances, and the previous speaker, the member for Fraser, was right about what might happen with the Australian dollar, where it might go and what the risks are. There are many other risks as well. But goodness me, this country has had to deal with so many unexpected pressures in this changing world—most of them coming from external influences, such as a weak world economy or in the context of terrorist threats, of homeland security and so on. We have been able to deal with that because we had a strong budget and we are running a strong economy. We want to keep Australia's economy strong. We have a commitment to stronger national security—that is, creating the conditions to allow for a more confident economy and a more secure future for Australian families.
I think Australian families understand that, yes, there are some difficult choices. But the Howard government is a government that has been prepared to stand up for difficult choices, and it now has a long track record where it has made some difficult decisions to ensure that we are able to keep the economy strong. Of course, we have been able to do that at the same time that the international economy has certainly had some grave difficulties. We have been able to do that by building on defence and national security—which is very important in my electorate. We have been able to cut personal income tax. We have been able to preserve Medicare. We have been able to increase access to Medicare. We have been able to pour a whole lot more money into education.
In summary, I think I am a member of a government that is the only government in the world that has delivered a budget this year that has been able to provide for massive unexpected spending on a military operation, massive spending on new security arrangements to keep Australia safe, massive increases in health expenditure, particularly through Medicare and through the Australian hospitals agreement, and massive increases in education, while at the same time delivering tax cuts to all Australians and a surplus as well. That is the trifecta in one. I was very proud on budget night to see all of that delivered.
Turning to my own electorate and being a bit parochial about this—and I think it is important to be a bit parochial about this—I represent Australia's largest tropical city, which is the Townsville-Thuringowa region, a city that is booming at twice the state growth average. Some say it is the work of the local member—I like to hear that. Certainly we do a lot of work to make sure that the city powers along. Townsville has done very well out of the federal budget this year. I am very proud that one of the centrepieces of the budget was the delivery of a super centre of research for Townsville. This is the newest super centre of research in Australia, and it is being delivered in North Queensland.
We have been able to arrange a formal affiliation between the Australian Institute of Marine Science and James Cook University. This formal affiliation will be called AIMS at JCU—the Australian Institute of Marine Science at James Cook University. AIMS at JCU will be a science powerhouse because of the opportunities. In fact, the director of AIMS, CEO Professor Stephen Hall, calls it the `Harvard business school of tropical marine science education and training'. We cannot do any better than that. We are building on the centre of gravity of tropical marine science that exists in Townsville, through AIMS, through JCU, through the reef CRC and through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which is headquartered in Townsville. It is a huge resource of marine science; we lead the world. This new super centre of research, this new cluster, will attract the highest quality postgraduate students from around the world. It is a marvellous result for our region.
There were big increases in Defence spending in Townsville. Not only do we have the most significant tropical marine science centre in the world; we also have Australia's largest Army base—Lavarack Barracks. We also have a very significant RAAF base, RAAF Townsville. Huge amounts of money were provided in the budget for Defence for new capital works. The redevelopment at Lavarack Barracks and RAAF Townsville has pumped $103½ million into the Townsville economy this year. Some marvellous work has been done by the contractors, Leightons and Theiss, at the two respective projects. On top of that, there are a number of ancillary projects. We expect to have another 100 accommodation units built on base over and above the 1,004 units that have been built in the last year. They will cost $12 million extra and that will circulate through the economy. More work will be done on the combat training centre. On top of that, Operation Safe Base, an Australia-wide operation, will impact positively on Townsville. More people will provide the enhanced guarding, patrolling and protective searches to make sure our bases are safe.
Lavarack Barracks is home to Australia's ready deployment force. The battalions in Townsville respond within 24 hours anywhere in the country. We are on the shortest notice to move—and well we might be, because virtually all of Australia's overseas operations in the last 10 or 15 years have been mounted out of Townsville. There is also a landmark figure of almost half a million dollars to implement the defence injury protection program, which was a very successful pilot program in 2001-02 that resulted in a reduction in injuries of over 70 per cent. It is good to see that that project will become a full-time project in Townsville.
That was not all the good news: there is more! James Cook University has had its biggest boost in years from this budget. Do not let me hear anybody say that the Howard government does not support higher education. The boost that James Cook University got in this budget delighted the senior academic management of the university. They could not believe that the government delivered so much. A number of regional programs in the budget were of great benefit to JCU. The AIMS affiliation will also benefit JCU, which will become the most significant regional university in the country. It will become a regional sandstone. I was very disappointed that the opposition called James Cook University a second-class university. It made me very angry. Senator Carr was responsible for making the claim, and he made it publicly. James Cook University is also very angry. The university is under-taking world-leading research in its immun-ogenetics program, through the medical school, as well as in marine science and earth science. The Labor Party consider JCU to be a second-rate university. I hope they continue to say that loud and long because I know that the 8,000 students in Townsville will not be very happy about that and neither will the academic staff.
We have been able to reduce the regional loading for the university in the budget. JCU is in the top five for extra funding out of the 32 regional universities. It delights me that we were able to achieve that. This budget will also give us an increase in base funding in the year 2005, which will be another $9 million for JCU. An additional 210 nursing places will be provided at regional universities. JCU has a very significant nursing program, so it will benefit from that initiative. It will also benefit from the new Commonwealth learning scholarships, particularly for students who have to come from rural areas of North Queensland. JCU students themselves will benefit from the approximately $3.7 billion in financial assistance to students through new student loans. To cap it all off, the Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarships are there for regional students as well. It is just a delight to see that that has happened.
When the state government brings its budget down on 3 June, I hope that it can match the increases that the federal government have provided in areas such as health and education. Parliamentary Secretary Worth might be interested to know the Queensland figures. Since the Howard government came to power, funding for state schools has increased by a massive 69.2 per cent. If anyone ever tries to say that we do not look after the state school system, they can be shown to be completely wrong. This year I would like to see the state government match the federal government's contribution to state schools. Let us see whether they deliver that in their budget.
It is the same with the funding for hospitals. The parliamentary secretary will be aware that the government have offered additional funding of up to $42 billion under the Australian health agreement over the next five years for funding of public hospitals. It is a 17 per cent increase in real terms. We want to see that matched by the state governments. It is a very interesting situation indeed in Queensland. There have been terrible problems week after week at the Townsville Hospital. It is a world-class hospital, but there are new problems every week. The extra money that has been offered by the Commonwealth should be pumped into hospitals like Townsville Hospital, but Premier Beattie has said, `We don't accept the Commonwealth's offer.' Queensland stands to lose $851 million because the Beattie government will not match the Commonwealth's increase in spending. Secondly, it will not be transparent about where it spends its money and will not show us that it is actually spending the increases on hospitals.
State governments have become pretty cute about these things over the last few years, so the Commonwealth government has decided to insist that its increased funding for hospitals is actually spent on hospitals. But the Beattie government is refusing to sign up to that. I wonder what that means. I wonder what has been happening over the last several years. I wonder if funding destined for hospitals never got there and it went somewhere else. The Commonwealth government is going to stand its ground and, if the Beattie government does not sign up to a great deal—an extra 17 per cent in real terms over the next five years—Queensland is going to miss out on $851 million of funding. I will be looking at that very carefully.
In the few minutes that I have left, I would like to comment on ALP Medicare policy. I could not believe what Simon Crean announced in his budget reply. He said to the whole of Australia that people who live in regional areas—like Townsville—are second-class citizens. ALP policy is that people who live in regional areas are second-class citizens. Do you know why? What he has done is announce a Medicare policy which says that, if you are in a capital city, doctors will get an extra amount of money if they bulk-bill 80 per cent of their patients. But, if you live in a regional city, doctors will get an extra amount of money if they bulk-bill only 75 per cent of their patients. If they live in a rural area, doctors only have to bulk-bill 60 per cent. How can you run a policy where you expect more people to be bulk-billed in the capital cities than you do in a city like Townsville, the capital city of Northern Australia? What a discriminatory policy. We will not be treated as second-class citizens, and we will reject the Australian Labor Party whenever they treat people in regional Australia as second-class citizens. I invite them to continue to do it, because it means the Howard government will be in power for a long time.
There are two final matters. I saw the managing director of the ABC in Senate estimates today. Something I would like to see for Townsville is the replacement of ABC Radio National, which has a transmitter in Townsville, which I think two and a dog listen to. I would love to see its program feed change to ABC News Radio, a much more relevant program these days. It is the radio equivalent of Sky News television. People want up-to-date information. They want to be able to turn on, get what they need and turn off. I think that that particular transmitter would be much better used if it was used as a feed for ABC News Radio. I challenge the ABC to have a look at the listenership of Radio National in Townsville and, when they find what it is, to change to News Radio.
Finally, just a big hi to the men and women of HMAS Newcastle, which I sailed on in the not too distant past. They are a great crew. I will have some more words to say about that at a later time.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. The 2003 budget exposes the Treasurer's policy weakness. Australia is in its 13th year of almost continuous economic growth, disrupted only by the introduction of the GST, but the Treasurer is unable to provide for tax relief for bracket creep, unable to provide services—in particular, through Medicare—that Australians had previously enjoyed and unable to produce any major economic reforms, such as the major enhancements to Australia's international tax competitiveness that were promised by the discussion paper that his department issued for consultation last year. After 12 years of economic growth, the general level of taxation has risen and continues to grow, a rapidly escalating number of Australian families cannot find a bulk-billing doctor and the government's capacity to provide major economic reforms has all but stalled because of a lack of money.
Instead of economic reform, instead of some new initiatives that would restore Medicare and instead of tax cuts that would take the pressure off the budgets of working families, we have more of the Treasurer's tired claptrap about what the government can afford. The Howard government and, in particular, the Treasurer have made a central focus of the political rhetoric of running a sound fiscal policy. Unfortunately for the government and the country, the Treasurer's days of doing that are long gone. The reality is that the net impact of policy decisions taken by this government, measured in the calendar year in which they were made, over the current budget and three forward estimate years, now stands at $65.4 billion. How could the government have arrived at a situation where it has made policy decisions with a net impact of $65.4 billion but it cannot return to taxpayers the full value of bracket creep, low- and middle-income Australian families cannot find a doctor who will bulk-bill and the government cannot deliver reform of the tax system to make it internationally competitive?

—That lack of financial control results from one thing: short-term politics dominating decision making. After eight years, we can see the impact of that pattern of spending in the misplaced priorities of public expenditure. The government has focused on only two things in determining its fiscal policy: achieving a surplus on the underlying cash balance and reducing net government debt. It has achieved the latter largely by selling assets. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table that shows the contribution of asset sales to reducing net government debt.

—Since the Howard government came to office, and by the end of this financial year—that is, 2002-03—debt will have been reduced by $63.4 billion. However, $55.3 billion of that has been achieved using asset sales, both financial, like Telstra, and non-financial, like the Department of Foreign Affairs building. That debt reduction is much less impressive when you take into account the means of achieving it.
The government's targeting of the surplus has not resulted in containment of expenditure, because it has been prepared to increase taxes to maintain those surpluses. This government has increased taxes in three ways. Firstly, it has introduced the GST. Secondly, it has not handed back the full value of bracket creep and so the general level of personal income tax is being allowed to increase notwithstanding the tax mix switch, which was one of the primary objectives of the Howard government's GST. If anyone thinks that the GST resulted in substantial long-term income tax reform, they should have a careful read of David Stevens paper entitled `Australian Taxation in an International Context', which concluded:
The abolition of the Wholesale Sales Tax (WST), the low GST rate, and the numerous exemptions has resulted in there not being a significant switch from the taxation of income to the taxation of consumption under the New Tax System.
The third way in which the government has increased taxation has been through a series of special levies and taxes such as the milk levy and the Ansett ticket tax, which the government is still continuing long after its original purpose has been obviated.
Total tax as a proportion of GDP has grown as a result of the government's tax policies from 23.1 per cent of GDP in 1996, when the government took office, to 25.3 per cent of GDP in the 2002-03 financial year. The government now taxes 25.3 per cent of GDP to pay for Commonwealth own purpose outlays and payments to the states that used to take 23.1 per cent of GDP under the Labor government. If you deduct payments to the states from the 23.1 per cent to produce a comparable figure with the Treasurer's budget papers, it would be well below 20 per cent.

—Bizarrely, the Treasurer defies IMF and ABS conventions and insists on ignoring the GST, because he wants to suggest that the Commonwealth tax is now only 21 per cent of GDP. Perhaps this is because he wants to pretend that he has turned the clock back to where taxes were at the end of the Whitlam government when total tax was 21.3 per cent of GDP. Unlike now, that was a time when the federal government was really throwing money at the states, particularly my state, and Commonwealth taxes to do that and pay for Commonwealth owned purpose outlays, which had grown significantly, were then still only 21.3 per cent of GDP. There is something seriously wrong when the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia ignores the Auditor-General's advice as to how budget figures are presented. This may explain why the government is reluctant to have the final budget outcome audited, because if the government persisted in ignoring the GST revenues and expenditure of an equivalent amount of money to the states those accounts would have to be qualified. There is little point in this Treasurer lecturing the business community on corporate governance when he does not listen to his own Auditor-General on an essential matter of the presentation of the Commonwealth public accounts and where he is hiding more than $30 billion of tax and expenditure.
Much has been made of the inadequacy of the Treasurer's $4 tax cut. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, in her own eloquent way, spelt out the inadequacy of the tax cut when she said:
$5, hell, what will it buy you? A sandwich and milkshake, if you're lucky.
But the real issue is how does a $2.4 billion tax cut stack up against bracket creep? It does not stack up against bracket creep. If it did, the tax cuts would be $900 million larger. That would cut the surplus to $1.3 billion in 2003-04, still a significant surplus. But the real reason that the Treasurer cannot give back the full proceeds of bracket creep is that if he did, in the two subsequent years 2004-05 and 2005-06, he would be putting the budget into deficit by $550 million dollars and $1.5 billion respectively. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table relating Access Economics's estimates of fiscal drag to the tax cuts and another showing what would happen to the surplus if the government handed back all bracket creep.

Access Economics, Budget Monitor May 2003
—In summary, under this government, the net effect of policy decisions by this government on the budget bottom line is a deterioration of $65.4 billion. That new policy has been funded by increasing tax from 23.1 per cent of GDP to 25.3 per cent of GDP. The budget is being kept in surplus by the extra tax collected through bracket creep. An overwhelming majority of debt reduction, $55.3 billion out of $63.4 billion, has been achieved with asset sales.
It is appropriate in the light of this systemic policy failure to draw attention to one of the expense measures in the budget papers under the Department of Finance and Administration. There are two measures: enhanced budget advisory capacity and enhanced budget information system. The additional measure for budget advice will cost taxpayers $9 million this year, $11.8 million next year, $12.1 million the year after and $12.4 million in 2006-07—a total of $45.3 million over four years. The information system measure will cost $5.5 million this year, $6.5 million next year, $4.3 million the year after and $2.9 million in 2006-07—a total of $19.2 million over four years. The total cost of these measures is $64.5 million. The fact that these measures are in the budget papers is a major admission of policy failure by the Department of Finance and Administration. They are a manifestation of abject failure by a once powerful and professional Commonwealth department. The fact that the money has had to be provided is an admission that the Department of Finance and Administration has huge problems. Those problems are the result of a failed experiment in public administration by the previous Secretary of the Department of Finance, Dr Peter Boxall. Dr Boxall's tenure at Finance must now be judged a failure with the government having to introduce specific budget measures to put the department back together again after he effectively destroyed its advising capacity on budget policy.
Perhaps based on his experience at the IMF, where international officials impose severe corrective policy on bankrupt countries and do not have to stick around long enough to observe the consequences of their advice, Dr Boxall apparently decided to get rid of any officer in his new department who did not think exactly like he did. Within a couple of years, he had jettisoned a department's corporate memory that had taken decades to build. He was keen to devolve many core finance department functions back to organisations that did not have the skills or resources to manage them. The results have been disastrous.
He also had a very narrow view of the core role of the Commonwealth government. He turned Canberra from a public sector town to a private sector town as he downsized and outsourced almost without regard to the concept of value for money. But the thing that he did which will stand as his lasting monument is the sale and lease back of Commonwealth buildings, most dramatically the building housing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Motor Trades Association of Australia superannuation fund is the chief beneficiary of this piece of policy lunacy. The MTAA CEO, Michael Delaney, alone amongst bidders, recognised what a great deal Peter Boxall was offering the successful purchaser. Very long leases, higher rents and guaranteed rent escalation clauses on property that would never be vacant amounted to an almost riskless investment with a high rate of return. It pumped up the prices received for the assets and so allowed the government to pay off more debt, but it did so at an astronomical ongoing expense to the taxpayer.
—John Curtin House.
—Centenary House was a casebook study in how not to do it. That lease was instigated by the then Auditor-General, it was negotiated at arm's length and it proved somewhat expensive. There was a royal commission into it. The royal commission found that there was no impropriety in that arrangement, but it certainly trawled over all the problems that pertained to the Commonwealth taking out long leases with private property owners to pay for accommodation that would always be leased by the Commonwealth. The Howard government should have learnt from that experience. It certainly observed that one closely, and it should not have replicated it on a grand scale with all other Commonwealth buildings.
The sale of these Commonwealth buildings was done by Dr Boxall on the ideological pretext that the government was not in the business of owning buildings, apparently regardless of the concept of value for money. I was so horrified by it that I asked the Auditor-General to look at it, and his report has become a textbook case study in how a government should not do business.
At a recent seminar on the future of the bond market, Keith Chessell from Access Economics characterised the debacle as a sweetheart deal between the good fairy from the finance department and the property market. I have not met too many people who would liken Peter Boxall to the good fairy, but I would say that he was off with the fairies with some of his policy advice.
The important point is that the Howard government has explicitly recognised that it has a serious problem down by the rose garden, and it is having to spend serious money to fix it—more than $65 billion. The problems are there to see. The net effect of policy decisions by this government on the budget bottom line is $65.4 billion, yet Australian families cannot find a bulk-billing doctor. That new policy, as inappropriate as much of it was, has been funded by increasing tax from 23.1 per cent of GDP to 25.3 per cent of GDP. The budget, to the extent that it is being kept in surplus—and it was not last year—is being kept in surplus by the extra tax collected through bracket creep. An overwhelming majority of the debt reduction that the Treasurer boasts about—$55.3 billion out of $63.4 billion—has been achieved with asset sales.
The most important issue for public expenditure in this budget is Medicare. It is the most important thing that is at stake. This government has decided that it will spend $917 million on a series of policies which will see the end of bulk-billing. It is paying for that new policy with cuts of $918 million to public hospitals. The outcome is going to be disastrous.
The member for Perth has just entered the chamber. The member for Perth and I visited a bulk-billing practice on Doctors Road at Morphett Vale in my electorate. We sat down with five of the doctors, and the member for Perth, who is the shadow minister for health, went through Labor's policy, which is to spend more than double the amount that the government is planning to spend and in a better designed way. The doctors at this particular surgery, which is quite an efficient surgery—it has a practice nurse, two sites and seven doctors; I will not name it—had been waiting for the Howard government's policy before deciding whether they would continue to bulk-bill. If they bulk-bill, they will get $1 per service from the Howard government's policy. They said that they would not be able to afford to continue to bulk-bill.
Across the other side of Doctors Road is another surgery. This one is not a large practice—it has one site in the shopping centre—and the doctor and his wife, who is the practice manager, had stuck to bulk-billing until November last year. They had found three doctors who, in their retirement years, were prepared to work for them for the going rate, which was about $70 or $80 an hour. The only reason that this doctor and his wife were able to afford to maintain bulk-billing until last November was that they were paying themselves exactly half of what they were paying the people who worked for them. Reluctantly, they gave up bulk-billing last November and began to charge a copayment. They are charging pensioners $5. That is about what the Labor Party's policy would provide to a practice in that sort of area.
So if the Labor Party's policy were implemented, one of them would be able to keep bulk-billing and the other would be able to return to bulk-billing. With the Liberal government's policy, neither of those practices will be bulk-billing. They are both in an area where people are on very low incomes. As gaps rise, those people are going to miss out on health care. They will have to sit and wait in long queues at the local hospitals' accident and emergency departments. On many occasions, there are going to be people in those areas who will miss out on getting any medical services at all. That is the critical issue in this budget. After $65.4 billion of new policy, the Howard government is unable to deliver a situation where Australian families on low or middle incomes are able to find a bulk-billing doctor.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—Law and order has become a touchstone issue in contemporary Australia. The Commonwealth government recognises its responsibilities in this area and is continuing to act to protect Australians now and in the future. This budget alone will provide a record amount of Commonwealth money over four years for initiatives in the Attorney-General's justice and customs portfolio. The Australian Federal Police received a massive funding boost in last year's budget of $398 million over four years. The Australian Federal Police's capacity to investigate terrorism has been further strengthened by the doubling of its strike team capability, which has been allocated $14.6 million in 2003-04, and by a focus on enhancing cooperative arrangements with partner agencies. This budget also continues our commitment to the Australian Customs Service, which is receiving an additional $218.2 million over four years, representing a funding increase of more than 50 per cent since 1996. The Australian Crime Commission has been allocated an extra $30 million over four years to investigate money laundering and tax evasion resulting from organised criminal activity.
The Tough on Drugs initiatives will receive a further $12 million to support key new measures. An additional $4 million is being allocated in 2003-04 to continue the National Crime Prevention program. This initiative was launched in 1997 as part of the Commonwealth government's response to community concerns about crime and violence and the impact it has on people's lives. A key priority of the National Crime Prevention program is the prevention of juvenile offending. Australia's financial intelligence capabilities through the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, also known as AUSTRAC, will be boosted by $8.2 million in the 2003-04 budget to tackle money laundering. This represents a 51 per cent increase on existing funding. The full promise of the new proceeds of crime legislation can now be realised due to additional resources for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. The Australian high-tech crime centre will be formally opened in 2003 to improve national coordination in response to high-tech crime threats, including threats to the national information infrastructure.
The Howard government is demonstrating that we need innovative solutions to tackle the crime problem. Knee-jerk and populist-driven reactions, like mandatory sentencing and capital punishment, do not drive down crime rates. While we need creative solutions, we also need to get the fundamentals right. I grieve for those parents and many others who have witnessed the failure of, or have been failed by, the legal system. The legal system was designed and is managed by human beings. We are all flawed and sometimes the results of our work are flawed. For that reason, we rely on precedent—on the experiences of our predecessors—and we should endeavour to do this in as dispassionate a way as possible. What is required of government is an objective, unemotional assessment of what is good for the individual, for families and, as well, for society as a whole.
It is into this climate that I wish to wade today in examining the case for abolishing the legal principle of double jeopardy. Put simply, the basis of the principle of double jeopardy, which has been present in our legal system since the 12th century, is that an accused cannot be tried for the same crime twice. It has two objectives: to deliver certainty to an accused who is found innocent and to ensure that a prosecution is undertaken in such a way that the state does not use its power over the individual inappropriately. Instead, the onus should be on the state to make sure that it gets the job right the first time. Indeed, it is the very responsibility of the prosecution to come to court with its best case knowing that it will not get a second chance that protects the professionalism of our court system. The corollary to that is, faced with the prospect of being able to have a second chance, the shoddiness that may creep into the prosecution case may infect the whole court system.
The arguments in favour of retaining the principle of double jeopardy cross an interesting divide. There are those who would claim to be conservative who feel uncomfortable that a basic tenet of our legal system for 900 years is being called into question, and there are those who are liberal and who subscribe to the view that double jeopardy is a brake on the power and reach of the state in the titanic battle between the state and the individual. Regardless of which view one comes from, both would argue that abolishing the principle of double jeopardy is something we should not rush into. We need to pause and take stock of the arguments. The argument put forward by the Premier of New South Wales is that forensic technology is now such that we can, with certainty, gather the evidence necessary to reopen cases and try defendants where previously our research may have been inconclusive or non-existent. This is superficially appealing.
But there is another approach. While we should certainly be using the DNA research and forensic technology available to us in current cases to ensure that criminals are brought to justice successfully, it is not so clear whether this technology should be used to reopen cases hitherto closed. To do so would overturn 900 years of legal practice in a way that would suggest that the state can move the goalposts on the citizen. In other words, this new technology should be used for our future and current investigations. Maybe the double jeopardy rule should be altered from the present onwards, but to remove it retrospectively seems to me to be unfair. In a world where the state already has the dice loaded in its favour vis-a-vis the individual, to retrospectively change the law in this way would appear to be making the odds for the individual insurmountable. It should be resisted.
This evening I suggest that rather than abolish our system of rules regarding double jeopardy we consider the halfway house option of introducing a new third verdict alternative. Last month, Perth man John Button received $460,000 as an ex gratia compensation claim, a year after his 1963 manslaughter conviction was quashed. Mr Button served 5½ years of a 10-year prison term, after being found guilty of running down his then 17-year-old girlfriend, Rosemary Anderson. Mr Button's conviction stood for almost 40 years, despite the death row confession of serial killer Eric Cooke and an absence of any forensic evidence on Mr Button's car. Meanwhile in Queensland, accused killer Raymond John Carroll, twice found guilty over the murder of 17-month-old Deirdre Kennedy, walks free after three successful appeals on legal technicalities, including double jeopardy. How would abolishing double jeopardy affect these men, their families and the families of their victims?
In the case of Raymond John Carroll, allowing another trial to proceed would probably go a long way to seeing justice served and giving some peace of mind to the victim's family. In the case of John Button, it would probably lead to acute anxiety, sleepless nights and, if he were charged again, emotional and financial strain that would almost certainly destroy him and his family. Mr Button's 40-year nightmare would continue for the rest of his life. It also raises the question of how adequately an accused could defend themselves if required to engage legal representation for a second trial. How do we protect someone who has spent their entire savings on a legal defence, only to discover that they must stand trial again with no savings to appoint a lawyer for a second trial?
There is a strong argument that double jeopardy still has an important role to play in fettering state power. No-one should assume that the state has an unblemished record in conducting fair and proper criminal law prosecutions. There are famous instances where ham-fisted prosecutions have resulted in wrongful detention. Internationally, the Guildford Four case in the 1970s in the United Kingdom and, more recently, the Tulia drug case in the United States are two examples where convictions were overturned following questionable practices by the prosecution. Similarly, there is interesting new research which highlights DNA studies that prove high rates of wrongful convictions have been achieved for death row inmates, partly because of public pressure to convict someone—anyone—for heinous crimes.
Double jeopardy has been a cornerstone of most legal systems for centuries. There is a risk that by abolishing this doctrine altogether we may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It seems that we are at a classic impasse: we are damned if we do abolish double jeopardy and we are damned if we do not. But there is an alternative that provides the best of both worlds. Scotland's criminal legal system provides three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proven. A not guilty verdict invokes the protection of double jeopardy, allowing a clearly innocent person to go about their life completely vindicated. A not proven verdict allows, with some restraints on oppressive prosecution, the case to be reopened with new evidence. There is no statutory, case law or universally accepted definition of the not proven verdict, nor of the difference between not proven and not guilty. In the 1964 case of McNicol v. HMA, Lord Justice General Clyde gave the following opinion:
The three choices are in fact much more logical and in accordance with principle than merely to give a jury two. Juries are not all-seeing and all-knowing. They are merely human beings and they can never know with certainty that a man is guilty. The furthest they can go against him is to hold on the evidence led before them it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did commit the crime. The true alternative to that verdict is that the Crown has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and the truly logical alternative, therefore, is a verdict of not proven. But there are cases where a jury can go further in the accused's favour. The crucial Crown witness may be disbelieved or may be proved discreditable and the defence may be shown to be a true defence which they accept. In that case a jury may well be prepared to hold it positively established by the evidence that the accused did not commit the crime and the appropriate verdict would then be a verdict of not guilty.
The advantages of the third verdict alternative are threefold. Firstly, the benefits of double jeopardy are retained, giving security and certainty to all Australians who have been wrongly or maliciously accused and found not guilty. We all share a sense of outrage that Raymond John Carroll is a free man due to the double jeopardy rule, but I am not comfortable with a criminal law system that completely abandons the principle of double jeopardy. I think most Australians would likewise baulk at the thought that they or their loved ones could be repeatedly brought before the court over the same allegation. The second advantage of the third verdict alternative is that prosecutions which fail for a procedural or technical reason do not put the jury in the invidious position of effectively finding the accused innocent in circumstances where available evidence points to probable guilt. There have been countless examples where technical difficulties or the actions of one hold out member of the jury frustrate justice. The O.J. Simpson trial is one such instance where the not proven verdict might have ultimately delivered a more sensible outcome. Thirdly, it draws on an ancient legal tradition, thereby providing some level of precedent and legitimacy to the proposal.
There is a risk that the third verdict system is good in theory but bad in practice. More specifically, there is a view that in a difficult trial a jury will take the soft option and deliver a not proven verdict. The alternative view is that with proper judicial instruction the not proven verdict will not be overused or become a judicial cop-out. A criticism of the third verdict system is that a not proven verdict attaches a certain stigma to the accused in that they are effectively found to be not innocent—or, as it was articulated in a 1994 United Kingdom consultation paper, the connotation is, `We think you did it, but we're not absolutely sure.' The alternative view is that even those persons found not guilty do not always escape some degree of stigma. A case in point is Lindy Chamberlain who, despite being found not guilty, still suffers from having a stained character.
In the same consultation paper it is argued that:
The public makes up its own mind about a case on what it has heard of the evidence and its attitude to the accused is not wholly determined by the verdict. There are cases where a not proven verdict is welcomed by a sympathetic public, and equally those where a guilty verdict has been perceived as unjust. The question of stigma is more complicated than a simple attachment to the not proven verdict.
Another criticism of the Scottish system is the question of judicial direction to juries. On occasions judges have attempted to explain to juries the difference and significance between the two acquittal verdicts, but this has sometimes resulted in appeals on grounds of misdirection. In practice, the appeal court has instructed trial judges not to attempt to explain the difference to juries. I stress that the three-verdict system has been in place in Scotland since the 17th century; it is not a new creation.
A misconception of the not proven verdict is that it prevents anyone else being convicted of that crime. This is incorrect. If there is evidence that someone other than the person tried may have committed the crime then it can and should be investigated. The Scottish experience shows that the not proven verdict is used in one-third of acquittals by juries and in one-fifth of acquittals in non-jury trials. Other statistics collected by the Criminal Justice Statistics Unit of the Scottish Office of Home and Health show that some types of court make more use of the not proven verdict than others. Among their findings is that juries make proportionately more use of the not proven verdict, returning it in 42 per cent of High Court acquittals and 33 per cent of Sheriff Court acquittals—that is not in all decisions, just in acquittals—than do justices and sheriffs, who return it in about 21 per cent of acquittals in the summary cases that they hear alone.
Australian legislators could also introduce additional measures to constrain the scope and operation of the third verdict system, including a provision that limits the number of trials to two. Another option that has been publicly flagged is to allow the Attorney-General to set aside the double jeopardy protection on a case by case basis. On face value this option appears to have merit, but the politics of law and order means that we run the risk of this option being invoked only in cases where a frenzy has erupted in the media.
The double jeopardy rule should not be surrendered without appropriate consideration. It certainly should not be abandoned as a knee-jerk reaction in an election campaign, but there is something very wrong with a system that allows an innocent person to be retried ad nauseam or a system that allows the plainly guilty to walk away innocent because of a legal technicality. Adopting the third verdict alternative has the potential to overcome both conundrums.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—I rise this evening to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004, which seeks to appropriate some $40 billion to consolidated revenue for the ordinary annual service of government. In doing so, I point out that this appropriation is exceptionally important because it actually goes to the day-to-day operations of our nation. It is also a statement of the government's priorities over the next financial year and ensuing years. That is exceptionally important, because we should never forget that what we are talking about tonight is not government money but taxpayers' money.
The Australian government is entrusted with directing that money in the best interests of all Australians. In essence, through the budget process it makes a very public statement about its priorities. The responsibility of government is to ensure that these resources deliver the services and infrastructure that will improve the opportunities and wellbeing of all Australians and those we assist beyond our shores in more disadvantaged nations.
I contend this evening that the Howard government has failed this test and, in doing so, it has failed to establish, for our community and for future generations, priorities in tune with the needs and aspirations of Australia in the 21st century. It is very clearly not a nation-building budget; it is a nation-cringing budget. When we look back through Australia's history—and we are not an old country in terms of settlement, beyond Indigenous settlement—each generation of Australians has had a responsibility to future generations to live in a sustainable way. There is a requirement and an obligation as a nation to maintain and improve our infrastructure and services, and to protect and improve our health, education and environment.
I believe that this budget fails those basic community expectations in the determination of the government's priorities, as expressed in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 and the Treasurer's speech. That raises at the outset the important issue of health care and the very clear endeavour by the Howard government to destroy Medicare. The Howard government is using this budget as an excuse to destroy what many of us believe is the best health care system in the world: Medicare. Instead of building on the strengths of that great system, this budget is about demolishing it and moving us all towards a flawed, second-rate, Americanised health care system that does not care for all Australians.
The facts speak for themselves. Bulk-billing will effectively end for two out of three Australians. The majority of families will have to check their wallets to decide whether they can seek medical help, regardless of how ill their family members may be. If they cannot afford to take their kids to the doctor, the Howard government then wants to slug them with a 30 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines. Our public hospitals would be stretched to breaking point under this government's health regime by forcing people out of the doctor's surgery and into the emergency department of the nearest hospital, such as the hospitals that the constituents in my electorate depend on: the Northern Hospital or the Austin Repat Hospital.
The budget papers also confirm that the Howard government has taken the knife to our public health care system by cutting some $918 million in funding over the next four years. By taking money out of the public health system to pay for a new system—which will put further pressure on the public health system—we will have, in essence, a double whammy of pain for public hospitals. Whichever way you look, the Howard government is committed to ripping apart the health care system instead of investing in the health and welfare of Australians at large. It is basically undermining a system that has clearly stood the test of time.
When you go beyond the issue of health, you start to confront one of the other fundamentals of life: education. This budget is premised on the provision of educational opportunity in Australia only for the well-off in the community. The budget spells out very clearly an end to affordable higher education in Australia. I believe, and many of the electors of Batman also believe, that education is a smart investment for Australia. It is an investment, because it is about our future. It is about our skilling and our capacity to compete domestically and internationally. It is about jobs and prosperity for Australians. Open access to education and training, therefore, is a fundamental requirement of Australia. It is the best way to maximise return and capitalise on the opportunities our people can garner.
The problem is that, through this budget, the Howard government wants to restrict opportunities for education and training to those with a pocketful of cash or, perhaps more correctly, those whose parents have a pocketful of cash—therefore crushing the benefits to be gained by our nation from making sure people get the best educational opportunity in life irrespective of their family background and irrespective of whether their parents have high-earning jobs or struggle from week to week to look after their children. Look at the increase in HECS. You can very clearly see that the government has one objective in life: to look after the well-off in the community rather than ensuring that all in the community get the same opportunities in life. HECS fees will rise by up to 30 per cent, and half of the already limited university places will be reserved for those who will pay the astronomical up-front fees.
I might say in passing that, in essence, this is about the Prime Minister changing opportunities for people to attend universities. I can recall the Prime Minister over the last couple of years having a lot to say about queues in the debate about migration and the Tampa. He went out of his way to stress the fact that Australians believe in an orderly way of life and that they actually see migration as being based on a requirement for people to make an application to come to Australia—in essence to join a queue—and be processed in an orderly way. It is strange that we now find that in terms of education, despite what he might have said on the immigration debate, the Prime Minister is putting in place a system which is effectively about enabling the wealthy in the community to jump the queue for educational opportunities. There is no longer a queue for educational opportunity in Australia; it is a case of university degrees being up for sale.
A university degree or an opportunity to pursue higher education only goes to those in the community whose parents can afford to pay. That is what it is about. People who can afford to pay will jump the queue and those from more difficult economic circumstances, who are unable to take on an expected debt of far higher proportions than any fair system would provide, will fall to the bottom of the queue and will be unable to attend university and achieve a fair opportunity in life through pursuing tertiary education. And, even if people are lucky enough to secure a place at a university and are prepared to take the risk of deferring payment of their fees, they will then graduate with a HECS debt of a minimum of $40,000 or more and find themselves paying the same rate of interest on the government's loan as they would pay for a home loan. This system is condemned by a great majority of Australians, and so it ought to be. This is not the higher education system that Labor planned for when it introduced HECS; nor is it the higher education system that Australia needs in the 21st century. It is not the Australian way.
I also remind the House that, when you move beyond health and education, you very quickly come to the conclusion that this is not a budget for the battlers; not on your life. It does not go anywhere towards assisting the battlers in the Australian community who the Prime Minister likes to talk about from time to time. On top of gutting health and making higher education opportunity more difficult, the government is asking Australia to support a budget that delivers only to the top end of town.
Let us take, for example, the issue of multinational corporations. In this budget, the government proposes $300 million in tax cuts to head the way of multinational corporations. Superannuation tax cuts are to be handed to the top few per cent of income earners at a time when the so-called battlers are seeing their superannuation accounts decline because of difficulties in the international share market and local investment opportunities. But the government do not go out of their way to assist those people; they go out of their way to give the highest superannuation earners an even bigger superannuation benefit by reducing the taxation on their benefits.
We then see the Howard government continue to stand back and reward company executives with tax subsidies for their massive bonuses and golden handshakes—an issue reinforced last week by reports about the payout to former BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer Mr Gilbertson, another mate of the Howard government. The Treasurer thinks he can hide these pay-offs to the big end of town—after all, these are the people who give the huge and generous donations to the secret election accounts that the coalition so carefully guard. Having rewarded those people for those huge donations, the Treasurer is trying to suggest that there are a few perks for the ordinary Australian citizen. He thinks he can hide those perks to the top end of town behind a $4 a week tax cut for the majority of Australians, a tax cut that the Australian community has seen correctly for what it is: the smallest tax cut in the history of Australia from the highest taxing government in the history of Australia.
I actually look at my electorate. A recent report into poverty by the Darebin City Council sends a wake up call to the Howard Government. The findings of that report show that the basic structural causes of poverty are prevalent in Darebin, that the gap between rich and poor is growing and that, unfortunately, socioeconomic disadvantage is becoming entrenched in my local community. That community is not far from the Melbourne CBD. I say, as a range of my constituents have said to me over the week and a half since the Treasurer brought down the budget, that this budget does nothing to address their significant and major concerns, which go to accessing essential services and trying to overcome some of the disadvantages that exist in their local community.
I will now turn to some of the problems with respect to my own shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities. I note that a cruel hoax is being perpetrated by the Howard government on the people of regional Australia. There are a number of disadvantaged regional communities around Australia. For a long time they have been promised a better deal—that we are finally going to do something to remove the difficulties that exist in those regional communities. I actually expected some major announcements in this budget for those struggling regional communities. So what did I get? Firstly, an amalgamation of regional programs—a proposal sponsored by the Labor Party at the last election. But then we go to the detail, beyond the simple statement about an amalgamation of regional programs.
I remind the House that those regional programs, which have diminished in amount since 1996, are more and more being used to pork-barrel marginal Liberal Party seats and, more often than that, National Party seats. When I go to the detail I find that regional Australia will lose $17 million in the next financial year and that the funding commitment to regional Australia has been short-changed by the announcements of the recent budget to the tune of—guess what?—not just $17 million in the next financial year but $102 million over the next three financial years. This is a 25 per cent cut to regional programs over a period of three years.
I believe that regional Australia deserves better than that. On all the indicators, including employment, health, education, assistance to improve the roads—you name it—regional Australia is doing it tough. There is no justification, be it remote regional Australia or the outer suburbs of the major capital cities, for this government to reduce the commitment to assist those struggling communities. The end result of these budget cuts is that regional Australia will again lose economic opportunities because of the lost opportunities for a development embodied in the announcements of the Howard government in its budget processes.
That takes me to the issue of AusLink, the question of the Ansett ticket tax and the ongoing decision by the Howard government to rip off ordinary Australians—the travelling public. Our transport infrastructure is in a bad state of disrepair. There is $870 million to upgrade the railway system in Australia. I contend that it is about time the Howard government told the truth with respect to that proposed investment in railway infrastructure. In 1998, the Howard government promised to spend $250 million on our tracks over four years, but less than $100 million of that promise has been spent. This is in spite of a report, released by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services two years ago, that said we need to spend $507 million to make any significant improvement to rail freight in Australia. The budget papers contain the furphy that over $800 million is to be spent. There is no additional money and there is no indication at all about where that $870 million will come from. It is one huge white lie to try to convince the Australian community that the Howard government is committed to the improvement of our rail freight system when it is not committed at all.
There is a clear indication in the budget processes that the ticket tax will continue for another 12 months. It is not only the Ansett ticket tax. We have further cost imposts not only on the aviation industry but also on the airline industry. I want to say to the Ansett workers and their families this evening that the budget processes continue to say to the Australian public that the ticket tax will stay in place to assist you. I know fully that none of that money is going to the Ansett workers; it is going to the government coffers for the purposes of their own pork-barrelling activities. The budget contains further increases in costs for the aviation industry—an industry struggling at the moment because of the threats of terrorism and SARS. There are also further cost imposts on the maritime industry for the purposes of changes in maritime security.
I think it is about time the Howard government was exposed for what it is. It is a government consumed with its own self-interest. The budget priorities set out in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 do not meet the needs and aspirations of Australia in the 21st century. It is time the Howard government got the message that it is its responsibility to govern for all Australians, not a few of its mates. Australians correctly expect that they will have their taxes used to expand opportunities for all—not a narrow, privileged minority in Australia. They want their taxes to be correctly used to look after their personal health, not the political health of the coalition government. Australians want their taxes spent on building the nation, not on tearing it down.
I therefore support the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. It correctly calls on the House to condemn the budget for failing to deliver basic services such as health, education, and services in my own portfolio areas of regional development, transport and tourism. The Howard government stands condemned for a budget that delivers neither any vision or commitment to nation building nor a basic commitment to the provision of services that Australians expect in return for the taxes that they pay. Australians are hardworking people and they are prepared to pay their taxes, but they also expect a safe and secure future through the normal Australian budget processes. That is why Australia needs a Labor government: a government with a vision, as spelt out in the Leader of the Opposition's budget response—a government that would govern for all Australians rather than a minority of mates.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 and to record my thanks to the Treasurer and to the government for delivering yet another responsible budget in very uncertain times. It has been said before that this is a government that has been about delivering outcomes for families and outcomes for small business. This budget certainly delivered on those aims. One of the aims that I had from my interest and involvement in the community in my electorate when I came into this place was to serve and further the cause of families, because of the importance of families to communities such as that of Dickson. My very strong belief is that this budget provided to those people in no small way. This government has not only delivered on things such as lower interest rates but also provided for more economic certainty than was ever the case when interest rates, unemployment and inflation were so high under the 13 years of the Labor government.
One of the concerns that I as a member in this place have is that when we come to Canberra and when we are in these great chambers we can sometimes lose touch with the views of so many in our community. An issue that I have campaigned on very hard is that of double jeopardy. I have campaigned very hard on that issue because it is an issue that I believe needs to be addressed by this parliament and, indeed, by the parliaments of each state government around the country. I commend the Carr government for the progressive legislative changes they have made in relation to double jeopardy in modernising a law which is 800 years old. It is a law which has also been modernised in the United Kingdom, where it originated. The Blair Labour government in the United Kingdom has taken the opportunity to update and modernise a number of aspects of the criminal law system, including that of double jeopardy. I commend that government as well for the way in which it has approached with an open mind this very serious issue, which causes grief to families and to members of our community.
It is an issue which is very well known in Queensland because of the infamous case of Raymond John Carroll. I know that some members in this place have spoken as well on the tragedy of the Carroll case. Carroll is a person who has twice been found guilty by separate juries and who has, subsequent to each of those findings, been found not guilty by a higher court on a legal technicality. It is an issue that I have fought very hard on in my community, because I believe that change needs to be made. Some who would misrepresent the view that I and other members of my community hold have said that we are about abolishing the principle of double jeopardy. It is quite the contrary, in fact. That is not what we are about. We are very much about modernising the concept of double jeopardy, providing for certainty and making provision within the criminal justice system for outcomes and closures for families—like families who have tragically lost people like Deirdre Kennedy, the 17-month-old child who was lost to Faye Kennedy and her family almost 30 years ago. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the tragic loss of Deirdre Kennedy in those dreadful circumstances that all Queenslanders and, I am sure, all Australians are aware of.
The ultimate outcome thus far in relation to the trial of Carroll—who, as I say, has been convicted twice of that murder—is that we have a situation where Carroll appealed to the High Court on grounds including that of double jeopardy and has in my view escaped justice to date. The overwhelming evidence that was produced in that trial and in the previous trials in my view proved that person's guilt. We have a situation where a principle which is 800 years old has robbed that family of justice. If we are about providing justice and fair outcomes to victims of crime and to their loved ones—who live in electorates such as mine, Dickson, and indeed in others right around the country—why shouldn't we be about righting the wrongs and providing for some fair outcomes for those people?
I have heard it said in this place that we should not be changing this principle simply because of the fact that it has been one of the cornerstones of our justice system for 800 years. In part, I agree with that argument. I am not advocating the abolition of double jeopardy, which is what some people who seek to misrepresent my view and my argument in relation to this matter would have you believe. Over the last few weeks, 15,000 signatures have been collected from people right around Queensland, and in particular from people in the south-east corner of Queensland, who have supported my calls for the upgrade and modernisation of double jeopardy. They share my view that double jeopardy is not a principle that should be abolished. It is one of the very important and fundamental cornerstones of the Australian criminal justice system. That is why we believe that the double jeopardy provisions should be retained and the principle modernised to provide justice in those cases where it has so far robbed people of that justice.
I have also heard people who misrepresent my view, and people who support my view, suggest that we should be looking at some overseas models. It has been suggested that we should be looking, for argument's sake, at the model in Scotland which has been adopted for about 300 years. It is a system which provides for three outcomes: a verdict of guilty, not guilty or not proven. We know that it is a system which, despite those people who advocate it, is only operating in Scotland. A not proven verdict means that the prosecution has not provided enough substantial proof to convict the individual of a crime but there remains considerable doubt regarding the offender's innocence. Under the Scot system, a person who has been given a not proven verdict cannot be retried for that same crime. That is a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Scot system would provide some justice or some outcome for those people under the Australian system who have been robbed by the outdated and antiquated double jeopardy provisions.
The not proven verdict has a 300-year-old history in Scotland and has been the subject of debate and criticism since at least 1827, when Sir Walter Scott labelled it `the bastard verdict'. In Scotland in recent times there has been a vigorous campaign to abolish the ability of juries to give a not proven verdict. The campaign was spearheaded by the father of a murdered girl whose accused killer was declared not proven. The argument against the system was that the verdict left victims' families in limbo without a resolution either way, with no closure—not dissimilar in many ways to the lack of closure that is provided for families who are robbed under the current provisions of the double jeopardy system that operates in Australia.
A not proven verdict also leaves the defendant tainted with a verdict of `less than innocent'. In 2000, 23 per cent of Scotland's 4,000 acquittals were declared not proven. That means that about 920 defendants were left without the clearance of an official exoneration and that 920 victims of crime and their families were left wondering if the guilty party was walking free. It is a system that is flawed also because it removes the cut and dried ability of a court to award costs to one party or another. This can necessitate a second judicial inquiry into costs. It further complicates the judicial process, as the second inquiry can be lengthier and more complex than the trial itself.
I say to the House tonight that this Howard government is very much about providing better outcomes for Australian families. One of the ways we can do that is to ensure that the injustices that families like the Kennedy family have endured now for 30 years never happen again. That is why I have been part of his campaign to modernise—not to abolish but to modernise—the provisions of double jeopardy as it operates in the Australian criminal law system.
I call on the attorneys-general around Australia—and, indeed, on the federal Attorney-General—to further consider this principle. If they are, as the Premier in Queensland talks about, for providing some justice, some equity, some equality and some uniformity across Australia then they should indeed adopt the model which has been rightly adopted by the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government in its modernisation of the double jeopardy provisions has provided a system where, essentially, if new evidence does come to light then the police make approaches to the Attorney-General of the day—quite properly so. The police then are removed from the whole process. The Attorney-General then takes the decision that there is new evidence, if that is what is adduced by what is before him. If he then arrives at the decision that new evidence has been produced and that a new trial should be granted, the Attorney-General then makes application to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
If people are after a watertight system as best we can provide it, and a transparent system that provides for some certainty and some outcome, then that is about as close to perfect as we can get in this current system. Not only does it remove police from any ability to make a decision in relation to a second trial; it also removes the Attorney-General and therefore, some would argue, any political motivation that might exist for the Attorney of the day. It places, quite rightly, that decision to again pursue the defendant with the Court of Criminal Appeal of the day. The Court of Criminal Appeal then makes the decision based on the evidence that is before it that, yes, there is sufficient new evidence that has been adduced from that provided by the police—or wherever the evidence may have come from—to grant another chance at justice.
I really do implore the state government tonight to put aside arguments and distractions where people are talking about abolishing double jeopardy, because that is not what we are doing. That is a furphy that has been introduced into the argument, and it is convenient for the sake of some people's arguments. We know that the Scottish system is a failed one; we know that people in Scotland do not agree with that system. And we know that we are about providing for fair outcomes. To be able to do that, we need to adopt a policy which modernises double jeopardy. It is a fundamental cornerstone of our justice system and it is a system which we do not recommend abolishing but which we do recommend updating.
There are other refinements that need to be made to our criminal law system to iron out these difficulties that we have from time to time. Make no mistake about it: this is not wholesale change which provides for some sort of ability for the state to pursue relentlessly some person who has previously been found not guilty. It does not provide that at all, and that is not what we are advocating. What we are talking about in the circumstance is providing for a fairer outcome for the people of Australian society. In my view, we need to put aside some of these arguments and distractions that other people have put forward and deal very quickly with the issue at hand.
I renew my call tonight not just to the Queensland Premier but indeed to the state Attorney-General to listen to, I believe, the 99 per cent of Queenslanders who support the modernisation of double jeopardy to ensure that the tragedy and the circumstances that the Kennedy family have gone through for 30 years never happen again. We want a system which provides that certainty, that outcome and that closure for families. If we do not provide that then we are going to see forevermore the difficulties that have been presented to the Kennedy family and to other families. If we are going to be honest about the situation and the system that we are faced with at the moment, we have fundamentally a very good legal system. There are problems that we need to iron out. We do not need to make wholesale change and replace the whole verdict system; we need to make changes which modernise the system and make it fairer for all Australian families.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-05-26,"—In resolution 55/196, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2003 as the International Year of Freshwater. This proclamation provides the opportunity and impetus to further implement water resource management principles on an international level and, consequently, on a national, state and municipal basis. It is a pity that Australia has not adopted this international year. Fresh water is the most important natural resource in existence—a fact especially relevant to Australia, the driest inhabited continent in the world. Fresh water is vital for human health, social development and economic productivity, with its scarcity or abundance being an indication of the wellbeing of the population, the economy and the nation as a whole.
Given this backdrop, it is not surprising that when there is a decrease in the per capita availability of fresh water there is a need for concern. Over the past 50 years or so, with increased water abstractions and pollution coupled with population pressures, the international per capita availability has dropped by nearly 60 per cent. This is predicted to fall further as abstractions progressively increase and ground water pollution worsens.
My electorate of Chisholm is fortunate; it lies within the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, one of only five cities in the world that has protected wilderness catchments which are closed to human activity to protect water quality and public health, with water that is largely unfiltered, with minimal chlorine. However, just like the rest of eastern and northern Australia, there is an ever-reducing amount of water due to the climatic changes brought about by El Nino, bringing on one of the worst droughts in living memory; a drought that has devastated rural communities and altered the water use habits of those in the suburbs.
So what can be done about this devastating situation? Many would argue that nothing can be done—but not my state Labor parliamentary colleagues. They have implemented enterprising initiatives to manage us through the present crisis and beyond. Victoria is the first state in Australia to have a Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability, a position with the responsibility to properly manage and protect our natural heritage. They are amending the Victorian constitution to entrench in public hands the responsibility for the delivery of water services. Moreover, the presenting of the Savewater awards in March gives deserved recognition to those businesses that implement and promote water sustainability. But arguably the most dramatic measure has been the courage to implement water restrictions, which many would have said was political suicide. However, what these detractors do not realise is that, when a decision is based on what is best for the people, then those very people will offer at least their understanding, if not wholehearted support.
This lifestyle sacrifice has been adhered to, if not embraced, by all Victorians, with not one prosecution necessary to date for breaching the stage 1 measures in place. In fact, the measures have encouraged volunteer groups to become more active in improving waterways and the surrounding areas. I take particular pride in mentioning two such groups in my electorate: Friends of Damper Creek, and Friends of Scotchman's Creek and Valley Reserve, which have received grants to continue their important work.
But can the same attitude and principled approach be said of the federal government? Typically, no. Everyone affected by the current drought conditions is trying to do their part, but the federal Liberal government is being its usual obstinate self. In an effort to further sustainable water management, the Victorian government is committing $77 million to the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline project, a project of national importance. But what has the federal government done? Instead of matching the amount for this project, it has committed less than five per cent of the amount, which will make the project proceed in a piecemeal fashion rather than in the comprehensive manner that it so very much deserves. This project is vital. It is estimated to save 83 per cent of the water lost through seepage and evaporation, which is about 93,000 megalitres per year. Unfortunately, this is typical of the Liberal government. After seven years of drought and the challenges facing the Victorian people, it has ignored them when they are in need. When will the Liberal government understand that such a vital resource as water is not a political football? It is about people's lives, the sustainability of their community and the wellbeing of the country.
I want to conclude with two points. First, I want to acknowledge the efforts of all Australians, especially Victorians and most particularly those in Chisholm, in reducing their water consumption. I know it has been a challenge, and their efforts have been extraordinary to say the least. Second, I want to congratulate the Victorian state government on taking responsible action now and having a long-term plan for water sustainability for future generations. They have given this issue the prominence, attention and action it deserves. It is a true pity that the federal government has not done the same; it continues to drag its feet.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Environment: Water Management</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-05-26," asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:
(1)	For how many of its staff has the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) provided GST training.
(2)	How many of those staff have subsequently left the ATO, and how many of them left within six weeks of completing the training course. 
(3)	How many staff left the ATO in (a) 1998-99, (b) 1999-2000 and (c) 2000-2001.
(4)	What will be the impact of these departures on the time taken to process taxation returns.
(5)	Have staff been transferred out of the Large Business and International business line; if so, how many.
(6)	What has been the cost of outsourcing the information technology function to EDS in each financial year since this first occurred.
(7)	What percentage of the ATO budget was allocated to information technology in (a) 2000-2001, (b) 1999-2000, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1997-98 and (e) 1996-97.
(8)	Has the ATO given incorrect GST registration numbers to businesses registering for the GST; if so, (a) on how many occasions, (b) what was the reason for incorrect registration numbers being issued and (c) will businesses in this situation who have printed letterheads, replied to questionnaires and who will incur significant expense in rectifying these errors be offered compensation by the ATO or the Government for expenses incurred as a result.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Taxation Office</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,19,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-26,"—The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1)	All staff recruited to GST have received induction and technical training appropriate to their job. Development and training programs continue to be provided to GST staff on an on-going basis. Other staff in the ATO receive GST training on a “needs” basis to assist them in performing their work. 
(2)	The number of staff who left immediately following their induction and technical training would form a small proportion of GST's overall low staff turnover rate of approximately 4%. The number of staff recruited to GST who left the ATO during 1999-2000 was 133, 2000-2001 was 183 and 2001-2002 was 346.
(3)	(a) 1,225, (b) 869, (c) 755
(4)	The ATO does not expect these departures to have an impact on the time taken to process taxation returns. The ATO has arrangements in place to ensure that sufficient staff are available to process taxation returns within the service standards set out in the Taxpayers' Charter.
(5)	There are always movements between business lines to meet work flow demands and staff preferences.
(6)	EDS Australia assumed responsibility for providing the ATO with information technology and telecommunications services from 24 June 1999.  The ATO has outlaid the following amounts to EDS for the provision of information technology and telecommunications services for the financial years shown:
·	$142.7 million for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000;
·	$197.7 million for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001;
·	$176 million for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002;
·	$85 million for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 December 2002.
(7)	The budget allocation to information technology as a percentage of the total ATO budget for:
	(a)	the financial year 2000-2001 was 15.49%;
	(b)	the financial year 1999-2000 was 15%;
	(c)	the financial year 1998-99 was 15.7%; 
The above figures for 2000-01, 1999-00 and 1998-99 were influenced by preparation for A New Tax System.
	(d)	the financial year 1997-98 was 11.7%; and 
	(e)	the financial year 1996-97 was 9%, of the ATO budget.
In relation to (7), the information technology funding allocation includes applications development, support and maintenance; EDS-supplied services; and other functions that were retained in-house, such as Data Capture, IT Architecture, IT Security and IT Training.  The percentages do not include IT-related functions performed outside the ATO Technology Line, such as other Business Line-developed applications.
(8)	(a)	The number of incorrect Australian Business Numbers (ABN) issued was 8,557 as at 10 February 2003. This is 0.2% of a total of 4.3 million ABNs issued - with 4.08 million ABNs active at the end of February 2003.  Of the incorrect ABNs, only 1,791 were brought to the attention of the ATO by businesses.  All others were identified through quality activities conducted by the ATO to ensure the integrity of the register.  
	(b)	Incorrect numbers issued as a result of discrepancies between data held by the ATO and the Australian Securities and Investments Commissioner (ASIC) for the companies concerned.  These discrepancies were caused by:
·	businesses quoting incorrect Australian Company Number (ACN) information to the ATO at the time of registering, eg valid ACN of one company quoted for another, or numbers transposed that still qualified as a valid ACN; and
·	incorrect data held by the ATO.
	(c)	The ATO administers a compensation scheme under the Taxpayers' Charter which offers compensation to entities that incur additional costs as a result of acting on incorrect advice provided by the ATO. Measures have been taken to advise all affected clients of their rights for compensation by incorporating this advice in the Notifications that issued with the replaced ABNs.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Taxation Office</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,19,1,answer
