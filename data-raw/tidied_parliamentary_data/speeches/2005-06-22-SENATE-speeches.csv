"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-22,"—When we were interrupted in our discussion of this legislation a day or two ago, I was speaking to Democrat amendment (1) and making the point that we Democrats firmly believe that ASIO should be required to provide the parliament with basic information about its use of interception powers—for example, the number of warrants issued to it by the Attorney-General. We do not believe that this would impinge in any way on ASIO’s ability to promote or protect Australia’s national security, and we make two observations which support this view.
Firstly, we note that law enforcement agencies are already required to provide basic information regarding the number of interception warrants they obtain each year, what offences those warrants relate to and whether or not the information obtained has led to an arrest. In recent years, the annual report on the Telecommunications (Interception) Act has included information such as the number of interception warrants that have related to an offence of terrorism. Given that this kind of information can be provided by law enforcement agencies without threatening national security, we Democrats see no reason why it cannot also be provided by ASIO.
The second observation we make is that ASIO is already required to provide an annual report on information which is just as sensitive as telecommunications interception—namely, the number of times which it applies for and is granted a warrant to take a person into custody for interrogation under its controversial new powers. We Democrats make the point that if ASIO is able to provide this kind of information without compromising national security then it should also be able to provide basic information about the exercise of its telecommunications interception powers, and that is the purpose of the amendment before us.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-22,"—Before I address this amendment, I have a golden opportunity, as the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, is in the committee here today, to say how much the government has valued Anne’s work. Anne will certainly be leaving with the best wishes of the government and my personal best wishes. When I first came here as a very inexperienced and younger senator—I am older now but still inexperienced—Anne Lynch taught me a great deal about the Senate. Any flaws that I demonstrate are purely the fault of the student, not the teacher. I wish Anne all the best in her retirement. She has certainly served the parliament and the Senate in an outstanding way. I have just breached the one rule that was taught to me about dealing with something which is not the subject of the committee’s debate, but I am grateful for the indulgence of the committee for that opportunity, as I do not have another opportunity to do it.
The government do not support this amendment. We believe that ASIO discharges its accountability responsibilities by providing its classified report to not only the government but also the opposition. The argument that ASIO should also be accountable in the public arena is far outweighed by the public interest of ensuring that our national security agency is able to operate as effectively as possible. The parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD considered in 2000 the need for ASIO to report publicly. The committee did not recommend any change to ASIO’s practice of not reporting publicly, and it does not appear necessary to consider this issue further at this time.
I can understand the thrust of the Democrat amendment, but the government believe that for these reasons it is not an appropriate amendment. We believe that ASIO discharges its accountability responsibilities by furnishing its classified annual report to not only the government but also the opposition. The Sherman report did not raise new substantive arguments to justify revisiting this argument and, as I said, the government will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-22,"—Senator Greig, the opposition had a very long and hard look at this issue. There is an alternative course available. We are not minded to support the amendment, although we do see the sense behind it. We understand the position that is being progressed, and your arguments are almost persuasive. There is the alternative course of allowing the matter to go to the parliamentary joint committee, which is looking into a range of issues, including this one. It may be worth while putting this on its agenda as well to ensure that there is greater parliamentary oversight of the activities of Australia’s intelligence agencies. But, given the context in which the amendment has been raised, as I said, we will not be supporting it.
If you look at the way warrants are issued by the Director-General of Security, you see that a thorough examination of these issues under the multiplicity of legislation that deals with ASIO powers and the reporting requirements under such legislation would be appropriate. There is no argument about that. I think it would be helpful. In addition to the public good of improving accountability, there are countervailing interests in protecting the work undertaken by ASIO. Without wanting to debate the full raft of instances, of course there would be circumstances in which the activities of ASIO would appropriately need to be protected—for example, in ongoing operational investigative matters. There are arguments for and against the matter. I think the way through this is to refer it for greater scrutiny of the particular issue rather than to agree to the amendment here—although, obviously, you will be disappointed with that. That is the position we are adopting in relation to this, but we do see the sense behind it. We think that it should go to the joint committee. If you do not take it to the joint committee, we are in a position to seek to take it there.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-06-22,"—We have before us today the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. As we wait for the Labor Party speaker, I will fill in for a few minutes on this bill. We know that the Labor Party speaker, who is late in coming to debate this most important issue, has stood against this bill from day one. He has fought it tooth and nail as it has gone back and forth from the Senate. I see that Senator Greig is here. He and the Democrats have had much to do to get this reform bill through the parliament. It is actually more than reform; it is a revolutionary bill relating to the superannuation industry. We all know that.
We know the consequences of bringing choice into what was a closed industry. It will have a major effect. It is going to take a while to smooth out. We have already seen the television advertisements about giving the consumer great choice. I mentioned Senator Greig. There have been many valedictories and he has been recognised by a couple of speakers. There is no doubt that when this bill first came to the Senate Senator Greig indicated that he would stand his ground with the Democrats against it unless certain amendments were made, in particular to aid his cause. To that end, the government did make those amendments after realising that Senator Greig, to his credit, would not back down. So I really think he can leave this place saying that he has made a major legislative difference—and a social difference, for that matter.
Senator Sherry has entered the chamber. I was only going to speak for a very short time to fill in the time because he was running late. I do not know why we have to put up with Senator Sherry running late on this matter when we already know what he is going to say. He has never varied his position, let alone his speech to the parliament, on this issue on any occasion. We are now going to suffer yet again Senator Sherry’s railing against this revolutionary piece of legislation. Senator Sherry, I invite you, in the next 10 minutes, to try and make some sense of your objection.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-22,"—I am pleased that Senator McGauran’s own colleague acknowledged that I was not late. In fact, I was called in unexpectedly because the schedules have been adjusted due to the valedictories. We are dealing with the second reading of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. It is in fact a bill to amend the original piece of legislation which passed last year. Superannuation choice begins on 1 July this year, so we are considering some important amendments with just over a week to go. That is a concern. With just over a week to go, we are dealing with some substantial amendments. Senator McGauran used the term ‘revolutionary’. I will certainly accept that this is a radical change to the nature of superannuation in Australia. I think that is one issue that we can all agree on at least. So here we are, at the last minute, making amendments to a radical restructuring of superannuation in this country. Labor would argue that you need some certainty and predictability when such a radical change is being imposed by the Liberal-National Party so that people can plan ahead.
I will also mention in this context the fact that the changes to the Financial Services Reform Act 2001, on which depends one of the fundamental protections for employees in respect of superannuation—the principle of disclosure of fees and charges—have not been finalised in the context of superannuation. Here we are coming up to 1 July and the regulations for the disclosure regime, which require the provision of what are called product disclosure statements to millions of Australian consumers in order to assist them and to protect them when they make a choice of superannuation fund, have not yet been finalised. The government put in original legislation regulations; the consequence is that disclosure statements that have been produced by financial institutions on super run to 50 to 80 pages. Unfortunately, for most Australians these documents are incomprehensible, because the surveys show this in terms of financial literacy—this is no criticism of the individual ability of Australians to understand or read English. They are simply too large and too voluminous, and the government has had to bring in so-called enhancements to simplify these dramatically. They will not be ready by 1 July.
I would firstly point out that in this country we already have superannuation choice. It is called investment choice. Most Australians have the ability, within a superannuation fund, to select different investment options. So it is not correct to argue that we do not have choice in Australia already. What we are dealing with here is about five million Australians being allowed to go and pick a superannuation fund. It is not unlimited choice of superannuation fund; there are a number of caveats. This is where the government have got themselves into a contradictory philosophical position, because they say, ‘We want choice,’ but at the same time they have imposed a number of caveats on individuals who exercise choice. Let me give you a couple of examples. There are defined benefit funds, and I understand why there is no choice for members of defined benefit funds. I will not go into the details of that today but it is difficult, practically, to do. The next caveat is where an employer contributes more than nine per cent; in that case there is no choice for the employee. Also, in the event of what are called workplace agreements, the employer can impose a fund that they have selected.
Labor argues that the government has got to be consistent. If you are going to have choice of superannuation fund—putting aside defined benefit funds—you cannot have caveats. Without them, ultimately, the system will evolve to total choice. But Labor’s central contention is that the regime the government is establishing is too complicated and it is unsafe. It is too complicated for employers. Employers have significant new red-tape burdens under choice of superannuation fund. I find it quite ironic that a Liberal-National Party government that argues for reducing red tape on employers is imposing a significant new red-tape burden. The employer under this new regime, and this was highlighted on the front page of the Financial Review this morning, is required to issue five million forms to employees in the period from 1 July, and one million ongoing. And these new choice of superannuation forms—
—You argued for those!
—They do not have to issue those at the moment, Senator McGauran. In fact, Senator McGauran might be interested that I have had representations from the National Farmers Federation on this. They are particularly concerned about industries where there is a high turnover of employees. The employer issues a form; the employee hands it back: for an industry where there is a significant turnover that is a lot of form filling. On top of that, the employer is legally obliged to keep these forms for five years because the tax office—the enforcer of this new regime—will be inspecting them to ensure that the employer has conformed. So that is one set of new obligations on the employer.
Next is that most employers pay to one superannuation fund in this country—one or two perhaps. That is the simple way to do it for the employer. Under the choice of fund regime the employer will be paying to many more than one or two funds. There are clearing houses that can transfer the moneys, but they cost the employer money; the employer has to pay for a clearing-house facility. If the employer does not have electronic transfers, and many still do not—they pay by cheque—and they have, say, 20 employees, over time they will have to write out cheques to 20 different superannuation funds.
—You argued for those when Kemp was minister!
—Senator McGauran, this becomes very messy because if an employee changes superannuation fund—and there are literally thousands of superannuation funds in the country—the documentation for paying the moneys to the fund has to be checked. And this continually changes. So no-one can dispute that there is additional red tape and cost for the employer. On top of that there is a very serious penalty regime—two years in jail and/or $22,000—if an employer advises an employee about choice of fund outside the terms of the legislation. They are very substantial penalties. Again, I find it quite interesting that a Liberal government—and in this case I will acknowledge also the role of the National Party—imposing a draconian penalty regime on an employer.
—You sought these checks and balances!
—Senator McGauran, in the event that any one of the five million employees about to be given forms quite innocently goes to their employer, and says, ‘What should I do. I do not know much about this; can you help me out?’ and the employer, wanting to help, says, ‘I think you should perhaps select or consider fund A, B or C’, that is an offence. Under the Financial Services Reform Act the employer is not licensed to give advice. Two years in jail and/or a $22,000 fine: I find it amazing that a Liberal-National government, on top of the new paperwork, the red tape and the cost, imposes what are very substantial penalties—fines and jail terms—on employers. I warn the government: these new costs and penalties will come back to bite you. The government has not designed a simple regime. Labor agrees with choice of fund, but the government has not thought enough about a simple regime to ensure that these new onerous burdens are not placed on employers.
In addition to this, the second theme of Labor’s concern is safety: protections to employees. This so-called choice of fund regime has been tried in other countries around the world. Effectively, it is deregulation of the retail distribution of superannuation. There are some dangers in this. Choice on the face of it sounds fantastic, but there are some practical difficulties for employees.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-06-22,"—My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Workforce Participation. I refer the minister to the budget impact report recently released by the respected Melbourne Institute. When the minister selectively quoted from that report earlier this week, didn’t he forget to mention that it shows that the effect of the so-called welfare to work measures on labour supply is no better than ‘ambiguous’? Didn’t the minister also forget to mention the report’s projection that only 45,000 people would move into work over the next four years and that none of this was a result of the welfare changes? Hasn’t the Treasurer’s budget night boast that 190,000 people would get work as a result of changes to welfare been completely and utterly discredited by the Melbourne Institute? Will the minister now indicate precisely how many people the government expects to actually move from welfare to work as a result of its changes to welfare?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment and Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-06-22,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister appears to have conceded that the Melbourne Institute is correct and therefore that the Treasurer is wrong. Has the minister advised the Treasurer that he agrees that the Melbourne Institute is correct and the Treasurer’s boastful claims of 190,000 are completely wrong? Does the minister also agree with the Melbourne Institute that Labor’s policy would actually move more people into work off welfare than the government’s package? Isn’t the reason the government arrogantly refused to release their costings and projections at Senate estimates that they knew the figures were a complete shambles, just like the rest of their so-called Welfare to Work scheme?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment and Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-06-22,"—Senator Wong has finally been able to convince the question time committee on her side to allow her to continue with this alleged attack she broadcast to the world that she was going to undertake this week. At the outset let me say that we as a government do not make any apologies for having a Welfare to Work policy and a program to implement it. That is in stark contrast with the Australian Labor Party, who have nothing to offer in this regard. Indeed, the Melbourne Institute in its analysis had great difficulty because it had to make a lot of assumptions as to what the Labor Party’s policy actually might be in certain areas. It was a huge vacuum around which the academics had to try to weave some sort of policy construct so that they could try to compare the Liberal approach with the Labor approach. The very first sentence of the institute’s analysis says:
This year’s budget of the Commonwealth government was clearly aimed at improving Australians’ labour force participation.
The Melbourne Institute fully acknowledge that that is the aim of the government. We make no apology for that. They have recognised that what we have done is designed for that purpose. If you have a look at the international comparisons, you note that we have a higher rate of people on disability support pension in comparison to OECD countries. That is out of whack. The reason for that is that we as a nation have not been encouraging those with disabilities to concentrate on what abilities they do have and what contribution they might be able to make to self-support and enter the work force. As a result, the government have announced plans and policies to assist people to re-engage with the work force.
I have heard a variety of figures mentioned as to how many people are going to be moved from welfare to work. Rather than us vacating the ground as a policy, as the Labor Party are doing in this area, anybody that we are able to move—every single individual Australian that we are able to move—from welfare to work will have been a success for that particular individual, for the community and society at large and of course also for the economy. If we are to be condemned because only 45,000 are going to be shifted across, at the end of the day the Australian people will be able to judge us a government that really had a go and that really developed policies designed to assist people to get from welfare to work. This is in stark contrast to the Labor Party, which have offered the Australian people absolutely nothing in this vital, important social area.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment and Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-06-22,"—I think all honourable senators know that I said nothing of the sort that Senator Wong has suggested. Yesterday in question time Labor tried to verbal me, and the record was corrected this morning. Of course, the Labor Party will try to assert that we have been saying things which are completely incorrect.
The Melbourne Institute’s great difficulty was in actually determining what the Labor policy might be and then trying to spin out what the consequences might be of a Labor policy that had not even been fully constructed. We on this side of the house see it as a social responsibility to assist as many people as possible off welfare into work. As the Melbourne Institute analysis says in conclusion— (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister’s failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.
I point out that my office contacted Senator Hill’s office much earlier today to advise that this would be asked at the end of question time. My question was a simple one. It was: when will the minister respond to my letter of 7 April 2003 concerning orders for the production of documents, which was tabled in the Senate on 14 May 2003? This is the second occasion on which I have asked why there has been no answer to that question. I think the answer is the government’s arrogant disregard for supplying Senate orders for documents.
I also remind the government and others in this place of the importance of producing documents requested by the Senate. In fact, Odgers has noted:
Orders for production of documents are among the most significant procedures available to the Senate to deal with matters of public interest giving rise to questions of ministerial accountability.
As we face after tomorrow a time when the government has the absolute numbers in this place, the ability of the Senate to call on the government to provide it with documentation to allow us to scrutinise the actions of the government is going to be even more limited. So it is regrettable that even in the last few years the government has had such a poor record on compliance. If I can go through that record, in 2001 52 per cent of orders were not complied with; in 2002, 50 per cent; in 2003, 64 per cent; and an all-time high in 2004 of 81 per cent of orders not complied with. In 2005 so far, 50 per cent have not been complied with.
My letter to the minister goes to the inconsistency with which government has responded to these returns to order. I do not think the government can argue that these were unreasonable requests, and I think we can demonstrate by the responses we have had to those requests how inconsistent the responses are and how unreasonable they are as excuses. Let me go through a few. Some that have been given to us are that they are internal working documents, others say they are policy advice, others say information belonging to the states, and of course the ubiquitous commercial-in-confidence rears its ugly head time and time again. Sometimes we have been told that it is all about delicate negotiations that are ongoing, and in one case, extraordinarily, that the production of information would not be helpful to the sheep. This was my colleague Senator Bartlett’s return to order and it was about the live sheep fiasco not so long ago.
My letter to you, Minister Hill, was to ask you to exercise your responsibility as Leader of the Government in the Senate by taking charge of government responses to Senate orders for documents to ensure that those orders are met with proper respect and not with casual refusals and that there is some consistency in the government’s responses. A consistent policy, I said, is conspicuously lacking in such responses at present, resulting in glaring inconsistencies, and casual refusal seems to be the current practice, with the number of government refusals of documents steadily increasing. That was in 2003, and the following year there were, as I said, 81 per cent of those returns to order refused.
Minister, it is a sad day to have to remind you about this. You obviously did not take this letter seriously. You have refused to consider responding to it. I can only assume by your refusal to do so that you care nothing about this question, that it does not bother you that your poor record on supplying the Senate with the documents that it requests is in such a shambles and that, given that you ask for the cooperation of the Senate in so many areas, you have such disregard for requests for documents to allow us to do our work. It is, as I say, a sad day, especially in the last week of the Senate in its current form, on which you ignore that request.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 29</title>,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,9,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-06-22,"—With respect, the confusion is on the side of Senator Allison. Why I was surprised when she asked about the letter was that her office had contacted mine to say that she was going to ask me why the government was so slow in responding to a large number of outstanding questions on notice and I had prepared myself for that occurrence. Senator Allison, unfortunately, has had a misunderstanding within her office and has come in with a different brief. So I am sorry I was not in a position to answer the matter that she referred to.
Having listened to her speech, I thought she was also somewhat unkind when she said that we have failed to comply with the notices to produce documents. I think she will find that, in every case, we have responded to the order of the Senate. In a number of instances, we have refused, after consideration, to table the documents on the basis of what we argue are legitimate grounds. I do not quarrel with Odgers; I would not dare quarrel with Odgers. This is an important tool of the Senate. It used to be recognised as such when it was used sparingly. Of recent times, it has almost become an alternative to an honourable senator doing his or her own homework by simply coming in and demanding the production of numerous documents. Of course, in this place, the opposition and the Democrats always vote together and the motion is passed.
That is a political exercise. Senator Allison apparently gets upset if it is responded to in a political way but we have an entitlement, in our view, to refuse to provide those documents in certain circumstances. Rather than belittle the circumstances, as was done by Senator Allison, I would in fact argue that they are all legitimate reasons for nonproduction of the documents. There are circumstances in which the government is entitled to do its business and meet its executive responsibility without having to provide internal workings. In some of those circumstances, we do not provide internal documents. We do not provide documents that deal with a relationship between Australia and other nations. We do not provide documents belonging to another state without the consent or approval of that other state. We do not provide documents that are commercial-in-confidence.
These explanations have been developed over a long period of time in order to provide a reasonable balance between the responsibilities of the executive and the responsibility of the legislature. It might not please Senator Allison that we seek to do our job as an executive in a way that we believe is in the best national interests but no doubt she would say she is trying to do her job in the best legislative interests. In these circumstances we disagree. It is certainly not intended to be a sign of disrespect to the Senate. She should have prefaced her comments by saying that on each and every occasion the government has responded, although in her terms it might not have met the order of the Senate and in fact produced the documents. So therein lies a difference. It has got nothing to do with arrogance at all; it is all to do with what a government needs to do to carry out its executive responsibilities in an effective way.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 29</title>,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-22,"—Minister, it is all very well for you to say that you have done what you need to do by telling us what the reason is for not giving us those documents, and you might also complain about the number of documents that are requested. That is fair enough, but the question that you have not answered is why you did not answer the letter in the first place. It was a serious letter and was couched in a way which demonstrated the problem that we have here of inconsistency—and it is inconsistent. I do not think you can argue that it is not. It also suggested that it is not good enough to just trot out a few old excuses. Perhaps we need to have some thought on your part about what is reasonable, and a justification of what is reasonable and what is not reasonable with regard to an excuse for not providing a document.
It is disrespectful of you to not respond to a letter which is written to you on a serious matter and which asked for a response. It is not reasonable for you to say that you are not being arrogant when, by ignoring such a letter, you are necessarily being so. So I ask you to give this a more considered response than you have been able to today. I am sorry if Chinese whispers in my office ended up with a message to you that was a little jumbled. I will check that with my staff and make sure that they did give your staff the advice that I expected they would. Nonetheless, the issue remains that you have not responded to a letter despite promptings in the form of formal questions. I ask you again to seriously look at that letter and to give the Senate a response, or give me a response, which I will table in the Senate, to all of those questions raised.

I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Australia House Defence and Lightwells Refurbishment, Australian High Commission, London

The Committee’s sixth report of 2005 addresses the refurbishment of lightwells and Defence office accommodation at Australia House, London. The works, referred by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, are intended to:
ensure compliance with current occupational health and safety standards;
provide an acceptable level of amenity for tenants;
ensure ongoing viability of the property in respect of income generation; and
to redress degradation of the lightwell areas.
Having investigated the proposal, the Committee is satisfied that the works will improve amenity of the 90 year-old building in a cost-effective manner and therefore, recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $11.98 million.

Mid-life Upgrade of Existing Chancery at the Australian High Commission, Singapore

The Committee’s seventh report of 2005 examines the mid-life upgrade of Australia’s existing Chancery building at its High Commission in Singapore. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reported that the Chancery in its current form has significant deficiencies in meeting current occupational health and safety and Building Code of Australia standards; is dysfunctional and non-cost-effective in terms of layout, and does not present an appropriate image of Australia in its representational and reception areas.
To redress these deficiencies, the Department proposes to:
upgrade building services, access, security and communications systems; and
reconfigure and refurbish tenant office accommodation.
The Committee was satisfied with the Department’s response to its questions and recommended that the work proceed at the estimated cost of $12.7 million.

New Consulate-General Building, Bali, Indonesia

The Committee’s eighth report of 2005 deals with a proposal, also by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to construct a new Consulate-General building in Bali, Indonesia, at an estimated cost of $7.15 million.
The Department reported that the former Consulate-General building in Bali is no longer suitable to fulfil its consular and representative role, with significant deficiencies in respect of:
occupational health and safety;
floor space and functionality;
building structure and services; and
security.
Since the terrorist bombing in 2002, the Australian Consulate-General in Bali has been accommodated in leased premises—a situation that is not sustainable in the long term.
The Committee is in no doubt as to the requirement for the proposed work and recommends that it proceed. Further, the Committee is pleased to note that the proposed works will provide a permanent site for, and improve access to, the Memorial Garden and Anniversary Pond erected to victims of the Bali bombing.

Construction of Chancery, Vientiane, Laos

A further proposal by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, namely the construction of a new Chancery in Vientiane, Laos, forms the subject of the Committee’s ninth report of 2005.
The proposed new building, estimated to cost $11 million, is intended to replace the existing Chancery, which was acquired and refurbished in 1961 and no longer modern standards in respect of services, layout, building codes or occupational health and safety requirements.
The Committee has given detailed consideration to the proposal and recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $11 million.

Reserve Bank of Australia Business Resumption Site

The tenth report of 2005 presents the Committee’s findings in relation to the proposed construction of a dedicated Business Resumption Site for the Reserve Bank of Australia. The purpose of the proposed work is to provide a facility that, in the event of emergency, will ensure the continuation of functions critical to the operation of Australia’s financial systems.
During the course of its inquiry, the Committee investigated:
the revenue to be generated and/or saved by the project;
issues relating to the relocation and accommodation of staff;
the use of the facility;
electricity supply; and
energy consumption and Green Building initiatives.
The Committee was particularly impressed by the range of energy and water conservation measures proposed for the new facility, and was also pleased with the high quality of the evidence submitted by the Reserve Bank, which assisted greatly in the speedy completion of the inquiry.
The Committee has no hesitation in recommending that the proposed work proceed at the estimated cost of $38 million.
Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to thank my Committee colleagues and all those involved in the five inquiries. I commend the reports to the Senate.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,COMMITTEES,22,2,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-06-22,"—by leave—I, and also on behalf of Senator Nettle, move:
That the Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry, made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, be disallowed.
This disallowance motion is extremely important. Support for it will protect some basic and intrinsic rights the Howard government is intent on stripping away from many thousands of Australians. The motion before the Senate relates to an instrument—a set of flimsy and useless guidelines—regarding the exercising of compliance powers under the Workplace Relations Act which were legislated for under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004, passed by the Senate on 24 June last year.
I take this opportunity to acquaint senators who may not remember the debate last year with some background remarks about why we are debating this issue here today. The parent bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2004, as with most of the Howard government’s industrial relations bills, was not really about the codifying of offences relating to contempt of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; it became a battering ram for the government, which it used to pursue a grab bag of unrelated industrial relations issues, the most important of which—and the reason we are debating these issues today—relates to the granting of coercive powers to the Building Industry Taskforce to extract information from persons and organisations involved in the building and construction industry for investigations undertaken by the task force. Under the regime proposed, officers of the Building Industry Taskforce will have the power to force anyone to answer questions under oath, either in writing or during an interrogation, and to hand over any document relating to a ‘building industry investigation’, as defined. Failure to comply with these requests will be criminal offences attracting penalties of $3,300 for a first offence and $6,600, or six months imprisonment, for the second and subsequent offences.
Until now, the investigative power of the Building Industry Taskforce has been confined to a capacity to demand the production of documents. It should be noted that in a recent consideration of that power, the Federal Court observed that written notices to produce documents directed to individuals that permitted roving inquiries were foreign to the workplace relations of civilised societies as distinct from undemocratic and authoritarian states—a point well made by the Federal Court.
What these powers allowing coercive investigation do is treat the 740,000 workers in the building and construction industry worse than suspected terrorists. The rights afforded under the legislation passed, and by these guidelines which, if not disallowed today, will regulate these powers, are fewer than those we afford to people suspected of being terrorists in this country when they are interrogated by ASIO. These new government sponsored interrogation sessions are to be conducted in secret. Under the guidelines we are debating today, interrogators can direct interviewees not to disclose to anyone other than their lawyer what has happened during the interview—not to family and not to friends. Questions asked must be answered, even where that answer may incriminate the interviewee giving it.
The protection against self-incrimination is an important legal and civil right. It is well entrenched as part of the processes of criminal law. The High Court has described it as a human right which protects personal freedom, privacy and dignity from the power of the state. However, in this case, any residual right to refuse to answer questions during investigations on the basis of the protection against self-incrimination has been removed by this government. This is an outrageous element of the regime, given the importance of that civil right and the serious consequences attached to the potential penalties involved.
What makes it worse is the government’s track record of partisanship in industrial relations disputes and the fact that trade union activity often has a political as well as an industrial element to it. This kind of measure will be used as a tool of political repression, especially when, as will shortly be the case, that form of political expression will become unlawful under this government. This whole proposal is totally unacceptable to me and totally unacceptable to the Labor Party. Nowhere else in the world do such powers exist. My question is: why should they exist here in Australia? It is absolutely beyond me. They certainly should not.
While these powers are not necessary, they fit snugly as another important piece of the government’s anti-union, anti-worker armoury and it makes sense that the government would have its Building Industry Taskforce equipped with them. You see, the granting of these increased powers of coercion to be used against workers in the building and construction industry is part of a considered anti-union, anti-worker government agenda.
Since 2001, the federal government has set up a government appointed and funded witch-hunt of unions and unionists in the industry disguised as a royal commission. It was a $69 million exercise in union bashing with no legal capacity to determine whether anyone had acted unlawfully, yet whose central findings nonetheless included the public identification of those said to have acted unlawfully and, more generally, lawlessly and with a disregard for the rule of law. After all the claims and rhetoric, there has only been one single prosecution stemming from this royal commission.
This government has shown complete disdain for international labour law by refusing to amend legislation that has been consistently ruled to be contrary to international conventions to which Australia is party. Rather, it has introduced further legislation to compound the problem, further denying Australian workers internationally recognised and accepted labour rights.
It has introduced a black list through its national code of practice for the construction industry, whereby parties are banned from government funded projects unless they implement the government’s own ideological brand of industrial relations practices and where entirely arbitrary and discretionary decisions about compliance are made by workplace relations departmental officers without any public accountability, a right to be heard or a right of review for those affected.
It has established a very expensive Building Industry Taskforce, a body inside the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, whose responsibility it is to be the government’s direct eyes and ears inside the industry, investigating and seeking to bring prosecutions against unions, unionists and other workers. But I will come back to that issue in a moment.
It has extended the powers of the task force to allow for compulsory, wide-ranging and secret interrogation sessions involving ordinary workers over industrial issues and expressly overriding any right to refuse to answer questions in the course of such interrogations. It has proudly announced that it will assist employers in the enterprise-bargaining process by abandoning the general rule that legislation that has a detrimental effect on people not be retrospective. It has proposed retrospective legislation that includes heavy penalties directed at unions and employees via the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. And it has conducted all of this in the name of re-introducing adherence to the rule of law in the construction industry.
The Building Industry Taskforce—the body which, if this disallowance motion fails, we will hand more unprecedented coercive powers to—was established on 1 October 2002. It is a section of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, answerable to the minister. It is not a statutory body governed by its own act of parliament. In practice and effect, it is a government sanctioned industrial attack dog assigned to the building and construction industry to do the bidding of this government as directed by this government.
The task force also has the power to secretly spy on Australian workers. According to the task force’s internal policy and guidelines manual, covert recording of conversations and the use of concealed tape recording and video equipment is allowable. It is outrageous and simply not justified that a body in this country is allowed to undertake covert surveillance operations against building and construction workers and unions lawfully and fully funded by the government—and it has indeed been funded by this government.
The Building Industry Taskforce’s total cost to 1 July this year has come in at around $24 million. That figure will double again next year, when the task force gains another $23 million of taxpayer funds to pursue its agenda. In fact, the 2005-06 federal budget contained around $100 million for the establishment of the Australian building commission, the body to be established if and when the Senate passes the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. What a waste of money this will be. It will be yet another grossly financially wasteful and useless government agency, just like the Building Industry Taskforce has been since its inception and like the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry was.
According to the task force’s web site, between 1 October 2002 and April 2005 the Building Industry Taskforce received 2,827 hotline inquiries. This was over a period of 942 days. It equates to around three phone calls per day or around $8,631 per phone call. The task force has conducted 2,734 site visits in this time. This equates to around $8,925 per site visit. The task force claims to have conducted 115 investigations during this time. This equates to around $212,174 per investigation. Of these investigations, only 11 have actually been to court and have had resolution. This equates to around $2,218,181 per completed matter. A further 11 matters are still before the courts at the moment. In total, only 22 matters have been to court at all. These have cost the taxpayer around $1,109,090 each. Penalties recovered through this process have ranged from $500 to $8,500. The final figure for total penalties recovered to date comes in at a grand $39,200—hardly a figure proving the government’s rhetoric that this is an industry dogged by illegal behaviour.
Even justices in courts such as the Federal Court of Australia have made numerous comments and remarks in a number of cases about the operations of the Building Industry Taskforce. For instance, Justice Hughes, in the case of Alfred v CFMEU (NSW Branch), described the task force as—and these are the justice’s words—a ‘shadowy group’. Justice Wilcox, in the case of PG & LJ Smith Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Lanskey Constructions Pty Ltd in 2005 remarked:
… the applicants’ case was beset with legal difficulties that would have required it to be dismissed in any event. Even on the view of the facts propounded by the applicants, their case was hopeless. It was instituted without reasonable cause.
This is a serious issue. These guidelines will grant extended and extensive coercive powers, unseen anywhere else in the world, to use for reasonable cause to a body which acts with unreasonable cause. In the decision in Pine v Seelite Windows & Doors Pty Ltd, Justice Finkelstein remarked:
In these circumstances this action is much ado about nothing. True it is that the laws of the land must be obeyed. It is also true that the Building Industry Taskforce is entitled to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the laws, for which it has some responsibility in enforcing, are complied with. As I have said, not every contravention of every law needs to be punished. Often a caution will suffice. But, as it has been decided that there should be an action, I must deal with it.
The judge went on to say:
Should I impose a penalty on the respondents? No harm has been done to anyone. The contravention was inadvertent. It is unlikely to occur again. The amount of wages involved is insignificant. In these circumstances it would be quite wrong to punish the respondents. Nothing would be achieved by the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. There is no need for a specific deterrent: it is simply not necessary. And if any penalty were imposed it would be so low that it could not act as a general deterrent.
This is another problem. Under the legislation and the guidelines, coercive powers may not be used to pursue investigations into minor or petty matters. But the very body we are expected to give these powers to does exactly that very thing. Even a justice of the Federal Court has said so. The task force has a zero tolerance policy and no matter is considered by them to be minor, petty or trivial. We cannot give these powers to this body. It cannot be trusted to exercise them within the framework of the legislation and the guidelines. It already flouts its legislative parameters. We are talking about stripping away the rights and civil liberties of people. We should also note that these new powers will not be used just against trade unions but also against ordinary workers as the Building Industry Taskforce goes about its business of investigating everyday industrial issues and disputes. It is a disgrace.
One of the government’s major defences for introducing these powers relies on the fact that the ACCC and ASIC have similar powers to coerce information or documents from persons. The major difference between the bodies involved, however, is that the ACCC and ASIC are statutory authorities governed by strict acts of parliament, whereas the Building Industry Taskforce is merely a division of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and is answerable to the minister, not to the parliament.
This regime is not accountable, it is far from transparent and it has already proved it cannot be trusted to act within its remit. As I have said, we are talking here about protecting the basic rights of thousands of workers that would otherwise be stripped away by a harsh anti-worker government. These coercive powers and the guidelines regulating them are an affront to the human rights of workers in the building and construction industry. These powers undoubtedly impinge upon a number of the universal rights afforded to all people, including people who work in the building and construction industry in Australia.
This disallowance motion is extremely important. It goes to the heart of the kind of democracy we want for this country. It goes to the question of the level of human rights and civil liberties we wish to afford to, or are happy to restrict from, particular groups of people in this country. It goes to the heart of issues such as natural justice and the principle of a fair go. It goes to the question of what is considered to be acceptable industrial investigation of workers by a government department in this country.
I do not believe that we should treat building and construction workers in this country like suspected terrorists. I do not believe that we should remove people’s rights in order for the Building Industry Taskforce—a body well known for pursuing minor and petty matters outside of its remit—to investigate them. I do not believe such investigations should be conducted in secrecy and I do not believe people should be compelled to provide self-incriminating evidence. These powers exist nowhere else in the civilised world. They are unfair and unjust. They are not an appropriate way of dealing with and settling industrial issues. The body being vested with these powers cannot be trusted with them. It is a partisan, government-sponsored attack dog that should be dismantled, not enhanced with further coercive powers.
The Democrats had decided to support the legislation at the time of the debate we had in the Senate chamber just on 12 months ago. I understood the arguments that were being put forward by the Democrats at that time. They believed that there may be some serious criminal activity happening in the building industry. The Building Industry Taskforce was thought to need new powers to weed that out. If there were any demonstrated criminal activity in the building industry, the Labor Party would certainly be 100 per cent supportive of weeding it out—in any industry, including the building and construction industry.
But 12 months have gone by. We have not seen any further or ongoing prosecutions except for the one prosecution that has come out of the finding of the Cole royal commission. In the 12 months since we debated this bill, we have not seen lots of prosecutions that have identified criminal activity in the building and construction industry. We have had a task force that has been going around investigating people in the industry and prosecuting trivial and minor matters of noncompliance with the act: in most cases, technical noncompliance. We have not seen the criminal activity that this government would have us believe is present in the building and construction industry.
The bill was also voted on at a time when no-one foresaw that the government would have a majority in the Senate in their own right. We did not foresee that the government would be all powerful and would not have the accountability of the Senate to deal with. Given those new circumstances, I appeal to the Democrats to change their view and support this disallowance motion based on the evidence that has been before the Senate since the time of the legislation.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-22,"—It is absolutely necessary to be vigilant and rigorous in our defence against any and every attempt to remove the fundamental civil rights and liberties that underpin our democracy. As we all know, democracy did not occur overnight. It took many years to develop and has grown out of the struggles of ordinary people working over hundreds of years. But what has taken centuries to obtain can very quickly be taken away.
These guidelines before the Senate today are an attempt to remove such rights and liberties and are therefore an attack on democracy. They single out one group of people, one class of citizen, building and construction workers, and then remove and undermine their rights. Their right to silence, their freedom of speech, their right to privacy, their right to strike and their right to be treated as innocent until proven guilty are all undermined or removed by these guidelines and the practices of the Building Industry Taskforce. This is why the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties President, Cameron Murphy, said this:
... new coercive powers have no parallel in democratic societies. Construction workers have been deprived of fundamental civil liberties which we all take for granted.
Why is the government singling out one particular group of workers? Why is one set of citizens having its rights removed whilst others are not? The government is embarking on an attack on working people and their families in this country with its planned changes to industrial relations. It begins this attack by striking at the strongest union first. So it is attacking a union that has a history of showing solidarity with other workers and groups of workers who, through their solidarity, have ensured that support for progressive trade unionism in their workplace is strong.
Just like the government’s attack on waterfront workers and the MUA, these guidelines are an attempt to break the back of a trade union that will play a crucial role in defending all workers’ conditions in the coming struggles for basic rights in the years to come. The Greens are adamantly opposed to this agenda of both the government and their friends in big business. Just as we supported the MUA in the waterfront dispute, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the CFMEU and other construction unions in their struggle for the right to join a strong and effective trade union and the right to bargain collectively.
The Greens support the campaign by the ACTU for working people and their families who face the loss of their protection from unfair dismissal, a cut to the minium wage and the slashing of award conditions. If they are not disallowed by the Senate today, these guidelines will increase the coercive powers of the Howard government’s industrial police force, the Building Industry Taskforce: a task force that is currently ruthlessly pursuing the government’s agenda of destroying building unions across the country.
These guidelines will enable the Building Industry Taskforce to force any construction worker to answer questions. Refusal to answer questions—this is the removal of the right to silence, for example about what was said at a stop-work meeting—could result in a worker receiving fines of up to $3,300 for a first offence, $6,600 for a second offence or imprisonment for up to six months. For hundreds of years the right to silence has been the bedrock of civil rights. It is recognised in the Magna Carta, which, if any senators have forgotten, is able to be viewed in its original form just upstairs from this chamber in the Members Hall. The right to silence grew out of people’s struggle to free themselves from the prerogative of kings and the authoritarian power of the monarchy.
These guidelines return us to the days of the Star Chamber, when the right against self-incrimination was violated by persecution with the aid of torture. While these guidelines obviously do not allow the use of physical force to extract confessions from the accused or witnesses, the principle is the same. You must talk, or you will go to prison or face draconian fines. You have no right to silence.
We should not be surprised that the government wants to give more powers to the Building Industry Taskforce. The Cole royal commission, which recommended the task force be established, was not able to show any real or substantial problems in the construction industry. We know from evidence by the task force in the Senate estimate hearing on June 3 that only one prosecution has been initiated by the task force as a result of evidence given to the royal commission and that now the task force is not investigating any other issues from the royal commission. An amount of $66 million of taxpayers’ money was spent for one prosecution, which has commenced, and which is yet to be proven. That is the extent to which this government is willing to throw good money after bad pursuing the CFMEU and construction and building workers. The result of the royal commission was proof, if it were ever needed, that the royal commission and the Building Industry Taskforce that came out of it, are a sham police force whose sole role is to pursue the government’s ideological crusade against construction workers.
It is not just the Greens and the CFMEU who are critical of the task force and its predecessor on building sites the Employment Advocate. In February of this year, the Federal Court threw out a case brought before them by the task force. Justice Wilcox described the task force’s case in this way:
... the applicants’ case was beset with legal difficulties that would have required it to be dismissed in any event. Even on the view of the facts propounded by the applicants, their case was hopeless. It was instituted without reasonable cause.
The task force’s snooping on workers’ bank accounts was described by Justice Marshall in the Federal Court in this way:
Roving inquiries may be an apposite expression for broad ranging inquiries into alleged tax fraud and the like under income tax legislation but such notices are foreign to workplace relations of civilised societies, as distinct from undemocratic and authoritarian states.
So why does the government want to give new powers to the Building Industry Taskforce at this time? I will explain. It relates to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005
In a couple of months the government will use its absolute control of the parliament and the Senate to ram through the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill. That bill will effectively ban the right to strike except on very limited grounds and it will increase the already huge fines which workers and unions may have to pay to as much as $110,000. For example, if there is a stop-work meeting because a worker has been killed on the job, the CFMEU and other unions represented on the building site could then be fined $110,000 for every company or subcontractor on the site.
On average, one building and construction worker is killed every week in my home state of New South Wales. Just over a week ago, a young building worker, Mark Gallace, suffocated on a work site in Chipping Norton in the western suburbs of Sydney. He was working for SACO Builders Pty Ltd. He was a young man of 24, the only son of Italian migrants who came to this country 30 years ago. He was engaged to be married in August and the reception had already been booked. There were over 900 people at his funeral.
The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill, the government’s legislation, would mean that, if workers gather together on the site to grieve and remember their workmate, to have a minute’s silence for workers like Mark Gallace, the union would be penalised. But, worst of all, this legislation does not come into force at the time that the bill is passed. The government has made the legislation retrospective, from 9 March this year. This is another attack on fundamental civil rights and an attempt to intimidate the CFMEU and other construction unions into not protesting against these laws and these guidelines.
Only two weeks ago, the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, speaking about the government’s refusal to seek David Hicks’s return from Guantanamo Bay, told ABC television ‘we don’t intend to make criminal laws retrospectively’. It appears this is not a steadfast principle that stays in place when the government wants to make laws that are designed to attack one group of people in this community: construction and building workers. The reason the government wants these guidelines in force now is so that it can set the Building Industry Taskforce to work, forcing building workers to give evidence about stop-work meetings and other union activities so that they can be prosecuted retrospectively under the government’s new construction bill that it is seeking to bring in when the Senate changes over. This is the government’s immoral purpose which should be opposed by the Senate today.
The Greens are proud to be moving to disallow these guidelines with Senator Marshall. They are an attack on the basic civil rights of building workers in this country. They are part of the government’s campaign to undermine wages and conditions of ordinary workers and to destroy trade unionism. They have no proper place in a fair and equitable system of industrial relations or civilised democracy and they should be disallowed.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MOTIONS,28,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-22,"—In 2003, after a lengthy and expensive royal commission into the building and construction industry, the government introduced two bills to introduce industry specific laws and an industry specific regulator with far-reaching powers. At the time of the introduction of the bills, and many times after, I told the Senate that the position of the Democrats was that we are beholden neither to business nor to unions and that we would evaluate this issue on its merits. I also said that we thought that there were problems in the building and construction industry at both the employer and the employee levels, including criminality and corruption, and that it is our job and the Senate’s job to assess what the solutions might be. I said that the Democrats would be even handed and fair in our assessment and that the Democrats wanted improved outcomes for the building and construction industry for both employers and employees and that we would not be party to any ideological agenda.
With Labor and the Greens support, we initiated a Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee inquiry into the building and construction industry, encompassing the royal commission findings, the two bills and other matters relevant to the building and construction industry. Following that inquiry, which did find that there were substantial problems in the building and construction industry, we produced a 63-page considered minority report. In that report, we rejected the building and construction industry improvement bills for clearly enunciated reasons. Our belief was that they could not be salvaged or amended. We argued that setting up the building and construction industry with different rights and obligations to other industries goes against the basic principle of law, which is that the law must apply equally to everyone. However, like the Cole royal commission, the Senate inquiry into the building and construction industry bills obtained evidence of non-compliance with the law by employees and employers in areas of industrial, tax, corporate, criminal and state law.
For example, construction accounted for up to 15 per cent of all workplace fatalities, even though that industry employs only six per cent of the total work force. The Australian Taxation Office submitted that the industry hides up to 40 per cent of its income. The Australian Taxation Office was then investigating 550 cases of phoenix companies and since then many more have been exposed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The majority of complaints made to the Office of the Employment Advocate regarding freedom of association, coercion in certified agreement making, right of entry misuse and abuse for union organisers and strike pay were in relation to the building and construction industry. Building and construction ranked among the four industry sectors with the highest level of disputes. Industrial law, tax law, corporate law, criminal law and state law were and are being poorly enforced in the building and construction industry.
These problems are not specific to the building and construction industry, but we did accept that this industry needed particular attention. So how did we address that without going to the full range of powers envisaged in the two bills that we had rejected? We argued at the time that the problems in this and other industries could be much better addressed by enforcing existing law; increasing penalties, which we did last June; and by the creation of an independent national workplace relations regulator. We are of the opinion that greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations law is desirable of itself, and that folding currently ineffective departmental state and federal inspectorates, the Employment Advocate and so on into a standard regulatory body would considerably advance regulatory practice and industrial relations in Australia. We argued that if it was good enough for there to be a national regulator for tax, which is the ATO; for finance, which is the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority; for consumer affairs and corporations, which is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and for competition purposes, which is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, then it was the right thing to do the same for workplace relations.
However, to set up such a body would require considerable consultation and therefore time and would need the full support of the parliament and of the government. We could not completely ignore the problems raised in the industry and we were prepared to work constructively on the problems. The building industry task force existed at that time, and it expressed concerns to the Senate committee that it was unable to pursue breaches of the law effectively. It gave evidence, which is confirmed elsewhere, that people in the industry are reluctant to provide information for fear of victimisation. That is not in every respect; it would be entirely and absolutely wrong to regard the building and construction industry as universally riddled with problems. But pockets of it are indeed a problem.
The building industry task force advised us they were restricted from working effectively with other law enforcement agencies. The Democrats agreed to move amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 that would increase the task force’s ability to gather information in pursuit of breaches of the Workplace Relations Act. The powers would also enable the building industry task force to share information with other agencies. Some members of the Labor Party and the CFMEU have run a scare campaign over these new powers. But the fact is they felt very strongly about the Building Industry Task Force regardless of those powers—I have seen the posters and vilification to which it has been subjected. The fact is that there is no power to detain, and the person required to answer questions has the right to legal representation and cannot self-incriminate. That is quite unlike, I might say, some of the ASIO laws that Labor has supported. I recall Senator Bartlett’s speech to the third reading of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003. He said:
The ASIO legislation enables any Australian to be taken into secret custody for up to a week and to be interrogated. They have no right to silence. They have to prove that they do not have information or face five years in prison. They can be denied access to an interpreter. They can be interrogated in the absence of a lawyer. They do not even have to be suspected of a crime; they need only have information ASIO thinks might be useful and that the person should provide.
Labor, the very people who condemn these limited building industry task force powers, supported those draconian ASIO powers. The Greens did not, I might add, and have been consistent on that front with the Democrats.
The powers do not allow the building industry task force to tap phones, to make secret recordings or to detain people. The amendments do not increase the task force’s power to initiate or intervene in prosecutions. The powers are limited to requiring a person to provide information, to produce documents or to answer questions, and are based on section 155(7) of the Trade Practices Act. It would be very wrong to regard these powers as the same as those applying to terrorists. It is emotive and misleading to draw that comparison. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Tax Commissioner, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission all have similar information gathering powers, and indeed much wider and more onerous and coercive powers, such as search and entry and prosecution powers. They were all supported by Labor and the Greens at the time of their introduction—and by the Democrats as far as I recall.
These authorities already apply these extensive, coercive and intrusive powers carried in the hands of the ACCC, the Tax Commissioner, APRA, ASIC and, to some extent, Customs. They already apply to workers, employees, subcontractors and participants in the building and construction industry. It confuses me: why does Labor support extremely onerous ACCC, ATO, APRA and ASIC powers, which are much more onerous than the BIT powers, and oppose the much lesser and far more limited powers which we are discussing here? It is not clear to me and it seems very inconsistent. To ensure that the powers could not be abused, the Democrats included mechanisms in the legislation to ensure that the powers are used responsibly and there are reasonable grounds for information gathering; that the Commonwealth Ombudsman will conduct annual reviews of the way they are being used and can also investigate complaints about how they are used; that if the investigators act inappropriately they are subject to the penalties under the Public Service Act 1999 and the Crimes Act 1914; that the powers must not be used for minor or petty investigations; and that the powers are sunset at three years.
On top of this, the Democrats moved an amendment for the creation of guidelines for how the information gathering powers could be used. That amendment, drafted as a disallowable instrument, which is what we are discussing today, ensured that the new information gathering powers could not be gained until the guidelines were developed and agreed upon by the Democrats. The government consulted with the Democrats on the guidelines, and we in turn consulted with Labor and the union movement. Normally, regulations become law once they are gazetted. In this case, the amendment moved by the Democrats meant that the guidelines would not come into force until after 15 sitting days had expired from the date they were tabled. Further, a notice of motion to disallow the regulation may be given, which has happened today. Any such notice of motion must be resolved or withdrawn within 15 sitting days. Since the regulations were tabled, back in August 2004, we have had an election and one of the shortest sitting periods in recent parliamentary history, and we now find ourselves in the remarkable position—and I doubt that anyone envisaged it—that, almost one year to the day since the amendments were first moved, the powers have still not been enacted. But this is the last day.
I want to say two prime things. The first is that it is absolutely wrong to mislead people as to the powers and the extent of those powers. It induces unnecessary fear and reaction. The second is that it is absolutely right to ensure the greatest vigilance to ensure that powers that are available are not abused—and that applies whether it is the ACCC, ASIC, the ATO or the BIT. I say with respect to this regulation that the Democrats honour our commitments. We made a commitment at the time to put it through, and we will honour that commitment. We believe that problems of lawlessness by both employers and unions still exist in pockets of the building and construction industry. We believe that new information gathering powers under the restraints of the guidelines, if used responsibly, will still produce very effective outcomes and hopefully will mean that some of the more draconian views that the government have in mind with respect to coming legislation might not be necessary or thought necessary. With those points, I indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting the motion to disallow the guidelines.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MOTIONS,28,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-06-22,"—The government opposes this Green-Labor accord motion. If anyone still needed proof of the extreme left-wing nature of the Greens, they got it by the bucketload courtesy of Senator Nettle’s contribution. The motion before the Senate today represents nothing more than the ALP and the Australian Greens seeking to reargue a debate that was finalised a year ago. Those guidelines flow from the passage of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004. That act provided new compliance powers for use in the building industry.
During the Senate consideration of the bill, the government agreed to amendments that provided that the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations must use guidelines governing the exercise of the power. Further, the powers cannot be exercised until the guidelines have passed the disallowance period. So the Green-Labor accord decided to delay this motion until the very last day so as to defer the possible introduction of the guidelines—and, as Senator Murray has indicated, that means that in total we are now about one year after the event.
These guidelines are modelled on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission guidelines for the exercise of their powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The guidelines form just one part of the comprehensive framework governing the use of the powers, including the provisions of part 5A of the Workplace Relations Act and directions issued by the secretary of DEWR to the director of the building industry task force. In addition, the Ombudsman is required to conduct an annual review of the use of compliance powers and report to the parliament. Taken together, these impose substantial obligations on those exercising the power. The powers cannot be used unless other avenues available to the task force to obtain information voluntarily or under other provisions of the Workplace Relations Act have been pursued or are not considered adequate to obtain the necessary information. The guidelines make it clear that the powers cannot be used for minor or petty purposes. The powers cannot be used by the task force unless the secretary of DEWR approves.
These guidelines have been subject to detailed scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Following extensive correspondence between the committee and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the concerns of the committee have been addressed and its disallowance motion has been withdrawn. If the Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is satisfied that the guidelines provide sufficient checks and balances on the exercise of the powers, then this should be sufficient for the Senate.
This disallowance motion is not about the merits of the guidelines. It is about the ALP seeking to stymie the legislation being put into effect by trying to prevent the building industry task force from exercising its powers. However, the need for such powers was demonstrated by the royal commission into the building and construction industry. The Cole royal commission found that the building and construction industry was rife with illegal activity, thuggery and intimidation—and this is what the Labor-Greens accord is trying to protect by the disallowance motion today.
Many people are currently reluctant to take action to address unlawful conduct or provide information about such conduct for fear of retribution. For example, from 1 October 2002 to 31 December 2003, the task force had to drop more than one-third of its investigations because complainants were unwilling to provide information and make statements. That is undoubtedly something the Greens-Labor accord in this place seems to approve of. The government is committed to ensuring that the rule of law applies in the building industry. These powers will help achieve this goal.
The reality is that the ALP and the Australian Greens do not object to the guidelines. They object to the existence of the powers themselves. The parliament has already considered this issue and determined that these powers should be available—and they are not excessive powers, as Senator Murray so eloquently pointed out. The Senate should not allow itself to be used to defeat the intention of the parliament in passing this legislation. I urge all honourable senators to oppose and reject the disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MOTIONS,28,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-06-22,"—I was not going to close the debate with a speech, but, given what the minister has just said, even when he is reading from a brief he can still demonstrate total ignorance of industrial relations reality. I just want to put on the record—in case anyone believes the nonsense and the minister’s rhetoric regarding industrial relations—that the motives that he has accused the Labor Party and, I am sure, the Greens of having are flatly rejected. I thought it was important to put that on the record. If, instead of contributing to the debate in a meaningful way, he wants to give the government’s normal rhetoric, he can, but it is rejected. It is, frankly, quite stupid.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-22,"—I move:
That the provisions of the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by Thursday, 23 June 2005.
That the committee have leave to meet during the sitting of the Senate on Thursday, 23 June 2005 for the purpose of considering the bill.
We have heard almost 24 hours worth of speeches about people departing this place. The vast majority of them emphasised the importance of the Senate as a house of review and the necessity to ensure that the Senate keeps up that task. This motion refers to ensuring that there is at least a minimal opportunity for a Senate committee to scrutinise a piece of legislation surrounding one of the most contentious and important issues in Australia today: migration detention.
The Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 was introduced into the House of Representatives just yesterday, following an agreement announced by the Prime Minister at about 4.30 pm on Friday afternoon last week. It was debated last night and today in the House of Representatives—I presume it passed through there; I have not heard—and it is intended to be put on for debate tomorrow in this chamber.
As someone whom I trust senators would recognise has followed issues surrounding this for quite a long period of time—basically since the day I came into this chamber eight years ago—I have seen a number of times when legislation has been pushed through as a bandaid to deal with a political fix or to grasp a political opportunity, and people have paid the price down the track because of a lack of recognition of what was actually being agreed to at the time. Many of those pieces of legislation have covered the migration area.
I am not going to put myself or the Democrats in a position where we are going to be accused of holding up this legislation and therefore be accused of keeping people behind razor wire for longer than they would otherwise be because we would not pass it speedily and instantaneously on the demand of the government, so we are not going to stand in the way of it being brought on for debate tomorrow night. But I do believe that the Senate would be served well and better, and the public would be served better—I even dare to suggest that poor old long-suffering DIMIA bureaucrats would be served better—if there were an opportunity to more clearly explore the detail and the reality behind the content of this legislation and what it will mean in practice. Frankly, I believe it will also save the Senate time during the debate on the legislation.
The purpose of Senate legislation committees is to explore the detailed legislation outside this chamber, ask questions of relevant departments and, ideally, ask questions of people in the community who may have expertise or an interest in it or would be affected by it. We will not have that opportunity in this case, but at least questions can be asked of the relevant department and officers about the specifics behind it before we get into this chamber, before we pass it and before it is inflicted on the public and the people that it is going to impact upon.
There are many examples where information that has come to light during Senate committee hearings has impacted on ensuring the legislation is improved or repaired. If not that, at least inadvertent stuff-ups in how it is implemented are avoided by questions becoming clearer in the relatively objective and dispassionate arena of Senate committee inquiries. Frankly, it cuts across the sentiments that have been widely expressed by a number of people over the last 24 hours to pass up the opportunity to at least have a few hours with DIMIA officials to go through what reality is involved in this legislation. We can speak on what the legislation has in it at more length tomorrow night, but it is relatively straightforward in that it deals with only a couple of issues.
One of those issues is giving the minister for immigration yet another discretionary power and creating yet another DIMIA euphemism to add to the hundred others that are already in place. We now have people being moved into community arrangements. They were called ‘community detention arrangements’ in the Prime Minister’s statement last Friday and they are now called something else in the legislation, but it basically means people in the community. Under what circumstances, the detail surrounding it and how the administrative procedures will operate are all things that nobody is clear on, beyond the general presumption that it will mean that people will move out from behind the razor wire to somewhere somewhat more comfortable. What conditions will be attached to them and how those conditions will be determined—all of those related matters—are still up in the air. Those questions can be asked of the minister tomorrow night in the committee stage here in the chamber. To save time, I think it would be better to ask them in the legislation committee outside of this chamber so that less of that needs to be gone through in detail tomorrow.
I presume that the government is not supporting this quite reasonable proposal, but I certainly hope that we do not get complaints tomorrow night about the number of questions that are asked of the minister. I am probably being naive, because I am sure that—as has often happened in the past—when you do ask questions in the chamber about how this stuff is supposed to work in practice, after a couple of questions the irritation level rises and you get the typical government response: ‘Why are you asking me all these questions? It’s our legislation. We’ll implement it however we see fit. Stop wasting time.’ To labour the point, as we have heard from a whole range of people over the last 24 hours, querying how legislation is going to work in practice, asking questions and getting it on the record from the people who are charged with implementing it is not a waste of time; it is in the public interest. I suggest that it is in the government’s interest as well.
It seems to me that the circumstance of rushing any bill through this place is unfortunate, let alone a bill on an area that is already known to be widely dysfunctional and creating manifest injustices. I suggest that to do so without grasping a limited but nonetheless potentially very valuable opportunity to question the relevant officials about how it will work in practice borders on recklessness and a dereliction of duty. I think it is a serious matter to pass up the opportunity, however rushed, however limited and however inadequate, to have a committee examination of this, simply because it is a done deal and it is going to happen anyway. The attitude is: ‘Let’s just put it through and get it over and done with.’
It is that sort of attitude that has led to the total mess and massive injustices that we have in the migration area. There is no willingness to confront the imperfections—to be polite—that are contained within the legislation. I have been involved in at least two Senate inquiries, going back five years, that have highlighted manifest problems with the way ministerial discretion is exercised. There are problems to do with not only inefficiencies and inconsistencies but also political interference and political atmospherics affecting the decisions, as well as all of the broader problems. Both of those inquiries have produced significant recommendations. One of them produced mostly unanimous recommendations, including from the two Liberal senators on the committee. None of them have been followed up by this government. Instead we have had a widening of the ministerial discretion power that has been shown to work so ineffectively.
This legislation adds another bandaid to the ever teetering, ever more incoherent Migration Act. I will not comment on the bill, but I do think that, because of the rushed nature of it and the debate about whether it resolves the so-called issue of extended detention and whether there needs to be more change, it is important to take the opportunity, before the legislation is railroaded through this place rather than after, to clarify some of the issues on the record, under parliamentary privilege, in the important arena of the Senate committee system. I think that the least the Senate could do on such an important issue that has dominated the concerns of so many Australians over a long period of time would be to show the courtesy of having even a perfunctory examination of some of the real issues of public policy that arise in this legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,31,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-22,"—Yesterday the Senate established an inquiry into the operation of the Migration Act, referring it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I was pleased to cosponsor that motion, along with my colleagues Senator Bartlett and Senator Nettle. However, Labor cannot support the motion that we have before us. This motion seeks to refer the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Labor do not support this motion, on the grounds of both true logic and commonsense.
I will start with the argument on the ground of commonsense. As it stands, the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 does not go far enough. That is clear. In the House of Representatives, Labor has already moved further amendments to the bill to bring about a better series of reforms. The bill represents policy on the run. The delay between the Prime Minister’s announcement and the introduction of this bill most likely represents the Office of Parliamentary Counsel burning the midnight oil in a desperate attempt to draft the Howard-Georgiou compromise, if we can call it that. The motion we have before us would supplement this furious policy on the run with an inquiry on the run, and what purpose does that serve? It seems that the purpose would be to drag DIMIA bureaucrats before the committee for a couple of hours, when it is more than likely that the advisers of Howard and Georgiou came up with this bill and that the drafting instructions were given to the parliamentary counsel. I am not convinced by what Senator Bartlett has proposed. I do not think that there would be any great service in questioning DIMIA officials in relation to the bill.
The Senate Committee of the Whole will provide an opportunity, as Senator Bartlett has correctly pointed out, to ask questions. There is also the second reading debate, which allows senators to put their views. I am sure that Senator Bartlett will contribute to that debate. In addition, the government can take on board those issues that Senator Bartlett has raised this evening and will raise during the second reading debate, in its summary of that debate. The government can contribute some of the answers to Senator Bartlett then.
We have a proposal from Senator Bartlett which would effectively lead to a rushed inquiry. We would not have to go through the usual processes which the Senate excels at—that is, calling the inquiry, advertising the inquiry, receiving submissions and conducting public hearings interstate and here in Canberra. That is the type of inquiry that the Senate does so well. None of that can happen in the frame that we have unless Senator Bartlett is willing to stop the bill and quite possibly keep some people in detention centres longer than would otherwise be the case. I know that Senator Bartlett, who has championed this cause admirably, does not believe that to be the best path. He told a rally on Friday that although the government’s changes were a con job ‘anything that helps a single person is a step forward’.
On the other hand, this bill will go through the normal Committee of the Whole procedure. Senator Bartlett can be assured of that. He has foreshadowed that he will take the opportunity to ask questions of the minister in that debate. On the ground of commonsense, it is clear that this motion should have been rethought and withdrawn. Given that we are now having a debate on this motion, I could have appealed to Senator Bartlett’s sense of logic, but, as I said, yesterday Senator Bartlett supported an inquiry into the Migration Act.
In the face of the government’s refusal to establish an inquiry with full judicial powers, it has become the Senate’s duty and responsibility to expose the incompetency of the minister and her administration of the portfolio. This inquiry will examine in detail the processing and assessment of visa applications, migration detention, and the deportation of people from Australia. It will also look at activities and involvement of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other government agencies in the deportation of people from Australia. It will look at the adequacy of health care, including mental health care, and other services and assistance provided to people in immigration detention. It will also look at the outsourcing of management and service provisions at immigration detention centres. The report is due to be given to the Senate on 8 November 2005. It will go through the process of being advertised, calling for submissions and having various interested bodies make those submissions. The committee will hear from those who give submissions. It will have the opportunity of taking evidence from them and they will have the benefit of Senate privilege.
That will of course deal with that particular Migration Act. But the subject of today’s motion is the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005—a bill to amend the Migration Act 1958. That means that when it passes the parliament this bill will become part of that act—that is, the same act that is already under review. So to clarify the position of Senator Bartlett, as I understand it he wants a short period to question—a rush job to review what are stopgap measures now—and a second review later that will cover the same territory. We will have the opportunity during that longer inquiry to examine those issues if Senator Bartlett wants to. The first review—that is, the inquiry proposed by this motion—is therefore illogical and probably now redundant, on two grounds. Firstly, we will have the opportunity tomorrow to ask those questions of the minister. The department, as I have indicated, is probably not that helpful, given that it was probably a Howard-Georgiou compromise. Secondly, we have already agreed to a review of the Migration Act—it was passed through this parliament a short while ago. As a result of long service on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee and on immigration matters, I do understand Senator Bartlett’s concerns but we do not think this motion is the best way of advancing them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,31,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-22,"—I rise in the absence of any contributions from the government or anyone else on this matter. At least the Labor Party had the courtesy to outline their position, as much as I do not agree with it. It is worth putting a couple of things on the record about the motion before the chamber. Frankly, I cannot see the so-called commonsense or logic here. What seems to be suggested is that we have got an inquiry up for a Senate committee to look at the whole act, so it does not matter if we pass another piece of flawed law into that act in the meantime, because we can just add that to the mess that we are looking at. As this area more than just about any other has shown us, the trouble is that once you put these changes in it is very hard to reverse them. So what we have seen is one patch-up job after another to fix up the unworkability of what has been rushed through. It does call to mind previous decisions by the Labor Party to refuse committee inquiries on other migration bills back in 2001. There was even one occasion when a bill was before a committee but was voted through this chamber anyway, despite the fact that it was still before a Senate committee and was to be examined.
There is also the very real risk, which I think is growing more and more by the day, based on signals around this place, that there is no guarantee the government will even cooperate with the inquiry that has been set up. There are indications that the inquiry that has been set up to look at the serious public policy questions about the Chen Yonglin matter is not being cooperated with by government senators. Of course, if they can avoid cooperating with any inquiries over the July break they can get back here in August and close down all the inquiries that are underway that they do not like, and this government has shown clearly that they do not like public examinations in any way, shape or form in the migration area. So all of the things that the Senate quite rightly should be doing, which Senator Ludwig has alluded to, will not happen.
We have an opportunity now to examine this area at least to some degree, although in an unsatisfactory manner. To pass up that opportunity is to not recognise the seriousness of the matters that we are dealing with. It does not recognise the difference between asking questions of the minister in a committee stage of the legislation when it has already passed through the second reading and asking questions of department officials outside of this place—we cannot ask questions of department officials in a committee stage in this chamber, and I am not suggesting we should be able to. Whilst departmental officials, particularly from that department, are quite practised at avoiding questions, they do at least make an attempt to answer them, more so than government ministers in this place who, when they have decided they are not going to answer, respond with politics or, in some cases, do not even bother standing up and responding at all—they refuse to give any response.
So, while there may be limitations on the fullness of responses that departmental officials give in Senate committee hearings, they nonetheless do have a record of giving more detailed responses than government ministers do in this place if they decide that they cannot be bothered to respond or they do not want to. The government have clearly shown any number of times in this area that they are not interested in giving more detailed responses. We will test that again tomorrow night. In response to their refusal to agree to this very modest request, I say to others, ‘Please do not complain tomorrow night about how long the debate on the legislation is taking in the committee stage when we have to ask all the questions that we could otherwise have asked outside of this chamber in a Senate committee hearing.’ People can note in advance that I will not be impressed if I hear any comments or complaints along those lines tomorrow night—that is, about how long the debate might be taking.
It is true that this legislation is the result of negotiations between government politicians: Mr Howard, Mr Georgiou and his colleagues. I take the opportunity to note the strength of their work in this area, but it will not be implemented by Mr Howard on a day-to-day basis. Quite frankly, given what is on the public record about how this area operates, the vast bulk of the changes will not be implemented by the immigration minister either, who is probably still coming to grips with what has been agreed to over her head by the Prime Minister. The changes will still be implemented on a day-to-day basis by DIMIA officers. I remind the Senate that, according to the Prime Minister’s own statement, the overall management of these changes will be overseen by an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
This whole process—part of which is reflected in the legislation—will be overseen by public servants, including those in the Prime Minister’s own department, yet somehow we have the suggestion that questioning them about how they believe it will operate is redundant or irrelevant, because it has all been decided by politicians and they are the ones who will decide how it operates. Frankly, I think that is a remarkable and bizarre suggestion. I made it quite clear in my first contribution to this debate that this is not about holding up the legislation. I do not think it is a satisfactory arrangement. Senator Ludwig kindly quoted my comments to the rally. I did not see him there—you should come along next time, Senator Ludwig—but there were some Labor Party people there with ‘Labor for refugees’ T-shirts on. I have not seen you wearing one lately, Senator Ludwig, but I am sure you have one in your bottom drawer. It is nice to know that people were listening to my words.
Anybody getting out of detention is good, even if it is from razor wire detention to community detention. It is usually better, although it does depend on the conditions attached to it, and that is one question that needs to be asked. But that fact should not be used as a reason to say, ‘We’d better pass this legislation because it will mean a few people will get out of detention, and we’ll just have to accept all of the inherent bad law components attached to it as part of the price we have to pay for getting a few people out of detention now and alleviating the pressure on the government and assisting those cases.’ In speaking to this motion I said that we are not about holding up the bill. We will debate it tomorrow night—as much as I am uncomfortable with that—because I am not going to be accused of keeping someone in detention any longer than they need to be.
I remind the Senate of a similar parallel to the start of this whole very unsatisfactory process that has led to a lot of suffering on the part of a lot of innocent people, and that was the legislation to provide safe haven visas for people when the Kosovo conflict was under way. There was a big push from the public to do something. Night after night, they could see those people out in the fields in Kosovo, desperately needing refuge, and they were pressuring the government to do something and the government was resisting. Rather than take the obvious step of accepting a group of people here—even back in 1998, I think—the government could not cope with the idea of bringing people in who might then decide to stay without the government having control over the situation. So overnight the government created this special safe haven visa that said that we would let people come here, but only if they signed something saying they would go away again when we told them to.
The Senate was placed in the impossible position of either pointing to all of the inherent dangers and flaws in that process—frankly, it was a forerunner to the temporary protection visas—such as the problems of only letting people in here who were fleeing desperate situations, so obviously they did not have any meaningful decision making or voluntary choice about the matter, or saying, ‘You either stay in this completely unsafe, horrendous situation or you sign this piece of paper in front of you and get some safety.’ Of course you are going to sign the piece of paper and then worry about what will happen next.
The obvious unsatisfactory nature of that visa was quite clear, but the Senate was in a position where, if we tried to amend the bill or hold it up at all, the government would say, ‘You’re preventing these people in desperate situations from getting help.’ So the impossible politics of that situation meant that the Senate agreed to pass the bill. Many people in the Australian community have suffered and are still suffering from the lack of control over their lives that resulted from that decision. It was fine for some—they came here, it was fine for them to go back and it all worked fine. But, inevitably, some people did not believe it was safe to go back. The government wanted to send them back and put that continual pressure on them. There were lots of different quick fixes, side deals and short-term arrangements to deal with the political and public pressure on those people who had already suffered a lot by being forced back. And there are still people here today in Australia, many years later, who are still suffering as a consequence of accepting that quick-fix solution because of the impossible position we were placed in.
We will be in that position again tomorrow in passing this bill, and we will do it again. I suspect there will be victims of the process again, but the alternative is worse. But, as a result of that, instead of Labor saying, ‘There’s no point even looking at it; there’s no point in talking to the public servants and department officials who are going to be implementing it,’ it probably would be useful to them because, quite frankly, they probably have not figured out or heard what is going on yet, given how quickly this legislation has been pushed together. Even if this were another area of law that was not so notorious for being a shambles, this process would raise question marks about putting together this sort of thing so quickly in such a politicised atmosphere and then just expecting some poor department officials to administer it, let alone a department with so many question marks over it.
Frankly, it is a missed opportunity, but I think they are very dubious arguments put forward by the opposition in relation to it. I suspect it is more the case that the quicker this debate is over with for the Labor Party the better. We all know the embarrassments they are suffering with the inadequacies of their shadow minister in this area. Mr Laurie Ferguson has a lot of knowledge about immigration issues, but he clearly does not grasp where this debate is at at the moment, the very real and major problems that people are facing and the serious problems with the whole law and the act as it stands.
The Labor Party are caught in the dilemma of having massively varying opinions within their own caucus about how to deal with this issue. Quite frankly, they are left in a situation where the government is looking more compassionate and more coherent on this issue than the Labor Party, which is quite extraordinary. That is unfortunate, given how many people within the Labor Party care about this issue and are working on this issue—not least the people I referred to earlier who were wearing the T-shirts I referred to earlier. One has to think that that is the real agenda here: ‘Let’s not have any more questions highlighting what a mess it all is and Labor’s incoherence as part of that; let’s just get the debate on, get the bill passed, get it over with and hope people start talking about something else—anything that does not highlight further what a shambles the Labor Party are on this issue.’
It is a completely unsatisfactory situation, and I think this latest decision to refuse even the most basic examination of an important area of public policy—an area that has already been shown to be dysfunctional—is a very disappointing and unsatisfactory decision. There is a general convention in this place—or there used to be, and I suspect it will disappear even further in coming months—where, if a senator believed a bill was worth sending to a committee, even for a very quick examination, people usually agreed to that. That is what the committee process is about—examining in the sort of detail that is not appropriate for debate in this chamber in the committee stage. Whilst this is an unusual situation, it is still an example where that convention has been ignored. There is no alternative that could have been put forward, other than this extremely truncated inquiry.
Frankly, I think this is an unhealthy step in terms of the lack of recognition of the Senate’s role—let alone, on a range of other levels, that the Labor Party will not support this. It makes it all the harder to argue in the future for the necessity of examining legislation when parties take exemptions from those conventions when it is politically convenient for them. We will have to make those arguments much more forcefully, I fear, when the government gets control of this Senate. This sort of stepping back from that simple principle on this occasion, for what I can only presume are political reasons, is not going to help in relation to that convention and the important requirement that we all still have to ensure the Senate retains its strength as a proper house of review.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-06-22,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
Mr President, I seek leave to speak to Report of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee on Indigenous education funding.
It is important to note that this is a unanimous report—it has the support of the Government Senators on the Committee.
It is in fact a report that unanimously condemns the Government’s policy development and implementation in relation to key Indigenous education programs.
The Committee found—particularly at its hearings at public and private schools—a clear pattern of poor program design and administrative bungling.
These failures of government have led to mistrust in communities and the disengagement of Indigenous parents. The Committee in fact found that:
It is difficult to escape the conclusion that in this instance the process of change has alienated people affected by it.
The Government’s prior record in relation to Indigenous education was one of neglect. Now serious mismanagement has been added to its repertoire.
Broader approach to Indigenous affairs
It is important that this dismal finding is placed in the broader context of the Government’s approach to Indigenous affairs and reconciliation.
Senators will be aware that Reconciliation Australia recently held a workshop in Old Parliament House to mark Reconciliation week. The workshop was attended by many prominent Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
Some of the key players in Reconciliation Australia clearly wanted to use this workshop to establish a new era of so-called bipartisanship in Indigenous affairs—a bipartisanship based on accepting the Government’s rhetoric and the Government’s actions without criticism.
The Prime Minister also wanted to use the opportunity to trumpet his new commitment to Reconciliation.
The reactions were mixed.
Can we really be expected to believe that the Prime Minister and his government are finally going take the lead in the movement towards reconciliation?
I don’t think it is unreasonable to be sceptical.
The Coalition’s record, both in its nine years of government and prior to that when it was in opposition, is not one that would inspire Indigenous Australians to immediate trust and goodwill.
To date, the Coalition, by and large, has shown little capacity to empathise with Indigenous Australians and to recognise the lasting impact of dispossession and the destruction of families caused by the policies of previous governments.
The Prime Minister’s failure—and that of his Government—is essentially a failure of imagination.
In his Redfern speech, Paul Keating challenged non-Indigenous Australians to put themselves in the shoes of Indigenous people.
Tellingly, after discussing some of the injustices suffered by Indigenous Australians, Keating said:
Imagine if we had suffered the injustice and then were blamed for it.
We all know that the Prime Minister is a master of dog whistle politics.
Over nine long years in government, his aim has not been to build understanding of past injustices and the underlying reasons for the disadvantage currently faced by Indigenous Australians.
He has instead—ever so subtly—directed the blame at Indigenous Australians themselves.
This Government has been in place for nine long years.
It is unreasonable for the Prime Minister to expect that Indigenous Australians—or indeed the Opposition—will simply forget the Coalition’s past statements and actions and accept its new-found commitment to reconciliation.
Indeed, it is arrogant in the extreme to expect such trust to be placed in a Government which has not yet earned it.
The Prime Minister and his Government must understand this, and work to build the trust of Indigenous Australians, if they are to have any hope of leading the country to reconciliation.
Unfortunately, their failures in designing and implementing changes to Indigenous education program are just another example of their failure to engage with, to trust—and to win the trust of—Indigenous Australians.
The impact of dispossession, etc
As I have said before, there is no doubt that the Government is pursuing a new balance of power in Indigenous affairs.
There is no doubt that the Government’s broad approach is one of assimilation.
The Prime Minister has been consistent in his view that Indigenous Australians should be, in his words “treated equally”.
What he really means is “treated the same”.
The fact is that the impacts of dispossession, marginalisation and racism are very real. They cannot be ignored in the debate on how to address Indigenous disadvantage.
To simply treat Indigenous children, families and communities in “the same” as everyone else will be to perpetuate the disadvantage that they face.
This was recognised by the many Indigenous leaders to speak at the Reconciliation Australia workshop—including Noel Pearson, who spoke eloquently about the impact of racism on his people.
New research has also drawn out the lasting impacts of dispossession and the destruction of Indigenous families.
Research by the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in Western Australia has shown how the impacts of the removal of children from their families reach into the second, third and fourth generation.
The Institute’s founding Director, Professor Fiona Stanley, outlined some of these findings at the launch of the National Day of Healing on 25 May this year. She gave an impassioned speech in which she said:
I believe that all Australians acknowledge that Aboriginal people have on average, worse outcomes in health and social situations. I do not believe that most acknowledge that the history of colonisation, and its aftermath, including the forced removal of children, has been the most significant reason for today’s picture of health and other problems.
And I also believe that few Australians realise that an important part of the way forward and the solutions to today’s Aboriginal problems will come from acknowledging and managing the historical pathways to poor outcomes.
One of the historical pathways to disadvantage is marginalisation—disengagement and a lack of trust in government and mainstream service providers.
It is nothing short of scandalous that the mismanagement of Indigenous education programs—the very programs which should be helping to address the impacts of intergenerational disadvantage—is now contributing to the further disengagement of Indigenous parents.
The inquiry found that the changes to funding arrangements have threatened to undermine parents’ full involvement in the education of their children.
It also found that professional educators consistently provided evidence to the Committee that the changes may arrest progress in achieving improvements to levels of literacy and numeracy among Indigenous students.
Findings of the Report and comparison with National Report on Indigenous Education and Training
The National Report to Parliament on Indigenous Education and Training 2003 was tabled on 4 May 2005.
In his foreword, Dr Nelson says in regard to the 2005-2008 quadrennium:
We will be directing more funding to assist the most disadvantaged students in Australia—Indigenous children living in remote areas. And we will be expecting more from mainstream educational services to improve outcomes for Indigenous students, especially those living in our cities.
We intend to build on a foundation of programs and approaches that we know work. … We will be asking individuals and communities that have achieved results to act as lighthouses for others to show them the way.
This up-beat description of the changes to Indigenous education funding could hardly be further from the reality of its implementation.
Directing tutorial assistance to remote students
The Committee has found that the Government’s strategy of directing greater funding to students living in remote areas has severely reduced the funding available to schools in regional or so-called ‘provincial’ areas which teach students from remote and very remote communities.
During the election and in its current Budget, the Government has trumpeted its new ‘mobility’ programs—actively encouraging students to leave their communities to attend metropolitan schools.
It is ironic, then, to realise that schools which are currently serving such students have been among those suffering most from the changes!
Indeed, the Committee has recommended that the tutorial assistance policy be amended to ensure that students from remote areas who are enrolled at boarding schools in cities remain eligible for the funding that goes to students in remote areas.
ASSPA programs
One would assume that the case studies presented in the Indigenous Education Report 2003 would provide a guide to the kinds of schools and programs that are considered successful and could be put forward as “lighthouses”.
So let’s take a look at the primary school case studies. Both demonstrate the benefits available to schools and students under the previous ASSPA program.
The first is Rawa Community School in outback WA. The programs implemented by this school include healthy eating (breakfast and lunch); language; computing; music; a youth centre; and camps and trips (both cultural and to the broader community).
This case study shows the impact of, among other things, breakfast and lunch programs and cultural trips.
By contrast, evidence presented to the Committee showed confusion within the Department of Education, Science and Training—and therefore within schools and communities—about whether nutrition programs would be eligible for funding under the new arrangements.
Excursions and trips to country were also under threat in many schools.
Overall, confusion reigned about what would be funded and what would not, in the move from ASSPA to PSPI.
The end result for many schools was six months with no funding for programs which they considered essential to their success in retaining students, improving attendance and therefore improving literacy and numeracy outcomes.
The second primary school case study in the National Report was the Djidi Djidi Aboriginal School in Bunbury, also in WA.
This community-based government primary school promotes Aboriginal culture in a number of ways. In particular, the case study includes reference to the “active and hardworking ASSPA Committee that spent their funds on supporting school initiatives and programs such as reading and sport resources”.
This is no longer the case. This school no longer has an ASSPA Committee.
Instead—if it is like the schools who presented evidence to the Committee—it will have a group of disillusioned parents whose ongoing involvement with the education of their children has been placed at risk by a Government which, at its core, does not trust Indigenous people to make decisions about money.
How can these schools be lighthouses when the Government has switched off the power to the very programs which made them shine?
Conclusion
Mr President, one of the worst aspects of this inquiry process has been the unwillingness of Minister Nelson to respond to the Committee’s interim report, tabled on 16 March.
The Committee tabled that report only because of its extreme concern—arising from its visit to the Northern Territory—that the implementation of the new funding arrangements was placing the education of Indigenous students at risk.
The final report has confirmed this earlier assessment.
While DEST has tried to address some of the issues raised during the inquiry—particularly in relation to the inconsistent advice provided to schools by its officers—major problems remain with both the policy and its implementation.
I would like to conclude by reiterating a point made in the preface of the report.
The point is that no-one elected to Parliament could help but be depressed to find that confidence in the processes of government among school communities has been damaged by the lack of consultation and respect for communities; poor program design; and abysmal implementation which have characterised the introduction of these new funding arrangements.
The Government, and Minister Nelson in particular, should be ashamed of the findings of this inquiry and I call on them to act promptly to address its recommendations.

The Institute’s founding Director, Professor Fiona Stanley, outlined some of these findings at the launch of the National Day of Healing on 25 May this year. She gave an impassioned speech in which she said:
I believe that all Australians acknowledge that Aboriginal people have on average, worse outcomes in health and social situations. I do not believe that most acknowledge that the history of colonisation, and its aftermath, including the forced removal of children, has been the most significant reason for today’s picture of health and other problems.
And I also believe that few Australians realise that an important part of the way forward and the solutions to today’s Aboriginal problems will come from acknowledging and managing the historical pathways to poor outcomes.
One of the historical pathways to disadvantage is marginalisation—disengagement and a lack of trust in government and mainstream service providers.
It is nothing short of scandalous that the mismanagement of Indigenous education programs—the very programs which should be helping to address the impacts of intergenerational disadvantage—is now contributing to the further disengagement of Indigenous parents.
The inquiry found that the changes to funding arrangements have threatened to undermine parents’ full involvement in the education of their children.
It also found that professional educators consistently provided evidence to the Committee that the changes may arrest progress in achieving improvements to levels of literacy and numeracy among Indigenous students.
Findings of the Report and comparison with National Report on Indigenous Education and Training
The National Report to Parliament on Indigenous Education and Training 2003 was tabled on 4 May 2005.
In his foreword, Dr Nelson says in regard to the 2005-2008 quadrennium:
We will be directing more funding to assist the most disadvantaged students in Australia—Indigenous children living in remote areas. And we will be expecting more from mainstream educational services to improve outcomes for Indigenous students, especially those living in our cities.
We intend to build on a foundation of programs and approaches that we know work. … We will be asking individuals and communities that have achieved results to act as lighthouses for others to show them the way.
This up-beat description of the changes to Indigenous education funding could hardly be further from the reality of its implementation.
Directing tutorial assistance to remote students
The Committee has found that the Government’s strategy of directing greater funding to students living in remote areas has severely reduced the funding available to schools in regional or so-called ‘provincial’ areas which teach students from remote and very remote communities.
During the election and in its current Budget, the Government has trumpeted its new ‘mobility’ programs—actively encouraging students to leave their communities to attend metropolitan schools.
It is ironic, then, to realise that schools which are currently serving such students have been among those suffering most from the changes!
Indeed, the Committee has recommended that the tutorial assistance policy be amended to ensure that students from remote areas who are enrolled at boarding schools in cities remain eligible for the funding that goes to students in remote areas.
ASSPA programs
One would assume that the case studies presented in the Indigenous Education Report 2003 would provide a guide to the kinds of schools and programs that are considered successful and could be put forward as “lighthouses”.
So let’s take a look at the primary school case studies. Both demonstrate the benefits available to schools and students under the previous ASSPA program.
The first is Rawa Community School in outback WA. The programs implemented by this school include healthy eating (breakfast and lunch); language; computing; music; a youth centre; and camps and trips (both cultural and to the broader community).
This case study shows the impact of, among other things, breakfast and lunch programs and cultural trips.
By contrast, evidence presented to the Committee showed confusion within the Department of Education, Science and Training—and therefore within schools and communities—about whether nutrition programs would be eligible for funding under the new arrangements.
Excursions and trips to country were also under threat in many schools.
Overall, confusion reigned about what would be funded and what would not, in the move from ASSPA to PSPI.
The end result for many schools was six months with no funding for programs which they considered essential to their success in retaining students, improving attendance and therefore improving literacy and numeracy outcomes.
The second primary school case study in the National Report was the Djidi Djidi Aboriginal School in Bunbury, also in WA.
This community-based government primary school promotes Aboriginal culture in a number of ways. In particular, the case study includes reference to the “active and hardworking ASSPA Committee that spent their funds on supporting school initiatives and programs such as reading and sport resources”.
This is no longer the case. This school no longer has an ASSPA Committee.
Instead—if it is like the schools who presented evidence to the Committee—it will have a group of disillusioned parents whose ongoing involvement with the education of their children has been placed at risk by a Government which, at its core, does not trust Indigenous people to make decisions about money.
How can these schools be lighthouses when the Government has switched off the power to the very programs which made them shine?
Conclusion
Mr President, one of the worst aspects of this inquiry process has been the unwillingness of Minister Nelson to respond to the Committee’s interim report, tabled on 16 March.
The Committee tabled that report only because of its extreme concern—arising from its visit to the Northern Territory—that the implementation of the new funding arrangements was placing the education of Indigenous students at risk.
The final report has confirmed this earlier assessment.
While DEST has tried to address some of the issues raised during the inquiry—particularly in relation to the inconsistent advice provided to schools by its officers—major problems remain with both the policy and its implementation.
I would like to conclude by reiterating a point made in the preface of the report.
The point is that no-one elected to Parliament could help but be depressed to find that confidence in the processes of government among school communities has been damaged by the lack of consultation and respect for communities; poor program design; and abysmal implementation which have characterised the introduction of these new funding arrangements.
The Government, and Minister Nelson in particular, should be ashamed of the findings of this inquiry and I call on them to act promptly to address its recommendations.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,34,2,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-22,"—I seek leave to incorporate the statement I wish to make tonight. I have provided copies to the whips.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I rise tonight to make a statement as Deputy Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Population and Development—soon to be named the Parliamentary Group on Population & Development. Earlier this week the Senate passed the following motion, also put up on behalf of the group. It was that the Senate:
recognizes that July 11, 2005 is World Population Day and that the days theme is equality empowers
recognizes that the empowerment of women will greatly help to alleviate global poverty
acknowledges that 500,000 women die each year due to the lack of adequate reproductive health services
July 11 is one day in the year that we should be reflecting on what is happening to populations in developing countries and more particularly in our region.
Our group was formed in 1995 to support and promote the Program of Action after the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in 1994.
The overarching aim of the Program of Action is to raise the quality of life for all people through appropriate population and development policies and programmes aimed at eradicating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development.
The Program of Action affirms that advancing gender equality and equity, the empowerment of women, the elimination of all forms of violence against women, and ensuring women’s ability to control their own fertility are ends in themselves; indeed they are ‘cornerstones’ of development.
The theme of World Population Day 2005, Equality Empowers, is central to our group’s advocacy, particularly in the context of equality for women.
Equality for women in broad terms calls for the same access to services and opportunities that most men have had for so long.
When women are empowered in this way there is a positive flow-on to their families and their communities, and as consequence, the burden of poverty and the harmful effects on the environment are alleviated.
For example; Australia supports a program in South East Asia that addresses both environment and reproductive health concerns through the provision of smokeless stoves. There are many benefits, some of which are less deforestation in rural areas and lower uterine prolapses for women from carrying heavy loads.
Empowering women means that they can input and participate in development activities and importantly, share equally in the benefits that result.
Empowering women also means that girls must have the right to attend school.
Sadly, 65 million (or 54 per cent) of an estimated 121 million children globally, currently out of school, are girls and 600 million women are illiterate, compared to 320 million men.
We must change this appalling statistic. Investment in girls’ education is generally acknowledged as the single-most important catalyst for poverty reduction and development.
Empowering women also means providing economic opportunities:
We must remove barriers to women’s equal participation in the workforce —Economic life opens up opportunities for women to earn more income, which benefits them, their families and ultimately their countries.
Women’s political participation must also be a strategic priority because where women’s share of seats in political bodies is less than 30 per cent, countries are less inclusive, less egalitarian, and less democratic. [Australia’s rate is 35%]
Empowerment for women also means having access to reproductive health services. Women should have the means and ability to space their children, to earn income without compromising their health, the means to protect themselves from violence and from contracting HIV/AIDS.
Access to these services saves the lives of hundreds of thousands of women —ensuring the most fundamental right of all is upheld, the right to live.
With the world population climbing to 6.5 billion, the largest group of young women ever is entering their childbearing years making access to these services more critical.
Lack of access to these services causes consequences that our own families and friends can only imagine, if at all. For instance, high rates of death in pregnancy and childbirth, the acceleration of HIV/AIDS and other serious health risks, like fistula, anaemia and septicaemia —most of which are preventable. To quote some alarming statistics: Over 500,000 women die from pregnancy related complications each year. This figure is just below twice the number of all births in Australia in the last year. Again, I stress these are all preventable.
Every minute worldwide, 389 women become pregnant—190 of these pregnancies are unwanted, 650 people become infected with a curable sexually transmitted infection and 10 people become infected with HIV, half of them women
Every year, 14 million teenage girls give birth. Some 200 million women in the developing world have an unmet need for effective contraceptives and an estimated 6,000 youth a day become infected with HIV/AIDS—one every 14 seconds—the majority of them young women.
In our region, East Timor—70% of Timorese women do not know where to obtain contraceptive information or advice and as a consequence has one of the highest fertility rates in the world. On average more than 8 children per woman. The poverty of many of the East Timorese people is well known.
It is estimated that guaranteeing access to family planning alone could reduce maternal deaths by 25 per cent and reduce child deaths by 20 per cent. Simply ensuring skilled attendants at births could reduce maternal deaths by 74 per cent.
To quote Jeffrey D. Sachs, Special Adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General on the Millennium Development Goals,

Reproductive health services are not just desirable in and of themselves—which they certainly are—but are absolutely critical tools for alleviating poverty, and in particular for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which are the overarching international framework for trying to alleviate the suffering of the poorest people in the world.

However it is not all doom and gloom. There has been progress.
Gender equality and women’s empowerment are issues increasingly recognized in global and national declarations and commitments to human rights and human development. Canada and The Netherlands for example have announced massive increases in their aid budgets to agencies which are committed to empowering women.
Australia supports the ICPD Programme of Action, the Beijing Platform for Action, and the Millennium Development Goals. These are mutually-reinforcing development platforms that affirm women’s human rights and acknowledge that solving the world’s most pressing problems demands the full participation and empowerment of the world’s women. We in Australia can do more by following through on our commitments made at these fora.
In the 2005 Australian budget there was an increase in funding for UNFPA which is very welcome money. I congratulate the Federal government in recognizing the importance of funding agencies that are committed to principles of reproductive health and rights for women.
Similarly, Australia must use its unique position in our region to advocate for the empowerment of women. We should work to ensure that the human rights of women and girls are respected, protected and promoted through gender-sensitive polices and legislation and through the provision of appropriate services.
Through these actions we can begin to address one of the root causes of worldwide poverty and inequality.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Parliamentary Group on Population and Development</title>,ADJOURNMENT,35,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-22," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 8 March 2005:
With reference to the recall on 28 April 2003 of products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals:
How many serious adverse events were reported in the 12 months prior to the recall.
Of the 62 serious adverse events occurring in individuals who consumed products for which Pan Pharmaceuticals was an approved manufacturer and that were reported in the 12 months prior to the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall, what proportion of that total number of adverse events reported do those 62 reports represent.
Can the Government confirm that, for those 62 adverse events possibly associated with Pan Pharmaceuticals, it is not possible to say that Pan Pharmaceuticals was definitely the manufacturer as it was only one of a list of approved manufacturers for those products; if so, what action was taken with other possible manufacturers to investigate their manufacturing processes.           
Can the Government confirm that when adverse drug reactions are reported, it is the practice that all medications that a person may be taking are listed and that it is common for people to be using multiple products at the one time; if so, of the 62 serious adverse events occurring in individuals who consumed products for which Pan Pharmaceuticals was an approved manufacturer and that were reported in the 12 months prior to the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall, how many of the 62 reports had other medications listed.
If there were other products also listed in the adverse events reports, what action was taken to investigate these other products.
How was it determined that the adverse reaction was caused by the Pan Pharmaceuticals product and not another product that the person had taken.
Are these adverse reports the only evidence to demonstrate an ‘imminent risk of death or serious injury’, and the reason for the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall; if not, what other evidence is required; if so, have there been other products which have had a similar number of adverse event reports and were these products recalled.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Pan Pharmaceuticals</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,37,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-06-22,"—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
The Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC) received 9672 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (“adverse events”) in the 12 months prior to the Pan recall. During this period, the information entered into the computer did not include a coding for serious reports. Thus, the computer system does not permit searching of all of these reports to identify those classified as serious. The original reports for the products that could possibly have been manufactured by Pan have been assessed to determine whether they were serious events or not.
and (3) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has conducted a further review of the adverse drug reaction reports. Excluding Travacalm, a total of 66 serious adverse reaction reports were received for products consumed in the 12 months preceding the Pan recall. Of these, 20 reports were sent to ADRAC prior to the recall. These 20 reports represent 0.21% of all suspected adverse drug reactions in that period. No batch numbers were provided for these 20 reports.
        Of those reports received after the Pan recall on 28 April 2003, there were eight with batch numbers confirming the products implicated had been manufactured by Pan. For medicines with more than one possible manufacturer, the batch number is needed to confirm the site of manufacture of the product actually associated with the report. In its absence it is not possible to say where the product was manufactured.
        Adverse reaction reports are one of a number of factors taken into account when scheduling audits. Other factors include the level of compliance of the manufacturer at the previous audit, the nature of the deficiencies identified previously, the type of products manufactured, recalls, tip offs and laboratory testing.
and (5) All medications identified by the reporter or by review by TGA staff or by the ADRAC as possible causes of the reaction are entered into the computer record and coded as “suspected” or, in some instances, “interacting” medications. All medications coded in this way are searchable by the routine computer programs. Medications mentioned in the report that are not identified as being suspected of possibly causing or interacting to contribute to the adverse event by the reporter, by review by TGA staff or by the ADRAC are generally entered into the computer record and coded as “other” medications. There were 40 of the 66 reports in which at least one other medicine was recorded as being taken.
Each report was assessed according to a standard protocol. A copy of the protocol for assessment of causality for each medication is provided in Attachment A.        
No, the decision to recall product manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals was made on the basis of the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) audits of Pan Pharmaceuticals undertaken by the TGA and on the advice of an independent Expert Advisory Group (EAG) that advised the TGA in relation to the public health and safety risk posed by the products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals.
        The audits undertaken by the TGA revealed widespread and serious deficiencies and failures in the company’s manufacturing and quality control procedures, including systematic and deliberate manipulation of quality control test data. These failures meant that the TGA could have no confidence in the quality of any products manufactured by the company since the last audit of the company in May 2002.
        The findings and recommendations of the EAG from its meeting on 23 April 2003 were that the multiple failures of GMP identified in the auditor’s report, in the opinion of the EAG, created risks of death, serious illness, and serious injury; that the risk would increase over time; and that the risk could be realised at any time.
        Acting on this advice the TGA recalled the products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals.
Attachment A
Causality Assessment
All reports are classified by ADRAC according to the likelihood that the reactions were caused by the drugs being taken. Reports are assessed individually without reference to previous reports or the published literature. There are four Causality Assessments:
1. Certain
2. Probable
3. Possible
4. Causality unclear – Reports listed as “causality unclear” are not displayed in the computer printouts provided = General listed
The criteria used by the Committee in determining causality ratings are consistent with WHO criteria and are:
1. Certain
(a) a reaction in association with a single drug which was confirmed by rechallenge
(b) a reaction in association with a single drug which is confirmed by laboratory data specifically implicating that drug
(c)a reaction onset is immediately following drug administration (within five minutes if injection was the method of administration and during infusion)
(d) a reaction which has precise spatial correlation with administration (e.g. at the exact site of skin patch or injection, vaccine site reaction, injection site abscess and eye application)
2. Probable
(a) temporal or spatial (e.g. skin) correlation with the administration of a single drug
(b) a reaction in reasonable temporal association with a single drug and recovery on withdrawal of the drug if no other drug is withdrawn and no treatment is given
(c) an uncommon clinical phenomenon associated with the administration of a single drug and the reasonable exclusion of other factors.
3. Possible
(a) more than one drug is suspected; and/or
(b) the reaction has not recovered, or the outcome of the reaction is not recorded; and/or
(c) recovery follows treatment (usually in addition to withdrawal of the drug); and/or
(d) recovery follows withdrawal of more than one drug; and/or
(e) time relationship is not clear; and/or
(f) data are incomplete; and/or
(g) an alternative explanation exists
(h) (Note a Certain or Probable Causality (i.e. meeting the usual criteria) may be downgraded to possible if a reasonable or possible alternative explanation exists)
4. Unclear (General List)
(a) Where a clinical event may well be explained as arising from factors related to underlying disease or other non-drug aetiology
(b) Where there is no reasonable temporal association between the use of a drug and the clinical event
(c) Where a reaction occurs at a dose not normally used
(d) Where the report does not contain enough information for an adequate assessment (e.g. no minimum data set)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Pan Pharmaceuticals</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,37,1,answer
