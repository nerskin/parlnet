Whilst we were close to finishing consideration of this legislation last night, this is an issue of significance that I did not think it was appropriate to rush through with just a few seconds comment. There are some issues here that still need to be explored and outlined on the record in the chamber. As I said in some of my contributions last night, I believe that both the amendments that the government have put forward and, more specifically, the amendments that the Democrats have put forward go a significant way towards addressing some of the concerns that were outlined not just by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee but also by a number of people involved in the migration agents and migration industry area. It is still undoubtedly the case that some people will not be fully happy, indeed the Democrats are not fully happy, with the final result. But we were in a context where it seemed to me quite clear that the bill would go through in some amended form or other and it would be best to try to acknowledge that reality, work with it and try to get the best package possible, rather than simply sitting on the sidelines and complaining about it, if there were scope to improve things. I am pleased to see that there have been opportunities to improve things. 
The amendments that I have moved go to a further section to deal with procedure for disciplining registered migration agents. Not surprisingly, this is the area that causes apprehension not just to the agents themselves but indeed to MARA—the Migration Agents Registration Authority—which is the overseeing body. To recap briefly, the procedure that was agreed to with amendments last night was that the minister and the department would examine or investigate an agent that they had concerns about, that they had viewed as maybe engaging in vexatious conduct, and that the agent would provide a written submission to the minister which would outline their situation and their arguments in relation to the areas of concern. The minister would then make findings in relation to that and submit it to the Migration Agents Registration Authority.
The very important amendment that was made last night was that MARA now has the scope to decide not to discipline the agent if the authority is satisfied that there are special circumstances that justify making that decision. There are still issues here. As I said last night, one of the concerns is that the minister, in what he or she provides to MARA, will be providing the full package of all that MARA is allowed to consider. In making its decision about whether or not to discipline the agents, MARA is not allowed to consider information other than that provided to it by the minister. The concern is that that may hinder MARA in taking into account all factors if other information is around that subsequently comes to light or that perhaps they are aware of separately. That is a legitimate concern, and it is one that needs to be noted. As I said last night, a model that might be seen as a very rough comparison is an investigative agency putting together a brief similar to one being put together for a director of public prosecutions, for example, who has to work off that brief and then determine whether or not to take action.
The issue is whether or not there is scope to take into account any other information. It is one of those areas, frankly, where the test will be how it works in practice, particularly in terms of the practice of the minister and the department in the thoroughness of their investigations and in the fairness of their findings of fact that they provide to the MARA. It should be emphasised that there will still be scope, if there is any disciplinary action taken, for a review of that disciplinary action by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
There have been concerns expressed to the Democrats that there is not adequate scope for review by the tribunal or that that review power is limited or inadequate or may still prevent people from being able to practise while the appeal before the tribunal is being considered. I would appreciate it if the minister could put on the record the facts on how the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will operate under this new framework. Certainly in some of the correspondence I have received—it is still coming through even this morning and there were extra emails yesterday—there is still concern amongst not just individual agents but experienced practitioners and representative bodies about how this new procedure will operate in practice. There is confusion out there because some people are going off the bills and some are going off the government amendments, not taking into account the amendments to the amendments that have already been made, let alone the extra amendments that I have just moved. It is important to have it on record in the chamber, given the fact that this is a work in progress and it has been a bit of a moveable feast, to try to ensure that from the outset there is a clear understanding of how this process will work so that misunderstanding and misinformation is limited as much as possible. I think it would be valuable to get some of that clearly on the record at this stage before the bill passes into law. 
The Democrats' understanding is that there is still scope for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review any action against a migration agent. Quite clearly if the procedures followed by the minister in terms of his or her findings of fact or the inability of the MARA to take other information into account have led to an unfair or unjust decision, then the tribunal should be able to detect that. If that is found to be a common practice then clearly the pressure will build very quickly to modify either the practice or the legislation.
Specifically, the amendments that the Democrats have moved this morning will put in place an extra step, if you like, in the process. Again I am not suggesting that this is the perfect model as far as the Democrats are concerned. It presents a reasonable compromise that should be workable. We will see in practice whether or not it is workable. Basically what the chamber did last night in adopting the Democrats' first range of amendments was to give the registration authority, the MARA, the power and ability to make a decision not to discipline a registered agent regardless of what the minister may wish or think. That decision is communicated back to the minister by the authority in writing, setting out reasons why the authority decides not to discipline the agent. The minister can then still decide whether or not to continue to refer the agent to the authority for disciplinary action.
This new second step still, in my view, retains some of the concerns that were initially there. If the minister decides some disciplinary action needs to be taken and the authority says, `No, we don't agree; we won't do that,' and then notifies the minister, setting out the reasons, the minister can still say, `No, I disagree,' and send it back again, requiring the authority to undertake disciplinary action. The second time around there is not the scope for the MARA to make a decision not to take some form of disciplinary action. That is still of concern to me in that it would be preferable for the MARA to have total discretion, so it is quite clearly a compromise arrangement.
The other aspect that remains is that the MARA has the ability to take a range of actions in making a decision to discipline an agent. It is not compelled to cancel or to suspend the agent's registration. It is still able to caution the agent. How that will operate in practice and what the impact of the caution will be over a period of time is something that we will have to wait and see. It does still mean, and it is obviously a very important issue for agents, that the scope is there for them to simply be cautioned by the authority. I assume that the authority can determine the wording and severity of that caution in its communications with the agent.
We should remember here that, whilst it is appropriate that we have concern for the consumer and concern that migration agents operate appropriately and not vexatiously, we are still talking about people's livelihood. If an agent's licence to practise is cancelled or suspended, you are taking away that person's livelihood. In some cases, that is a person's entire livelihood. It is not something that should be done lightly and we need to keep that in mind. There is, as I have said, still the scope for the agent to appeal a decision made by the MARA to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal whether it is a suspension, a cancellation or a caution. If the minister were to place that on the record, it would be of benefit. 
So the amendments still give the scope that was originally there for the minister to require MARA to make a disciplining decision, but at the second stage rather than the first time around. The legislation still retains the ability for the MARA simply to caution rather than to suspend or, in the most extreme example, to cancel the registration. As I have said, that is not the ideal solution the Democrats would have preferred but one that is at least a workable compromise, given that the legislation was likely to pass in some form or other.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-23,"—We are currently dealing with the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003, which provides the parameters for the operation of MARA, the Migration Agents Registration Authority, which oversights the licensing of migration agents in this country. The Labor Party will be supporting the group of amendments that we are currently considering as moved by Senator Bartlett on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I outlined our reasons in lengthy detail last night when we concluded the business of the Senate as to why we will be supporting the package of amendments moved by the Australian Demo-crats. 
Senator Bartlett has touched on an issue that we would appreciate perhaps some response from the government on, and that is the difficulty a migration agent may face if there is a stay order placed on them by MARA and the practical problem that they may face if they seek to appeal to the AAT, and it is reasonable that they should have an appeal process. The time lag that it takes for the AAT to hear the appeal has an impact on an operator who effectively could, in some circumstances, be forced out of business while they are waiting for the AAT to hear their appeal. The minister might like to make some comment about what we certainly identify as a potential problem for some operators where a stay order has been placed. With those concluding remarks I reiterate that the Labor Party will be supporting the package of amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. 
The bill that we will shortly be proceeding to approve has been much improved as a result of the Senate committee process. There are some 39 amendments which the government itself has moved and a significant number of amendments that the Australian Democrats have moved which, while not resulting in a perfect piece of legislation from the Labor opposition's perspective, certainly will result in a considerably improved piece of legislation dealing with a very important issue—the oversighting registration of migration agents and their operation in this country. On behalf of the Labor opposition, I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and certainly the two Labor members of that committee, Senator Bolkus and Senator Ludwig. I also want to thank the chair of the committee, Senator Payne, because the Senate committee report was a unanimous one as a consequence of the correct observations being made about practical issues that did need resolving in respect of the original bill. The legislation committee is a committee on which the government has a majority and its report was unanimous, therefore I have not thanked just the Labor members. From the Labor Party's point of view I should thank the chair, Senator Payne, who is a member of the government and, I think quite correctly in this case, came to an appropriate conclusion about the necessary amendments to produce a considerably better piece of legislation in respect of migration agents. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-23,"—The government will be agreeing with the Democrat amendments. Both Senator Bartlett and Senator Sherry have raised issues in relation to the operations of reviews by the AAT. The issue that Senator Sherry raises in particular relates to the circumstances in which a migration agent who has had an order—I think it is referred to in the trade as a `sanction'—may be placed in the position that they are unable to continue to act because on average the AAT, I am informed, takes something like 271 days to finalise an appeal by an agent. It is obviously a serious matter because in those circumstances the agent may well be unable to continue. 
There is a difference, as I understand it, between those who are cautioned and those who are sanctioned. The people who are cautioned can continue. I am told, however, that the number of people who are sanctioned is very small. There are something like 3,300 registered agents and there have only been 60 sanctions since March 1998. So it is a very small number who would be affected, and those who are cautioned are not affected. Senator Bartlett raised questions about the processes around the AAT. The officers from Senator Vanstone's office have indicated that we are very keen to work through those issues with agents and with Senator Bartlett and, if it is useful, we could facilitate relevant briefings and information packs as required.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-23,"—I will not hold up the committee unnecessarily. I think it is important to have this on the record because we are still having concerns expressed to us. A fax came through just late yesterday from the Queensland Law Society expressing concern that the law would operate on a non-transparent and unreviewable basis at the complete discretion of the minister. It is my understanding that that is not the case and that it is a reviewable situation. There is a full merits review. The merits review does not happen through the Migration Agents Registration Authority but through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Whilst that might not be ideal it means that there is scope for a full merits review at that stage of the process. If it pans out that people are put into a position where, through delays in the AAT, cancellations or suspensions might come into force in a way that prevents them from practising whilst that full merits review is considered then that would be of concern.
The other potential consequence, if that turns out to be the case, is that the MARA would be far less likely to impose a `sentence', if you like, of a cancellation or a suspension. They would be more likely to go with a caution if they felt it would prevent people from being able to exercise their livelihood because of the length of time in the review process. It is not simply a matter of having the process work as fairly as possible; it is also a matter of ensuring that there are not unintended consequences. If I were in a position where I was considering whether or not to suspend someone's licence I would take into account whether they would end up not being able to practise while a review was carried out. It is important in that respect. 
I note the minister's final comments. They are welcome and I am sure that in conjunction with the MARA and the Migration Institute of Australia the minister will seek to require or enable full information to get out to relevant people as quickly and clearly as possible. As I stated, there is a lot of concern about this area. It has been pending for quite a period of time. The Senate has obviously made a lot of changes in the last 24 hours in relation to what people were fearing and I think those changes will alleviate some, although not all, of their fears. So it is important that people's understanding of the final outcome is correct and I urge the government to get that material out there as quickly as possible, and in as understandable a way as possible. As I think I said yesterday, the goals of this legislation are shared by everybody and we just want to make sure that the legislation operates in practice.
In conclusion I would also like to note again the effectiveness of the Senate committee. As Senator Sherry rightly pointed out, it is not just the non-government members but also the chair, Senator Payne, who has     contributed. Another government member, Senator Mason, produced a useful and occasionally fiery contribution at the committee hearings. Again, the work of others in the community has contributed not just to the committee inquiry but right through the process—as I said, right up until this morning—raising views, concerns and ideas. I think the work of those agents, particularly the Migration Institute, should be acknowledged. I do not think that in any way they should be held responsible for the final outcome—it is very much the responsibility of the Senate—but the Migration Institute and those people who work on behalf of the entire industry have certainly been responsible in part for it being a lot better than it otherwise would have been.

Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 3227:
(1)	Clause 5, page 5 (line 12), at the end of the definition of employment, add:
	; and 	(e) unpaid work.
This amendment deals with extending the scope of the bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in the context of unpaid work. This amendment responds directly to the recommendations made by the Australian Nursing Federation, the Council on the Ageing, ACOSS and the Australian Lawyers for Human Rights. We Democrats believe that restricting the prohibition against age discrimination to the paid work force is inconsistent with the underlying objects of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003. If this amendment is not passed, many Australians who undertake unpaid work will be left at risk of discrimination on the basis of their age. 
In recent years, the government has repeatedly acknowledged the immense value of work performed by volunteers in the Australian community. Volunteering is an integral part of community life in Australia and we should be doing everything we can to support the many thousands of volunteers who perform invaluable but unpaid work. The government's exclusion of these people is, I think, mean-spirited and hypocritical. Not only does it let down Australian volunteers; it also weakens the prohibition against age discrimination that the bill we are dealing with is attempting to establish. The Democrats believe that those who perform unpaid work should be protected from discrimination by the bill. That is what this amendment seeks to do, and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—We have been able to look at Democrat amendment (1) and we agree that it has merit. Labor are prepared to support that amendment and a number of other Democrat amendments—it might have been easier to move them as a group. Like our amendments, this amendment will improve the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and we think positive things will come out of it. I foreshadow that Labor are in a position to support Democrat amendments (1), (2), (5) and (6) as we try to get our head around the debate—I think it was some time ago that we finished the second reading debate and started the committee process. I also understand that the Democrats will be withdrawing amendments (3), (9), (10) and (11). We understand that amendment (3), which deals with the dominant purpose test, and amendment (11), which deals with the prohibition of harassment, are being withdrawn because they are covered by the amendments Labor propose to move on those issues. We will move amendments that relate to the dominant purpose test and the prohibition of harassment which are the same as the Democrat amendments, and we will be seeking your support to achieve that result.
Amendment (1) relates to unpaid work. Like the Democrats, Labor believe that limiting the bill's provision to those only in the paid work force is short-sighted and inconsistent with the underlying objects of the bill. There is a massive contribution made to our community by older people in the unpaid sector. This includes both my now deceased father-in-law and my mother-in-law, who continues to work in the unpaid workforce, contributing significantly to the running of an auxiliary for a hospital as she has been doing for 20-odd years now—she is past eight score years. The work that she has done has contributed significantly, of the order of many millions of dollars, to the running of that hospital. By the dedication of volunteers, each year they make a donation of instruments and the like that they buy for the QEII hospital. I am sure she will be pleased that I have mentioned that, although I indicated that I probably would not.
My one example is really the tip of the iceberg of the unpaid work that goes on. The older people who contribute are a massive community sector and they contribute right across the board. There is not only that person working in that sector but a whole community or group who contribute in those and related areas. I would be remiss not to mention all of them, because I think they all stand head and shoulders above many people who retire and do not contribute in some way to citizens volunteering associations and all of those other things. They do things like caring for grandchildren. They also volunteer, as I have indicated, for charitable services and organisations. It is important that they be covered by the bill because it is a significant area, it is a growing area and it is one that deserves recognition—recognition not only through the awards that they sometimes get and in other ways but recognition by the government that they are an integral part of society and deserve coverage under bills such as the one we are now debating. They should not be excluded simply on the basis that they do not do work that is integral to the overall fabric of our society. 
In fact when you look at the recent call to arms made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over the growing ageing of our population, it is difficult to understand why the government are not prepared to treat older people in the unpaid work force on the same grounds as those in the paid work force. If the government want examples of how unfair age based discrimination could occur against people in the unpaid work force, they need only read many of the submissions made to the committee inquiry into this particular bill. The example of older people being refused work because of     concerns about insurance costs or other lia-bilities does seem to fly in the face of the principle that it should be your ability to contribute, not your age, that determines your participation in unpaid work. I really did not want to make too long a speech in relation to this issue, but it is something that I have had a long interest in—not only representing paid workers but also being associated with many unpaid workers and the work they contribute to our society. Here is but one small way that the government can acknowledge the work that unpaid workers do and treat them similarly to paid workers, as they would expect to be treated.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—The government oppose this amendment. At the outset, I acknowledge the great work that is done by the many senior citizens who engage in voluntary work in the community. This was an issue which went before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, and one on which the committee did not recommend a change—it supported the government view in relation to this. There are differing provisions in relation to the states and territories across the country. Some allow provision for measures to be taken where there is discrimination in relation to paid and unpaid work; others exclude the unpaid work. Accordingly, when the Commonwealth came to consider this issue, we were of a view that the voluntary sector could suffer an adverse impact if this were to be extended to unpaid work.
On balance, it was decided that employment should cover paid work. That is consistent with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. In other words, the Commonwealth are saying that we have discrimination legislation which applies to employment. This age discrimination legislation should be consistent with that. We do not for one minute, though, ignore the great contribution that senior members of our community make in relation to voluntary work—and, I might add, that young people make as well. In my experience as a minister travelling around Australia I never fail to be impressed by the great contribution that is made on a voluntary basis by all Australians. But in this instance we believe that it would cause more problems to extend it to unpaid work and that those problems would be mainly visited upon the voluntary sector. For those reasons, the government does not support the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-23,"—I will use this opportunity to make some general comments for the Greens on the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 before addressing this specific amendment. The Greens are opposed to forms of ageism and support initiatives to counter them in a whole range of different areas. We consider it fundamental that all citizens are accorded the same opportunities and respect regardless of their age. So we believe that the Commonwealth age discrimination legislation we are debating at the moment is long overdue. 
The age discrimination legislation has been introduced in response to several recent studies on age discrimination, such as the Age matters report done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the House of Representatives committee report Age counts. The purpose of this bill is to eliminate age based discrimination in a range of different areas. This amendment relates to work, but the bill also deals with access to goods, services and facilities; access to premises; Commonwealth programs; education; and accommodation. The Greens welcome this, particularly the bill's aim of prohibiting age based discrimination in the workplace.
We note that the ACTU have outlined in their Older workers background paperthat the main impediment to older workers' employment prospects is the perception that they lack the ability to develop new skills. The ACTU Older workers background paper quotes a survey in which 42.5 per cent of those surveyed believe that mature age workers were discriminated against in the workplace. Older workers also make up a disproportionately high percentage of the long-term unemployed. Discrimination against older workers has a negative impact not just on the individual workers but, we believe, on society as a whole.
The Greens share the concerns of community groups who, in their participation in consultations and the Senate inquiry into this bill, have pointed out a raft of different concerns. Some of those concerns were about the legislation containing holes—for example, the failure to prohibit age based harassment, which we will get to later in the committee stage of the debate. The bill also contains far too many blanket exemptions. I want to talk about the broad exemption that exists within the bill for social security payments. The Greens acknowledge that, obviously, there are some social security payments—such as aged pension or family benefit payments—for which it may be required to have an exemption from this bill, but we share the concerns of organisations such as the Youth Action Policy Association, the YWCA and other youth advocacy groups that there is no sound basis for age discrimination in relation to most social security payments.
The example that I will give is rent assistance. The payment of rent assistance to students who are on Youth Allowance as opposed to students who are on Austudy is determined solely on the basis of the age of that person when they begin their study. If you begin study after the age of 25, you are eligible for Austudy payments but not for Youth Allowance and therefore you are unable to receive rent assistance. The Greens have, for a long time, campaigned to have rent assistance available for Austudy recipients. In fact, just last week the Senate supported a Greens' amendment to the social security bill we were debating condemning the government for refusing to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients.
We will continue to work on this issue because the Greens believe the fact that the government refuses to take the small measure that would be required to extend rent assistance to Austudy students indicates a lack of concern for the student poverty that exists within the higher education sector in Australian universities, particularly at a time when we are seeing government moves to increase the up-front fees that students face when they begin their university studies. There will be more opportunity during this debate to talk about some of the specifics but I wanted to raise that issue as an example of some of the blanket exemptions that are in this piece of legislation. We will be supporting the legislation and we will support a raft of amendments in committee to improve the legislation to deal with some of these areas. We question the capacity of the legislation to cover all of the areas of age discrimination that the Greens believe need to be covered. 
I indicate that we will be supporting the amendment that has been put forward on unpaid work. The Greens and many of us here come from community organisations and recognise the benefit of the unpaid work that a whole raft of individuals put in as volunteers in organisations and the contribution that they make. We support the amendment which we are debating at the moment, as we say that people who contribute to our community through their unpaid work should not be discriminated against on the basis of age. At this point it is probably worth also tossing in that the Greens do not want to see a situation that has been highlighted in the past by government comments whereby we come to rely on volunteer work forces to provide the sorts of services that, in the Greens' view, the government should be providing, whether they be welfare services, support services for people on temporary protection visas or a whole raft of different things. We support the capacity of individuals to contribute to society in a way which they feel is appropriate, which may be in the unpaid work force, as we are debating here. We do not think that should be a replacement for the work that the government needs to do. We support this amendment to ensure that those people who choose to make their contribution in the unpaid work force are not discriminated against on the basis of their age.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1), (2), (3) and (4) on sheet 3224 revised:
(1)	Clause 5, page 4 (after line 12), after the definition of age, insert:
associate of a personmeans:
	(a)	any person with whom a person associates, whether socially or in business or commerce, or otherwise; and
	(b)	any person who is wholly or mainly dependent on, or a member of the household of, a person.
(2)	Clause 5, page 6 (after line 3), after the definition of public authority of the Commonwealth, insert:
relative of a person means any person to whom a person is related by blood, marriage, affinity or adoption.
(3)	Clause 14, page 13 (lines 4 to 17), omit the clause, substitute:
14 Discrimination on the ground of age— direct discrimination
For the purposes of this Act, a person (the discriminator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person if:
	(a)	the discriminator harasses, or treats or proposes to treat the aggrieved person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person of a different age or who does not have a relative or associate who is of that age or age group; and
	(b)	the discriminator does so because of:
	(i)	the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person; or
	(ii)	a characteristic that appertains generally to persons of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person; or 
	(iii)	a characteristic that is generally imputed to persons of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person.
(4)	Clause 15, page 13 (lines 19 to 28), omit subclause (1), substitute:
	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, a person (the discriminator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person or the age of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person if:
	(a)	the discriminator imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice; and
	(b)	the condition, requirement or practice is not reasonable in the circumstances; and
	(b)	the condition, requirement or practice has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons of the same age as the aggrieved person.
These four amendments relate to the same issue. They seek to amend the bill so as to extend its protection to people discriminated against on the basis of the age of their relative or associate. These amendments also seek to introduce a prohibition on age based harassment. The interconnectedness of the amendments is the reason why I asked for them to be moved together, and I thank the Senate in committee for allowing me to do that. The first issue concerns the relatives and associates; it might be easier to deal with them both at the same time and I will then go on to talk about the harassment issue as well. Effectively, as I have said, they are interconnected, in truth. The amendments in terms of relatives and associates extend the protection of the bill to people discriminated against due to the age of an associate or relative of the complainant. This protection is necessary to ensure that secondary victims of age discrimination have some protection from irrational and counterproductive discrimination on the basis of the age of their relatives and associates. Age discrimination is a complex and entrenched problem and any legislative response to the problem will need to be sufficiently innovative and flexible to overcome this entrenched discrimination. This amendment, in Labor's view, goes some way to achieving this necessary innovation and flexibility.
The second part of the amendments relates to age based harassment, which, as I have made out, is connected. Once again the amendments are necessary to ensure that the bill actually stamps out age based discrimination, rather than simply paying lip service to the concept. We are concerned that is what the current bill does, although we do not want to be too critical. Age based harassment is an entrenched facet of many workplaces and must expressly be prohibited in this bill to maximise the effectiveness of and minimise any legal uncertainty surrounding this bill. If possible, what we do not want to see—unfortunately sometimes it is hard to avoid it altogether but at least we can try to minimise it—is the courts' involvement in trying to determine what this bill is. These amendments try to overcome that. We acknowledge that they are not going to be successful in every case, but we think they are a better approach than what the government has put forward and we think they improve the overall position. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, as Senator Sherry acknowledged earlier in relation to its work on migration, has on this matter—I am a member of the committee and perhaps I make my comments more to the other members—worked solidly to ensure that these issues are well aired and that parties have an ability to express their views to the committee so that the committee comes up with a well-considered report. I have covered most of the issues that I wanted to in relation to these amendments. I thank the Senate in committee. ",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—We Democrats will support Labor amendments (1), (2), (3) and (4). Amendments (1), (2) and (4) will extend the prohibition against age discrimination so that it incorporates, as Senator Ludwig said, provisions in relation to discrimination on the basis of the age of a person's relative or associate. That is one of many issues that was raised in a number of submissions to the committee, including those from the Council on the Ageing, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, ACOSS and HREOC. These amendments are designed to apply to circumstances such as discrimination against an individual who may be caring for an elderly relative or perhaps, as the Hon. John von Doussa, President of HREOC suggested in some of his evidence, a mother who is discriminated against because she has a young child. We Democrats believe it is important to protect individuals against discrimination in those circumstances. In fact, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee inquiry also took the view that this was important and recommended that the bill be amended accordingly.
The committee also noted that other antidiscrimination legislation contains similar provisions, so we Democrats welcome this particular suite of amendments from Labor which will broaden legislation against age discrimination. We also support Labor amendment (3) to extend the definition of discrimination to include harassment. The failure of the bill thus far to prohibit harassment does distinguish it from other Commonwealth antidiscrimination legislation. ACOSS and ALHR both argued that the bill should be amended to include such a provision, and we agree with that. We believe, too, that the Commonwealth really has a responsibility to provide legislative protection against harassment on the basis of a person's age. For that reason, a little later on we will be dealing with Democrat amendment (11), which seeks to achieve that similarly. However, we are happy to concede that on this occasion Labor's amendment is perhaps more appropriately worded, and we therefore support Labor's amendment. I give notice that we will later withdraw Democrat amendment (11).",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-23,"—One of the concerns the Australian Greens have with this piece of legislation is that it does not deal with the issue of harassment, so we will certainly be supporting the amendment that we are discussing at the moment to ensure that age discrimination legislation is more comprehensive in its cover and that it does deal with the issue of harassment on the basis of age.
We will equally be supporting the other amendments that deal with relatives being included within the context of this legislation: for example, in circumstances where women are discriminated against on the basis of having young children to care for or of having older parents they are looking after—anywhere they have caring responsibilities that are a part of who they are, a part of the contribution they make to the community and a part of ensuring that they are looking after quality of life for themselves as individuals and for their families and communities. These are the examples and instances of why we need this kind of legislation—to ensure that, in terms of the contribution they make to our society, people who have young children or older parents they are looking after are not discriminated against on the basis of these other responsibilities they have to the broader community and to their families. The Greens will be supporting the amendments that are being debated at the moment. ",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—The government will be opposing these four amendments which deal with the extension of the coverage of the legislation to an associate or relative of the person concerned and which also deal with the question of harassment. The government is of the view that it is not appropriate to extend the concept of unlawful age discrimination to cover an agreed person's relative or associate. If that discrimination were to take place, we believe there are other avenues available. For instance, Senator Nettle has just cited the case of a woman with young children seeking employment. We believe that the Sex Discrimination Act or the workplace relations legislation could cover that. Similarly, if someone has a disabled relative, they are covered by other pieces of legislation. The government is of the view that extending the legislation in this manner is not appropriate.
In relation to the question of consultation—and this was an aspect we raised during the course of framing this legislation—different views were expressed about whether the proposed Commonwealth age discrimination legislation should prohibit harassment on the ground of age. Employers and business groups felt that the concept was too vague and could cause spurious complaints about legitimate workplace requirements. It was noted that state legislation does not generally prohibit harassment, other than sexual harassment, and I think that is an important point to remember.
Other groups, however, expressed the view that provisions against age based harassment were appropriate, and the government decided on balance that introducing this concept would not necessarily achieve the objectives of the bill. Indeed, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee expressed the view that not providing an offence of harassment is consistent with the bill's objective of achieving attitudinal change. That committee did say that it should be extended to relatives and associates but, for the reasons I have outlined, the government did not see its way clear to accepting that recommendation. For those reasons, the government does not support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-23,"—I would like to ask the minister about his response regarding the government not supporting the expansion of the definition of who should be covered by this legislation. Can the minister tell the committee whether, in the circumstances where an individual is caring for elderly parents—not necessarily disabled parents but elderly parents—he believes there is any other legislation under which they could be assured of not being discriminated against in terms of their capacity to engage in employment or on other issues?",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—The Sex Discrimination Act enables relief to be sought in relation to direct discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities which takes the form of dismissal from employment. Likewise, the Workplace Relations Act provides that it is unlawful to take family responsibilities into account in relation to termination of employment. That covers the situation Senator Nettle has outlined. Both these acts prohibit discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities in certain circumstances. I mentioned children before; now Senator Nettle mentions elderly parents being looked after. That comes under the ambit of family responsibilities. Persons faced with discrimination because of their responsibilities to care for children, elderly parents and relatives are able to seek redress for discrimination based on their family responsibilities under the two pieces of legislation I have mentioned, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Workplace Relations Act. I might add that many industrial awards provide leave for employees in relation to family responsibilities. ",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-23,—I thank the minister for his answer. I am not sure whether in his answer he was indicating examples where people would not face discrimination on the basis of being dismissed from their position. I am wondering whether that is the limit of the capacity or whether the discrimination example you provide would cover people with elderly parents or young children whom they were caring for in other facets of their engagement in the community rather than just their dismissal from employment.,SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—The provision I mentioned relates to dismissal from employment. The issue of application for employment is something that I am taking on notice. It may take a moment. If there are any other matters Senator Nettle wishes to raise in the meantime, she can do that. That is something we can come back to in the course of the committee debate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—The Democrats oppose clause 6 in the following terms:
(2)	Clause 6, page 6 (lines 21 to 26), TO BE OPPOSED.
The Democrats seek to remove altogether clause 6 from the bill. Clause 6 provides that for the purposes of the legislation:
... a reference to discrimination against a person on the ground of the person's age is taken not to include a reference to discrimination against a person on the ground of a disability of the person (within the meaning of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992).
Quite simply, we Democrats see no particular justification for the inclusion of such a provision in the bill. We believe that a person who has been discriminated against should have the opportunity to pursue a remedy under either piece of legislation. As the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission indicated during the committee inquiry into the bill, it is well equipped to deal with any overlap between the two forms of discrimination, since its existing complaints processes and mechanisms allow for the determination of complaints relating to multiple grounds of discrimination—and that has always been the case with HREOC and its jurisdiction. So we would seek to remove that clause altogether and see no particular value in maintaining that clause within the bill as it stands.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—The opposition sees its way clear to supporting the Democrats on this issue. Labor sees it as reasonable to remove clause 6 from the bill, thereby not preventing a person who is discriminated against on the grounds of both their age and a disability from pursuing remedies under either piece of legislation. I think that is the important point. Senator Greig made that well. In the administration of both pieces of legislation there are clear provisions for multiple grounds of discrimination to be heard by HREOC. We can see no reason why someone should be discriminated against on the grounds of both their age and their disability and not be able to make complaints against their discriminator on both these grounds, rather than trying to choose one under one particular act or run two separate actions under separate acts. It does not make sense, quite frankly. Unless the government can provide some compelling new evidence or reasons as to why this provision should remain in the act, we will be supporting the Democrat amendment to remove this clause. ",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-23,"—The Greens will also be supporting this proposal. We recognise the instances that already exist where people who face multiple forms of discrimination have the capacity to make decisions about which form of discrimination they face. For example, if it is because of a non-English-speaking background and a disability then they can make determinations as to how they pursue those issues. We will certainly be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—The government does not support this proposal. It believes that clause 6 does provide some certainty and addresses the potential overlap between discrimination based on age and that based on disability. It has been suggested that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is already well enough equipped to deal with any overlap between these two forms of discrimination. The government's view, however, is that the law must deal clearly with possible overlap between different areas of discrimination and not leave any areas which might lead to uncertainty.
As I said, the point of clause 6 is to make clear that where an act constitutes age and disability discrimination it must be dealt with under the Disability Discrimination Act. This was certainly something the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee supported. It stated that it considered that clause 6 is appropriate to provide certainty in relation to matters that involve disability and age discrimination issues. For that reason we believe clause 6 should stand as printed.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—It is necessary to at least argue that the minister has not provided a cogent reason. The issue that it should be allowable to deal with both under the one act is a more compelling argument. I do not think the minister has made the case but I will not draw it out any longer than that, other than to say those few words in relation to that. We will still support the Democrat amendment.
 (Senator Bolkus)—The question is that clause 6 stand as printed.
Question negatived.
—The next amendment is Democrat amendment No. 3 on sheet 3227, which is the same as opposition amendment No. 5 on sheet 3224.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—I move Democrat amendment (3) on sheet 3227:
(3)	Clause 16, page 14 (lines 1 to 6), omit the clause, substitute:
16 Act done because of age and for other reasons
	If:
	(a)	an act is done for 2 or more reasons; and 
	(b)	one of the reasons is the age of a person (whether or not it is the dominant reason for doing the act);
then, for the purposes of this Act, the act is taken to be done for that reason.
I note that the opposition had a similarly worded amendment, so the amendment would appear to attract support. At its heart, the amendment goes to removing the dominant purpose test of the bill. This test means that if an act is committed for two or more reasons, one of which is the age of the person, it will only be discriminatory if the age of the person was the dominant reason for committing that act. This test does not apply in the context of any other piece of Commonwealth antidiscrimination legislation. We do not think the government has provided a compelling reason why it should apply in relation to age discrimination. Moreover, by including the dominant purpose test in this legislation but not in any other antidiscrimination legislation, the implication is that protection from age discrimination is less important than protection against other forms of discrimination. We find that unacceptable. 
We note that HREOC has argued that the inclusion of the dominant purpose test in this bill will make it more difficult for complaints to succeed and will give rise to litigation with regard to the meaning of `dominant purpose'. It is also important to note that the dominant purpose test was previously included in the Racial Discrimination Act but was removed because its practical application gave rise to too many complications. If the dominant purpose test was unworkable in the context of the Racial Discrimination Act there is no reason to believe that its practical implementation will be any less complicated in the bill before us—that is, the Age Discrimination Bill. To conclude, the Democrats believe that the dominant purpose test is not strong enough and will present practical difficulties. It should be removed from the bill through the amendment that we have before us.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—I will just do some tidying up. It does not matter who actually moves the amendment because Democrat amendment (3) and opposition amendment (5) are exactly the same. They seek to do the same thing. On that basis I foreshadow that I will not move amendment (5). We support amendment (3) in relation to clause 16 of the bill, which is the dominant purpose test. The current test contained in the bill, as has been pointed out, is too weak to stamp out age based discrimination in the wider community. The legal loophole created by the dominant purpose test means that discrimination prohibition will only be enforceable in the most extreme cases. In those instances they will be surrounded by litigation and expense.
This amendment brings Commonwealth policy in line with other Commonwealth legislation. It will mean that this bill will actually deliver outcomes rather than provide rhetoric. During the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill it was surprising to discover that there exists other Commonwealth legislation that provides what is being proposed here today, but the government has sought to use a weaker test than that provided in other legislation of this order. In my and the opposition's view, without this amendment it will be almost impossible for complainants to make out the proof under the new regime.
There was extensive consultation in relation to the bill, as I understand it. Although the government sometimes do not get any recognition—perhaps `praise' is not the right word to use in some instances—for taking a consultative approach in these issues, in this instance by and large they did. They put out an information paper with proposals for Commonwealth age discrimination legislation. That began in December 2002 and it went forward. Most issues were examined and considered. However, in relation to this provision I am not convinced that they did take a consultative approach. I will wait for the government to inform me about the consultative process they did take in relation to this provision to ensure that it did meet the expectations of the participants involved in the consultative process, but it is a matter for the government whether they wish to respond to that aside. The real issue is that the test that the Democrats put up and that we similarly put up and support is a much better test. It is reflected in other Commonwealth legislation and should be reflected here as well. ",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—The government oppose this amendment. We believe that the dominant reason test in clause 16 is sufficient to achieve the attitudinal change which I mentioned before. This is designed to send a clear message that age stereotyping is unacceptable. It does that but without restricting employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers who are acting in good faith. In the preparation of this bill we have seen instances of jobs for which an employer is entitled to take age into account. We have exemptions for that. For instance, it might involve physical activity. There may be other exemptions, which I have touched on.
We do appreciate that in other discrimination legislation which the Commonwealth has passed we have the test of any reason. That relates to race and sex particularly. But in this particular case we believe that if you reduce that threshold in relation to clause 16 you will end up with more problems than you would otherwise have. It would perhaps hamper and not advance the cause of people who may be young or old. Remember, this is an age discrimination bill. We have been talking largely about older people but we have to remember that it will apply to younger people as well.
We believe this situation is not quite as cut and dried, if you like, as in the case of discrimination on sexual or racial grounds. Certainly there were different views during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's hearings. That committee preferred the any reason test, as I recall. But the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry supported the dominant reason test for the reasons I have outlined. Of course, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission opposed it. We can see the different arguments. But, again on balance, the government believe that reducing that threshold in clause 16 would attract more problems than otherwise and therefore we oppose this amendment.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—As I indicated earlier—and it did take me a second to find it—I think one of the failings of the minister's arguments in relation to this is that there were a number of submitters to the inquiry, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, that supported the justifications for the dominant reason test. They did concede, however, that they had only really turned their minds to it—they are my words, but I think they would agree—and considered the dominant purpose test effect within the workplace setting, not outside the setting of the workplace. So to rely on them is to rely on only a very narrow area. Mr Peter Anderson, representing the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, indicated that the dominant test would assist employers in, as he said, minimising the risk of being exposed to the complaints and costs involved, but he did not expand outside of that. He confined his remarks to within the employment sphere. HREOC are a much better organisation to take a broad community based view. They opposed the introduction of the dominant purpose test. HREOC were of the view that the dominant reason test would make it more difficult for complaints to succeed. Labor adopts that view and I think they are right in that respect.
The real issue, as I alluded to earlier—and I found the particular section that I wanted to go to—was that the evidence from the representatives of the Attorney-General's Department indicated that there was no public consultation on providing a test different to other antidiscrimination laws. So the praise that I gave you for providing an information paper on proposals for Commonwealth age discrimination legislation remains valid. It is a good process, and I encourage you to continue to do the work that you have been doing in public consultation. This issue does not fall under that umbrella. It was an issue that came outside of that umbrella. Relying on the broader consultative framework may have come up with a different answer—it may have in fact come up with the answer which both the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats have come up with today. I commend that to the committee.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—As outlined in amendment (4) on sheet 3227, the Democrats oppose clause 25 in the following terms:
(4)	Clause 25, page 23 (lines 6 to 15), TO BE OPPOSED.
This amendment goes to the heart of youth wages. We Democrats have long opposed the concept of youth wages. Our view is that people should receive equal pay for equal work and that should not be determined on the basis of age. As such we do not believe that youth wages ought to be exempted from the bill. As we previously argued, young people are required to pay the same amount for food, rent and clothing as other Australians. Only full-time students have access to public transport and other concessions. Moreover, the Democrats believe it is unjustifiable to, on the one hand, confer on 18-year-olds the same rights and responsibilities as other adults—including the rights to vote, to consume alcohol and to drive a vehicle and the responsibility of being held fully accountable for their actions under the law—and yet, on the other hand, pay them less for performing the same duties in the workplace as other adults.
Youth wages as a concept convey the implicit message that work undertaken by young people is less valuable than work undertaken by older people. It suggests that the worth of a worker is to be determined according to their age rather than their skills, training or experience. They represent a fundamental contravention of the principle of equal pay for equal work, which is enshrined in international and human rights conventions to which Australia is a signatory, not the least of which is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Youth wages, we believe, are inherently discriminatory. The policy justifications advanced in their favour are unconvincing. We Democrats do not believe that reducing the pay of young Australians is the way to create job opportunities for them. For all of those reasons we Democrats take the view that youth wages should not be exempted from the prohibition against age discrimination. This amendment seeks to address that through the bill we have in front of us.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—Labor have of course given careful consideration to this issue. It is not a new issue; it has arisen in this place, in other forums and in other arguments. However, when we look at the sense of this legislation, Labor are not convinced by the arguments put forward by the Australian Democrats that these amendments are critical at this stage for the passing of this bill. We acknowledge that it is a very complex issue and not one that can be easily sorted through. There is complexity that surrounds this issue, with the interaction of industrial awards, certified agreements and the like and youth wages. There obviously may be improvements or changes proposed to the legislation at any time in the future. If such a case became fully apparent after being argued with sufficient evidence, we might be of a mind to look at it a lot harder. We have certainly looked at this very hard but we cannot see ourselves supporting it in relation to the way it has been put forward with this bill. ",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-23,"—As others have indicated, much of the discrimination that is faced by older people is also faced by younger people. It is disappointing that in the form of this legislation there appears to be a focus on the discrimination that older people face and no recognition with anywhere near the same emphasis of the discrimination that younger people face. The clearest example of this is the exemption of youth wages from this piece of legislation. Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. That covenant says that signatories are obliged to ensure that everyone has a right to `fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind'. It is difficult to reconcile this obligation with the youth wage, which by definition is a reduced wage given to a worker on the basis of their age. The Greens are inherently opposed to the discrimination that is a part of youth wages and will be supporting this amendment to remove the exemption for youth wages from the legislation.
We have campaigned with trade unions and many other voices in supporting the introduction of competency based wage systems rather than age based payments. Youth wages are discriminatory because they allow an employer to say, `You will be paid less for what you are doing, even though it is exactly the same as what your fellow worker is doing, based purely on how old you are.' Youth wages reinforce the stereotype that young people are in some way less competent. They make the value judgment that, because you are younger, the work you do is inherently less worth while. They say to young people: `When you turn 18, you are expected to contribute and have responsibilities. Whether it be voting or participating in society in a range of different ways, we expect you to have these responsibilities. But the work that you do is less valuable than that done by your 22-year-old colleague.' This is not a message the Greens believe it is appropriate to send to young people who are trying to be part of our work force.
The government recognises the discriminatory nature of youth wages by exempting them from the bill. The government believes that young people get a foothold in the employment market through youth wages, but the evidence does not support that. In 1999, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission found in its junior rates inquiry that youth rates were of little use in securing a direct entry to full-time employment. The real effect of youth wages is to put young people at greater risk of poverty. They still have the same bills to pay and pay the same price for food and the same price for rent and yet through a spurious argument the government believes that they should be paid less money for the work that they do in their community. It is an important amendment to support. The Greens will be supporting it and we recommend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-23,"—It was part of the government's election policy that it would work with businesses and communities to ensure that this legislation was fair and struck the right balance between the need to eliminate unfair discrimination on the basis of age and the need to ensure sufficient flexibility to specifically allow for situations where age requirements have particular policy significance: for example, in relation to youth wages, job training and social security. I highlight youth wages because that was an aspect that we went to the election on. The proposal is to remove the exemption covering youth wages. Youth wages have been specifically exempted. This will allow the payment of youth wages as well as advertising and selection for youth wage positions. The government believes that that is advantageous and for these reasons opposes the amendment. 
 (Senator Bolkus)—The question is that clause 25 stand as printed.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 3227:
(5)	Clause 33, page 29 (line 13), after “intended”, insert “and reasonably required”.
(6)	Clause 33, page 29 (line 20), after “intended”, insert “and reasonably required”.
Democrat amendments (5) and (6) seek to introduce an objective element into the test relating to positive discrimination. The exemption for acts involving positive discrimination is of course an important one, so we must ensure that it does operate effectively. HREOC has expressed concern that in its current form this exemption may actually undermine the objective of the proposed legislation to eliminate age discrimination. This is because the way in which the exemption has been worded gives rise to a subjective test rather than an objective one. The test relies on whether or not the act in question is `intended' to meet the need of a particular age group—not whether it is likely to actually meet that need. In this respect the test differs from the positive discrimination test used in other pieces of Commonwealth antidiscrimination legislation. The government has provided no explanation for that change. What we Democrats seek to do with this amendment is ensure that whether or not an act will meet the need of a particular age group is assessed objectively and according to community standards of reasonableness. These amendments respond directly to the recommendation made by HREOC, and we believe that HREOC is best placed to identify potential problems associated with the practical implementation of exemptions.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-23,"—Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator O'Brien in relation to communications between the government and Qantas concerning security matters. I have a further response from Minister Anderson in response to that question and I seek leave to have that incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
I can confirm that:
	The government invests significant resources in keeping the Australian aviation industry informed about any threats to its interests
	The aviation industry is routinely informed of the nature and level of threat and any changes that they need to know in order to develop their protective security arrangements.
	Should information of a definite nature or a specific threat be received, those who need to know are immediately informed and provided with assistance to put in place appropriate counter measures.
	As Mr Anderson said on the `Sunday' programme, Qantas, subsequent to Mr Carl Sullivan's remarks of last week, clarified this matter by indicating they are satisfied with the current arrangements concerning the provision of security information
	Senator O'Brien raised the issue of information in relation to Japan. There was not an incident, as claimed in the Senator's question.
	What did occur was that Japanese regulators introduced additional security measures for airlines flying to and from Japan. 
	Qantas sought information about the additional security measures. I am advised that Australian Government agencies provided speedy and accurate information to Qantas about the additional security measures and the reasons for them.
	Following further examination of all the matters raised over the last few days, the government has every reason to believe that communication arrangements between the government and
	Qantas have been and are continuing to work very effectively.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security: Transport</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1

It would mean in effect that we should not railroad this through here today but that we should wait at least until tomorrow. I believe that the Senate and the committee should consider that.
There is no urgency for this bill to say that it should not wait until there is proper consideration of the evidence before the committee and due weighing of that and the writing up of the reports. I believe that it should be made an order not for a later hour of today but at least for tomorrow. Remember, we are dealing here with a quite complex issue, one which is effectively taking East Timor's resources and placing them in the hands of Australia and the oil companies developing them. It is an extremely important matter and it will have ramifications for Australia and its relationship with its poor neighbour for decades to come. It should not be pushed through here at the rate it is and at the rate at which the amendment would have it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-23,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 14 May 2004:
Whether any pressure was put on the Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mr Keelty in relation to his views or comments on the connection between Australia's involvement in the war on Iraq and the threat to Australia's security and, in particular, what communications took place between the office of the Prime Minister, other ministerial advisers or public servants and Mr Keelty in his capacity as Police Commissioner in relation to that matter.
I move that motion because it is extremely important that in a working democracy, and in a bicameral system such as ours, the Senate act as a watchdog on the excesses of the government, particularly where you have a dominant government in the House of Representatives and particularly where you have a government in its third term that is forgetting that there is a clear delineation between politics in the country and policing of the country. Our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, has crossed the dividing line between politics in Australia and the policing of Australia. We know from the public evidence that a week ago the Prime Minister interfered in a statement by the Australian Police Commissioner about terrorism, which of course is extremely important to the fabric of political discussion and to the security of this country in the current day and age.
On the Nine Network's Sunday program, Jana Wendt interviewed AFP Commissioner Keelty. She said:
Well, Commissioner, that brings me to the question that most Australians are asking themselves. Could this happen here? 
That is, could a terrorist attack happen in Australia? Commissioner Keelty responded:
Well, I think we've said all along this is an uphill battle. This is a marathon, not a sprint. The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq. And I don't think anyone's been hiding the fact that we do believe that ultimately one day, whether it be in one month's time, one year's time, or ten years' time, something will happen.
And no one can guarantee it won't. And I think there's a level of honesty that has to exist here in terms of what the problems are here, not only in Australia but in our region.
But on the threat level, the threat level here in Australia hasn't changed. It still remains at medium. It has been at medium for some time for an attack on Australians in Australia.
What Commissioner Keelty was saying is commonsense. If it is established that Islamic extremists were responsible for the outrage in Madrid then you can take it from there that it is likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other countries like Australia took in involving themselves in the invasion and continued occupation of Iraq. That is commonsense and an opinion poll since Sunday week has shown that two out of three Australians recognise that as commonsense. But as far as the Prime Minister of Australia is concerned, it was not politically edifying. It was not to the government's political advantage so he had his chief of staff, Mr Sinodinos, contact Commissioner Keelty within minutes of that Channel 9 interview and express the displeasure, or at least the discomfort, of the Prime Minister about the words that Commissioner Keelty had used.
After some days of growing public concern about this and the revelation on the Tuesday that Mr Sinodinos had indeed made that contact, Commissioner Keelty felt the need to put out what is called a clarifying statement, which did not alter his comment on the risks at all but said that he had been taken out of context. The question here is not the comment of Commissioner Keelty at all. He is concerned that he has a responsibility to be open to Australians about matters relating to his police work—not least, of course, the security of the country when it comes to terrorism.
The Prime Minister's interference is a different matter altogether. It is not acceptable in our democracy that you have an elected representative in government—the most powerful political figure in the country—ringing the chief of police to say what should be said in public. That is a transgression. If it is allowed to pass, if it is not questioned and if there is not a breakthrough on the Prime Minister's refusal to discuss the matter then we will become effectively complicit in what has happened. I, for one, am not going to be complicit in this. The full strength of the Senate needs to be brought to bear in discovering how the Prime Minister's contact was made, why it was made, how it was followed up and why it led to Commissioner Keelty bringing out his subsequent statement.
The Senate has the power to establish a committee. It has the power to subpoena people and documents. It can certainly test the Prime Minister's faith with the country and with the democratic system in this country by asking even him to appear. The Prime Minister should appear before such a committee; so ought the police commissioner. This can be done in camera if necessary, and it should be done in a way which does not infringe on the primary interest of the public—the public interest of this country. To let it ride—to say that we should do nothing and should simply allow a system in which prime ministers ring police commissioners, heads of security services or heads of armed services to dictate or to influence what is said in the public arena by these esteemed public officers who know full well their primary duty to the government, the people and the long-term interests of this country—is not acceptable. 
The Senate should be supporting this motion. The opportunity to direct the public servants who may be involved, the staff officers who may be involved and the principal figures to appear before such a committee is compelling. There is one alternative. That is that the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, be direct, honest and aboveboard with the Australian people and explain the instructions he gave to Mr Sinodinos and others on his staff in contacting Commissioner Keelty—why he did that and how he can show that it was in the public interest to do that rather than in the political interest of a Prime Minister heading towards an election within months and rattled by the new debate that has arisen in the Australian community about not just the propriety but also the good sense of our nation's involvement in the war in Iraq.
Let me make my assessment of this clear. We cannot allow terrorists to dictate what this nation does, what it thinks or how it acts—never: not now, not in the past and not in the future. Any robust democracy must not allow that to even enter into the debate. On the other hand, we cannot allow the political and public debate about terrorism to be unnecessarily truncated. It was in the public interest for Mr Keelty to express his point of view. It was, after all, sheer commonsense. It is not in the public interest to have the Prime Minister intervene in that for his own political purposes. This was an egregious and premeditated mistake by Prime Minister Howard. Where is his explanation for it? Where is his apology not just to Mr Keelty but also to the nation? It is not there. One is led to wonder what else this Prime Minister is prepared to do to further his own political kudos, or rather to cover his own sliding political fortunes by crossing the boundaries of democratic decency and what is understood in this country to be the divide between such things as policing functions and political interests.
Prime Minister Howard put political interest before the interests of this country. It is in the interests of this country that Commissioner Keelty and other major figures involved should be able to put on the public record their assessment of how this nation is proceeding. I do not for one minute think that these officers are going to fail the public interest. Certainly Commissioner Keelty did not do so on this occasion. He was serving the public interest. His problem was that he was not serving Prime Minister Howard's interests. There is a divergence between the two, and that says something about the mood of this nation at the moment. The Prime Minister's interest here was not the interests of the nation. When that occurs and when the Prime Minister infracts upon proper practice, as he has done on this occasion, he deserves to come under the full scrutiny of the Senate, of the other place in this parliament which, amongst its other functions, is a check on the executive government—in this case the executive government of Prime Minister Howard. It is more limited than that: it is actually government from the prime ministerial office.
This move for a Senate inquiry is the strongest move we can make. I say to other senators on this side of the house that it should be supported. I do not want there to be any stone left unturned in pursuit of the Prime Minister—he can defend himself—and the discovery of the motivation and the means he used to further his political interest in this matter. That is what this inquiry is about and that is why this inquiry should be supported. I note that the opposition is seeking papers and documents. I say to the opposition that we should also be seeking the people involved. We all know that a Senate inquiry, which is able to get people to appear before it, is always much more successful than simply getting together papers to discuss them and to see whether or not they give some further clue as to how the government is behaving. The inquiry should be held now. It should be supported today. It should use the full powers of the Senate to discover the whole truth of this matter. That is why the Greens have brought it forward. 
We know that there is the potential here for distress to be caused. We believe that the chief of police should be able to get on with his business. We also believe that this matter will not be settled unless every effort is made as soon as possible—and that time is now—to have it fully aired publicly and a determination made on it. Then we can move on. I am afraid that any other course of action will not achieve that goal. I know we must all be concerned in this place that with the Prime Minister we have and the way in which he works behind the scenes to influence events—with the way in which this government has invented information and has deceived, not least in the matter of sending Australians to war in Iraq at the behest of the Bush administration in America—it would be very difficult to extract all the information from the Prime Minister. He can exclude himself from the reach of the Senate, but let us reach those that we can. Let us get the information we can. Let us test this Prime Minister, and his administration, in the best way that we are able to—which is by supporting this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-23,"—The public bullying of AFP Commissioner Keelty by the Howard government is certainly a serious matter. It is not surprising that this issue has dominated the media for more than a week and it is not surprising that this issue has dominated the Australian parliament over the last two days. Ask yourself why this affair has attracted so much interest. I think there are a number of reasons. It is not proper for a government to heavy an independent statutory office holder to toe the government line. The subject of the heavying, Commissioner Keelty, is held in high regard for his efforts to combat terrorism in Australia and abroad.
The comments for which the commissioner was heavied seemed to be reasonable and, frankly, quite unremarkable. The government's reaction to those comments was absolutely over the top, giving the impression of a panicked Prime Minister. As a result of the media scrutiny and the parliamentary scrutiny, we have a pretty good picture of what transpired. I would like to set out for the Senate what we know. We have the appalling terrorist attack in Madrid occurring on 11 March. It was one of the worst attacks in Europe since the Second World War, killing 202 people and injuring more than 1,500. In the following days, as many began to wonder if the terrorist attack was the work of al-Qaeda, Commissioner Keelty told Jana Wendt on the Sunday program on 14 March, and I quote:
The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.
Immediately after the interview, and still in the Channel 9 studio, Commissioner Keelty received a phone call from the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Arthur Sinodinos. According to Steve Lewis's report in the Australian on Tuesday, 16 March, the call was terse and Commissioner Keelty was personally chastised by Mr Sinodinos for contradicting the government claim that the Iraq war had not increased the terrorist threat to Australia. Sydney Morning Herald columnist Alan Ramsey wrote that the Prime Minister's media adviser, Tony O'Leary, confirmed Mr Sinodinos made the call to Commissioner Keelty after a conversation with the Prime Minister. In the ensuing days, we heard a number of ministers, and the Prime Minister, disagreeing with Commissioner Keelty and questioning the commissioner's ability to make such a judgment. For instance, on Monday, 15 March the Attorney-General, Mr Philip Ruddock, said: 
Well that's not a conclusion I would agree with because the evidence doesn't suggest that that is likely.
On the 7.30 Report on Monday, 15 March, Mr Howard went further, questioning whether Commissioner Keelty was in a position to make such a comment and comparing his assessments with those of ASIO Director-General, Dennis Richardson. I quote the Prime Minister:
And that is part of the background as to why somebody such as the Director General of ASIO, who, with all due respect to the other people you've mentioned, is a more authoritative person than most on the motives and the modus operandi of terrorist organisations.
There is a difference between the intelligence judgments that are brought to bear in relation to these organisations and the operational functions of police commissioners and police forces.
They are quite separate issues, and quite separate and different judgments are brought to bear.
But then on Tuesday, 16 March we had Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, as usual, going a bridge too far; this is his modus operandi. He told journalists in a doorstop interview at Parliament House:
I think he—
this is Commissioner Keelty, I interpolate—
is just expressing—expressing a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we're getting from al Qa'eda. I think what the bottom line of all this is is that they—al Qa'eda—are out there running this line on Iraq, and they're doing it for propaganda purposes.
Then we had General Cosgrove, the Chief of the Defence Force, tell journalists:
I disagree with him—
I interpolate again: the `him' is Commissioner Keelty—
on this occasion.
That was on 16 March. Then, according to the Australian, Commissioner Keelty was so concerned by the government attacks on his reputation that he seriously considered resigning. After the Sunday interview, according to Alan Ramsey, Mr Howard's office began `heavying' Commissioner Keelty over the phone, telling him to stay away from the media. Throughout Tuesday the Prime Minister's office continued to press Commissioner Keelty to issue a clarification of his Sunday remarks. According to the Age newspaper, the PM&C Secretary, Peter Shergold, `negotiated' with Commissioner Keelty over the press statement. According to Alan Ramsey, the offices of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General were also involved in drafting the statement and, when completed, it was `vetted' by Mr Howard's office. By Tuesday evening the Prime Minister's office had successfully pressured Commissioner Keelty into issuing a press statement to `clarify' his remarks on the Sunday program. After the release of the statement we have Alexander Downer again. He put on that incredible performance on Lateline: he did a complete U-turn. I quote what he said on 16 March:
Now, as for Mr Keelty, let me just make a point about him if I could.
You are right, he has done a wonderful job in the fight against terrorism.
I'll never forget the fantastic job he's done with the Indonesians in the follow-up to the Bali bombing.
The extraordinary job he's done in the South Pacific, the work he's now doing with Papua New Guinea. 
He's an outstanding Australian.
He will go down in history as one of the great police commissioners and I certainly have no intention of reflecting on him or his professionalism.
He is an outstanding Australian.
On the Wednesday, ministers, the Prime Minister included, all changed their tune and began commending and praising the work of Commissioner Keelty. We had Attorney-General Ruddock saying:
I have the utmost respect for Mick Keelty. He's a very experienced officer ...
We had the Prime Minister saying:
I think he does his job extremely well.
Notwithstanding their ringing public endorsements of the commissioner, his original remarks still obviously rankle with the government. As recently as last Sunday the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, made this very clear when he said:
But look, I mean, people who work in Government agencies are expected to give frank and fearless advice to Government, but they are not free agents to be able to traverse every other area of responsibility as if they have relevant expertise in those areas.
It is not that Commissioner Keelty's original remarks were in any way remarkable: a number of terrorism and political experts have expressed a similar point of view. Professor Rohan Gunaratna, a former principal investigator with the United Nations Terrorism Prevention Branch and author of Inside Al Qaeda, told journalists on Monday, 15 March:
Certainly the conflict in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism world wide, especially to countries that have participated with the Americans in Iraq.
Clive Williams, Director of Terrorism Studies at the ANU, told Channel 10 on Wednesday, 17 March:
After our involvement in East Timor we were probably in the top twenty of preferred targets, and then after Afghanistan probably the top ten and I think after Iraq probably in the top four.
Then John Pistole, the FBI's executive assistant director of counter-terrorism, told 2UE radio in Sydney:
Any country that allies itself with the US, unfortunately, is a target. Whether it's a higher target is a relative issue that becomes moot once the place is attacked.
Let me quote what, back in August last year, ASIO Director-General Dennis Richardson said about the war in Iraq:
It's too early to tell what impact the war in Iraq will have, more broadly, on the threat of terrorism.
We are only up to chapter 6 in a 10 chapter book, with the last four chapters yet to be written.
At one end of the spectrum Iraq could be another Afghanistan in providing a cause celebre for young Muslims worldwide. At the other end of the spectrum Iraq might be re-made, with positive consequences for the Middle East.
That is from the ASIO Director-General's address to the Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association's annual conference in Brisbane. Last week Mr Richardson made similar remarks when he addressed the Security in Government Conference in Canberra:
The fact we are in close alliance with the United States and the fact that we were early and actively involved in the war on terrorism does contribute to us being a target.
Paul Wolfowitz, the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, told Fox News that Spain `has been a real stand-up country, and I suppose maybe that's one of the reasons they came under attack'. On Thursday morning, when Minister Downer was asked by the AM program if Paul Wolfowitz was wrong, Mr Downer said:
Look, everybody is entitled to their opinion, even the Australian Government is entitled to an opinion. 
Everybody is entitled to an opinion except Commissioner Keelty!
The treatment of Commissioner Keelty is not the first time a public servant has been pressured by the Howard government to clarify a statement seen as politically sensitive. Just recall the treatment of the then Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Shackleton, in 2001. Do not forget that, after talking to Commander Banks on HMAS Adelaide and discovering the children overboard allegation was a lie, Vice Admiral Shackleton relayed this information to journalists at a press conference on 8 November 2001, three days before a federal election was held. It was a revelation. Vice Admiral Shackleton in effect told the media and the public that children had never been thrown overboard.
With only a few days remaining until an election, the government of course went into damage control. Instead of facing up to the truth, the government pressured Vice Admiral Shackleton to clarify his statement. What did we have? We had the Minister for Defence's chief of staff, Peter Hendy, telling Vice Admiral Shackleton that he had contradicted the minister and must issue a press release. Interestingly, Hendy asked that a copy of the statement be cleared with—you guessed it—Arthur Sinodinos. Same person, same style, same approach. What did the statement say? It went as follows:
My comments in no way contradict the Minister. I confirm the Minister was advised that Defence believed children had been thrown overboard.
A year later the CMI report would find that the then Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, had deceived the Australian people during the 2001 federal election campaign. At the time, the Prime Minister claimed no-one pressured Vice Admiral Shackleton to clarify his remarks. He told Lateline on 8 November 2001:
I'm not aware that anybody in my office has spoken to him—
that is Shackleton—
But I just want to make it clear I have not put pressure on him and I did not ask anybody to put any pressure on him.
I suppose it is true. I suppose it is true that the Prime Minister did not directly pressure Vice Admiral Shackleton; his colleagues did it for him. Sinodinos did the job for him, just like he did the job on this occasion, just as it was done in the case of Commissioner Keelty. That is how this mob operates. That is the modus operandi of the Howard government.
We have a very detailed picture of what actually happened in this case, how the heavying of Commissioner Keelty worked, and we know from the previous heavying of Vice Admiral Shackleton that it is standard operating procedure for the government. Even people as smart as Senator Hill can get caught up with this. He had to put out a clarifying statement himself, when he was honest about weapons of mass destruction this morning. He had to very quickly, after being up in a hot air balloon—a piece of interesting symbolism for a minister in this government—put out a clarifying statement.
—Did Arthur contact him? No!
—We do not know that, Senator Ray. I did ask him in question time but, again standard operating procedure: no answer from Senator Hill. You would not expect government ministers to come clean on these sorts of issues.
But Senator Hill is not the issue. We ought to be more concerned about the sort of pressure that is applied to senior public servants and, when similar pressure has been applied to them, when it is applied to public servants, to military officers and to statutory office holders. We know of two cases in detail; I have just gone through them. How many more have there been? The immediate question before the chair at the moment concerns a proposition moved by Senator Brown calling for a Senate inquiry. You have to ask yourself the question `Will a Senate inquiry illuminate the Keelty matter any more?' I do not think so. Consider those who the inquiry might want to call. You might want to start with the Prime Minister. He will not front. 
—He has taken a vow of silence.
—He has taken a vow of silence. Perhaps you might then go to the Prime Minister's chief of staff, Mr Sinodinos, a central player in this matter. He will not front. You would certainly want the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, to give evidence. He will not front. We have some idea of what happened in Attorney-General Ruddock's office. His staff will not front. Does anyone believe that Mr Downer would have the guts to front up? Of course not. No-one seriously believes that these key witnesses would give evidence to a Senate inquiry. We know that is the case.
Does anyone believe that the Howard government would be any more honest in answers to questions about this affair from a Senate committee than it has been in its answers in question time in the Senate, in the House of Representatives and in previous parliamentary inquiries? I do not think so. I certainly do not believe they would—that is my view. Of course, what you are left with is Commissioner Keelty, who may or may not be instructed to come to the committee if a committee were established. If he were so instructed, of course he would not front, so he would end up being the fall guy. That is not what I believe should happen and I do not think it is what any senator believes should happen.
I do not think we are in a position at this stage where we can say that we need a Senate inquiry to expose the government's reprehensible and ham-fisted behaviour on this particular matter and their ham-fisted and reprehensible behaviour towards Commissioner Keelty. The behaviour has been exposed and this government stands condemned for it. We will have an opportunity to question the government about any loose ends or new developments in this saga through question time and certainly through the Senate estimates process, where certain officials, including Commissioner Keelty, will be present.
There are other ways in which we can use the procedures and processes of this chamber to further expose the government's action. This afternoon, for example, I have given notice of a motion to require the government to table the drafts of the clarifying statement which was prepared for Commissioner Keelty. I hope the government conforms with that order of the Senate, if it is agreed to, by Tuesday of next week. There is also a motion I have moved co-jointly with the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett, which I would commend to the Senate. I want to say this: the opposition does sympathise with the motivation behind this motion and the good reasons Senator Brown has given for moving it. At this stage I have indicated we do not believe it warrants support, for all the cogent reasons I have outlined, but we will not give up on this issue. We will hold the government accountable on this matter. The truth will out.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-03-23,"—All the issues under discussion today go back to the intervention in Iraq. The reasons the government put forward for intervening in Iraq had to be carefully crafted. After all, they were subscribing to a new policy position of pre-emptive intervention. We were not intervening with the blessing or the authority of the United Nations; we were doing it as a pre-emptive act. Therefore the government had to carefully craft the reasons for intervention so that they could be argued in a consistent way with regard to international law and with an eye on domestic political agendas. Two reasons were put up. It was argued by the government that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Subsequently, on a better view, they no longer hold that position—although Senator Hill today still seems to hold out some hope somewhere that some weapon of mass destruction will be found, a view not shared by many. 
Interestingly enough, the second reason for intervening was the supposed sponsorship by Iraq of terrorist groups. It having been put at that time, I have never heard the argument repeated and I have heard no evidence adduced for that particular rationale since the successful conclusion of the Iraq intervention. They have captured thousands of individuals and there have been hundreds of thousands of interrogations, yet there has not been one piece of evidence put forward that the Iraqi regime, with all its massive faults, was a sponsor of terrorism. It is very important, incidentally, that we in fact isolate those countries that do sponsor terrorism, because the easiest way of wiping out international terrorism is getting host countries to change their mind about it. We all welcome the developments in Libya and Sudan—countries that previously were seen as sponsors of terrorist groups have now forsaken that as a course of action.
But, in part of this rationale for going into Iraq, another subtext emerged. That was to argue that our intervention in Iraq would not increase the possibility of a terrorist action occurring on Australian soil. It is a strange view. It is a political view—political spin here is more important than the national interest. That is why this view has been put forward. It does not sit well, though, with the counterviews held by Paul Wolfowitz—hardly a left-winger—who is the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the US and a long-time expert on terrorism. It does not sit well with some of the experts in the FBI and some of the UK experts on terrorism. A whole range of people have said that intervention in Iraq may up you in terms of the possibility of a terrorist act on your soil. This is well-known, so whatever comments Commissioner Keelty made were merely reflecting the view of many other experts around the globe.
I would make it clear that I do not expect any sovereign country to be browbeaten by threats from terrorists. We cannot afford that. A lot of people have talked about the Spanish experience and whether Spain was moved up the priority list. Quite possibly—not necessarily because terrorists even like Iraq or are concerned about Iraq but because it gives them an excuse. But, if you are looking for the reason that the Spanish government was thrown out, it probably was not the terrorist attack per se. It was the later political manipulation of the issue by a conservative government. To put it frankly, they tried to cash in. They immediately blamed ETA, the Basque separatists, when it never even looked like following a pattern of their previous activity, and they got caught out on it. Do you want to know why the turnout in the vote jumped from 57 per cent to 77 per cent within a few days? Because the public did not want to be conned by their government. The public of Spain wanted a government that would put the national interest at the forefront and not try to exploit it for domestic political purposes. Don't you get a sense of deja vu here with this government that constantly talks about the national interest but only ever dreams and thinks of its own political survival and political self-interest? 
Much of the debate about Commissioner Keelty's statement misses the point. Of course we were a target prior to Iraq—most open democratic societies are a target for these fanatics. The key question that Commissioner Keelty raised, simply so we could be properly prepared for it, was: have we moved up the priority list? Have these extremists used our intervention in Iraq as an excuse to move us up the list? He was basically saying that the answer to that is probably yes, as do all these other experts. What is so wrong with saying that? Understanding that, we can be better prepared to counteract it and to meet it in the future. But his problem was that he had undermined a central plank of political spin that sustains this particular government.
Such threats cannot govern our approach to terrorism, but what we want is an honest description of where we stand, not some contrived, false construction that deludes the Australian public. I do not want to hear any nonsense that intelligence suggests that we have not moved up the list. How would you know that through intelligence? Given the fact that strategic intelligence was a major failure with regard to Iraq, what has suddenly improved that this government could base its assessments on intelligence that says al-Qaeda has not targeted Australia more strongly because of intervention in Iraq? You would not know either way. 
I suspect we will never get to the truth of what really happened between the government and Commissioner Keelty. We will not know whether he threatened to resign or whether the clarifying statement was foisted upon him by government spin doctors. So why not have an inquiry? I answer: simply because it will not work. As Sheridan once said, I am quite happy to beat my head against a brick wall; I do not want to build one for that specific purpose. That is the problem with this particular inquiry proposed by Senator Brown.
I acknowledge and endorse the remarks by Senator Faulkner that on this occasion Senator Brown is totally well intentioned. A couple of times I have been unkind enough to say that inquiries wanted by Senator Brown were just a circus, a public display. But that is not his motivation on this stage; he is trying to get to the truth of the matter. Where we disagree is that I do not think you will get to the truth of the matter through this inquiry. In fact, I do not think this inquiry that he proposes can get anywhere because of the lack of witnesses.
Let us go through it. Who would you want to call to such an inquiry? I do not think we would have a disagreement between Senator Brown and me. We would want Prime Minister Howard to front up, but there is the tradition of comity between the houses, which is usually an adequate excuse for him not to appear and certainly not to be compelled. We would want to know what instructions he gave Mr Sinodinos before he rang the police commissioner. We would want to know why he did it so rapidly. Why not wait till Commissioner Keelty got home or back to his office? Why ring him at the Channel 9 studios? It was by mobile phone, so they may not have known it. But why react so rapidly? It has nothing to do with the national interest. If you impinge on Liberal Party self-interest, there is an immediate reaction.
Another question is: why didn't Mr Howard ring Commissioner Keelty himself? Why did he give it to his hatchet man to do? Why not ring the commissioner and say, `I think we have a difference of opinion here. Can we discuss it next week?' No, no, no. Get the hatchet man to ring him up, because it is more humiliating to slap the police commissioner around when it is a mere staffer, albeit a highly paid one. Why did the Prime Minister at a later time, by Monday, seek to invoke the Director-General of ASIO into the dispute? To put Mr Keelty down, he says, `I'm really going to rely on what the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, tells me.' I can imagine how happy Mr Richardson would be to be dragged into this argument. That was a tool by the Prime Minister, again to humiliate the police commissioner. It is the same sort of thing as the Prime Minister waving an ONA report around on 8 November 2001 to save his political skin over `children overboard'—`We have it in the report that backs up our point of view'— 
—The same day Sinodinos got to Shackleton.
—That is right, exactly the same, Senator. The next question we would like to ask the Prime Minister is: why did you involve the secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet in this? Why did Dr Peter Shergold have to go and negotiate with the police commissioner? I cannot speak for him but I am sure he was not happy to do so. It was probably the last thing he wanted to do, so why involve him? If the police commissioner wanted to change or clarify any of his statements of the previous Sunday, why not just leave him to it? Why was it necessary to get a government negotiator involved in this? Again, we have no answers to this.
Once things start to go pear-shaped, suddenly we have a Prime Minister that impersonates a Trappist monk and takes a vow of silence. Suddenly our voluble Prime Minister becomes the soul of discretion. In an interview on Adelaide radio that has to be acknowledged as a fairly friendly interview, the following exchange took place—this is last Thursday, after five days of endless comment:
REPORTER: Prime Minister, did your office urge Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty to issue a clarification over his remarks linking the Madrid bombings to Spain's involvement in Iraq?
JOHN HOWARD: I'm not going to comment on that story.
REPORTER: Why not?
JOHN HOWARD: Because I'm not commenting on it.
REPORTER: You can't say whether Mr Keelty's statement on Tuesday was made after a request from your office?
JOHN HOWARD: I don't have any comment on those matters.
Yesterday at question time in another place the Prime Minister was asked by the Leader of the Opposition:
What did the Prime Minister instruct his chief of staff to say to Mr Keelty?
Mr Howard replied:
... there are numerous discussions between not only my office and the secretary of my department and also the commissioner but other people. I do not intend to break the confidentiality of those discussions.
I interpolate: I will just get Tony to leak it out to the press. The Leader of the Opposition goes on to ask the Prime Minister:
What involvement did the Prime Minister, his staff or ... his department have in the preparation of the so-called statement of clarification issued by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner on 16 March?
Our Prime Minister says:
That statement was the commissioner's statement. As to contact ... I do not intend to go into it ... 
So much for an honest, open approach. Where government requires transparency we have a Prime Minister, as the Americans would say, who takes the Fifth Amendment. We have a Prime Minister not willing to justify publicly the actions of his sanctioned assassin who carried out the task in private. This is from someone who had the temerity, indeed the impertinence, to accuse former opposition leader Kim Beazley of lacking ticker. Come on down, Prime Minister. You have made a major miscalculation. Why don't you own up to it? You must really be going bad, Prime Minister, if you are not fronting up on the Ray Martin program to explain yourself. That is when you know the Prime Minister has gone totally maggoty on an issue. Do not accuse anyone else of lack of ticker in future if you are not willing to front. If you are not willing to justify your actions, as Prime Minister, never accuse anyone else of lacking ticker. 
The second witness we would like to see brought before the inquiry, if we had one, is chief of staff Mr Sinodinos. But again, he will not be available because he works under the MoP(S) Act—not subject to its salary limitations; he has been paid well above that for a number of years. Because of the `children overboard' and other precedents, we cannot call Mr Sinodinos to give evidence. Only the Prime Minister, the silent Prime Minister, our newly enrolled sworn in Trappist monk of a Prime Minister can represent Mr Sinodinos, but he will not say anything.
We would like to ask Mr Sinodinos what instructions he was given by the Prime Minister on that Sunday morning immediately after the interview. We would like to know whether the nature of his conversation with Commissioner Keelty was proper or improper. We would also like to know why he did not obey the guide of conduct that suggests and instructs him as a MoPS employee and an adviser to go through the relevant portfolio minister before talking to a public servant in another area. This was totally and absolutely ignored.
Senator Ellison said yesterday that you cannot do that on every occasion. I accept that but, when you are issuing an admonishment or reprimand, you should follow the rules. When you are purporting to represent a Prime Minister and are slapping around a police commissioner, you had better follow the rules of the game. But of course none of these questions will be answered, and that would make a committee of inquiry next to useless. We could call Senator Ellison because he is a senator, but he is just the government's resident doormat. That is clear because he was not even involved in a conversation with the police commissioner until as late as Tuesday afternoon—two days after the alleged offence—so we might as well leave him out of an inquiry. 
If the answers he gave today in question time are any example, he would add nothing. He answered a dorothy dix on national security and tried to smear the opposition as though we are not on board in supporting national security. What a typically weak wedge effort—not even done with style and class, just a pathetic spray. He was then asked who leaked the Brigitte information—not the details of it, but how it got into the public domain. There was no answer whatsoever from the minister, from the doormat. It would be unnecessary to bring him before an inquiry because he would add absolutely no value to the inquiry.
We could compel Dr Peter Shergold to attend such an inquiry. He is a witness who could attend. I do not really want to do that because I do not think it would be fair on him. He was just following orders; he did not have any choice in the matter. If we were to bring him before the inquiry, I am certain he would give accurate and honest evidence. He would not be like a couple of the public servants in the `children overboard' inquiry, including the Anastasia of the Public Service who on 53 occasions said, `I can't recall,' and on another 40 occasions said, `I can't remember.' In reward for that she received a Public Service Medal and the secretaryship of the biggest department around. Dr Shergold would not behave in that way, so why should I want to embarrass him for being an honest public servant? I would not want to do that. 
We could ask Mr Downer to appear. But after watching him on Latelinethe other night I do not want to cringe all over again. What a pathetic, miserable, hopeless performance that was. It was probably—and I really like Alexander Downer, so I do not want to say this too harshly—the equal of Senator Rod Kemp's Latelineor 7.30 Report performance.
—I don't believe that; it couldn't have been that bad.
—Maybe not. I might withdraw that accusation. But I mean we are not going to get Mr Downer to come. We are not going to get any politician to front up at this inquiry. Yes, we could bring along the Director-General of ASIO to embarrass—and he should not be embarrassed because he has played a totally honourable role in all of these matters. What about Commissioner Keelty himself? Is it fair to bring him along? He would be in a no-win position at the inquiry. I have not always commended him for the evidence that he has given before committees, but I feel on this occasion he would be put in a totally invidious position.
Why has all this come up? It has come up because this government hates criticism. It just cannot stand any adverse comment. It detests scrutiny. Just look at Senator Alston's and Senator Santoro's attacks on the ABC's coverage of Iraq. It is not as though the fourth estate does not support the coalition government. But it expects total hegemony in this area. Look at the swag of right wing chatterers who day in, day out support the government's foreign policy—be it Andrew Bolt from the Herald Sun, Alan Jones, Piers Akerman, Greg Sheridan, Christopher Pearson, Michael Baume, Dennis Shanahan or Janet Albrechtsen. The list goes on and on. There are hundreds of these right wing acolyte writers out there, backing up every action of the government. 
But that is not enough—the first person who steps out of line and inadvertently upsets the political spin of this government gets slapped around by a ministerial staffer. If you are like Andrew Wilkie, what does this Nixonian government do? It is not just a question of being slapped around: suddenly a top-secret, AUSTEO, code-worded ONA document written by him is leaked to one of the government's media hatchet men so the job can be done on him. That is the way it reacts in these circumstances. 
Let me repeat that the miserable behaviour by the government will not be exposed by an inquiry because the witnesses will not turn up. They will turn such an inquiry into a circus. We will not get the truth; we will not get answers. The only people who will front up will be the honest ones and then they will be exposed to an inquisition that would be unfair in as much as the others will not be subject to it. I commend Senator Brown—and I do not often do it—for his thoughts behind this motion. I know he is genuine about it. I know he wants to get to the truth, but we disagree on the method of getting to the truth. The government are far worse than Senator Brown thinks they are—if he thinks any of them will front up to tell the truth.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-23,"—The Senate is debating what is an important matter and, while it has been considered and talked about in the public and political arenas for some time, I do not think the significance of it should be understated. This government has acted completely inappropriately by publicly and privately pressuring an independent statutory officer in a very important position—the head of the Australian Federal Police—for expressing individual views, views which were not remarkable in any way, shape or form. But, because of what can only be described as the paranoia of the Prime Minister, those views were seen as somehow potentially reflecting on him and his government's line in relation to Iraq.  
The Senate is also debating whether or not to establish a Senate inquiry into the actions of the Prime Minister and other ministers and ministerial staff of his government. Senator Brown has outlined quite well why establishing a special Senate inquiry now is not necessary. He outlined in a fair bit of detail and quite accurately what has happened—how the Prime Minister and ministerial staff have acted inappropriately—and Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner have built on that. 
Broadly speaking we know what has happened and we know that the Prime Minister is clearly guilty of very inappropriate behaviour. We do not need a Senate inquiry to tell us that. It would be nice to know some of the facts that we are not aware of but, as has just been outlined, a specifically set-up Senate inquiry would not tell us any of those details because the people needed before the inquiry to find out that information would not show up. The precedent has clearly been established.
It is important to highlight that this is not just a matter of trying to generate political embarrassment for the Prime Minister. This is not just a matter of the Prime Minister being caught out as paranoid and overly obsessive about having his particular viewpoint seen as the accepted truth. This is a serious matter for the Australian public. It is not serious because it might be a political problem for the Prime Minister and, frankly, to some extent not even because Commissioner Keelty has been put in a difficult position; it is serious because it is an indication of independent statutory officers having major and inappropriate pressure brought to bear on them over what is widely acknowledged as being a fairly minor divergence of views from the government. What if this independent official, the commissioner of police, had a significant disagreement with the government? What if he knew the government was putting out something that was blatantly wrong and wanted to say something about it? He now knows that even the tiniest divergence, most of it imagined in the mind of the Prime Minister, will bring immense pressure on him. It is through this incident that a very clear message has been given to the head of the AFP: that any form of divergence over any matter—including matters far more important than the one we are talking about today—is viewed by the government as a major offence.
That same culture of oppression of public officers applies across the board. The message that the Prime Minister and Mr Sinodinos sent to Mr Keelty was not just a message for Mr Keelty; it was a message for every single public servant and every single public officer that they do not step one millimetre out of line. We know that this is not the first occasion this has happened. The work that was done through the `children overboard' inquiry—also known as A Certain Maritime Incident inquiry—quite clearly showed an obsession with control of information, public servants and Defence Force personnel. There was the complete gagging of a whole range of officials from making any public statements or releasing information without it being cleared through the minister. Enormous pressure was brought to bear, as has been outlined, on any officer who was seen as not toeing the line 100 per cent. The Public Service has become immersed in that culture across the board, and that is why it is serious. It seriously impacts on proper governance in this country, and having a Senate inquiry will just reaffirm what we already know—that is, a serious offence has occurred. It is not the first time this has occurred; it is endemic and the Prime Minister is a serial offender in using ministerial staff to heavy everybody. We saw that through the `children overboard' inquiry. 
Frankly, the work has already been done by Democrat and Labor senators through the `children overboard' inquiry and through estimates committees, when we have repeatedly followed up on a range of different incidents where inappropriate pressure has occurred. What we really need is action to try and prevent this sort of situation from continuing to occur. It is worth pointing out that the work has already started on this through other Senate committee processes, where Democrat and Labor senators are investigating ministerial staff behaviour. It has become very clear, and more and more of a problem over time, that ministerial staff are not held accountable. As previous speakers have said, they will not show up to any Senate committee inquiries. It is likely that the only person who would show up to an inquiry focused on this incident would be the commissioner, who would then be placed in an impossible position. Frankly, he is the last person, at least in relation to this incident, who should be put in that position. 
There is scope for parliament, through budget estimates committees in May, to continue to pursue not only the fabric of this particular incident but also the broader pattern of behaviour of a whole range of officials, but it has the continuing problem that ministerial staff and the vast bulk of ministers will remain unaccountable. That is where the work needs to be done. The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee has done some work on it, which has partly flowed from the `children overboard' inquiry. It has brought down a report on an inquiry into ministerial staffers and other staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act—the so-called MOPS Act—which included a number of recommendations. The Democrats believe these need to be acted on. If those recommendations were acted on, it would go some way to preventing a recurrence of the sort of incident that we are debating today. It is no surprise that the government has not responded to the recommendations of that report; indeed, it is no surprise that the government has not responded yet to the recommendations of the `children overboard' inquiry from even further back. There is not even the slightest interest from this government in acknowledging recommendations of inquiries that have put the spotlight on misbehaviour and inappropriate behaviour by ministers and ministerial staff.
That is where we really need to put the pressure on the government; not to have an inquiry to tell us what we already know, but to increase the pressure based on work done elsewhere to get accountability of ministerial staff. These are staff who are, in effect, acting as de facto ministers of the Crown by ordering public servants—including independent statutory officers, such as the commissioner of police, senior defence personnel and senior public servants—on what to do, but they are not able to be in any way held accountable or questioned on their behaviour or actions.
The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee recommended that ministerial staffers should be made to appear before committees, including Senate estimates committees, when requested. There is nothing specifically in law to prevent this. The Senate's powers to call witnesses are not tested, but I do not think there is much doubt that the legal power is there to require the attendance of ministerial staff. I believe the view of most senators is that it would not be a desirable use of Senate powers to press those powers to the limit. It would probably end up requiring court action if the government continued to insist on directing staff not to appear.  
Frankly, I have a stronger view than others on this. In a debate amongst different senators on the `children overboard' committee, there was certainly an open question about whether or not former Minister Peter Reith should have been pressed harder to appear before that committee. I believe that that should have occurred, that there was no doubt the committee had the power to compel him; but others took a different view to me, saying that it was not appropriate to use those powers. I think it is about time we tested those powers, particularly when you look at the record of the government. That shows quite clearly their deliberate and wilful attempts to refuse to answer questions and to provide information. And it goes much further than just not appearing before Senate committees. As I have often said in this place, there is a record of widespread refusal by the government to comply with orders of the Senate to produce documents. With such deliberate and wilful ignoring of the Senate's authority and with such deliberate and wilful deceit and hiding of information from the public, I think it is time for the Senate to consider using its powers more fully. 
I accept that others for quite genuine reasons have a different view, and I guess it is a debate that we will continue to have. The key issue from the Democrats' point of view on this matter is not to set up a specific, separate inquiry to examine what, broadly speaking, we already know. To use a very useful phrase that Senator Ray quoted: there is a lot of activity in this place of beating our heads against a brick wall, but we do not necessarily have to build one specifically for the purpose. I think that describes it quite well. But there are certainly other processes that have been used and are still being used to get movement in relation to the core problem here—and the core problem is not specifically the incident we are referring to but the entrenched attitude and behaviour of a government that is obsessed with control of all information and that insists its version of the truth is the only one allowed to have any sort of airing at all. 
That is a problem at the best of times but, as we know with this government, we have a clear record of their repeated use of that so-called truth actually being very flexible—to put it politely—when often it is just being completely fabricated, to put it in its worst frame of words. In such a circumstance it is required of the Senate to explore every avenue on behalf of the public to get the truth into the political debate. In relation to this incident, broadly speaking, we know the truth; we know what happened. We might not know the specific conversations; we might not know some of the detail. That would be useful to know, but a Senate inquiry will not produce it—not a specific one set up for that, as is suggested in this motion. 
The other work that has been done is not as glamorous and immediately appealing to media headlines; it is the typically grinding hard work that Senate committees need to do and that the Democrats are willing to do. It is the less visible, below-the-radar work carried out over a long period of time on the areas of government accountability that really gets significant shifts towards proper openness and transparency. It has been identified through a number Senate inquiries that there is a growing and now major problem with the lack of accountability of ministerial staff who are exercising their position with increasing authority but decreasing accountability. The focus needs to be on trying to ensure that these incidents do not continue to occur.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-23,"—The first point I would like to make in this debate is a rather curious one. This is a very strange debate. This is the first debate that I have seen in this place where, after five speakers—and I am the fifth speaker on this side of the debate—in a debate which is extremely critical of the Prime Minister and the government and other ministers, not one government senator has seen fit to get up and defend the Prime Minister. Not one government senator is expressing an interest in doing so, yet their behaviour is worthy of debate in this place. It is enormously critical and important behaviour. It is strange—as the record will show—that at a time when the Prime Minister needed to be defended and at a time when the foreign minister needed to be defended not one government senator showed an interest in defending them. I suppose across the board those on the other side share the respect for Mick Keelty that people on this side of the parliament do.  
—Senator McGauran laughs; maybe he does not. He can go back and tell the people of Victoria that he does not. Borne out of that respect is, I believe, an embarrassment on the other side that they cannot defend the indefensible. They cannot defend the bullying behaviour that occurred last week, and it is good to see that they are not coming into this place and trying to defend that indefensible behaviour. They are embarrassed by it. They should be embarrassed by it. The whole government should be embarrassed by it. 
What we are talking about today is quite a serious issue, one demanding of multiple responses but, as my colleagues indicated earlier on, probably not one that is immediately appropriate for the Senate committee process. But there is no doubt that what we have now—and we had it last week—is the behaviour of a government in decay. All the aspects of that decay were on parade as government ministers from the Prime Minister down took the long bat to one of the most respected leaders in this country, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty.
Last week we saw the worst aspects of this government. We saw an arrogant government bullying a senior independent officer. We saw a deceitful government selectively misusing the truth. We saw a hypocritical government undermining the reputation of someone they were falling over themselves to be photographed with just a few months ago. We saw a government in disarray as they shafted Mick Keelty one day and heaped praise on him the next. We also saw a desperate government who were prepared to dispense with the truth once again and, just as importantly, to dispense with the reputation of a decent, intelligent and highly respected professional officer. For what purpose? The only purpose was to save their skins.
At the helm of the government we saw a desperate and rattled Prime Minister. Aren't we getting used to that? From day one of the Latham leadership of the Labor Party, we have become used to the Prime Minister being wrong footed and looking desperate and embattled. The man of steel is starting to look like Captain Mainwaring, and that is getting through to the Australian public. The Prime Minister has form on the issue of truth, and the Australian public saw once again a Prime Minister who wishes to deny them the truth. The Prime Minister continues to keep the truth from the Australian people. I am sure this issue is resonating in the Liberal Party polling, as it does with anyone who goes out and talks to the public. We all know that, when it comes to keeping the truth from the Australian public, this Prime Minister is a serial offender. 
The Australian public firmly believe now that the truth was kept from them in the `kids overboard' affair. They do not believe, as we saw in this morning's poll, they were led into Iraq with honesty but that they were misled into that war. As we have heard from expert after expert, as a nation the public firmly believe we are a greater target as a consequence of the engagement in Iraq. They know that this government is trying to keep the fundamental truth from them. Another firm belief of the Australian people is that the issues of national security and law enforcement should be above politics, and they do not like the fact that last week those issues were not. The Australian public see the government's behaviour as an act of desperation, an act of deceit and an act of dishonesty. They are concerned across the country that these fundamental pillars of our system were dragged into a debate and the principal players were bullied.
Let us get a real fix on what happened last week. Commissioner Mick Keelty, the head of this nation's peak police body, the Australian Federal Police, told the Australian public what they also firmly believe and what most experts around the world believe. He said:
The reality is, if this—
the Madrid bombing—
turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.
He told the truth as he knew it and as he had analysed it. Not only have Commissioner Keelty and the Australian public expressed that view but also Minister Abbott and Paul Wolfowitz—conservatives in the extreme—have expressed that view. For that, Commissioner Keelty was jumped on and dumped on from a great height. Why? Essentially he was jumped on and dumped on because he told the truth in a way this Prime Minister did not want it told. Why didn't this Prime Minister want it told? Because this Prime Minister's only concern is his continuity in the job. He knows that it would be threatened if voters blamed him for increasing the risk of terrorist attacks within Australia. The Prime Minister ensured that by the end of last week those fundamental issues of the independence of our national security agencies and infrastructure, and the independence of our chief law enforcement officer and agency, were dispensable. They were dispensable at the altar of the security of the Howard government.
Commissioner Keelty is a person who is widely respected, and with good cause. I have known him for over 10 years, in the days when I was a minister, as a decent, intelligent and honest person. He had served previous governments skilfully, intelligently and honestly. With the transition to the Liberal government, I was continually confronted by Commissioner Keelty in estimates committees and other parliamentary committees, where he continued to show extreme dedication to the protection and security of the Australian public. He did so with honesty and intelligence. He is widely respected, and he deserves to be. He continues to serve this country professionally and intelligently.
In the days after the Bali bombing I am sure all Australians slept easier, as did I and my family, knowing that Mick Keelty was behind the wheel. He should be honoured rather than abused. Unfortunately, last week he was abused. But it was not just the person that was abused; it was also the institution of the highest ranking position in our national police force. In turn, the AFP as a whole was abused.
In this country we have legislative processes for interaction between different arms of government, and we have them for good reason. Our Constitution provides that there be a separation of powers, which is designed to balance authority. The separation of powers is designed to protect our democratic system and the rights of our people. This separation dictates that law enforcement be kept separate from the government of the day. This separation protects the independence of judiciaries. It demands that the law be applied without fear or favour, and it demands that those who enforce the law be protected by statutory independence. Commissioner Keelty is protected by such constitutional principles. These principles are reinforced by the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 as amended. That act establishes the legally allowable forms of communication, and it clearly shows that last week the government acted outside the law by pressuring the police commissioner. 
Let us turn to what the government did privately, and later on I will get onto what they did publicly. Privately, they berated him from within seconds of the interview on the Sunday program. We know that the Prime Minister's senior adviser rang Commissioner Keelty—and it was not to ask him what he was having for breakfast. The senior adviser rang Commissioner Keelty within seconds of the interview, with essentially two demands: the first was that the commissioner keep away from the press; the second was that he issue a clarifying statement. The law, the AFP Act 1979, defines the allowable channels of communication and direction of government with respect to the AFP commissioner. In this instance last week the government acted outside the law. Section 37(1) of that act talks of general administration. It says:
Subject to this Act, the Commissioner has the general administration of, and the control of the operations of, the Australian Federal Police.
The subsequent two subclauses of section 37 detail what are allowable channels of communication and what areas that communication is allowable in. Section 37(2) says:
The Minister may, after obtaining and considering the advice of the Commissioner and of the Secretary, give written directions to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police.
Subclause 3 states:
In addition to ... power to give directions under subsection (2), the Minister may give written directions (either specific or general) to the Commissioner in relation to the use of common services ...
It is very clear from this legislation that, when the act was passed, when the AFP was set up, the allowable communication, the allowable direction had to be in writing and only as to general policy. Last week it was not in writing and it was as to a specific matter of intelligence and law enforcement. Going back to when the legislation was introduced in parliament, during the term of the Fraser government in 1979, in his second reading speech the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr McLeay said:
The responsibilities of the Minister and the Secretary, who in some limited matters also advises the Minister, are clearly spelt out. They refer to the giving of written directions by the Minister, after seeking both the advice of the Commissioner and the Secretary, on the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Federal police ...
As I say, I think the government acted outside the law in pressurising the AFP Commissioner as they did last week. They did it privately. The legislation establishes the position of the AFP Commissioner as an independent one and it defines the allowable avenues of direction, and the government did not act within the law with respect to that. But this was not the full extent of the government's response that I find distasteful—there is even more. It was the response that is probably best summed up by Verona Burgess, one of our most respected public servant commentators, if not the most respected, in the weekend Canberra Times, where she said: 
What part of “children overboard” didn't the Government understand? The part about ruining the careers of public servants who didn't agree with them? The part about bullying those who dared speak out? The part about trashing the reputations of decent people who have committed their lives to the service of the nation? The part about playing senior officials against one another? Or the part about disguising the truth in a fog of confusion?
She goes on to say:
What is different this time is that the Prime Minister and his Chief of Staff, Arthur Sinodinos, have been caught with their pants down interfering with an independent statutory authority—the nation's top cop, Mick Keelty...
I think that best describes the government's response last week. They denigrated, they bullied, they played one officer against the other all in an attempt to disguise the truth. And when they wanted to get right into it, they called on the person whose conduct, I believe, alternates between village bully and town clown to take the police commissioner to task and to undermine his judgment and reputation. One of the most offensive performances I have seen in national politics was the performance last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, when he came to the crease and delivered the greatest insult of the lot. Of the man who probably, with the Director-General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, has done more to keep Australia safe from terrorism, Mr Downer said, `Keelty is just expressing a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we are getting from al-Qaeda.' Would you believe it, even from Alexander Downer? It was an amazing over-the-top statement. In one sentence, a one-line put-down, Downer tells us that Keelty has been (1) duped by al-Qaeda propaganda and (2) is mouthing that propaganda as a mouthpiece for al-Qaeda. In one line, Commissioner Keelty is depicted as being inept and gullible. When Minister Downer was attacked in the House of Representatives for this sort of statement, this sort of denigration, when he was accused of being a `rotten lousy disgrace', what was his response? The man who can throw it by the bucket load takes umbrage and demands a retraction. No-one has said anything worse in national politics recently than the statement by Minister Downer about Mick Keelty. But he is the one who is offended; he is the one who wants the attention. He is the one who least deserves it. Mick Keelty is the one who most deserves an apology from the minister—a profuse apology.
That was not the only line of attack on Commissioner Keelty last week. The other line—one used by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the foreign minister—was to claim that Commissioner Keelty was only involved in `operational matters'. To me, that is the more insidious and belittling put-down of the lot. In other words, we are told that Keelty and his operation do not do the thinking; they are just the legs and arms and they do the legwork and all the analysis and intelligence analysis is done elsewhere. It was more subtle than the al-Qaeda connection but I think professionally more damaging and, of course, totally wrong. It is a good line for the moment. It gets the Prime Minister out of sticky moments in press conferences and with the odd talkback announcer who may be critical. When we look at the work of Commissioner Keelty and the AFP and we take into account what the Prime Minister and others have said—the allegation that the AFP and Commissioner Keelty have not been involved in the intelligence analysis—let us acknowledge that Commissioner Keelty has been intimately involved in regional networking of intelligence, in global networking of intelligence and in domestic enforcement of laws based on intelligence.  
Let us also remember, lo and behold, that after Bali, this government, this Prime Minister gave the Australian Federal Police a counter-terrorist role, including 100 jobs for intelligence analysts. We are asked to believe that Commissioner Keelty has 100 intelligence analysts working for him, yet we are told he has no role in intelligence analysis. How dishonest, how tricky, how deceitful, how normal. If these analysts are not reporting to the commissioner, who are they reporting to? We all know who they are reporting to. Mick Keelty is at the pinnacle of that analysis. We know he has a role and, as I said earlier, together with Dennis Richardson he is probably more critical than anyone else in the protection of Australia's security. We see the theme over and over again. For Mr Downer it is us and them. He and his people are above the stairs with his mates. They are the ones capable of doing the analysis and the rest of us, people such as Commissioner Keelty, are the downstairs people. They are expected to do the legwork. They are the operational people. It is not a role in which to think about these things. I find that offensive. I am sure others in the community find it offensive and the sooner this country is rid of a patrician foreign minister like Downer, the better off we will be.
At the end of the week, I think Commissioner Keelty is probably more respected by the Australian people and Prime Minister Howard less so; he is obviously less respected by his own colleagues in this place. As I say, no-one is jumping up for the call in this place to defend the Prime Minister against, once again, serial behaviour. This is the Prime Minister who wants to keep the truth from the Australian people and who always finds ways to do it: tell a little half-truth here and a little lie there, always skating close to the edge. But where are his colleagues today? This is a critical issue of concern to the nation: it goes to the constitutional separation of powers concept, it goes to the administration of justice and it goes to honesty in government, but not one government senator is prepared to get up and defend the Prime Minister. That in itself is a reflection not just on his behaviour last week but also on what a difference a couple of Newspolls can make.
We have a couple of Newspolls and they are all scurrying back to their holes. Senator McGauran is sitting over there looking very embarrassed. Senator Vanstone is sitting over there wishing she was not here. That is the truth of it: no-one else wanted to come into this place to defend what we all know is the indefensible. In terms of public policy conduct it does not get much worse than the behaviour of Prime Minister Howard, Minister Downer and Minister Ruddock last week. To use this for their base political purposes, to use this as an excuse to save their skins and try to position themselves against any terrorist attack in the future I think is the basest of motives on which to undermine the reputation of a person widely respected both locally and in the region.
I must ask again: where are the Liberals? Where are the Nationals? Where are the defenders of this so-called man of steel who, as I said earlier, increasingly looks like Captain Mainwaring? We are concerned about it and Senator Brown is concerned about it. I think he has a legitimate proposition before the Senate but one that probably is not workable given the conduct of this government. But let us get another speaker up and let us hope that the government can find someone who can defend their position. I will not be holding my breath.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—No, Senator Bolkus did not need to hold his breath in relation to that. The attempt by the Howard government to distort the message on an important national issue such as terrorism and to attack experts who hold a contrary view is poor and desperate politics. The government's handling of the entire Keelty affair has been reprehensible. Not only has the government attacked the credibility of a man who has devoted his whole working life to protecting Australia and Australians; it has also undermined the independence and integrity of one of the most important statutory offices in this country. 
I have personally known Mr Keelty in the sense of seeing him at estimates hearings a number of times and during the course of inquiries of both the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee over some five years now. I think the government has clearly undermined the independence and integrity of one of the most important and independent positions we have. In defence of his own political spin Mr John Howard has muddied the reputation of and seriously undermined the office of the Australian Federal Police and he also attempted to do that to the commissioner himself. As far as I am aware, Mr Keelty has spent a significant part of his working life defending Australia and Australians. For close to 25 years, I think, he has gone to work every day to protect Australians from the worst kinds of criminals, organised gangsters, drug and gun-runners and, of course, other types of criminals. His hard work and dedication saw him rise through the ranks of the Australian Federal Police all the way to the top job in 2001, when he was appointed Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.
During his term as commissioner, Mr Keelty has skilfully managed the significant increase in the scale and complexity of the Australian Federal Police mission that has resulted from the new threat environment we now face. His leadership of the Australian Federal Police has in my view been an invaluable asset in the war against terrorism. To have lost him should he have resigned, as suggested in the paper, would unquestionably have weakened Australia in this endeavour. It is worth while going through some initiatives to examine the person that the Prime Minister's office sought to interfere with. Mr Keelty has overseen the establishment of new counter-terrorism teams, the expansion of the AFP's overseas network, the reorganisation of the AFP's intelligence capability, the implementation of a new regime to confiscate the proceeds of crime and a major overseas deployment to stabilise the Solomon Islands.
Many of these issues were covered at hearings of the legal and constitutional committees where I was able to inquire and hear from Mr Keelty about issues raised during estimates or about legal and constitutional committee issues. The achievements with which Australians would be most familiar would be the assistance provided by the AFP to the Indonesian National Police following the horrific terrorist attack in Bali on 12 October 2002. That assistance ranged from disaster victim identification, forensic investigation, criminal intelligence analysis and bomb data analysis, as well as preparation for prosecutions. At the time, the Prime Minister himself commended the work of Commissioner Keelty when he told parliament on 12 December 2002:
I record the gratitude of Australians to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty ...
Unfortunately, that gratitude was all but forgotten last week. The government's first tactic to defend its spin in defiance of the truth was to undermine the credibility of the police commissioner and to question his expertise in this area. That is why I took a couple of minutes at the beginning of my contribution to provide a backdrop to the ability of Mr Keelty, his experience and the issues he has been involved in over the last couple of years on behalf of this government and under this government's minister. I am sure he has worked to the best of his ability. 
Of all the government ministers who were then wheeled out to have a pot shot at Mr Keelty for daring to speak the logical truth, no-one went in harder or lower in my view than the foreign minister. The foreign minister's suggestion that Commissioner Keelty was advancing al-Qaeda propaganda in suggesting that Australia faced a greater security risk as a result of our involvement in the war in Iraq is simply outrageous. One wonders why he went a bridge too far. It is a despicable slur on the commissioner, and the fact that the minister has repeatedly refused to apologise to him only reinforces that. These disparaging comments were backed up by the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister himself—after first of all, of course, not wanting to comment on it.
The suggestion that the threat level faced by Australia has risen due to our involvement in the war in Iraq is not propaganda; it is one of those facts that we have to live with. A number of commentators have backed up the commissioner, including the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr Paul Wolfowitz, and the head of the FBI's counter-terrorist unit, Mr John Pistole, whom I was fortunate enough to meet in America recently. Indeed, comments by the American ambassador to Australia, Tom Schieffer, also conceded this point. Other police chiefs who supported this view included the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Service, Mr Ken Moroney, the Deputy Commissioner of the Victoria Police, Mr Bill Kelly, and former Commissioner of the Western Australian Police Service, Mr Bob Falconer. Add to this a significant array of international terrorism experts who also supported Commissioner Keelty's view and it becomes obvious that this government is simply denying the plain truth.
Despite this defence of its own spin—perhaps `its own deceit' is a better way of putting it; `its own political survival' might even be closer to the truth—unfortunately for the government, polls reported recently revealed that the Australian people will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by this government. They will not allow government spin to overwhelm the facts. The point is that Commissioner Keelty was telling Australians that we cannot be complacent about the potential for a terrorist attack. Anyone who dismisses the relevance of the attack on Spanish citizens in Madrid and discounts the fact that it was an indication that we now face greater risks is naive. In my view, it would be dishonest not to raise that as an issue.
Last week our leading police officers, the commissioners of police at federal and state level, were hosting a conference with myriad international terrorism experts. It seemed, in retrospect, a perfectly logical opportunity for us to honestly and objectively assess the risks faced by Australia and, more importantly, to take constructive steps to address those risks. It was totally inexcusable that, rather than being able to concentrate on those constructive steps that could have been taken, Commissioner Keelty was distracted by what can only be described as political standover tactics. Indeed, alarmingly, reports suggested that he had—at one stage at least, as I suggested earlier—considered his resignation. This would have had a drastic effect on Australia's counter-terrorism capability, yet it was apparently a real possibility, caused by this government—unnecessarily, I might add. 
This whole episode shows that we have a government that places its own partisan political interests ahead of the national interest. It was prepared to sacrifice a highly respected, highly determined and highly competent law enforcement officer—indeed, the chief law enforcement officer in the land—for its own political interests because that law enforcement officer was not citing the government's spin. The government should be under no illusion that, when it comes to a question of having Mr Keelty or Mr Alexander Downer and government spin doctors defend the security of their families, the Australian people will choose Mr Keelty every time.
To demean such a man by requiring him to issue a press release drafted by the government—that is apparently so; the government has not denied it—is nothing short of a national scandal. To justify their political standover tactics on the basis of an assertion that Mr Keelty did not have a role in security assessment ignores, incredibly, the role that the Australian Federal Police now have to play and were asked to play in this issue by this government. The Attorney-General said, in answer to a question on notice from as recently as 18 March this year, that the Australian Federal Police—who will be seconded to the National Threat Assessment Centre that will be open in a month's time—will be:
... fully integrated NTAC analysts and as such, will be directly responsible for the preparation of threat assessments.
So the Australian Federal Police will be playing an integral role in relation to the National Threat Assessment Centre analysis. Therefore, it begs the question: why would the government's comments say that we can perhaps leave Mr Keelty's view aside and go to, say, that of Dennis Richardson from ASIO or perhaps that of Alexander Downer? I have to say that, at the end of the day, you might want to consider Dennis Richardson's argument but you also might want to listen to the Australian Federal Police on this issue, given their role. I think this demonstrates that the Australian Federal Police will be intimately involved in advising on matters of national security. There is no doubt about that. How can the Australian people have confidence, then, that in fulfilling its vitally important responsibility the AFP will be able to give frank and fearless advice in the interests of Australia's national security and not those of their political masters? The position could not be stated more clearly and precisely than in the words of Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty himself, on 14 March this year, when he said, on that same Sunday program:
... there's a level of honesty that has to exist here in terms of what the problems are here, not only in Australia but in our region.
No-one should be under any illusions that the viciousness with which the government has approached this matter was not intended to intimidate. It was intended to control the message and, if that message did not suit its political agenda, to stifle and deny the truth and the facts. We should not forget that, in the process of demeaning its distinguished law enforcement officer, the government quite frankly is prepared to con the Australian public on matters of security. I note, for instance, that Mr Ruddock was reported as saying that:
... the efforts by the United States and other allies to drive Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had drawn terror groups to the country.
That is, Iraq. Mr Ruddock was then reported as saying that:
This was then reducing the possibility of those groups carrying out terror actions in other parts of the world. 
That is what he said. He went on to say:
I suspect the fact that they are in Iraq probably diminishes the harm that they can occasion elsewhere.
The next thing you know is that the government not only will be standing over our primary law enforcement officers but will be proposing a diminished state of alert because it would like us to believe that all the terrorists in the world have been sucked into Iraq and we are now safe here. That is not the case at all. The point the government should take on board is that it is prepared to say anything for its political purposes even when those statements conflict with the national interest. It is a shameful thing to have to say that this government has now put itself in this position. This is typified by its response to terrorism. It seems that with this government it is all about the words, not about action. It is not about recognising and respecting people who have contributed to the debate. It is not about those who have contributed their efforts in the war on terrorism. It is about ensuring that there is a political spin which the government can live with that comes from its bureaucrats, the people the government thinks it controls.
We have seen the government espousing its toughness on security matters by adding words to statute books but we have not seen it exercise its powers. We have seen again today the further suggestions as to just what Willie Brigitte was up to in Australia, and the government still has not answered the question of how he was granted a tourist visa in circumstances where he was clearly a person of interest to French security authorities even before September 11. We have not heard an explanation from the government as to why it took more than two weeks to respond to a request from France as to whether he was in the country, even though they pointed out this man had trained with al-Qaeda linked organisations in Afghanistan. We have not heard the government say whether it is prepared to set in place a standard 24-hour response to such requests, a 48-hour response, a one-week response, a two-week response or only after an alerting country sends a second transmission urgently warning us about this individual—which was an urgent warning, I might add—remained unattended to because of a long weekend. We have also seen reported in the Sun Heraldand elsewhere the security leaks. We do not know whether this government is going to investigate those or whether they emanated from the French authorities or from the Australian authorities.
What we heard in question time today in the Senate was a minister who is responsible for the area but who apparently did not know what was going on, who thought he could hide under operational requirements. But the question was not about operational requirements. The question was about what the government was doing about the leaks—an entirely different matter. Either this government is asleep at the wheel, or it hides behind its rhetoric or it does not like the truth. It can choose any of those, but they all lead to the incompetence that this government is now portraying in the issue of national security. By way of an example we have seen over 400 individuals and organisations listed as terrorist organisations for the purpose of having their assets frozen in Australia and, of those 400 that have been listed, the government has taken action against two. The first organisation, Shining Light, was not a South American terrorist organisation but in fact a record store that it seems had its assets frozen by mistake. It then took a considerable amount of time and effort to get those assets unfrozen. The second organisation had its total assets of $2,100 frozen. That is a cashed up organisation, that one! We have not been able to find out anymore about that, but as the case unfolds we may be able to see whether or not the government has struck another record store. As to associates of Willie Brigitte in Australia, have we seen in media reports any suggestion of a prosecution, investigation or perhaps even a short little speech in the House about what is going on? No. In short, virtually no assets have been confiscated and there have been no prosecutions. 
There is a lot of rhetoric coming from this government. The rhetoric of this government is not good rhetoric. It is not talking the talk or walking the walk. What it is doing is in fact only talking about the rhetoric surrounding national security rather than national security itself. Again, the Australian people are not mugs; they can judge political charlatans a mile off. The conduct of the government, directly from the Prime Minister's office last week, was disgraceful. The government knows it. The opposition knows it. Senator Brown clearly knows it. The government should acknowledge that disgrace, it should apologise to our primary law enforcement officer and it should give a commitment to the Australian people that it will not engage in such outrageous intimidation again. That will enable all senior public servants involved in the security of Australia to be honest and frank with the Australian people in their efforts to protect our national security.
The issue that Senator Brown seeks to refer to a Senate inquiry is one that, of itself, Labor believe the Australian people deserve answers on. They deserve to know the exact details of the role that the Prime Minister's office, the Prime Minister himself and his staff had in muscling in on the commissioner. They deserve to know that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in Australia will continue to give frank and fearless advice not just to the Australian government but to all the Australian people. Labor are committed to doing the work necessary to ensure that the Australian people get those answers. Our efforts yesterday, our continuing efforts today and the ongoing pressure we will be applying to the Howard government to extract the simple truth is a testament to that fact. Labor are committed to taking the steps necessary to extract the facts but we look at the issues as they stand. We will not support measures just for any reason.
Labor do not believe that a Senate inquiry into this affair will deliver answers to the Australian people, and that is why we will stop short of supporting it. We cannot send this issue off to a Senate inquiry, which may ultimately not provide the answers that we want from this government. I suspect that the Prime Minister's chief of staff will not give evidence to the committee. The ministers who have attacked the commissioner will not front up. In truth the only person who would be likely to front up is Commissioner Keelty, for another round of questioning. I am not sure whether in truth that in itself would provide any answers for the Australian people. Senator Faulkner moved a motion earlier today to seek to extract information from this government. The government should not have to be ordered. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—I agree wholeheartedly that the issue at hand is important, and I particularly agree with the opening comments of both Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray. This issue has clearly captured the imagination of the electorate, and I think people understand the issues that underpin the motion of Senator Brown that is before us. However, I agree too with previous speakers who have outlined the reasons why a Senate committee of the nature proposed is not the best forum in which to try and get to the bottom of these issues. I would not like to see a situation where Commissioner Keelty was the only person who was called on to present before a committee and ultimately presented only to find himself hammered repeatedly with questions, giving what he believed to be fair and frank answers but really not getting anywhere. I think he has already had enough public humiliation and scrutiny and is not necessarily deserving of any more of that. I am not suggesting that the issue should not be explored further but I believe strongly that, if nothing else, Senate estimates committee hearings are a better forum and a better place and time for that. 
Out of curiosity I looked this afternoon on the parliamentary web site at the committee inquiry workload. I want to spend a few minutes talking about that. The inquiry Senator Brown is proposing would be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, one of the committees on which I serve and have served since I first came into this place. I note with interest that since 1996 Senator Brown has proposed that the Senate inquire into some 27 different references. Of those proposals, the Senate rejected 19 but agreed to eight. I raise that just as a matter of interest. That got me thinking about the sorts of issues the Senate legal and constitutional committees—or legal and con committees, as we refer to them affectionately; and there is both a legislation and a references committee—have been dealing with in recent times. I was quite stunned to find that in just the last year those two committees have undertaken some 33 different inquiries, six of which are currently under way, and there may be another four potential inquiries by the end of this sitting period. I am reminded that this is all being done with three research staff in the committee secretariat. That workload is a considerable strain on those tremendous staff—Louise Gell and others. Also it can be difficult for the senators who serve on those committees if for no other reasons than geography and time.
As an illustration, since 2 April last year the legal and constitutional committees have inquired into the following references: averment provisions in Australian customs legislation; crime in the community—victims, offenders and fear of crime; the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 [2004]; the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002; the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003; the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 and related matters; the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002; the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003; the establishment of an Australian republic; the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002; the government amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002; the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing for Property Offences) Bill 2000 [2002]; the Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002; the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which led into migration zone excision and examination of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 and related matters; the outsourcing of Australian Customs Services information technology; the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and related bills; the provisions of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003, which we are currently dealing with; the provisions of the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003; the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Amendment Bill 2003, and I understand hearings on that are still under way; the provisions of the Family Law Amendment Bill 2003; the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Bill 2003; the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003; other migration legislation; telecommunications interception; reconciliation; security legislation; the private senator's bill on one vote, one value; the statutory powers and functions of the Australian Law Reform Commission; the capacity of current legal aid and access to justice arrangements to meet the community need for legal assistance; and finally the needs of expatriate Australians, which is currently under way. 
I place those inquiries on the record purely to give an illustration of the workload being placed on the legal and constitutional committees. I think you would confidently agree with me that these committees will take on any inquiry that the Senate asks of them, will do so seriously and will consider it a duty, and all effort will be put into it. But it seems to me that it is getting to the point, with the time and resources currently allocated to these committees, where some inquiries cannot be done competently or comprehensively unless more time and resources are made available to these committees. There are other committees to which the Senate can refer inquiries. There is the rural and regional affairs committee, there is the community affairs committee and there are others. I note that three of the inquiries Senator Brown has successfully had referred by the chamber for investigation have gone to other committees. They were an inquiry into the MOPS staffing arrangements, an inquiry into Turkish asylum seekers and an inquiry into various chemicals, and I understand there were hearings for that in Parliament House this morning. But I make the point that Senator Brown, who moved and argued that those inquiries be referred to committees, did not participate—and is not participating—in any of the hearings of those three inquiries. I do not raise that, Senator Brown, to be unkind—
—Yes, you do.
—No, I make the point to express the frustration. Those of us who are full and participating members on these inquiries can find it unsettling to be presented with extra work only to find that the originators, those people who specify particular areas of inquiry and move them through this chamber, do not follow through on the work that subsequently unfolds. I understand the expectations on senators of their party colleagues, their constituencies and their electorates in terms of work and obligations. I understand that we cannot be in all places at all times. But I do think it is incumbent on senators who propose and succeed with particular terms of reference to engage in the committee processes that flow from that.
I would like to conclude with a last point about the work that the committees are doing. I make the observation that there is an increasing trend in this place for inquiries to be held on sitting days. As a relatively new person to this chamber, having been here five years, I understand that that has not always necessarily been the case—historically it has not been frequent.
—Five years is reasonable. That is half a decade.
—It feels like an eternity. I meant relatively.
—But what you say is right. The point you make is right.
—I thank the minister. The point I am making is that the trend has shifted: a greater number of Senate inquiries are being held in-house on sitting days. I make a plea to colleagues to desist with that as best they can. I accept that there will be exceptions. There will be circumstances—and this might be one of them if Senator Brown's motion before us were to succeed—where you might want to have an inquiry on a sitting day in Canberra because those people who could reasonably expect to be called before that committee would likely be based in Canberra in the first instance. But there are many occasions when, particularly for those of us on the legal and constitutional committees who live in the more remote parts of Australia—Perth for me or Darwin for my colleague Senator Scullion—the time and distance involved in participating in the Senate committee processes can be challenging, to say the least. But we do our best to participate. 
Having Senate committee hearings on sitting days is unfair on both senators and more particularly witnesses. As the bells in the chamber ring for divisions and quorums, as they do frequently throughout the day, it is unfair—indeed rude—to continually get up and leave committee inquiries, leaving witnesses and secretarial staff waiting for the return of senators so the hearings can continue. My final plea is to please desist from having committee hearings on sitting days.
I note a fax that came across my desk today from, I understand, Senator Brown proposing yet another inquiry—this time for the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 to be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. This is yet another inquiry being asked of us. I am not suggesting that the inquiry itself is not worthy or that it is not something that we should not look into, but I make the point again that the legal and constitutional committees have six inquiries currently under way, potentially another four, I understand, by the end of next week and now this one coming across our desk. It lends greater argument—
—Does that include the teachers one?
—I am uncertain, Senator.
—It has been referred.
—It is now on the list as yet another bill. You may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Bolkus, that I approached you informally some months ago and tentatively asked whether the Democrat Sexuality and Gender Identity Discrimination Bill 2003 might also go to one of the legal and con committees for investigation and you advised me that the legal and con committees would be too busy to deal with that.
 (Senator Bolkus)—Now you know why.
—I will in future perhaps take such comments with a pinch of salt because, subsequent to you saying that, an additional five—now six—bills have been referred to those committees.
—I told you they were coming.
—I think it means two things. Ultimately we can and should deal with some of these issues in another forum, and Senate estimates does lend itself to that. As Senator Ray made the point, that is the time at which the very people you would hope to inquire of, particularly on this hearing, are going to be there before you. Secondly, perhaps senators might join their voices in a greater chorus for more resources for Senate committees, not the least of which would be the Senate legal and con committees. 
To conclude, I say to Senator Brown that the terms of reference in his motion are fine. I have no objection to them. But I do genuinely believe that the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee is not the place but that Senate estimates committee does lend itself more readily to that.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-23,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 14 May 2004:
Whether any pressure was put on the Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mr Keelty in relation to his views or comments on the connection between Australia's involvement in the war on Iraq and the threat to Australia's security and, in particular, what communications took place between the office of the Prime Minister, other ministerial advisers or public servants and Mr Keelty in his capacity as Police Commissioner in relation to that matter.
I move that motion because it is extremely important that in a working democracy, and in a bicameral system such as ours, the Senate act as a watchdog on the excesses of the government, particularly where you have a dominant government in the House of Representatives and particularly where you have a government in its third term that is forgetting that there is a clear delineation between politics in the country and policing of the country. Our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, has crossed the dividing line between politics in Australia and the policing of Australia. We know from the public evidence that a week ago the Prime Minister interfered in a statement by the Australian Police Commissioner about terrorism, which of course is extremely important to the fabric of political discussion and to the security of this country in the current day and age.
On the Nine Network's Sunday program, Jana Wendt interviewed AFP Commissioner Keelty. She said:
Well, Commissioner, that brings me to the question that most Australians are asking themselves. Could this happen here? 
That is, could a terrorist attack happen in Australia? Commissioner Keelty responded:
Well, I think we've said all along this is an uphill battle. This is a marathon, not a sprint. The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq. And I don't think anyone's been hiding the fact that we do believe that ultimately one day, whether it be in one month's time, one year's time, or ten years' time, something will happen.
And no one can guarantee it won't. And I think there's a level of honesty that has to exist here in terms of what the problems are here, not only in Australia but in our region.
But on the threat level, the threat level here in Australia hasn't changed. It still remains at medium. It has been at medium for some time for an attack on Australians in Australia.
What Commissioner Keelty was saying is commonsense. If it is established that Islamic extremists were responsible for the outrage in Madrid then you can take it from there that it is likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other countries like Australia took in involving themselves in the invasion and continued occupation of Iraq. That is commonsense and an opinion poll since Sunday week has shown that two out of three Australians recognise that as commonsense. But as far as the Prime Minister of Australia is concerned, it was not politically edifying. It was not to the government's political advantage so he had his chief of staff, Mr Sinodinos, contact Commissioner Keelty within minutes of that Channel 9 interview and express the displeasure, or at least the discomfort, of the Prime Minister about the words that Commissioner Keelty had used.
After some days of growing public concern about this and the revelation on the Tuesday that Mr Sinodinos had indeed made that contact, Commissioner Keelty felt the need to put out what is called a clarifying statement, which did not alter his comment on the risks at all but said that he had been taken out of context. The question here is not the comment of Commissioner Keelty at all. He is concerned that he has a responsibility to be open to Australians about matters relating to his police work—not least, of course, the security of the country when it comes to terrorism.
The Prime Minister's interference is a different matter altogether. It is not acceptable in our democracy that you have an elected representative in government—the most powerful political figure in the country—ringing the chief of police to say what should be said in public. That is a transgression. If it is allowed to pass, if it is not questioned and if there is not a breakthrough on the Prime Minister's refusal to discuss the matter then we will become effectively complicit in what has happened. I, for one, am not going to be complicit in this. The full strength of the Senate needs to be brought to bear in discovering how the Prime Minister's contact was made, why it was made, how it was followed up and why it led to Commissioner Keelty bringing out his subsequent statement.
The Senate has the power to establish a committee. It has the power to subpoena people and documents. It can certainly test the Prime Minister's faith with the country and with the democratic system in this country by asking even him to appear. The Prime Minister should appear before such a committee; so ought the police commissioner. This can be done in camera if necessary, and it should be done in a way which does not infringe on the primary interest of the public—the public interest of this country. To let it ride—to say that we should do nothing and should simply allow a system in which prime ministers ring police commissioners, heads of security services or heads of armed services to dictate or to influence what is said in the public arena by these esteemed public officers who know full well their primary duty to the government, the people and the long-term interests of this country—is not acceptable. 
The Senate should be supporting this motion. The opportunity to direct the public servants who may be involved, the staff officers who may be involved and the principal figures to appear before such a committee is compelling. There is one alternative. That is that the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, be direct, honest and aboveboard with the Australian people and explain the instructions he gave to Mr Sinodinos and others on his staff in contacting Commissioner Keelty—why he did that and how he can show that it was in the public interest to do that rather than in the political interest of a Prime Minister heading towards an election within months and rattled by the new debate that has arisen in the Australian community about not just the propriety but also the good sense of our nation's involvement in the war in Iraq.
Let me make my assessment of this clear. We cannot allow terrorists to dictate what this nation does, what it thinks or how it acts—never: not now, not in the past and not in the future. Any robust democracy must not allow that to even enter into the debate. On the other hand, we cannot allow the political and public debate about terrorism to be unnecessarily truncated. It was in the public interest for Mr Keelty to express his point of view. It was, after all, sheer commonsense. It is not in the public interest to have the Prime Minister intervene in that for his own political purposes. This was an egregious and premeditated mistake by Prime Minister Howard. Where is his explanation for it? Where is his apology not just to Mr Keelty but also to the nation? It is not there. One is led to wonder what else this Prime Minister is prepared to do to further his own political kudos, or rather to cover his own sliding political fortunes by crossing the boundaries of democratic decency and what is understood in this country to be the divide between such things as policing functions and political interests.
Prime Minister Howard put political interest before the interests of this country. It is in the interests of this country that Commissioner Keelty and other major figures involved should be able to put on the public record their assessment of how this nation is proceeding. I do not for one minute think that these officers are going to fail the public interest. Certainly Commissioner Keelty did not do so on this occasion. He was serving the public interest. His problem was that he was not serving Prime Minister Howard's interests. There is a divergence between the two, and that says something about the mood of this nation at the moment. The Prime Minister's interest here was not the interests of the nation. When that occurs and when the Prime Minister infracts upon proper practice, as he has done on this occasion, he deserves to come under the full scrutiny of the Senate, of the other place in this parliament which, amongst its other functions, is a check on the executive government—in this case the executive government of Prime Minister Howard. It is more limited than that: it is actually government from the prime ministerial office.
This move for a Senate inquiry is the strongest move we can make. I say to other senators on this side of the house that it should be supported. I do not want there to be any stone left unturned in pursuit of the Prime Minister—he can defend himself—and the discovery of the motivation and the means he used to further his political interest in this matter. That is what this inquiry is about and that is why this inquiry should be supported. I note that the opposition is seeking papers and documents. I say to the opposition that we should also be seeking the people involved. We all know that a Senate inquiry, which is able to get people to appear before it, is always much more successful than simply getting together papers to discuss them and to see whether or not they give some further clue as to how the government is behaving. The inquiry should be held now. It should be supported today. It should use the full powers of the Senate to discover the whole truth of this matter. That is why the Greens have brought it forward. 
We know that there is the potential here for distress to be caused. We believe that the chief of police should be able to get on with his business. We also believe that this matter will not be settled unless every effort is made as soon as possible—and that time is now—to have it fully aired publicly and a determination made on it. Then we can move on. I am afraid that any other course of action will not achieve that goal. I know we must all be concerned in this place that with the Prime Minister we have and the way in which he works behind the scenes to influence events—with the way in which this government has invented information and has deceived, not least in the matter of sending Australians to war in Iraq at the behest of the Bush administration in America—it would be very difficult to extract all the information from the Prime Minister. He can exclude himself from the reach of the Senate, but let us reach those that we can. Let us get the information we can. Let us test this Prime Minister, and his administration, in the best way that we are able to—which is by supporting this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,21,2
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-23,"—The public bullying of AFP Commissioner Keelty by the Howard government is certainly a serious matter. It is not surprising that this issue has dominated the media for more than a week and it is not surprising that this issue has dominated the Australian parliament over the last two days. Ask yourself why this affair has attracted so much interest. I think there are a number of reasons. It is not proper for a government to heavy an independent statutory office holder to toe the government line. The subject of the heavying, Commissioner Keelty, is held in high regard for his efforts to combat terrorism in Australia and abroad.
The comments for which the commissioner was heavied seemed to be reasonable and, frankly, quite unremarkable. The government's reaction to those comments was absolutely over the top, giving the impression of a panicked Prime Minister. As a result of the media scrutiny and the parliamentary scrutiny, we have a pretty good picture of what transpired. I would like to set out for the Senate what we know. We have the appalling terrorist attack in Madrid occurring on 11 March. It was one of the worst attacks in Europe since the Second World War, killing 202 people and injuring more than 1,500. In the following days, as many began to wonder if the terrorist attack was the work of al-Qaeda, Commissioner Keelty told Jana Wendt on the Sunday program on 14 March, and I quote:
The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.
Immediately after the interview, and still in the Channel 9 studio, Commissioner Keelty received a phone call from the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Arthur Sinodinos. According to Steve Lewis's report in the Australian on Tuesday, 16 March, the call was terse and Commissioner Keelty was personally chastised by Mr Sinodinos for contradicting the government claim that the Iraq war had not increased the terrorist threat to Australia. Sydney Morning Herald columnist Alan Ramsey wrote that the Prime Minister's media adviser, Tony O'Leary, confirmed Mr Sinodinos made the call to Commissioner Keelty after a conversation with the Prime Minister. In the ensuing days, we heard a number of ministers, and the Prime Minister, disagreeing with Commissioner Keelty and questioning the commissioner's ability to make such a judgment. For instance, on Monday, 15 March the Attorney-General, Mr Philip Ruddock, said: 
Well that's not a conclusion I would agree with because the evidence doesn't suggest that that is likely.
On the 7.30 Report on Monday, 15 March, Mr Howard went further, questioning whether Commissioner Keelty was in a position to make such a comment and comparing his assessments with those of ASIO Director-General, Dennis Richardson. I quote the Prime Minister:
And that is part of the background as to why somebody such as the Director General of ASIO, who, with all due respect to the other people you've mentioned, is a more authoritative person than most on the motives and the modus operandi of terrorist organisations.
There is a difference between the intelligence judgments that are brought to bear in relation to these organisations and the operational functions of police commissioners and police forces.
They are quite separate issues, and quite separate and different judgments are brought to bear.
But then on Tuesday, 16 March we had Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, as usual, going a bridge too far; this is his modus operandi. He told journalists in a doorstop interview at Parliament House:
I think he—
this is Commissioner Keelty, I interpolate—
is just expressing—expressing a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we're getting from al Qa'eda. I think what the bottom line of all this is is that they—al Qa'eda—are out there running this line on Iraq, and they're doing it for propaganda purposes.
Then we had General Cosgrove, the Chief of the Defence Force, tell journalists:
I disagree with him—
I interpolate again: the `him' is Commissioner Keelty—
on this occasion.
That was on 16 March. Then, according to the Australian, Commissioner Keelty was so concerned by the government attacks on his reputation that he seriously considered resigning. After the Sunday interview, according to Alan Ramsey, Mr Howard's office began `heavying' Commissioner Keelty over the phone, telling him to stay away from the media. Throughout Tuesday the Prime Minister's office continued to press Commissioner Keelty to issue a clarification of his Sunday remarks. According to the Age newspaper, the PM&C Secretary, Peter Shergold, `negotiated' with Commissioner Keelty over the press statement. According to Alan Ramsey, the offices of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General were also involved in drafting the statement and, when completed, it was `vetted' by Mr Howard's office. By Tuesday evening the Prime Minister's office had successfully pressured Commissioner Keelty into issuing a press statement to `clarify' his remarks on the Sunday program. After the release of the statement we have Alexander Downer again. He put on that incredible performance on Lateline: he did a complete U-turn. I quote what he said on 16 March:
Now, as for Mr Keelty, let me just make a point about him if I could.
You are right, he has done a wonderful job in the fight against terrorism.
I'll never forget the fantastic job he's done with the Indonesians in the follow-up to the Bali bombing.
The extraordinary job he's done in the South Pacific, the work he's now doing with Papua New Guinea. 
He's an outstanding Australian.
He will go down in history as one of the great police commissioners and I certainly have no intention of reflecting on him or his professionalism.
He is an outstanding Australian.
On the Wednesday, ministers, the Prime Minister included, all changed their tune and began commending and praising the work of Commissioner Keelty. We had Attorney-General Ruddock saying:
I have the utmost respect for Mick Keelty. He's a very experienced officer ...
We had the Prime Minister saying:
I think he does his job extremely well.
Notwithstanding their ringing public endorsements of the commissioner, his original remarks still obviously rankle with the government. As recently as last Sunday the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, made this very clear when he said:
But look, I mean, people who work in Government agencies are expected to give frank and fearless advice to Government, but they are not free agents to be able to traverse every other area of responsibility as if they have relevant expertise in those areas.
It is not that Commissioner Keelty's original remarks were in any way remarkable: a number of terrorism and political experts have expressed a similar point of view. Professor Rohan Gunaratna, a former principal investigator with the United Nations Terrorism Prevention Branch and author of Inside Al Qaeda, told journalists on Monday, 15 March:
Certainly the conflict in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism world wide, especially to countries that have participated with the Americans in Iraq.
Clive Williams, Director of Terrorism Studies at the ANU, told Channel 10 on Wednesday, 17 March:
After our involvement in East Timor we were probably in the top twenty of preferred targets, and then after Afghanistan probably the top ten and I think after Iraq probably in the top four.
Then John Pistole, the FBI's executive assistant director of counter-terrorism, told 2UE radio in Sydney:
Any country that allies itself with the US, unfortunately, is a target. Whether it's a higher target is a relative issue that becomes moot once the place is attacked.
Let me quote what, back in August last year, ASIO Director-General Dennis Richardson said about the war in Iraq:
It's too early to tell what impact the war in Iraq will have, more broadly, on the threat of terrorism.
We are only up to chapter 6 in a 10 chapter book, with the last four chapters yet to be written.
At one end of the spectrum Iraq could be another Afghanistan in providing a cause celebre for young Muslims worldwide. At the other end of the spectrum Iraq might be re-made, with positive consequences for the Middle East.
That is from the ASIO Director-General's address to the Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association's annual conference in Brisbane. Last week Mr Richardson made similar remarks when he addressed the Security in Government Conference in Canberra:
The fact we are in close alliance with the United States and the fact that we were early and actively involved in the war on terrorism does contribute to us being a target.
Paul Wolfowitz, the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, told Fox News that Spain `has been a real stand-up country, and I suppose maybe that's one of the reasons they came under attack'. On Thursday morning, when Minister Downer was asked by the AM program if Paul Wolfowitz was wrong, Mr Downer said:
Look, everybody is entitled to their opinion, even the Australian Government is entitled to an opinion. 
Everybody is entitled to an opinion except Commissioner Keelty!
The treatment of Commissioner Keelty is not the first time a public servant has been pressured by the Howard government to clarify a statement seen as politically sensitive. Just recall the treatment of the then Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Shackleton, in 2001. Do not forget that, after talking to Commander Banks on HMAS Adelaide and discovering the children overboard allegation was a lie, Vice Admiral Shackleton relayed this information to journalists at a press conference on 8 November 2001, three days before a federal election was held. It was a revelation. Vice Admiral Shackleton in effect told the media and the public that children had never been thrown overboard.
With only a few days remaining until an election, the government of course went into damage control. Instead of facing up to the truth, the government pressured Vice Admiral Shackleton to clarify his statement. What did we have? We had the Minister for Defence's chief of staff, Peter Hendy, telling Vice Admiral Shackleton that he had contradicted the minister and must issue a press release. Interestingly, Hendy asked that a copy of the statement be cleared with—you guessed it—Arthur Sinodinos. Same person, same style, same approach. What did the statement say? It went as follows:
My comments in no way contradict the Minister. I confirm the Minister was advised that Defence believed children had been thrown overboard.
A year later the CMI report would find that the then Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, had deceived the Australian people during the 2001 federal election campaign. At the time, the Prime Minister claimed no-one pressured Vice Admiral Shackleton to clarify his remarks. He told Lateline on 8 November 2001:
I'm not aware that anybody in my office has spoken to him—
that is Shackleton—
But I just want to make it clear I have not put pressure on him and I did not ask anybody to put any pressure on him.
I suppose it is true. I suppose it is true that the Prime Minister did not directly pressure Vice Admiral Shackleton; his colleagues did it for him. Sinodinos did the job for him, just like he did the job on this occasion, just as it was done in the case of Commissioner Keelty. That is how this mob operates. That is the modus operandi of the Howard government.
We have a very detailed picture of what actually happened in this case, how the heavying of Commissioner Keelty worked, and we know from the previous heavying of Vice Admiral Shackleton that it is standard operating procedure for the government. Even people as smart as Senator Hill can get caught up with this. He had to put out a clarifying statement himself, when he was honest about weapons of mass destruction this morning. He had to very quickly, after being up in a hot air balloon—a piece of interesting symbolism for a minister in this government—put out a clarifying statement.
—Did Arthur contact him? No!
—We do not know that, Senator Ray. I did ask him in question time but, again standard operating procedure: no answer from Senator Hill. You would not expect government ministers to come clean on these sorts of issues.
But Senator Hill is not the issue. We ought to be more concerned about the sort of pressure that is applied to senior public servants and, when similar pressure has been applied to them, when it is applied to public servants, to military officers and to statutory office holders. We know of two cases in detail; I have just gone through them. How many more have there been? The immediate question before the chair at the moment concerns a proposition moved by Senator Brown calling for a Senate inquiry. You have to ask yourself the question `Will a Senate inquiry illuminate the Keelty matter any more?' I do not think so. Consider those who the inquiry might want to call. You might want to start with the Prime Minister. He will not front. 
—He has taken a vow of silence.
—He has taken a vow of silence. Perhaps you might then go to the Prime Minister's chief of staff, Mr Sinodinos, a central player in this matter. He will not front. You would certainly want the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, to give evidence. He will not front. We have some idea of what happened in Attorney-General Ruddock's office. His staff will not front. Does anyone believe that Mr Downer would have the guts to front up? Of course not. No-one seriously believes that these key witnesses would give evidence to a Senate inquiry. We know that is the case.
Does anyone believe that the Howard government would be any more honest in answers to questions about this affair from a Senate committee than it has been in its answers in question time in the Senate, in the House of Representatives and in previous parliamentary inquiries? I do not think so. I certainly do not believe they would—that is my view. Of course, what you are left with is Commissioner Keelty, who may or may not be instructed to come to the committee if a committee were established. If he were so instructed, of course he would not front, so he would end up being the fall guy. That is not what I believe should happen and I do not think it is what any senator believes should happen.
I do not think we are in a position at this stage where we can say that we need a Senate inquiry to expose the government's reprehensible and ham-fisted behaviour on this particular matter and their ham-fisted and reprehensible behaviour towards Commissioner Keelty. The behaviour has been exposed and this government stands condemned for it. We will have an opportunity to question the government about any loose ends or new developments in this saga through question time and certainly through the Senate estimates process, where certain officials, including Commissioner Keelty, will be present.
There are other ways in which we can use the procedures and processes of this chamber to further expose the government's action. This afternoon, for example, I have given notice of a motion to require the government to table the drafts of the clarifying statement which was prepared for Commissioner Keelty. I hope the government conforms with that order of the Senate, if it is agreed to, by Tuesday of next week. There is also a motion I have moved co-jointly with the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett, which I would commend to the Senate. I want to say this: the opposition does sympathise with the motivation behind this motion and the good reasons Senator Brown has given for moving it. At this stage I have indicated we do not believe it warrants support, for all the cogent reasons I have outlined, but we will not give up on this issue. We will hold the government accountable on this matter. The truth will out.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,21,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-03-23,"—All the issues under discussion today go back to the intervention in Iraq. The reasons the government put forward for intervening in Iraq had to be carefully crafted. After all, they were subscribing to a new policy position of pre-emptive intervention. We were not intervening with the blessing or the authority of the United Nations; we were doing it as a pre-emptive act. Therefore the government had to carefully craft the reasons for intervention so that they could be argued in a consistent way with regard to international law and with an eye on domestic political agendas. Two reasons were put up. It was argued by the government that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Subsequently, on a better view, they no longer hold that position—although Senator Hill today still seems to hold out some hope somewhere that some weapon of mass destruction will be found, a view not shared by many. 
Interestingly enough, the second reason for intervening was the supposed sponsorship by Iraq of terrorist groups. It having been put at that time, I have never heard the argument repeated and I have heard no evidence adduced for that particular rationale since the successful conclusion of the Iraq intervention. They have captured thousands of individuals and there have been hundreds of thousands of interrogations, yet there has not been one piece of evidence put forward that the Iraqi regime, with all its massive faults, was a sponsor of terrorism. It is very important, incidentally, that we in fact isolate those countries that do sponsor terrorism, because the easiest way of wiping out international terrorism is getting host countries to change their mind about it. We all welcome the developments in Libya and Sudan—countries that previously were seen as sponsors of terrorist groups have now forsaken that as a course of action.
But, in part of this rationale for going into Iraq, another subtext emerged. That was to argue that our intervention in Iraq would not increase the possibility of a terrorist action occurring on Australian soil. It is a strange view. It is a political view—political spin here is more important than the national interest. That is why this view has been put forward. It does not sit well, though, with the counterviews held by Paul Wolfowitz—hardly a left-winger—who is the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the US and a long-time expert on terrorism. It does not sit well with some of the experts in the FBI and some of the UK experts on terrorism. A whole range of people have said that intervention in Iraq may up you in terms of the possibility of a terrorist act on your soil. This is well-known, so whatever comments Commissioner Keelty made were merely reflecting the view of many other experts around the globe.
I would make it clear that I do not expect any sovereign country to be browbeaten by threats from terrorists. We cannot afford that. A lot of people have talked about the Spanish experience and whether Spain was moved up the priority list. Quite possibly—not necessarily because terrorists even like Iraq or are concerned about Iraq but because it gives them an excuse. But, if you are looking for the reason that the Spanish government was thrown out, it probably was not the terrorist attack per se. It was the later political manipulation of the issue by a conservative government. To put it frankly, they tried to cash in. They immediately blamed ETA, the Basque separatists, when it never even looked like following a pattern of their previous activity, and they got caught out on it. Do you want to know why the turnout in the vote jumped from 57 per cent to 77 per cent within a few days? Because the public did not want to be conned by their government. The public of Spain wanted a government that would put the national interest at the forefront and not try to exploit it for domestic political purposes. Don't you get a sense of deja vu here with this government that constantly talks about the national interest but only ever dreams and thinks of its own political survival and political self-interest? 
Much of the debate about Commissioner Keelty's statement misses the point. Of course we were a target prior to Iraq—most open democratic societies are a target for these fanatics. The key question that Commissioner Keelty raised, simply so we could be properly prepared for it, was: have we moved up the priority list? Have these extremists used our intervention in Iraq as an excuse to move us up the list? He was basically saying that the answer to that is probably yes, as do all these other experts. What is so wrong with saying that? Understanding that, we can be better prepared to counteract it and to meet it in the future. But his problem was that he had undermined a central plank of political spin that sustains this particular government.
Such threats cannot govern our approach to terrorism, but what we want is an honest description of where we stand, not some contrived, false construction that deludes the Australian public. I do not want to hear any nonsense that intelligence suggests that we have not moved up the list. How would you know that through intelligence? Given the fact that strategic intelligence was a major failure with regard to Iraq, what has suddenly improved that this government could base its assessments on intelligence that says al-Qaeda has not targeted Australia more strongly because of intervention in Iraq? You would not know either way. 
I suspect we will never get to the truth of what really happened between the government and Commissioner Keelty. We will not know whether he threatened to resign or whether the clarifying statement was foisted upon him by government spin doctors. So why not have an inquiry? I answer: simply because it will not work. As Sheridan once said, I am quite happy to beat my head against a brick wall; I do not want to build one for that specific purpose. That is the problem with this particular inquiry proposed by Senator Brown.
I acknowledge and endorse the remarks by Senator Faulkner that on this occasion Senator Brown is totally well intentioned. A couple of times I have been unkind enough to say that inquiries wanted by Senator Brown were just a circus, a public display. But that is not his motivation on this stage; he is trying to get to the truth of the matter. Where we disagree is that I do not think you will get to the truth of the matter through this inquiry. In fact, I do not think this inquiry that he proposes can get anywhere because of the lack of witnesses.
Let us go through it. Who would you want to call to such an inquiry? I do not think we would have a disagreement between Senator Brown and me. We would want Prime Minister Howard to front up, but there is the tradition of comity between the houses, which is usually an adequate excuse for him not to appear and certainly not to be compelled. We would want to know what instructions he gave Mr Sinodinos before he rang the police commissioner. We would want to know why he did it so rapidly. Why not wait till Commissioner Keelty got home or back to his office? Why ring him at the Channel 9 studios? It was by mobile phone, so they may not have known it. But why react so rapidly? It has nothing to do with the national interest. If you impinge on Liberal Party self-interest, there is an immediate reaction.
Another question is: why didn't Mr Howard ring Commissioner Keelty himself? Why did he give it to his hatchet man to do? Why not ring the commissioner and say, `I think we have a difference of opinion here. Can we discuss it next week?' No, no, no. Get the hatchet man to ring him up, because it is more humiliating to slap the police commissioner around when it is a mere staffer, albeit a highly paid one. Why did the Prime Minister at a later time, by Monday, seek to invoke the Director-General of ASIO into the dispute? To put Mr Keelty down, he says, `I'm really going to rely on what the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, tells me.' I can imagine how happy Mr Richardson would be to be dragged into this argument. That was a tool by the Prime Minister, again to humiliate the police commissioner. It is the same sort of thing as the Prime Minister waving an ONA report around on 8 November 2001 to save his political skin over `children overboard'—`We have it in the report that backs up our point of view'— 
—The same day Sinodinos got to Shackleton.
—That is right, exactly the same, Senator. The next question we would like to ask the Prime Minister is: why did you involve the secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet in this? Why did Dr Peter Shergold have to go and negotiate with the police commissioner? I cannot speak for him but I am sure he was not happy to do so. It was probably the last thing he wanted to do, so why involve him? If the police commissioner wanted to change or clarify any of his statements of the previous Sunday, why not just leave him to it? Why was it necessary to get a government negotiator involved in this? Again, we have no answers to this.
Once things start to go pear-shaped, suddenly we have a Prime Minister that impersonates a Trappist monk and takes a vow of silence. Suddenly our voluble Prime Minister becomes the soul of discretion. In an interview on Adelaide radio that has to be acknowledged as a fairly friendly interview, the following exchange took place—this is last Thursday, after five days of endless comment:
REPORTER: Prime Minister, did your office urge Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty to issue a clarification over his remarks linking the Madrid bombings to Spain's involvement in Iraq?
JOHN HOWARD: I'm not going to comment on that story.
REPORTER: Why not?
JOHN HOWARD: Because I'm not commenting on it.
REPORTER: You can't say whether Mr Keelty's statement on Tuesday was made after a request from your office?
JOHN HOWARD: I don't have any comment on those matters.
Yesterday at question time in another place the Prime Minister was asked by the Leader of the Opposition:
What did the Prime Minister instruct his chief of staff to say to Mr Keelty?
Mr Howard replied:
... there are numerous discussions between not only my office and the secretary of my department and also the commissioner but other people. I do not intend to break the confidentiality of those discussions.
I interpolate: I will just get Tony to leak it out to the press. The Leader of the Opposition goes on to ask the Prime Minister:
What involvement did the Prime Minister, his staff or ... his department have in the preparation of the so-called statement of clarification issued by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner on 16 March?
Our Prime Minister says:
That statement was the commissioner's statement. As to contact ... I do not intend to go into it ... 
So much for an honest, open approach. Where government requires transparency we have a Prime Minister, as the Americans would say, who takes the Fifth Amendment. We have a Prime Minister not willing to justify publicly the actions of his sanctioned assassin who carried out the task in private. This is from someone who had the temerity, indeed the impertinence, to accuse former opposition leader Kim Beazley of lacking ticker. Come on down, Prime Minister. You have made a major miscalculation. Why don't you own up to it? You must really be going bad, Prime Minister, if you are not fronting up on the Ray Martin program to explain yourself. That is when you know the Prime Minister has gone totally maggoty on an issue. Do not accuse anyone else of lack of ticker in future if you are not willing to front. If you are not willing to justify your actions, as Prime Minister, never accuse anyone else of lacking ticker. 
The second witness we would like to see brought before the inquiry, if we had one, is chief of staff Mr Sinodinos. But again, he will not be available because he works under the MoP(S) Act—not subject to its salary limitations; he has been paid well above that for a number of years. Because of the `children overboard' and other precedents, we cannot call Mr Sinodinos to give evidence. Only the Prime Minister, the silent Prime Minister, our newly enrolled sworn in Trappist monk of a Prime Minister can represent Mr Sinodinos, but he will not say anything.
We would like to ask Mr Sinodinos what instructions he was given by the Prime Minister on that Sunday morning immediately after the interview. We would like to know whether the nature of his conversation with Commissioner Keelty was proper or improper. We would also like to know why he did not obey the guide of conduct that suggests and instructs him as a MoPS employee and an adviser to go through the relevant portfolio minister before talking to a public servant in another area. This was totally and absolutely ignored.
Senator Ellison said yesterday that you cannot do that on every occasion. I accept that but, when you are issuing an admonishment or reprimand, you should follow the rules. When you are purporting to represent a Prime Minister and are slapping around a police commissioner, you had better follow the rules of the game. But of course none of these questions will be answered, and that would make a committee of inquiry next to useless. We could call Senator Ellison because he is a senator, but he is just the government's resident doormat. That is clear because he was not even involved in a conversation with the police commissioner until as late as Tuesday afternoon—two days after the alleged offence—so we might as well leave him out of an inquiry. 
If the answers he gave today in question time are any example, he would add nothing. He answered a dorothy dix on national security and tried to smear the opposition as though we are not on board in supporting national security. What a typically weak wedge effort—not even done with style and class, just a pathetic spray. He was then asked who leaked the Brigitte information—not the details of it, but how it got into the public domain. There was no answer whatsoever from the minister, from the doormat. It would be unnecessary to bring him before an inquiry because he would add absolutely no value to the inquiry.
We could compel Dr Peter Shergold to attend such an inquiry. He is a witness who could attend. I do not really want to do that because I do not think it would be fair on him. He was just following orders; he did not have any choice in the matter. If we were to bring him before the inquiry, I am certain he would give accurate and honest evidence. He would not be like a couple of the public servants in the `children overboard' inquiry, including the Anastasia of the Public Service who on 53 occasions said, `I can't recall,' and on another 40 occasions said, `I can't remember.' In reward for that she received a Public Service Medal and the secretaryship of the biggest department around. Dr Shergold would not behave in that way, so why should I want to embarrass him for being an honest public servant? I would not want to do that. 
We could ask Mr Downer to appear. But after watching him on Latelinethe other night I do not want to cringe all over again. What a pathetic, miserable, hopeless performance that was. It was probably—and I really like Alexander Downer, so I do not want to say this too harshly—the equal of Senator Rod Kemp's Latelineor 7.30 Report performance.
—I don't believe that; it couldn't have been that bad.
—Maybe not. I might withdraw that accusation. But I mean we are not going to get Mr Downer to come. We are not going to get any politician to front up at this inquiry. Yes, we could bring along the Director-General of ASIO to embarrass—and he should not be embarrassed because he has played a totally honourable role in all of these matters. What about Commissioner Keelty himself? Is it fair to bring him along? He would be in a no-win position at the inquiry. I have not always commended him for the evidence that he has given before committees, but I feel on this occasion he would be put in a totally invidious position.
Why has all this come up? It has come up because this government hates criticism. It just cannot stand any adverse comment. It detests scrutiny. Just look at Senator Alston's and Senator Santoro's attacks on the ABC's coverage of Iraq. It is not as though the fourth estate does not support the coalition government. But it expects total hegemony in this area. Look at the swag of right wing chatterers who day in, day out support the government's foreign policy—be it Andrew Bolt from the Herald Sun, Alan Jones, Piers Akerman, Greg Sheridan, Christopher Pearson, Michael Baume, Dennis Shanahan or Janet Albrechtsen. The list goes on and on. There are hundreds of these right wing acolyte writers out there, backing up every action of the government. 
But that is not enough—the first person who steps out of line and inadvertently upsets the political spin of this government gets slapped around by a ministerial staffer. If you are like Andrew Wilkie, what does this Nixonian government do? It is not just a question of being slapped around: suddenly a top-secret, AUSTEO, code-worded ONA document written by him is leaked to one of the government's media hatchet men so the job can be done on him. That is the way it reacts in these circumstances. 
Let me repeat that the miserable behaviour by the government will not be exposed by an inquiry because the witnesses will not turn up. They will turn such an inquiry into a circus. We will not get the truth; we will not get answers. The only people who will front up will be the honest ones and then they will be exposed to an inquisition that would be unfair in as much as the others will not be subject to it. I commend Senator Brown—and I do not often do it—for his thoughts behind this motion. I know he is genuine about it. I know he wants to get to the truth, but we disagree on the method of getting to the truth. The government are far worse than Senator Brown thinks they are—if he thinks any of them will front up to tell the truth.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,21,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-23,"—The Senate is debating what is an important matter and, while it has been considered and talked about in the public and political arenas for some time, I do not think the significance of it should be understated. This government has acted completely inappropriately by publicly and privately pressuring an independent statutory officer in a very important position—the head of the Australian Federal Police—for expressing individual views, views which were not remarkable in any way, shape or form. But, because of what can only be described as the paranoia of the Prime Minister, those views were seen as somehow potentially reflecting on him and his government's line in relation to Iraq.  
The Senate is also debating whether or not to establish a Senate inquiry into the actions of the Prime Minister and other ministers and ministerial staff of his government. Senator Brown has outlined quite well why establishing a special Senate inquiry now is not necessary. He outlined in a fair bit of detail and quite accurately what has happened—how the Prime Minister and ministerial staff have acted inappropriately—and Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner have built on that. 
Broadly speaking we know what has happened and we know that the Prime Minister is clearly guilty of very inappropriate behaviour. We do not need a Senate inquiry to tell us that. It would be nice to know some of the facts that we are not aware of but, as has just been outlined, a specifically set-up Senate inquiry would not tell us any of those details because the people needed before the inquiry to find out that information would not show up. The precedent has clearly been established.
It is important to highlight that this is not just a matter of trying to generate political embarrassment for the Prime Minister. This is not just a matter of the Prime Minister being caught out as paranoid and overly obsessive about having his particular viewpoint seen as the accepted truth. This is a serious matter for the Australian public. It is not serious because it might be a political problem for the Prime Minister and, frankly, to some extent not even because Commissioner Keelty has been put in a difficult position; it is serious because it is an indication of independent statutory officers having major and inappropriate pressure brought to bear on them over what is widely acknowledged as being a fairly minor divergence of views from the government. What if this independent official, the commissioner of police, had a significant disagreement with the government? What if he knew the government was putting out something that was blatantly wrong and wanted to say something about it? He now knows that even the tiniest divergence, most of it imagined in the mind of the Prime Minister, will bring immense pressure on him. It is through this incident that a very clear message has been given to the head of the AFP: that any form of divergence over any matter—including matters far more important than the one we are talking about today—is viewed by the government as a major offence.
That same culture of oppression of public officers applies across the board. The message that the Prime Minister and Mr Sinodinos sent to Mr Keelty was not just a message for Mr Keelty; it was a message for every single public servant and every single public officer that they do not step one millimetre out of line. We know that this is not the first occasion this has happened. The work that was done through the `children overboard' inquiry—also known as A Certain Maritime Incident inquiry—quite clearly showed an obsession with control of information, public servants and Defence Force personnel. There was the complete gagging of a whole range of officials from making any public statements or releasing information without it being cleared through the minister. Enormous pressure was brought to bear, as has been outlined, on any officer who was seen as not toeing the line 100 per cent. The Public Service has become immersed in that culture across the board, and that is why it is serious. It seriously impacts on proper governance in this country, and having a Senate inquiry will just reaffirm what we already know—that is, a serious offence has occurred. It is not the first time this has occurred; it is endemic and the Prime Minister is a serial offender in using ministerial staff to heavy everybody. We saw that through the `children overboard' inquiry. 
Frankly, the work has already been done by Democrat and Labor senators through the `children overboard' inquiry and through estimates committees, when we have repeatedly followed up on a range of different incidents where inappropriate pressure has occurred. What we really need is action to try and prevent this sort of situation from continuing to occur. It is worth pointing out that the work has already started on this through other Senate committee processes, where Democrat and Labor senators are investigating ministerial staff behaviour. It has become very clear, and more and more of a problem over time, that ministerial staff are not held accountable. As previous speakers have said, they will not show up to any Senate committee inquiries. It is likely that the only person who would show up to an inquiry focused on this incident would be the commissioner, who would then be placed in an impossible position. Frankly, he is the last person, at least in relation to this incident, who should be put in that position. 
There is scope for parliament, through budget estimates committees in May, to continue to pursue not only the fabric of this particular incident but also the broader pattern of behaviour of a whole range of officials, but it has the continuing problem that ministerial staff and the vast bulk of ministers will remain unaccountable. That is where the work needs to be done. The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee has done some work on it, which has partly flowed from the `children overboard' inquiry. It has brought down a report on an inquiry into ministerial staffers and other staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act—the so-called MOPS Act—which included a number of recommendations. The Democrats believe these need to be acted on. If those recommendations were acted on, it would go some way to preventing a recurrence of the sort of incident that we are debating today. It is no surprise that the government has not responded to the recommendations of that report; indeed, it is no surprise that the government has not responded yet to the recommendations of the `children overboard' inquiry from even further back. There is not even the slightest interest from this government in acknowledging recommendations of inquiries that have put the spotlight on misbehaviour and inappropriate behaviour by ministers and ministerial staff.
That is where we really need to put the pressure on the government; not to have an inquiry to tell us what we already know, but to increase the pressure based on work done elsewhere to get accountability of ministerial staff. These are staff who are, in effect, acting as de facto ministers of the Crown by ordering public servants—including independent statutory officers, such as the commissioner of police, senior defence personnel and senior public servants—on what to do, but they are not able to be in any way held accountable or questioned on their behaviour or actions.
The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee recommended that ministerial staffers should be made to appear before committees, including Senate estimates committees, when requested. There is nothing specifically in law to prevent this. The Senate's powers to call witnesses are not tested, but I do not think there is much doubt that the legal power is there to require the attendance of ministerial staff. I believe the view of most senators is that it would not be a desirable use of Senate powers to press those powers to the limit. It would probably end up requiring court action if the government continued to insist on directing staff not to appear.  
Frankly, I have a stronger view than others on this. In a debate amongst different senators on the `children overboard' committee, there was certainly an open question about whether or not former Minister Peter Reith should have been pressed harder to appear before that committee. I believe that that should have occurred, that there was no doubt the committee had the power to compel him; but others took a different view to me, saying that it was not appropriate to use those powers. I think it is about time we tested those powers, particularly when you look at the record of the government. That shows quite clearly their deliberate and wilful attempts to refuse to answer questions and to provide information. And it goes much further than just not appearing before Senate committees. As I have often said in this place, there is a record of widespread refusal by the government to comply with orders of the Senate to produce documents. With such deliberate and wilful ignoring of the Senate's authority and with such deliberate and wilful deceit and hiding of information from the public, I think it is time for the Senate to consider using its powers more fully. 
I accept that others for quite genuine reasons have a different view, and I guess it is a debate that we will continue to have. The key issue from the Democrats' point of view on this matter is not to set up a specific, separate inquiry to examine what, broadly speaking, we already know. To use a very useful phrase that Senator Ray quoted: there is a lot of activity in this place of beating our heads against a brick wall, but we do not necessarily have to build one specifically for the purpose. I think that describes it quite well. But there are certainly other processes that have been used and are still being used to get movement in relation to the core problem here—and the core problem is not specifically the incident we are referring to but the entrenched attitude and behaviour of a government that is obsessed with control of all information and that insists its version of the truth is the only one allowed to have any sort of airing at all. 
That is a problem at the best of times but, as we know with this government, we have a clear record of their repeated use of that so-called truth actually being very flexible—to put it politely—when often it is just being completely fabricated, to put it in its worst frame of words. In such a circumstance it is required of the Senate to explore every avenue on behalf of the public to get the truth into the political debate. In relation to this incident, broadly speaking, we know the truth; we know what happened. We might not know the specific conversations; we might not know some of the detail. That would be useful to know, but a Senate inquiry will not produce it—not a specific one set up for that, as is suggested in this motion. 
The other work that has been done is not as glamorous and immediately appealing to media headlines; it is the typically grinding hard work that Senate committees need to do and that the Democrats are willing to do. It is the less visible, below-the-radar work carried out over a long period of time on the areas of government accountability that really gets significant shifts towards proper openness and transparency. It has been identified through a number Senate inquiries that there is a growing and now major problem with the lack of accountability of ministerial staff who are exercising their position with increasing authority but decreasing accountability. The focus needs to be on trying to ensure that these incidents do not continue to occur.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,21,2
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-23,"—The first point I would like to make in this debate is a rather curious one. This is a very strange debate. This is the first debate that I have seen in this place where, after five speakers—and I am the fifth speaker on this side of the debate—in a debate which is extremely critical of the Prime Minister and the government and other ministers, not one government senator has seen fit to get up and defend the Prime Minister. Not one government senator is expressing an interest in doing so, yet their behaviour is worthy of debate in this place. It is enormously critical and important behaviour. It is strange—as the record will show—that at a time when the Prime Minister needed to be defended and at a time when the foreign minister needed to be defended not one government senator showed an interest in defending them. I suppose across the board those on the other side share the respect for Mick Keelty that people on this side of the parliament do.  
—Senator McGauran laughs; maybe he does not. He can go back and tell the people of Victoria that he does not. Borne out of that respect is, I believe, an embarrassment on the other side that they cannot defend the indefensible. They cannot defend the bullying behaviour that occurred last week, and it is good to see that they are not coming into this place and trying to defend that indefensible behaviour. They are embarrassed by it. They should be embarrassed by it. The whole government should be embarrassed by it. 
What we are talking about today is quite a serious issue, one demanding of multiple responses but, as my colleagues indicated earlier on, probably not one that is immediately appropriate for the Senate committee process. But there is no doubt that what we have now—and we had it last week—is the behaviour of a government in decay. All the aspects of that decay were on parade as government ministers from the Prime Minister down took the long bat to one of the most respected leaders in this country, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty.
Last week we saw the worst aspects of this government. We saw an arrogant government bullying a senior independent officer. We saw a deceitful government selectively misusing the truth. We saw a hypocritical government undermining the reputation of someone they were falling over themselves to be photographed with just a few months ago. We saw a government in disarray as they shafted Mick Keelty one day and heaped praise on him the next. We also saw a desperate government who were prepared to dispense with the truth once again and, just as importantly, to dispense with the reputation of a decent, intelligent and highly respected professional officer. For what purpose? The only purpose was to save their skins.
At the helm of the government we saw a desperate and rattled Prime Minister. Aren't we getting used to that? From day one of the Latham leadership of the Labor Party, we have become used to the Prime Minister being wrong footed and looking desperate and embattled. The man of steel is starting to look like Captain Mainwaring, and that is getting through to the Australian public. The Prime Minister has form on the issue of truth, and the Australian public saw once again a Prime Minister who wishes to deny them the truth. The Prime Minister continues to keep the truth from the Australian people. I am sure this issue is resonating in the Liberal Party polling, as it does with anyone who goes out and talks to the public. We all know that, when it comes to keeping the truth from the Australian public, this Prime Minister is a serial offender. 
The Australian public firmly believe now that the truth was kept from them in the `kids overboard' affair. They do not believe, as we saw in this morning's poll, they were led into Iraq with honesty but that they were misled into that war. As we have heard from expert after expert, as a nation the public firmly believe we are a greater target as a consequence of the engagement in Iraq. They know that this government is trying to keep the fundamental truth from them. Another firm belief of the Australian people is that the issues of national security and law enforcement should be above politics, and they do not like the fact that last week those issues were not. The Australian public see the government's behaviour as an act of desperation, an act of deceit and an act of dishonesty. They are concerned across the country that these fundamental pillars of our system were dragged into a debate and the principal players were bullied.
Let us get a real fix on what happened last week. Commissioner Mick Keelty, the head of this nation's peak police body, the Australian Federal Police, told the Australian public what they also firmly believe and what most experts around the world believe. He said:
The reality is, if this—
the Madrid bombing—
turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.
He told the truth as he knew it and as he had analysed it. Not only have Commissioner Keelty and the Australian public expressed that view but also Minister Abbott and Paul Wolfowitz—conservatives in the extreme—have expressed that view. For that, Commissioner Keelty was jumped on and dumped on from a great height. Why? Essentially he was jumped on and dumped on because he told the truth in a way this Prime Minister did not want it told. Why didn't this Prime Minister want it told? Because this Prime Minister's only concern is his continuity in the job. He knows that it would be threatened if voters blamed him for increasing the risk of terrorist attacks within Australia. The Prime Minister ensured that by the end of last week those fundamental issues of the independence of our national security agencies and infrastructure, and the independence of our chief law enforcement officer and agency, were dispensable. They were dispensable at the altar of the security of the Howard government.
Commissioner Keelty is a person who is widely respected, and with good cause. I have known him for over 10 years, in the days when I was a minister, as a decent, intelligent and honest person. He had served previous governments skilfully, intelligently and honestly. With the transition to the Liberal government, I was continually confronted by Commissioner Keelty in estimates committees and other parliamentary committees, where he continued to show extreme dedication to the protection and security of the Australian public. He did so with honesty and intelligence. He is widely respected, and he deserves to be. He continues to serve this country professionally and intelligently.
In the days after the Bali bombing I am sure all Australians slept easier, as did I and my family, knowing that Mick Keelty was behind the wheel. He should be honoured rather than abused. Unfortunately, last week he was abused. But it was not just the person that was abused; it was also the institution of the highest ranking position in our national police force. In turn, the AFP as a whole was abused.
In this country we have legislative processes for interaction between different arms of government, and we have them for good reason. Our Constitution provides that there be a separation of powers, which is designed to balance authority. The separation of powers is designed to protect our democratic system and the rights of our people. This separation dictates that law enforcement be kept separate from the government of the day. This separation protects the independence of judiciaries. It demands that the law be applied without fear or favour, and it demands that those who enforce the law be protected by statutory independence. Commissioner Keelty is protected by such constitutional principles. These principles are reinforced by the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 as amended. That act establishes the legally allowable forms of communication, and it clearly shows that last week the government acted outside the law by pressuring the police commissioner. 
Let us turn to what the government did privately, and later on I will get onto what they did publicly. Privately, they berated him from within seconds of the interview on the Sunday program. We know that the Prime Minister's senior adviser rang Commissioner Keelty—and it was not to ask him what he was having for breakfast. The senior adviser rang Commissioner Keelty within seconds of the interview, with essentially two demands: the first was that the commissioner keep away from the press; the second was that he issue a clarifying statement. The law, the AFP Act 1979, defines the allowable channels of communication and direction of government with respect to the AFP commissioner. In this instance last week the government acted outside the law. Section 37(1) of that act talks of general administration. It says:
Subject to this Act, the Commissioner has the general administration of, and the control of the operations of, the Australian Federal Police.
The subsequent two subclauses of section 37 detail what are allowable channels of communication and what areas that communication is allowable in. Section 37(2) says:
The Minister may, after obtaining and considering the advice of the Commissioner and of the Secretary, give written directions to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police.
Subclause 3 states:
In addition to ... power to give directions under subsection (2), the Minister may give written directions (either specific or general) to the Commissioner in relation to the use of common services ...
It is very clear from this legislation that, when the act was passed, when the AFP was set up, the allowable communication, the allowable direction had to be in writing and only as to general policy. Last week it was not in writing and it was as to a specific matter of intelligence and law enforcement. Going back to when the legislation was introduced in parliament, during the term of the Fraser government in 1979, in his second reading speech the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr McLeay said:
The responsibilities of the Minister and the Secretary, who in some limited matters also advises the Minister, are clearly spelt out. They refer to the giving of written directions by the Minister, after seeking both the advice of the Commissioner and the Secretary, on the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Federal police ...
As I say, I think the government acted outside the law in pressurising the AFP Commissioner as they did last week. They did it privately. The legislation establishes the position of the AFP Commissioner as an independent one and it defines the allowable avenues of direction, and the government did not act within the law with respect to that. But this was not the full extent of the government's response that I find distasteful—there is even more. It was the response that is probably best summed up by Verona Burgess, one of our most respected public servant commentators, if not the most respected, in the weekend Canberra Times, where she said: 
What part of “children overboard” didn't the Government understand? The part about ruining the careers of public servants who didn't agree with them? The part about bullying those who dared speak out? The part about trashing the reputations of decent people who have committed their lives to the service of the nation? The part about playing senior officials against one another? Or the part about disguising the truth in a fog of confusion?
She goes on to say:
What is different this time is that the Prime Minister and his Chief of Staff, Arthur Sinodinos, have been caught with their pants down interfering with an independent statutory authority—the nation's top cop, Mick Keelty...
I think that best describes the government's response last week. They denigrated, they bullied, they played one officer against the other all in an attempt to disguise the truth. And when they wanted to get right into it, they called on the person whose conduct, I believe, alternates between village bully and town clown to take the police commissioner to task and to undermine his judgment and reputation. One of the most offensive performances I have seen in national politics was the performance last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, when he came to the crease and delivered the greatest insult of the lot. Of the man who probably, with the Director-General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, has done more to keep Australia safe from terrorism, Mr Downer said, `Keelty is just expressing a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we are getting from al-Qaeda.' Would you believe it, even from Alexander Downer? It was an amazing over-the-top statement. In one sentence, a one-line put-down, Downer tells us that Keelty has been (1) duped by al-Qaeda propaganda and (2) is mouthing that propaganda as a mouthpiece for al-Qaeda. In one line, Commissioner Keelty is depicted as being inept and gullible. When Minister Downer was attacked in the House of Representatives for this sort of statement, this sort of denigration, when he was accused of being a `rotten lousy disgrace', what was his response? The man who can throw it by the bucket load takes umbrage and demands a retraction. No-one has said anything worse in national politics recently than the statement by Minister Downer about Mick Keelty. But he is the one who is offended; he is the one who wants the attention. He is the one who least deserves it. Mick Keelty is the one who most deserves an apology from the minister—a profuse apology.
That was not the only line of attack on Commissioner Keelty last week. The other line—one used by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the foreign minister—was to claim that Commissioner Keelty was only involved in `operational matters'. To me, that is the more insidious and belittling put-down of the lot. In other words, we are told that Keelty and his operation do not do the thinking; they are just the legs and arms and they do the legwork and all the analysis and intelligence analysis is done elsewhere. It was more subtle than the al-Qaeda connection but I think professionally more damaging and, of course, totally wrong. It is a good line for the moment. It gets the Prime Minister out of sticky moments in press conferences and with the odd talkback announcer who may be critical. When we look at the work of Commissioner Keelty and the AFP and we take into account what the Prime Minister and others have said—the allegation that the AFP and Commissioner Keelty have not been involved in the intelligence analysis—let us acknowledge that Commissioner Keelty has been intimately involved in regional networking of intelligence, in global networking of intelligence and in domestic enforcement of laws based on intelligence.  
Let us also remember, lo and behold, that after Bali, this government, this Prime Minister gave the Australian Federal Police a counter-terrorist role, including 100 jobs for intelligence analysts. We are asked to believe that Commissioner Keelty has 100 intelligence analysts working for him, yet we are told he has no role in intelligence analysis. How dishonest, how tricky, how deceitful, how normal. If these analysts are not reporting to the commissioner, who are they reporting to? We all know who they are reporting to. Mick Keelty is at the pinnacle of that analysis. We know he has a role and, as I said earlier, together with Dennis Richardson he is probably more critical than anyone else in the protection of Australia's security. We see the theme over and over again. For Mr Downer it is us and them. He and his people are above the stairs with his mates. They are the ones capable of doing the analysis and the rest of us, people such as Commissioner Keelty, are the downstairs people. They are expected to do the legwork. They are the operational people. It is not a role in which to think about these things. I find that offensive. I am sure others in the community find it offensive and the sooner this country is rid of a patrician foreign minister like Downer, the better off we will be.
At the end of the week, I think Commissioner Keelty is probably more respected by the Australian people and Prime Minister Howard less so; he is obviously less respected by his own colleagues in this place. As I say, no-one is jumping up for the call in this place to defend the Prime Minister against, once again, serial behaviour. This is the Prime Minister who wants to keep the truth from the Australian people and who always finds ways to do it: tell a little half-truth here and a little lie there, always skating close to the edge. But where are his colleagues today? This is a critical issue of concern to the nation: it goes to the constitutional separation of powers concept, it goes to the administration of justice and it goes to honesty in government, but not one government senator is prepared to get up and defend the Prime Minister. That in itself is a reflection not just on his behaviour last week but also on what a difference a couple of Newspolls can make.
We have a couple of Newspolls and they are all scurrying back to their holes. Senator McGauran is sitting over there looking very embarrassed. Senator Vanstone is sitting over there wishing she was not here. That is the truth of it: no-one else wanted to come into this place to defend what we all know is the indefensible. In terms of public policy conduct it does not get much worse than the behaviour of Prime Minister Howard, Minister Downer and Minister Ruddock last week. To use this for their base political purposes, to use this as an excuse to save their skins and try to position themselves against any terrorist attack in the future I think is the basest of motives on which to undermine the reputation of a person widely respected both locally and in the region.
I must ask again: where are the Liberals? Where are the Nationals? Where are the defenders of this so-called man of steel who, as I said earlier, increasingly looks like Captain Mainwaring? We are concerned about it and Senator Brown is concerned about it. I think he has a legitimate proposition before the Senate but one that probably is not workable given the conduct of this government. But let us get another speaker up and let us hope that the government can find someone who can defend their position. I will not be holding my breath.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,21,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-23,"—No, Senator Bolkus did not need to hold his breath in relation to that. The attempt by the Howard government to distort the message on an important national issue such as terrorism and to attack experts who hold a contrary view is poor and desperate politics. The government's handling of the entire Keelty affair has been reprehensible. Not only has the government attacked the credibility of a man who has devoted his whole working life to protecting Australia and Australians; it has also undermined the independence and integrity of one of the most important statutory offices in this country. 
I have personally known Mr Keelty in the sense of seeing him at estimates hearings a number of times and during the course of inquiries of both the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee over some five years now. I think the government has clearly undermined the independence and integrity of one of the most important and independent positions we have. In defence of his own political spin Mr John Howard has muddied the reputation of and seriously undermined the office of the Australian Federal Police and he also attempted to do that to the commissioner himself. As far as I am aware, Mr Keelty has spent a significant part of his working life defending Australia and Australians. For close to 25 years, I think, he has gone to work every day to protect Australians from the worst kinds of criminals, organised gangsters, drug and gun-runners and, of course, other types of criminals. His hard work and dedication saw him rise through the ranks of the Australian Federal Police all the way to the top job in 2001, when he was appointed Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.
During his term as commissioner, Mr Keelty has skilfully managed the significant increase in the scale and complexity of the Australian Federal Police mission that has resulted from the new threat environment we now face. His leadership of the Australian Federal Police has in my view been an invaluable asset in the war against terrorism. To have lost him should he have resigned, as suggested in the paper, would unquestionably have weakened Australia in this endeavour. It is worth while going through some initiatives to examine the person that the Prime Minister's office sought to interfere with. Mr Keelty has overseen the establishment of new counter-terrorism teams, the expansion of the AFP's overseas network, the reorganisation of the AFP's intelligence capability, the implementation of a new regime to confiscate the proceeds of crime and a major overseas deployment to stabilise the Solomon Islands.
Many of these issues were covered at hearings of the legal and constitutional committees where I was able to inquire and hear from Mr Keelty about issues raised during estimates or about legal and constitutional committee issues. The achievements with which Australians would be most familiar would be the assistance provided by the AFP to the Indonesian National Police following the horrific terrorist attack in Bali on 12 October 2002. That assistance ranged from disaster victim identification, forensic investigation, criminal intelligence analysis and bomb data analysis, as well as preparation for prosecutions. At the time, the Prime Minister himself commended the work of Commissioner Keelty when he told parliament on 12 December 2002:
I record the gratitude of Australians to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty ...
Unfortunately, that gratitude was all but forgotten last week. The government's first tactic to defend its spin in defiance of the truth was to undermine the credibility of the police commissioner and to question his expertise in this area. That is why I took a couple of minutes at the beginning of my contribution to provide a backdrop to the ability of Mr Keelty, his experience and the issues he has been involved in over the last couple of years on behalf of this government and under this government's minister. I am sure he has worked to the best of his ability. 
Of all the government ministers who were then wheeled out to have a pot shot at Mr Keelty for daring to speak the logical truth, no-one went in harder or lower in my view than the foreign minister. The foreign minister's suggestion that Commissioner Keelty was advancing al-Qaeda propaganda in suggesting that Australia faced a greater security risk as a result of our involvement in the war in Iraq is simply outrageous. One wonders why he went a bridge too far. It is a despicable slur on the commissioner, and the fact that the minister has repeatedly refused to apologise to him only reinforces that. These disparaging comments were backed up by the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister himself—after first of all, of course, not wanting to comment on it.
The suggestion that the threat level faced by Australia has risen due to our involvement in the war in Iraq is not propaganda; it is one of those facts that we have to live with. A number of commentators have backed up the commissioner, including the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr Paul Wolfowitz, and the head of the FBI's counter-terrorist unit, Mr John Pistole, whom I was fortunate enough to meet in America recently. Indeed, comments by the American ambassador to Australia, Tom Schieffer, also conceded this point. Other police chiefs who supported this view included the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Service, Mr Ken Moroney, the Deputy Commissioner of the Victoria Police, Mr Bill Kelly, and former Commissioner of the Western Australian Police Service, Mr Bob Falconer. Add to this a significant array of international terrorism experts who also supported Commissioner Keelty's view and it becomes obvious that this government is simply denying the plain truth.
Despite this defence of its own spin—perhaps `its own deceit' is a better way of putting it; `its own political survival' might even be closer to the truth—unfortunately for the government, polls reported recently revealed that the Australian people will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by this government. They will not allow government spin to overwhelm the facts. The point is that Commissioner Keelty was telling Australians that we cannot be complacent about the potential for a terrorist attack. Anyone who dismisses the relevance of the attack on Spanish citizens in Madrid and discounts the fact that it was an indication that we now face greater risks is naive. In my view, it would be dishonest not to raise that as an issue.
Last week our leading police officers, the commissioners of police at federal and state level, were hosting a conference with myriad international terrorism experts. It seemed, in retrospect, a perfectly logical opportunity for us to honestly and objectively assess the risks faced by Australia and, more importantly, to take constructive steps to address those risks. It was totally inexcusable that, rather than being able to concentrate on those constructive steps that could have been taken, Commissioner Keelty was distracted by what can only be described as political standover tactics. Indeed, alarmingly, reports suggested that he had—at one stage at least, as I suggested earlier—considered his resignation. This would have had a drastic effect on Australia's counter-terrorism capability, yet it was apparently a real possibility, caused by this government—unnecessarily, I might add. 
This whole episode shows that we have a government that places its own partisan political interests ahead of the national interest. It was prepared to sacrifice a highly respected, highly determined and highly competent law enforcement officer—indeed, the chief law enforcement officer in the land—for its own political interests because that law enforcement officer was not citing the government's spin. The government should be under no illusion that, when it comes to a question of having Mr Keelty or Mr Alexander Downer and government spin doctors defend the security of their families, the Australian people will choose Mr Keelty every time.
To demean such a man by requiring him to issue a press release drafted by the government—that is apparently so; the government has not denied it—is nothing short of a national scandal. To justify their political standover tactics on the basis of an assertion that Mr Keelty did not have a role in security assessment ignores, incredibly, the role that the Australian Federal Police now have to play and were asked to play in this issue by this government. The Attorney-General said, in answer to a question on notice from as recently as 18 March this year, that the Australian Federal Police—who will be seconded to the National Threat Assessment Centre that will be open in a month's time—will be:
... fully integrated NTAC analysts and as such, will be directly responsible for the preparation of threat assessments.
So the Australian Federal Police will be playing an integral role in relation to the National Threat Assessment Centre analysis. Therefore, it begs the question: why would the government's comments say that we can perhaps leave Mr Keelty's view aside and go to, say, that of Dennis Richardson from ASIO or perhaps that of Alexander Downer? I have to say that, at the end of the day, you might want to consider Dennis Richardson's argument but you also might want to listen to the Australian Federal Police on this issue, given their role. I think this demonstrates that the Australian Federal Police will be intimately involved in advising on matters of national security. There is no doubt about that. How can the Australian people have confidence, then, that in fulfilling its vitally important responsibility the AFP will be able to give frank and fearless advice in the interests of Australia's national security and not those of their political masters? The position could not be stated more clearly and precisely than in the words of Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty himself, on 14 March this year, when he said, on that same Sunday program:
... there's a level of honesty that has to exist here in terms of what the problems are here, not only in Australia but in our region.
No-one should be under any illusions that the viciousness with which the government has approached this matter was not intended to intimidate. It was intended to control the message and, if that message did not suit its political agenda, to stifle and deny the truth and the facts. We should not forget that, in the process of demeaning its distinguished law enforcement officer, the government quite frankly is prepared to con the Australian public on matters of security. I note, for instance, that Mr Ruddock was reported as saying that:
... the efforts by the United States and other allies to drive Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had drawn terror groups to the country.
That is, Iraq. Mr Ruddock was then reported as saying that:
This was then reducing the possibility of those groups carrying out terror actions in other parts of the world. 
That is what he said. He went on to say:
I suspect the fact that they are in Iraq probably diminishes the harm that they can occasion elsewhere.
The next thing you know is that the government not only will be standing over our primary law enforcement officers but will be proposing a diminished state of alert because it would like us to believe that all the terrorists in the world have been sucked into Iraq and we are now safe here. That is not the case at all. The point the government should take on board is that it is prepared to say anything for its political purposes even when those statements conflict with the national interest. It is a shameful thing to have to say that this government has now put itself in this position. This is typified by its response to terrorism. It seems that with this government it is all about the words, not about action. It is not about recognising and respecting people who have contributed to the debate. It is not about those who have contributed their efforts in the war on terrorism. It is about ensuring that there is a political spin which the government can live with that comes from its bureaucrats, the people the government thinks it controls.
We have seen the government espousing its toughness on security matters by adding words to statute books but we have not seen it exercise its powers. We have seen again today the further suggestions as to just what Willie Brigitte was up to in Australia, and the government still has not answered the question of how he was granted a tourist visa in circumstances where he was clearly a person of interest to French security authorities even before September 11. We have not heard an explanation from the government as to why it took more than two weeks to respond to a request from France as to whether he was in the country, even though they pointed out this man had trained with al-Qaeda linked organisations in Afghanistan. We have not heard the government say whether it is prepared to set in place a standard 24-hour response to such requests, a 48-hour response, a one-week response, a two-week response or only after an alerting country sends a second transmission urgently warning us about this individual—which was an urgent warning, I might add—remained unattended to because of a long weekend. We have also seen reported in the Sun Heraldand elsewhere the security leaks. We do not know whether this government is going to investigate those or whether they emanated from the French authorities or from the Australian authorities.
What we heard in question time today in the Senate was a minister who is responsible for the area but who apparently did not know what was going on, who thought he could hide under operational requirements. But the question was not about operational requirements. The question was about what the government was doing about the leaks—an entirely different matter. Either this government is asleep at the wheel, or it hides behind its rhetoric or it does not like the truth. It can choose any of those, but they all lead to the incompetence that this government is now portraying in the issue of national security. By way of an example we have seen over 400 individuals and organisations listed as terrorist organisations for the purpose of having their assets frozen in Australia and, of those 400 that have been listed, the government has taken action against two. The first organisation, Shining Light, was not a South American terrorist organisation but in fact a record store that it seems had its assets frozen by mistake. It then took a considerable amount of time and effort to get those assets unfrozen. The second organisation had its total assets of $2,100 frozen. That is a cashed up organisation, that one! We have not been able to find out anymore about that, but as the case unfolds we may be able to see whether or not the government has struck another record store. As to associates of Willie Brigitte in Australia, have we seen in media reports any suggestion of a prosecution, investigation or perhaps even a short little speech in the House about what is going on? No. In short, virtually no assets have been confiscated and there have been no prosecutions. 
There is a lot of rhetoric coming from this government. The rhetoric of this government is not good rhetoric. It is not talking the talk or walking the walk. What it is doing is in fact only talking about the rhetoric surrounding national security rather than national security itself. Again, the Australian people are not mugs; they can judge political charlatans a mile off. The conduct of the government, directly from the Prime Minister's office last week, was disgraceful. The government knows it. The opposition knows it. Senator Brown clearly knows it. The government should acknowledge that disgrace, it should apologise to our primary law enforcement officer and it should give a commitment to the Australian people that it will not engage in such outrageous intimidation again. That will enable all senior public servants involved in the security of Australia to be honest and frank with the Australian people in their efforts to protect our national security.
The issue that Senator Brown seeks to refer to a Senate inquiry is one that, of itself, Labor believe the Australian people deserve answers on. They deserve to know the exact details of the role that the Prime Minister's office, the Prime Minister himself and his staff had in muscling in on the commissioner. They deserve to know that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in Australia will continue to give frank and fearless advice not just to the Australian government but to all the Australian people. Labor are committed to doing the work necessary to ensure that the Australian people get those answers. Our efforts yesterday, our continuing efforts today and the ongoing pressure we will be applying to the Howard government to extract the simple truth is a testament to that fact. Labor are committed to taking the steps necessary to extract the facts but we look at the issues as they stand. We will not support measures just for any reason.
Labor do not believe that a Senate inquiry into this affair will deliver answers to the Australian people, and that is why we will stop short of supporting it. We cannot send this issue off to a Senate inquiry, which may ultimately not provide the answers that we want from this government. I suspect that the Prime Minister's chief of staff will not give evidence to the committee. The ministers who have attacked the commissioner will not front up. In truth the only person who would be likely to front up is Commissioner Keelty, for another round of questioning. I am not sure whether in truth that in itself would provide any answers for the Australian people. Senator Faulkner moved a motion earlier today to seek to extract information from this government. The government should not have to be ordered. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,21,2
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-23,"—I agree wholeheartedly that the issue at hand is important, and I particularly agree with the opening comments of both Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray. This issue has clearly captured the imagination of the electorate, and I think people understand the issues that underpin the motion of Senator Brown that is before us. However, I agree too with previous speakers who have outlined the reasons why a Senate committee of the nature proposed is not the best forum in which to try and get to the bottom of these issues. I would not like to see a situation where Commissioner Keelty was the only person who was called on to present before a committee and ultimately presented only to find himself hammered repeatedly with questions, giving what he believed to be fair and frank answers but really not getting anywhere. I think he has already had enough public humiliation and scrutiny and is not necessarily deserving of any more of that. I am not suggesting that the issue should not be explored further but I believe strongly that, if nothing else, Senate estimates committee hearings are a better forum and a better place and time for that. 
Out of curiosity I looked this afternoon on the parliamentary web site at the committee inquiry workload. I want to spend a few minutes talking about that. The inquiry Senator Brown is proposing would be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, one of the committees on which I serve and have served since I first came into this place. I note with interest that since 1996 Senator Brown has proposed that the Senate inquire into some 27 different references. Of those proposals, the Senate rejected 19 but agreed to eight. I raise that just as a matter of interest. That got me thinking about the sorts of issues the Senate legal and constitutional committees—or legal and con committees, as we refer to them affectionately; and there is both a legislation and a references committee—have been dealing with in recent times. I was quite stunned to find that in just the last year those two committees have undertaken some 33 different inquiries, six of which are currently under way, and there may be another four potential inquiries by the end of this sitting period. I am reminded that this is all being done with three research staff in the committee secretariat. That workload is a considerable strain on those tremendous staff—Louise Gell and others. Also it can be difficult for the senators who serve on those committees if for no other reasons than geography and time.
As an illustration, since 2 April last year the legal and constitutional committees have inquired into the following references: averment provisions in Australian customs legislation; crime in the community—victims, offenders and fear of crime; the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 [2004]; the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002; the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003; the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 and related matters; the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002; the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003; the establishment of an Australian republic; the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002; the government amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002; the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing for Property Offences) Bill 2000 [2002]; the Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002; the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which led into migration zone excision and examination of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 and related matters; the outsourcing of Australian Customs Services information technology; the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and related bills; the provisions of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003, which we are currently dealing with; the provisions of the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003; the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Amendment Bill 2003, and I understand hearings on that are still under way; the provisions of the Family Law Amendment Bill 2003; the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Bill 2003; the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003; other migration legislation; telecommunications interception; reconciliation; security legislation; the private senator's bill on one vote, one value; the statutory powers and functions of the Australian Law Reform Commission; the capacity of current legal aid and access to justice arrangements to meet the community need for legal assistance; and finally the needs of expatriate Australians, which is currently under way. 
I place those inquiries on the record purely to give an illustration of the workload being placed on the legal and constitutional committees. I think you would confidently agree with me that these committees will take on any inquiry that the Senate asks of them, will do so seriously and will consider it a duty, and all effort will be put into it. But it seems to me that it is getting to the point, with the time and resources currently allocated to these committees, where some inquiries cannot be done competently or comprehensively unless more time and resources are made available to these committees. There are other committees to which the Senate can refer inquiries. There is the rural and regional affairs committee, there is the community affairs committee and there are others. I note that three of the inquiries Senator Brown has successfully had referred by the chamber for investigation have gone to other committees. They were an inquiry into the MOPS staffing arrangements, an inquiry into Turkish asylum seekers and an inquiry into various chemicals, and I understand there were hearings for that in Parliament House this morning. But I make the point that Senator Brown, who moved and argued that those inquiries be referred to committees, did not participate—and is not participating—in any of the hearings of those three inquiries. I do not raise that, Senator Brown, to be unkind—
—Yes, you do.
—No, I make the point to express the frustration. Those of us who are full and participating members on these inquiries can find it unsettling to be presented with extra work only to find that the originators, those people who specify particular areas of inquiry and move them through this chamber, do not follow through on the work that subsequently unfolds. I understand the expectations on senators of their party colleagues, their constituencies and their electorates in terms of work and obligations. I understand that we cannot be in all places at all times. But I do think it is incumbent on senators who propose and succeed with particular terms of reference to engage in the committee processes that flow from that.
I would like to conclude with a last point about the work that the committees are doing. I make the observation that there is an increasing trend in this place for inquiries to be held on sitting days. As a relatively new person to this chamber, having been here five years, I understand that that has not always necessarily been the case—historically it has not been frequent.
—Five years is reasonable. That is half a decade.
—It feels like an eternity. I meant relatively.
—But what you say is right. The point you make is right.
—I thank the minister. The point I am making is that the trend has shifted: a greater number of Senate inquiries are being held in-house on sitting days. I make a plea to colleagues to desist with that as best they can. I accept that there will be exceptions. There will be circumstances—and this might be one of them if Senator Brown's motion before us were to succeed—where you might want to have an inquiry on a sitting day in Canberra because those people who could reasonably expect to be called before that committee would likely be based in Canberra in the first instance. But there are many occasions when, particularly for those of us on the legal and constitutional committees who live in the more remote parts of Australia—Perth for me or Darwin for my colleague Senator Scullion—the time and distance involved in participating in the Senate committee processes can be challenging, to say the least. But we do our best to participate. 
Having Senate committee hearings on sitting days is unfair on both senators and more particularly witnesses. As the bells in the chamber ring for divisions and quorums, as they do frequently throughout the day, it is unfair—indeed rude—to continually get up and leave committee inquiries, leaving witnesses and secretarial staff waiting for the return of senators so the hearings can continue. My final plea is to please desist from having committee hearings on sitting days.
I note a fax that came across my desk today from, I understand, Senator Brown proposing yet another inquiry—this time for the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 to be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. This is yet another inquiry being asked of us. I am not suggesting that the inquiry itself is not worthy or that it is not something that we should not look into, but I make the point again that the legal and constitutional committees have six inquiries currently under way, potentially another four, I understand, by the end of next week and now this one coming across our desk. It lends greater argument—
—Does that include the teachers one?
—I am uncertain, Senator.
—It has been referred.
—It is now on the list as yet another bill. You may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Bolkus, that I approached you informally some months ago and tentatively asked whether the Democrat Sexuality and Gender Identity Discrimination Bill 2003 might also go to one of the legal and con committees for investigation and you advised me that the legal and con committees would be too busy to deal with that.
 (Senator Bolkus)—Now you know why.
—I will in future perhaps take such comments with a pinch of salt because, subsequent to you saying that, an additional five—now six—bills have been referred to those committees.
—I told you they were coming.
—I think it means two things. Ultimately we can and should deal with some of these issues in another forum, and Senate estimates does lend itself to that. As Senator Ray made the point, that is the time at which the very people you would hope to inquire of, particularly on this hearing, are going to be there before you. Secondly, perhaps senators might join their voices in a greater chorus for more resources for Senate committees, not the least of which would be the Senate legal and con committees. 
To conclude, I say to Senator Brown that the terms of reference in his motion are fine. I have no objection to them. But I do genuinely believe that the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee is not the place but that Senate estimates committee does lend itself more readily to that.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-23,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
One of the aims of the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 [2004] is to complete the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police by harmonising the legislative and employment frameworks which currently govern AFP officers on the one hand and APS officers on the other.
One of the ways it does this is by using the machinery in the Public Service Act for transferring Public Service employees to a Commonwealth authority. This involves the making of determinations by the Public Service Commissioner under that act and the AFP Commissioner under the AFP Act, preserving the employment conditions APS officers enjoy under the 170MX award which currently applies in the APS. 
In its report tabled today, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has recognised the desirability of all AFP staff being employed under an integrated employment framework. This will assist in providing operational cohesion to the newly integrated agency. However, a particular focus of the inquiry by the committee has been on the uncertainty faced by transferring APS officers in the transitional period until a new certified agreement is negotiated to cover the integrated work force.
The committee heard evidence on this issue from the CPSU, representing transferring APS officers, and from the AFP. What emerged is that there is still concern on the part of transferring APS officers about their capacity to maintain their safety net of remuneration and conditions and to access independent review of AFP decisions that affect employment arrangements during this transition period. There is concern that the AFP will be able to make unilateral decisions, altering remuneration and conditions, and that those affected will not be able to seek review of those decisions by the relevant authority, which in the AFP is a board of reference constituted under the Workplace Relations Act.
Not only is it unfair to transferring APS officers to face such uncertainty; it is plainly against the national interest for people tasked with such a critical protective security role to experience such a fundamental insecurity in their employment arrangements. I draw the Senate's attention to the committee's deliberations, and particularly to the end part of chapter 3 of the committee's report, which addresses this issue. 
My purpose for taking note of this report is to put the minister on notice that, in particular, Senator Ludwig will be questioning him about this issue when the bill comes on for debate. We expect the minister will be ready for those questions. Otherwise, on behalf of Senator Ludwig, who has carriage of this legislation, we will have to consider what alternatives are available to the Senate to ensure that transferring APS officers retain the same protection as AFP officers against unilateral variation of their remuneration and conditions and the same rights as AFP officers to resolve their disputes before an independent umpire.

This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 13 March 2002, and two years later the government has finally got round to dealing with it in the Senate. Labor supports these changes to the Migration Act. It supported the bill in the House and still supports it. In 2002, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 15 May 2002. The government moved amendments to the bill in the House, reflecting the recommendations of that Senate committee. Labor supported those amendments in the House, contained as they are now in the bill before us.  
I turn to the contents of the bill. The bill makes the following changes to the Migration Act. Firstly, it clarifies the immigration status of noncitizen children born in the migration zone—that is, born on the Australian mainland or in non-excised parts of Australia. Children are born in Australia to noncitizens who are here in a variety of circumstances, such as on a tourist visa, a temporary entry visa, a student visa and the like. Children can also be born to noncitizens who are not immigration cleared. This applies to detained persons, including asylum seekers, who have not been taken to be immigration cleared until their claim has been processed and a visa has been issued. 
Under the Migration Act there is no specific provision as to the immigration status of a child born in these circumstances. Conceptually under the act, a child who is born to a person here on a valid visa is not immigration cleared and would not be immigration cleared until separately processed. Clearly, as a matter of practice, there are not separate immigration clearance procedures for newborn babies, and the child is assumed to have the same status as his or her parents. This amendment clarifies this matter by providing that, at the moment of birth, a child is immigration cleared if a parent was immigration cleared on last entry into Australia. 
Put simply, if a parent is immigration cleared and lawfully here, the child will be seen by virtue of this amendment and as a matter of law to be immigration cleared and lawfully here as well. If a child is born to a person who does not hold a substantive visa and who has not been immigration cleared, such as an asylum seeker in detention, this amendment provides that the child is not immigration cleared and the child's immigration status will then be dealt with in a substantive visa application process.
Secondly, the bill clarifies issues relating to the cancellation of special purpose visas. These are used for classes of individuals such as aircraft crews, crews of visiting vessels and members of foreign armed forces visiting for the purposes of exercises or training. Given that a person qualifies for a visa because of his or her membership of the relevant class of person, if information comes to light about the undesirability of a particular individual within that class, it is necessary to have a process to cancel the visa, and to cancel it expeditiously. Section 33 of the Migration Act provides that the minister may cancel such a visa if it is undesirable for the noncitizen holder to travel to and enter Australia or to remain in Australia. The visa ceases to be in effect at the end of the day when a declaration is made. 
It is not clear under the act whether the rules of natural justice apply to such a cancellation and, consequently, whether the individual has a right to be heard in these circumstances. The bill makes it clear that the rules of natural justice do not apply to such a visa cancellation and that the person involved has no right to be heard. This is a sensible clarification. Australia does not owe hearing rights to noncitizens in such circumstances. In addition, there are considerable logistical difficulties with offering hearing rights to individuals such as seafarers who may have deserted vessels. The amendment also provides that the declaration to cancel a visa comes into effect immediately. 
Thirdly, the bill deals with restrictions on bridging visa holders for onshore visa applications. Section 48 of the Migration Act provides that a person who has been in Australia and who has made an unsuccessful application for a visa can apply for only a limited number of visa types. This is obviously to prevent people from lodging countless applications, specifically to remain in the country. There has been some avoidance of the intent of this provision. Specifically, people are travelling a short distance overseas—for example, to Auckland—and then returning and seeking to make a whole new round of onshore applications. The bill proposes to stop this practice by providing that, for the purposes of this section, a noncitizen holding a bridging visa who leaves and re-enters the migration zone is taken to have been continuously in the migration zone despite that travel. There is a clarification that the force of this provision does not prevent a person on a bridging visa from lodging a visa application offshore.
Fourthly, the bill deals with the imposition of strict liability for people-smuggling offences. Section 233(1)(a) of the Migration Act makes it an offence to participate in `the bringing or coming to Australia of a noncitizen under circumstances from which it might reasonably have been inferred that the noncitizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of the Migration Act'. The provision says nothing about the state of mind of the accused in relation to the circumstances under which the noncitizen is brought or comes to Australia.
As part of a raft of migration legislation passed by the parliament in December 2001, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 came into effect. The act added the following point to the matters that the prosecution has to prove under section 233(1)(a) of the Migration Act: `the accused was aware of a substantial risk that the noncitizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of the Mig-ration Act and, having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, he or she was not justified in taking that risk'.
The application of the Criminal Code was not meant to change the nature of offences. The explanatory memorandum of that act stated that the relevant offences would continue to have the same meaning and apply in the same way as they did prior to the application of the Criminal Code. This bill therefore corrects the anomaly that arises, because the application of the Criminal Code has had an unintended effect. Lastly, the bill, as originally introduced into the House, also deals with the application of strict liability to section 241(1) of the Migration Act in relation to de facto spouses. This provision is not being proceeded with as a result of the government accepting recommendations from the Senate legislation committee and so amending the bill in the House.
Since the introduction of this bill into the House in 2002, the government has sat on its hands. There does not appear to be any reason for this delay, other than that the government does not consider it a priority, yet the bill includes the tightening of a people-smuggling offence that was slackened by the government's own legislative management in 2001. Labor's circulated amendments on people smugglers seek to implement Labor's policies of three new offences, including life imprisonment for smuggling unlawful noncitizens into Australia causing the death of one or more people. Labor also proposes to increase some existing penalties to better deter potential people smugglers. These penalties include a minimum of 10 years imprisonment for repeat offences of high-level people-smuggling. Labor will increase the fine for low-level people-smuggling to $100,000, plus we will introduce the mandatory confiscation of the vessel or aircraft. We will make sure they are never used again. We will also confiscate any profits earned from this vile enterprise. 
People smugglers make money from human misery and deserve no leniency. Labor represents a zero tolerance approach. In the most recent case, when a boat reached Melville Island, the Howard government let the people smugglers go back to try a second, third and fourth time. Their ringmasters here and abroad have also escaped prosecution. Labor's amendment contains two basic elements: firstly, a substantial increase in people-smuggling offences and, secondly, the introduction of three new people-smuggling offences. The new offences are: firstly, to introduce a people-smuggling offence of smuggling unlawful noncitizens into Australia causing the death of one or more persons, with a penalty of life imprisonment—unless mitigating circumstances apply, in which case a mandatory minimum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a 10-year non-parole period will apply. The onus will be on the defendant to show mitigating circumstances as to why life imprisonment should not be imposed.
The second new offence is that of assisting a person reasonably suspected of being involved in people-smuggling so as to remove them from the jurisdiction for the purpose of avoiding prosecution under Australian law. The penalty here is a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and/or a $100,000 fine. The third new people-smuggling offence is that of supplying funds for the purpose of procuring the services of a people smuggler to transport an unlawful noncitizen into Australia. The penalty is a maximum of five years imprisonment and/or a $50,000 fine. Labor have zero tolerance for people smugglers, and we will put them where they belong—in jail. The government has remained immobile for almost two years on legislation that would tighten penalties for people smugglers.
The other circulated Labor amendment, if adopted, would amend the power to detain under the Migration Act. The government would be compelled to do two things: firstly, it would be compelled to place unaccompanied children into appropriate foster or community care arrangements rather than hold such children in detention facilities like Baxter and Port Hedland. Secondly, the government would be compelled to rehouse children who are currently here with their families in accommodation like the Port Augusta residential housing project. Labor has been campaigning for a long time to get kids out of these detention facilities. The substance of this amendment was first circulated in February 2002 and Labor's position remains the same in 2004. That concludes my contribution on this legislation, on behalf of Senator Sherry.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-03-23,"—I present the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and a related bill, together with the Hansard record of proceedings, submissions received by the committee and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to incorporate my tabling speech. 
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The speech read as follows—
Mr President, the Greater Sunrise petroleum resource comprises the Sunrise and Troubadour deposits and lies in the Timor Sea, approximately 500 kilometres north-west of Darwin. The field straddles the border of the Joint Petroleum Development Area, which is the area of shared jurisdiction between Australia and East Timor established by the Timor Sea Treaty, and an area of sole Australian jurisdiction located within the Northern Territory adjacent area.
In 2003, Australia and East Timor agreed to the arrangements to govern the unitisation of this petroleum resource. `Unitisation' refers to the development of the resource as a single unit. Without unitisation, production from one part of the resource could adversely affect the resource as a whole or the interests of those with an interest in the resource on the other side of the boundary.
The Greater Sunrise unitisation agreement will be ratified by Australia and East Timor once both countries have put in place the domestic arrangements required to enable them to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. The Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 [the Greater Sunrise bill] and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Greater Sunrise) Bill 2004 do this for Australia.
Development of the Greater Sunrise field will provide substantial benefits to both Australia and East Timor. These benefits will include investment, exports, employment and revenue. The passage of the Greater Sunrise bills through the Senate is an essential step in the provision of the fiscal and legal certainty required for the development of this important project.
There are some who have expressed concern about the bills and, more specifically, about elements of the Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement itself. The Economics Legislation Committee has carefully considered submissions and oral evidence on those matters. In essence, the concerns expressed relate to three issues. They are:
	whether the Australian government has negotiated and intends to negotiate in good faith with the Democratic Government of Timor-Leste;
	whether any revenue generated from the Greater Sunrise resource should be held in trust or escrow until such time as the maritime boundary dispute between Australia and East Timor is settled; and
	whether the customs exemption provided by the Customs Tariff Amendment (Greater Sunrise) Bill 2004 has the potential adversely to affect Australian industry participation in the development of the Greater Sunrise project.
Let me address each of these concerns briefly.
First, Mr President, there are some who have interpreted certain actions or decisions of the Australian government in negative ways. They suggest, for example, that Australia's decisions about the pace of negotiations on maritime boundary issues or the mode chosen for arbitration of those issues are susceptible of sinister interpretation. The Committee rejects such interpretations, and notes the evidence from the Attorney-General's Department to its inquiry: `The position is that Australia negotiates its agreements in good faith. It might have a disagreement in the course of those negotiations or a difference with the other party, but that does not mean it is not negotiating in good faith'.
Second, the Committee rejects the view that any revenue generated from the Greater Sunrise resource should be held in trust or escrow until such time as the maritime boundary dispute between Australia and East Timor is settled. It would be appropriate to have an escrow account if there was some contingency yet to be resolved about the disbursement of the fund. There is, however, no such contingency. The Agreement, which has been signed by both East Timor and Australia, explicitly sets the production sharing arrangements between the two countries. The concept of a trust or escrow arrangement thus does not apply.
Finally, the Committee notes that the customs arrangements implemented by the bill in relation to the Greater Sunrise development are designed merely to ensure administrative consistency across the whole field. The Committee notes assurances given by Woodside Energy Ltd that its practice of maximising local content in its projects would be unchanged by the bill. 
Mr President, the Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and its cognate bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Greater Sunrise) Bill 2004, put in place the framework necessary for Australia to meet its obligations arising under the Greater Unitisation Agreement with East Timor. Their passage is required if the Greater Sunrise resource is to be allowed to develop and to bring great benefits to the people of both Australia and East Timor. The Committee therefore recommends that the Senate pass the bills.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned. ",SENATE,<title>GREATER SUNRISE UNITISATION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation        Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2004-03-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In taking note of the annual report of the Wheat Export Authority, I would like to give some background to the authority. The Wheat Export Authority, the WEA, was established on 1 July 1999. This is its fourth or fifth report, following the restructure of the former Australian board and the transfer of the government's wheat marketing and selling role to a private company, controlled by wheat grower shareholders, known as AWB Ltd. The WEA operates under the Wheat Marketing Act and has the following statutory functions: to control the export of wheat from Australia; to monitor AWB's international performance in the export of wheat; and to examine and report on the benefits to growers that result from that performance. One of the legislative functions of the WEA is to consider granting consent for shipments in bulk containers and/or bags. Within this charter, the WEA considers requests to export wheat from exporters other than AWB(I). 
It was important for me to give that structured background and to advise the Senate how this body works, and to outline the accountability and flexibility that operate within the orderly marketing system. It is a fallacy, often levelled at the industry, that the WEA is a dinosaur, a monopoly and that it is denying farmers and, for that matter, the economy as a whole efficient returns. The deregulators who seek to abolish the export monopoly of the Australian Wheat Board push this line, but they operate as a minority. Vocal as they may be, they operate as a minority. Over 90 per cent of the farmers support the current industry structure—that is, the single desk arrangements for export wheat. Moreover, the single desk marketing arrangements are supported by this government. Like the Rock of Gibraltar sitting in the Mediterranean, the Wheat Board sits firm in this government.
Let me refer to a speech by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, given on 10 February at Old Parliament House, where Jack McEwen's spirit still roams the corridors. He said:
... the Australian government is committed to the wheat export single desk arrangements, while ever they provide a net benefit to Australia's ... growers ...
That is forever. He did not say that little piece; I just put it in for Hansard's sake. But he would have said it because he meant it; we mean it here in the National Party. Mr Truss went on to say:
The Prime Minister has said it on many occasions, the Deputy Prime Minister has said on many occasions and I have stated it clearly and publicly, particularly in the context of the recent trade negotiations, that the government supports the single desk ...
That is, the single desk for wheat marketing arrangements. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, the government did not flinch under the pressure of the strongest and most powerful economy in the world, the United States. When it came to the free trade agreement the single desk was never on the table; we would never have compromised it. Even before the greatest economy in the world we would not sell our principles; we would not allow it to happen. I thought I had 10 minutes to speak but I see that my time is running out. The minister made an important point: the bottom line is that only within the industry can the single desk be undermined. That is a timely reminder to farmers not to flirt in any way with changes at the edges of the single desk. Do not chip away at this Rock of Gibraltar, for any change no matter how slight or how seductive will bring down the single desk. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Wheat Export Authority</title>,Documents,26,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-03-23,"—We are debating the 2002-03 annual report of the Wheat Export Authority tabled today. The report on the single desk was brought out some time last week. The Wheat Export Authority is the mechanism whereby you can get permits to bypass the Australian Wheat Board. We in the National Party are concerned that that mechanism not be used to chip away at the authority of the Australian Wheat Board. We realise that some sales can have a permit issued through the Wheat Export Authority, but we are concerned that the Wheat Export Authority not be used to undermine the great Australian Wheat Board, which delivers so many benefits to Australia.
A lot of people have put a lot of work into this, and one of the authorities has come out with a report that shows that the single desk selling arrangements delivered an average premium of $13 per tonne. On the current 2003 pool of about 19 million tonnes, this premium has the potential to deliver approximately $250 million into the hands of Australian farmers. The report estimates that the reduction in grower returns if the single desk were removed, and in particular the buyers of last resort obligation, would be significant and that the loss would be in the range of $US360 million to $US560 million. No single approach can adequately measure the value of the single desk, and that is why the report used a variety of methods and models to get an across-the-board indication of the value of the single desk to growers.
Australian Wheat Board International and the single desk have captured price premiums for growers right across the nine separate grades of wheat since 1996-97. On average, the benchmark APW grade gives a premium of between $15 and $30 a tonne, which is realised to the benefit of the farmers. The net welfare benefit of the single desk to the entire Australian economy gives an increase in consumption expenditure across the nation of approximately $50 million per annum. The wheat industry employs over 150,000 people in rural Australia and the single desk arrangements deliver almost 2,000 jobs in rural Australia. Approximately 45,000 non-farm business enterprises in rural Australia rely on the profitability of the wheat industry.
If we deregulate, the impact would be a reduction in grower returns of at least $134 million. The buyers of last resort provision ensures that all of Australia's 36,000 wheat growers have ongoing access to the export market. Markets will be controlled by other steps on the vertical chain, most likely the bulk carriers. Deregulation of container shipments will result in losses of customers, volume and price premiums. As long as there is a National Party there will be a single desk.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Wheat Export Authority</title>,Documents,26,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-03-23,"—The retention of Australia's single desk arrangement for wheat exporting is of the utmost importance to the grain industry. In August 2003 the Land newspaper, which I do not always agree with, reported that an overwhelming 82 per cent of wheat farmers surveyed are in favour of maintaining wheat's export single desk. It seems to me sensible that, when your constituents tell you with such overwhelming support that they want to do something, it would be very dangerous not to take the advice of those constituents. 
The Nationals have given a firm commitment to fight to keep the single desk while there is a net benefit to Australian wheat growers and the nation's export performance. Further, the agriculture minister, Warren Truss, rejected the recommendation from the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in its report on the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002 for further deregulation of exports in bags and containers. The value of the single desk has been demonstrated recently by the exclusion of the changes to the current arrangements under the proposed United States-Australia free trade agreement. Trade Minister Vaile made sure that the current arrangements concerning the export of Australian wheat under the single desk would not be compromised—for good reason.
The Australian Wheat Board has undertaken research into the value of the wheat single desk, and a major finding is that AWBI and the single desk are capturing an average premium across all grades of around $13 per tonne. On the current 2003-04 pool of about 19 million tonnes, this has the potential to deliver approximately $250 million back into the hands of Australian wheat growers. The research also found that deregulation of the single desk not only would negate these premiums but also could prompt a further reduction in grower returns if an unregulated duopoly or monopoly market emerged—something researchers suggested was not only likely but highly likely. These researchers estimated that the reduction in grower returns flowing from the removal of the single desk—and, in particular, the buyer of last resort obligation—would be of significant magnitude: somewhere between $US360 million and $US563 million to Australian wheat growers.
The 2004 review is about AWBI's performance as the commercial manager of the single desk. The review is not about the existence of the single desk itself and it will not incorporate national competition policy principles. The government accepts that a review by an independent committee, with the assistance of the WEA, will improve the transparency of the review and provide greater confidence to growers and other stakeholders. The review will assess the benefits to growers from AWBI's man-agement of the single desk, and a report for growers will be tabled in the parliament. Deregulation of the domestic wheat market unfolded in the 1980s, and now the export single desk has been under fire for some years.
—Keep talking, Sandy! Talk it out!
—I am tempted to take your interjection, Senator Heffernan, but your laughter might not be incorporated in Hansard. I believe that the majority of growers have got it right when they support the retention of our export monopoly. Australian growers are unlikely to gain from a deregulated export market, and that is why competitors like the US are so keen to get rid of it. Whilst the National Party remains, it will not be got rid of.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Wheat Export Authority</title>,Documents,26,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2004-03-23,"—I am fascinated by that speech. There was great preparation and there were a lot of notes. I do not have any notes. I do not need any notes to speak on this issue, because one of the great furphies that has been put around in recent times to try to scare Australia's wheat growers is that somehow the government is putting at risk the single desk. The government is not putting at risk the single desk, but the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee does say to Australia's wheat growers that we are here to defend their interests. We are aware that most people that have approached the Wheat Export Authority inquiry are driven by their own self-interest. Most corporate companies are big and ugly enough to look after their own interests, but the average wheat farmer who grows 200 or 300 acres of wheat, and who still probably thinks that AWB Ltd is the Wheat Board, needs their interests protected. 
We discovered through the committee hearing that the Wheat Export Authority was not equipped with the right tools to have a meaningful look at the operation of the Australian Wheat Board. As a result of the committee's hearings and findings, which recommended the independent inquiry and a snapshot of the wheat industry, the Wheat Export Authority will be better equipped to do its job. We are not interested in getting rid of the single desk; we are interested in making sure that in its present form the single desk operates in the best interests of growers, that its costs are competitive and that it has meaningful benchmarking for competitive interests. There is a furphy around that somehow the National Party is the only defender of Australia's wheat growers. It is the greatest load of rubbish that I have ever heard. The opposition are all down there grinning, after preparing all day, with a lot of notes. Australia's wheat growers can rest assured that the independent inquiry by Alice Williams will take a meaningful and equitable look at the industry, and will come up with constructive criticisms if constructive criticisms are required.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Wheat Export Authority</title>,Documents,26,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-03-23,"—Honourable senators will know that I spoke four times in this chamber last year on the matter of child protection in the context of the Queensland state government's appalling record of failure to respond to critical problems. Therefore, it gives me no pleasure to speak on this issue again tonight—a fifth speech in this place on a matter that is absolutely fundamental to government, to the community's duty of care to children and to the civic values of our nation.
The Beattie Labor government in Queensland has finally moved on these matters. That at least is pleasing. It is late—it is too late, given all the prevarication and delay that the Queensland government is guilty of in this instance—but it is, nonetheless, welcome. What is not pleasing is that it may be both too late and too little. Premier Beattie and his two previous failed ministers responsible for child protection, Anna Bligh and Judy Spence, did nothing for five years, during which time they knew that the dysfunctional department of children's services was simply not working.
Having had his hand forced, and having finally ordered real action rather than just another cover-up, Premier Beattie has announced a substantial effort by the state, backed by an extra $201 million to be spent on child protection by 2007. That is a lot of money, but it may not be the full cost. Already the Premier has been out there saying he will have to find a way to fund it without raising state taxes or charges. According to the Courier-Mail, the state government has `already promised' to fund the reforms through the surplus, and not by raising taxes or charges. Seasoned watchers of the Beattie machine will detect some fertile ground for the Premier's tractor to plough up later, on the basis of a further cost blow-out, for example, or other hitherto unsuspected additional costs. 
The `promise', delivered as it was on the run and off the cuff, could so easily turn into one of the growing list of undeliverable objectives in the Premier's bulging dillybag of undertakings hidden, mislaid, forgotten or indeed forgone. He is showing all the signs familiar to Queenslanders of preparing the ground for a budget—this year, next year or perhaps even the year after—about which he will be able to cry poor on the basis of his unavoidable expenditure on child protection and go for a deficit because he has no other option. In fact, he does have an option. At a later time I will come back to the detail of that. Yesterday the Premier's office announced instant action on the blueprint for child protection in Queensland, produced by the government's consultant Peter Forster. To quote from his media release on the subject, circulated yesterday afternoon, the Premier said:
These funds are needed to give the most vulnerable Queensland children—
and they are the most vulnerable—
the best child protection system in Australia.
From worst to best in one great leap. That is vintage Peter Beattie spin. Regrettably—and, in the circumstances, regretfully—we shall have to wait to make a judgment on whether this time Beattie Labor actually delivers the goods.
The children at the centre of the scandal will have to wait too. That remains the real tragedy. It is additionally tragic because it would all have been so avoidable if Mr Beattie had not needed the 1999 Forde inquiry; exhaustive parliamentary and media probing, extending over the period from 1999-2003; continuous lobbying over at least the same period by organisations such as Bravehearts and others; and two highly visible crises within the system—one of which his first failed minister, Anna Bligh, flicked away to the source of the problem, her department, and the other dismissed by his second failed minister, Judy Spence, as something she needed to get the help desk to sort out—to convince himself that there really was a problem he needed to fix.
We have heard about the millions of dollars that are to be deployed to create an instant solution to the problem that Mr Beattie, his two failed ministers and his government ignored for five years or more. But it is sound implementation and safe and focused delivery and administration that is really needed. That is less a matter of money than of focus and leadership. The new money that is to be deployed to protect children is obviously essential, but this is not a throw-and-forget dollar solvable problem. It is an institutional problem. Mr Forster's report is clear about that. His report is thorough, so far as it goes, but it reads as if he wrote it within a preset budgetary limit. Perhaps he was told where the dollars were concerned, `Go for double, that's OK; but no further,' instead of on the basis of applying maximum effort to meeting actual needs.
It has not satisfied the chief lobbyists, Hetty Johnston of Bravehearts and David Woods of the Abused Child Trust. They say the blueprint for child protection reform lacks the promised whole of government approach and neglects the bulk of children and families who would come into contact with the counter abuse system. Ms Johnston says no money has been factored into the $201 million costing to help other government departments meet their new obligations in accordance with their role in child protection. She also says no money has been allocated for therapy services for children other than those with complex needs and extreme behaviours—in other words, for any affected children other than those in care. This is a point taken up by Mr Woods, who described it has stupid and negligent—hardly a ringing endorsement for the country's best child protection system that the Premier promises is just around the corner. 
Obviously, where finite sums are involved and other priorities exist, it is impossible to satisfy everyone or to meet every need that someone or some organisation claims exists. But in all the circumstances it seems strange, given that what Premier Beattie is dealing with is a painful, historic and systemic failure to provide child protection. Even from his administration, which clings to be belief that the zing of the spin cycle is much more important than the whiteness of the wash that results, it is an oversight that we should not have had to expect after so much time and so much anguish.
 Queensland Liberal leader, Bob Quinn, says he suspects the state government is squibbing on some of the costs by shifting a greater burden of responsibility on to other departments, which might have to divert funds from other areas to pay for it. It is in precisely that area of budgetary operations that future problems are likely to arise. It is a way of hiding the true cost of meeting the state government's obligations in child protection, but it is of course in no way a solution to the difficulty. The money is one thing. But, as I said earlier in this speech, actual delivery of services—and, in this instance, actual protection for children—is by far the more important point.
The fact is that there is ample anecdotal evidence of continued poor decisions by Queensland family services and evidence of a continued desire to sweep matters under the carpet or to fail to deal effectively with them. In one instance that has come to my attention an incident that commenced with one injury of unknown cause has by poor management created a whole extended family of victims. It has been characterised by hostility from a child protection officer towards someone who became involved simply as a charitable act towards the mother in the case, who had asked for that involvement. It has been characterised as well by heavy-handedness on the part of the authorities, particularly in relation to a child protection order issued by the Children's Court. As the matter is before the courts, under existing arrangements there appears to be no avenue of complaint, either through the Crime and Misconduct Commission or the Children's Commissioner. My informant makes the point that it is anomalous, that it is not possible to complain to a state body about poor decisions by a state public servant simply because the matter is before a court. In the Commonwealth jurisdiction, matters before the courts that become the subject of complaint are investigated by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
The brief facts of this sad case are tragically all too common in the area of child protection. The three children involved have all been removed from the mother's care. Police have interviewed people who might have knowledge of an injury to one of the children. Child protection officers say there is no evidence against any person, or any admissions. They do not know what caused the injury, a skull fracture, or whether anyone else was involved. The injury could be the result of abuse, neglect, misadventure or the otherwise innocent action of a sibling. There appears to be no real evidence that would indicate one possibility being greater than another. These are the sorts of intricacies on which an emotive area of administration such as child protection ultimately stand or fall. It is not a matter of dollars, irrespective of whether it is $10, $200 or indeed $2 million. It is simply a matter of commonsense.
