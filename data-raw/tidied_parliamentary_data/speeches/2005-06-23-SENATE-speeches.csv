"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2005-06-23,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Marshall, I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee entitled The cancer journey: informing choice, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate Senator Marshall’s tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
This report, entitled The Cancer Journey: Informing Choice, is the result of an inquiry established in February 2005 by Senator Peter Cook into services and treatment options for persons with cancer.
The Committee received over 100 submissions from a range of groups and individuals. The Committee especially thanks the cancer patients and their families who provided submissions and gave very moving testimonies of their personal cancer journeys. The Committee has given voice to these people in the report and hopes that it has done justice to their stories.
This is a unanimous report. It is the Committee’s hope that the recommendations will be a guide for government and non-government institutions to improve cancer treatment and services in Australia for all cancer patients regardless of where they live.
Australia can feel justifiably proud of its internationally recognised achievements in the areas of decreased mortality and increased survival for people with cancer. However, despite our achievements and advances in treatment, there are inequalities in the system and not all Australians have access to best practice cancer care. This is true even in some outer metropolitan areas but particularly for rural and Indigenous Australians.
We want to assist all cancer patients to receive best practice care. Cancer is perhaps unique in that it usually requires a whole range of different services to treat it. For example, patients may need to see not only surgeons but also radiographers, oncologists, pathologists and other allied services.
One of the key messages from cancer patients was that their care had been fragmented and disorganised. The Committee heard from witnesses that multidisciplinary care is best practice and provides the cancer patient with a team approach which agrees on a precise diagnosis and a treatment plan and includes a designated care coordinator. Patients experiencing multidisciplinary care report greater satisfaction with services, less personal distress and improved outcomes.
To improve coordination of care along the care continuum, the Committee recommended that multidisciplinary care be widely promoted through a range of measures including: multidisciplinary cancer centre demonstration projects, enhancing current Medicare Benefit Schedule arrangements to support participation in multidisciplinary meetings and including multidisciplinary care as part of any system of accreditation of cancer services.
Care coordinators play a vital role to reduce fragmentation of care and improve the provision of information. The Committee recommended that all State and Territory governments that have not yet done so, establish designated care coordinator positions to help cancer patients navigate their way through treatment and provide support and access to appropriate information. The Committee recognised the success of the breast cancer nurse model and recommended State and Territories undertake recruitment drives for skilled health professionals such as retired nurses to help fill these positions.
Another key message from cancer patients was the lack of information from the very start of their cancer journey. Along with the shock of the diagnosis, there are a myriad of questions to be answered, the health system to navigate, choices to be made regarding specialists and treatments, and unfamiliar medical terms to learn.
To make more information available to the cancer patient, their families, care coordinators and health professionals, the Committee recommended that Cancer Australia provide access to authoritative, evidence-based information on services, treatment options, government and non-government assistance and links to appropriate support groups.
To provide more information to physicians and patients at the time of diagnosis and to assist making decisions regarding treatment, it is important to link referral pathways to services which are accredited and physicians who have appropriate credentials. The Committee has recommended that Cancer Australia together with the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia and the Cancer Council of Australia develop and introduce accreditation and credentialing systems.
Cancer patients also stressed to the Committee that life goes on regardless of cancer and sometimes the emotional and practical issues they face can be just as challenging as the physical ones. Many stressed the lack of support available and the Committee has recommended that psychosocial care be given equal priority with other aspects of care and be fully integrated with both diagnosis and treatment, including the referral to appropriate support services where necessary.
To address a major concern for regional cancer patients, the Committee has called on State and Territories to adopt and implement a consistent approach to travel and accommodation benefits which should be indexed or reviewed annually.
To improve the survival rates for Indigenous Australians, we have recommended that Cancer Australia, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the States and Territories, auspice work to improve access to cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment for Indigenous people that is culturally appropriate.
Cancer patients are increasingly better informed and many want to be active participants in their treatment plans. Complementary therapies was another area highlighted by patients where there is a significant need for greater information. They referred to the negative attitude taken by many medical professionals at attempts by patients to help themselves and investigate complementary therapies.
The Committee heard that the reasons behind the growth in complementary therapies include: greater individual attention from practitioners, holistic values, dissatisfaction with medical outcomes, a desire for improved health, increased access to health information as well as a growth in research based evidence supporting their effectiveness.
There is substantial research literature and growing understanding by patients that some of these therapies can enhance quality of life such as meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy, support groups and relaxation. There is also emerging evidence that some therapies can not only enhance but may contribute to life extension.
In the USA and Europe, the benefits of complementary therapies have been acknowledged and are being actively introduced into the conventional health sector as part of integrative medicine. Integrative medicine combines the best of both worlds, the scientific aspects of conventional medicine with the scientific aspects of complementary medicine.
To support informed choice and attitudinal change in Australia, the Committee has recommended steps to provide greater access to information on complementary therapies, increase knowledge of their potential benefits and increase Australian complementary therapy research.
With increasing numbers of people, including cancer patients, accessing complementary therapies, the Committee has recommended that Cancer Australia access information available internationally on different complementary therapies and alternative products in order to provide authoritative, evidence-based, up-to-date information.
To develop complementary therapy research in Australia the Committee has called on the NHMRC to provide a dedicated funding stream, assist complementary therapists applying for research funding and appoint representatives with a background on complementary therapy to be involved in the assessment of research proposals.
The Committee considers that complementary therapy organisations need to speak with a more influential and unified voice and has recommended that the complementary therapy organisations form a national body to enable its members to discuss issues such as regulation, research, collaboration and cancer initiatives at the Commonwealth, State and Territory levels.
The increasing numbers of people being diagnosed with cancer and living longer with cancer will place pressure on the national health budget and present challenges to the delivery of optimal cancer care services in Australia. We hope this report will contribute to the development of a national, evidence-driven, consumer-focussed approach to cancer care, involving greater coordination of the cancer patient’s journey and greater provision of support.
I commend the report to the Senate and I look forward to a positive response from the government.
Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to all members of the Committee for their empathy and cooperation throughout the hearings and through the compilation of the report and recommendations in the short timeframe available. I also thank the staff of the Community Affairs secretariat who were ably assisted in this inquiry by Lyn Beverley, Ian Kemp and Clive Deverall.
—The Chairman of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Gavin Marshall, and the committee have asked me to table this report. I thank them sincerely for the opportunity to do so. I recognise in the gallery members of the committee secretariat. The committee secretariat served us well. This report had a tough deadline and a tight scheduling of hearings. At all times we were conscious of the importance of the subject—cancer—and the need to do a thorough job. I believe we achieved that. Without the help of Mr Elton Humphery and his staff , especially Ms Lyn Beverley and Mr Ian Kemp, it would not have been possible. In particular, I am grateful to my own staff member Mr Clive Deverall for the help he provided. I believe we all owe a debt of gratitude to them.
When I moved the terms of reference for this inquiry in the Senate, I had just come through a traumatic and frustrating period in my life. I had been diagnosed with secondary melanomas and undergone extensive surgery, only to be given a dismal prognosis. Fortunately for me, a lot of good friends came to my aid and helped me, together with outstanding doctors at the Sydney Melanoma Clinic, later at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and many others, to develop a strategy to improve the odds.
When I was diagnosed I knew nothing about the disease. Initially it was a frightening and frustrating experience. With little or no knowledge I had to make life-critical decisions in an urgent time frame. Faced with that immense task it is very easy to despair and give up. What I needed was a rational evaluation of all the options—information on diet, exercise, emotional wellbeing and guidance on what was snake oil and what held promise among the alternative treatments. Most of all I needed advice on the various conventional therapies available. Eventually I found my way through to a treatment strategy that has given me confidence. In all that I have learnt, I have learnt that there is no such thing as a silver bullet here—no single, one solution—and that the answer, if there is one, lies in integrating a number of treatments, or sequencing them in a way to make sure that one treatment does not negate or block another. The other insight I gained is that, as a patient, I had to take responsibility for my own healing.
As I said, I was fortunate to have good friends who referred me to the leading researchers and clinics in all the capital cities of Australia and overseas. Indeed, it was because of these referrals that I came across a congressional inquiry into cancer treatments conducted in Washington some 15 years ago. A book published about it gave me the confidence to assess all of the options, both conventional and complementary, before making a choice on an integrated regime. That American inquiry is now some 15 years old. We have the chance in Australia to replicate and update that very worthwhile work. In fact, we have, I believe, a duty to do it. Cancer patients should not be left to the luck of the draw or to serendipity in order to have their disease treated in the most effective way.
In moving for this inquiry I recognised that the options I eventually chose may not be appropriate to everyone facing cancer. But I believed that the Senate could help others navigate their way through the maze to find the treatment regime which best suited them. An inquiry could survey the field, consider the options, and point to possible solutions; importantly, it could do this by standing in the shoes of cancer patients and hopefully make sense of the system on their behalf.
Too many individuals and families in Australia suffer from cancer or experience its effects at first hand. On current statistics, one in three Australians will have to deal with cancer before the age of 75, and cancer has now, unfortunately, supplanted heart disease as the biggest single killer of Australians. Some families cope well, survive their treatment and carry on with their lives. But there are far more who do not cope, do not survive, and become grim statistics—the technical classification is ‘cancer mortality’. And there are those who achieve remission but live the rest of their lives struggling with the disease.
Our report looks at the experience of cancer patients who have survived what many call their ‘cancer journey’—from the impact at the time of diagnosis through sometimes lengthy cycles of treatment. Others gain full remission or cure, or the knowledge that their cancer cannot be cured and they cope with maintenance therapy until they die—often of something else. One thing we do know is that more people in Australia are getting cancer, in all its forms, and that the incidence is going to increase as our population ages. I hope that our report, which quotes all the statistics, will help people who are currently being treated and significantly improve the outlook for those who are diagnosed in the future.
Australia has a good record, by any international comparison, in terms of its cancer treatment results or ‘survival’, as it is technically described, but we believe it has the opportunity to do better. However, all the statistics of incidence and survival mask the real, everyday problems that cancer patients face on their individual journeys. All the statistics can never describe the psychological trauma at the time of diagnosis; the financial impact on families as they lose income; the nausea, vomiting and fatigue that so many patients experience as side effects; and the burden that has to be carried by their carers.
During the inquiry we heard details of how patients adjusted their lives and tried, together with their carers, to cope with the progression of their disease and its treatment. It was very evident to all of us on the committee that cancer treatment services in Australia could and should be improved. The system by which patients are managed after their diagnosis and how they are referred is not a scientific or medical issue; it is a health management issue. We received powerful evidence during the inquiry that the present system of referral can be erratic and poorly managed. It often works against the best interests of the patient. The best illustration of how it should be done is from the breast cancer treatment sector, which, since the early 1990s, has been overhauled and brought into line with the modern approach of multidisciplinary care.
Multidisciplinary care is identified by the committee as vital to improving the treatment of cancer in Australia. Multidisciplinary care is teamwork where the different medical disciplines or experts, assisted by allied heath professionals, are involved in the treatment program. This includes the psycho-social support of the patient. Multidisciplinary care has been well demonstrated nationally and internationally. It allows GPs to refer their patients to the best-qualified and best-equipped centres which specialise in the treatment of specific cancers. Components of multidisciplinary care, all of which are described in the report, support the patient and their carer throughout the cancer journey.
Included as part of integrated multidisciplinary care is a care coordinator, who guides the patient through their cancer journey. The care coordinator can be a nurse or other trained health or allied health professional who works in the multidisciplinary team and plays a major part in organising the patient’s treatment program. Keeping the patient informed and discussing the options available, as well as supporting the patient emotionally, is part of the role of the care coordinator. The National Breast Cancer Centre has already demonstrated the effectiveness of breast care nurses in the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of breast cancer. It has been established that a care coordinator is not only of great comfort to a patient and their carers but also helps to ensure the most efficient use of professional time.
Part of the pedigree for multidisciplinary care is a national accreditation system that rates the clinic or hospital and a credentialling process that assesses and rates the clinicians who work there. The committee was unanimous that multidisciplinary care must be available for the treatment of all cancers. The systematic introduction of multidisciplinary care in Australia will also improve treatment services in rural and remote regions of our country, including culturally appropriate services for Indigenous Australians. It is also important that, when cancer patients are treated, we know how they were treated and the outcome of the treatment is measured and recorded. This is an important part of data collection and multidisciplinary care. Data collected should also include information on the patient’s quality of life.
Another method of improving treatment standards, in addition to multidisciplinary care, is clinical trials—which also feature positively in the report. Clinical trials help to introduce new treatment techniques, including new drugs, into the Australian treatment protocols which keep Australia up to date internationally. Dramatic improvements have been achieved as a result of clinical trials, especially for treatment of cancer in children.
Several recommendations in the report relate to complementary therapies, or CTs. Complementary therapies are used by over 60 per cent of cancer patients being treated in Australia, yet they are provided, in most cases, outside the Australian health system with few medical rebates. Australians spend upwards of $1 billion per annum on these forms of treatment.
From evidence presented to the inquiry, it was clear that there is a great divide between conventional medicine and complementary therapy including alternative medicine. Collaboration appears to be virtually non-existent. So we have this strange situation in this country where there are thousands of cancer patients being treated in our hospitals and at the same time a majority of these same patients are using complementary therapies and alternative products without any exchange of information between the two systems. Some witnesses at our inquiry spoke about how in their case their specialists derided their inquiries about specific complementary therapies, or of the ignorance of many doctors about them. There is a void when it comes to the public having access to authoritative, accurate and up-to-date information.
In contrast, the committee heard evidence from overseas witnesses, who included representatives from the famous centre in New York, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre; the Macmillan Cancer Relief centre in the United Kingdom; Mount Vernon Cancer Centre in London; and the Lance Armstrong Foundation. All the representatives told the committee about their use and endorsement of complementary therapies including herbal medicine and acupuncture, which were described as ‘an integrative part of mainstream cancer treatment’.
Integrative medicine is now a standard course of study in most American university medical schools. Australian witnesses representing this sector emphasised how nutritional medicine and techniques such as massage, meditation, sequential muscle relaxation and aromatherapy helped cancer patients having conventional treatment cope better with the side effects of their treatment as well as improving their outcomes. Complementary therapies also help patients who are in remission after successful conventional treatment to maintain good health.
It is the committee’s view that Australia is, in comparison with Europe and the USA, behind in the use of complementary therapies. It is clear from the evidence provided that respected scientific journals have published positive results relating to the use of complementary therapies. It also appears that Australian patients are already voting with their chequebooks by their widespread use of complementary therapies. Consequently the committee recommended that the government should publish authoritative, up-to-date information and, in addition, that complementary therapies should be incorporated within multidisciplinary cancer care.
Professor Jane Maher, an overseas expert witness from the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, recommended that Australia needed to find champions from the conventional medical sector who, like her, would be prepared to foster the use of complementary therapies and alternative medicines in their clinics as well as to encourage more research. The committee recommended that the NHMRC convene an expert working group to identify research needs which must involve representatives from the complementary therapy sector.
I believe this has been an extremely useful inquiry conducted by this Senate committee. Yesterday I delivered my valedictory speech, but now that this is an addendum to what I have done in my 22 years in this chamber I must say this may well be the most important inquiry I have sat on. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Gavin Marshall; the deputy chair, Senator Sue Knowles; and the other members of the committee for the work they have put into what I regard as being a vital and important inquiry.
I hope these findings not only reflect the evidence, as I am sure they do, but also receive a sympathetic and understanding ear in government as we try and work our way through improving on the already first-class treatment that this country provides to cancer patients. There are some other steps we can take, and this report recommends them. I think it does so sensibly, and I commend it to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,10,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2005-06-23,"—I would like to begin by paying tribute to Senator Cook for his courage and determination at a time when he could be excused for moving on and not putting such energy and effort into something when he is facing a very personal challenge. I would also like to pay tribute to the committee, and this will be for the last time. The community affairs committee is a fabulous committee. I pay tribute to Elton and his team.
For me, this inquiry was quite a moving experience. I think the essence of it was about empowering people who find that they have cancer. One of the big gaps in Australia is the lack of access to alternatives—to complementary therapies—or even finding out about what the alternatives are. As we looked overseas and had overseas evidence by phone linkage we saw that, particularly in the US and also in Europe, they are so much further ahead than we are. We also looked at the breast cancer model in Australia. We saw there the breast cancer nurse and the contact that is made with the woman within the first few days—someone else who has had the experience gets in touch. There is a process then of explaining alternatives, and we are not talking about going on a diet instead of chemotherapy; we are talking about the other things that can be done to help the cancer sufferer and their family through what is a very daunting experience. This is about action. This is about looking at what we do now and better coordinating the excellent services that are available in our hospitals with what people want and, indeed, as Senator Cook has said, what people are paying for out of their own pockets, because the holistic approach is simply missing in Australia.
For me, one of the specific issues we need to deal with urgently is that of adolescents. There is a gap between excellent childhood cancer services and adult services, which tend to be focused cancer by cancer. As I said, the breast cancer model is the one that we should be moving across into all the various sorts of cancers. But somehow the teenagers seem to be slipping through. They do not want to go into cancer wards in the big hospitals. A lot of the adult services are quite daunting for them. So I make an appeal to the government on this to look at firstly making sure that this battle between what is conventional and what is complementary stops, that doctors are supported through the process of understanding that if you empower someone with a chronic illness—if they actually feel better—they will get better. It is very much a part of the process, and this is not going to cost a lot of money.
I only have three minutes to speak on this, and in my last couple of seconds I want to stress that we are not talking about huge input from the budget. We are talking about reorganising what we have got, focusing it on the individual and understanding that anyone with a chronic illness needs to have firstly a real understanding of what they are facing but then some real alternatives and to feel in control of themselves.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-06-23,"—This cancer inquiry has been particularly significant for all affected by cancer, both today and tomorrow. I congratulate Senator Cook on taking the initiative to initiate this inquiry. It was a very significant inquiry and it was, in many cases, a very alarming inquiry. The things that have been revealed to this inquiry are certainly food for thought for governments all around Australia and also for medical practitioners. It is very disturbing to see that there is so little communication between various levels of the medical profession where they could aid cancer patients right from the moment of diagnosis all the way through their journey.
Senator Cook well and truly needs to be congratulated for, as Senator Lees said, taking on an inquiry with quite an arduous hearing schedule when clearly it would have been very easy for him to sit at home with his slippers on—so congratulations, Senator Cook. I also will take this opportunity, Senator Cook, to wish you well in your future journey and also for your retirement. I do not want to use much time; in fact, I would like to allocate what time I have left over, when I have concluded my comments, to my colleague Senator Humphries. As everyone knows, Senator Humphries is the future; I am about to be the past. So I think it is important that Senator Humphries has considerably more time.
I would like to make special mention of Senator Marshall’s chairmanship of this inquiry. I think his chairmanship has been absolutely superb. There were a lot of people who were very emotional and very affected by the evidence that they were giving. Thank you, Senator Marshall, for your care, patience and tolerance and the compassion that you showed in your chairmanship. I also, again, would like to thank our wonderful secretariat for the work they have done on this. But I would also like to have the indulgence for a moment of the Senate because I did forget to thank two very significant groups of people in my valedictory speech. One is Hansard: bless your souls, you have managed to get down all the words over 21 years and make sense of them at times. I would also like to thank the library. Both have been wonderful resources over the time. But, as I said, I wish to leave my extra time to Senator Humphries. Congratulations again to Senator Cook and the committee on an excellent report that I hope will see great benefits extended to those who are diagnosed today and deal with it tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,10,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-06-23,"—I was privileged to be part of this fascinating inquiry. I feel that a real contribution has been made to public policy in Australia by virtue of that inquiry having been conducted. Like other members, I commend Senator Cook for the opportunity he created, by virtue of his own experience, to throw the spotlight of the Senate onto this important issue. I think it has produced some value in public policy terms.
As senators have already heard, this problem is a significant problem for an increasing number of Australians. Between 1991 and 2001 there was a 36 per cent increase in the diagnoses of cancer in this country—a frightening statistic. In recent years, it has led to the calculation that half a million potential years of life are lost each year to Australians by virtue of this insidious set of diseases. It is important to note that, although there are certainly improved survival rates for a number of cancers, in fact for the majority of cancers, across Australia in recent years because of improved technology and medicines, the fact remains that all too many Australians each year are finding that diagnosis suddenly placed in front of them. Steps need to be taken to ensure that they are better supported through the process of the cancer experience, the cancer journey.
It is true to say that overall the quality of cancer services in this country is quite good. We have survival rates which are quite high by world standards, and it is important for us not to lose sight of that. Indeed, what this report focuses on is not so much recommending massive new amounts of money to be spent on cancer research or cancer services per se—although, of course, more money would be welcome and would go a long way—but rather looking at ways in which we can improve the delivery of service to Australians by looking at the range of services available in Australia, the information available to Australians who are diagnosed with cancer, particularly the way in which we integrate conventional cancer services with what are variously called complementary therapies and other things for people who find themselves in that position.
An important recommendation from this report is the one that suggests that, with so many information pathways available to Australians affected by cancer, it is extremely important that we begin to channel and tailor packages appropriate to people who are diagnosed with cancer. There is a huge amount of information for people in these circumstances. In fact, there is much information which is probably unhelpful or inaccurate. There is much very useful information provided by clinical outlets, government and semi-government agencies, research bodies and so forth. But, for those freshly diagnosed with cancer, we found evidence that there were too often confusing portals into that information and a lack of a clear set of principles and explanations of clinical pathways available to them. The opportunity created by Cancer Australia’s formation to bring this all together is very significant. I think it is most important that this report be taken up by that new body to establish a very clear set of principles for how information is provided to those newly diagnosed.
I want to touch on the issue of complementary therapies. My view during the course of this inquiry about those therapies swung around quite dramatically. I was sceptical about the value of such therapies but have come to the view that they are extremely important for the emotional and spiritual wellbeing of cancer patients. The fact that so many cancer patients in this country turn to them, often sidestepping clinical advice available to them from their GP or specialist, is evidence of the important place that they occupy in the cancer scene by offering hope to people who otherwise might be told by conventional medicine that they have little or no hope.
It is important that we provide a pathway for people who are diagnosed with cancer to access accurate information about complementary medicines. I particularly commend to the Senate the recommendations that provide for the NHMRC to establish a funding stream dedicated to research into complementary medicines, and not because I think it is likely to bring a large number of alternative therapies in from the cold and somehow make them acceptable to mainstream medicine overnight. That may happen over time but it is not likely to happen anytime soon. But it is important for people to know where they stand with those medicines, to know what implications they have in connection with conventional medicine. Many complementary therapies are beneficial, as I have said. In an emotional and spiritual sense they support patients with a diagnosis of cancer. They give them a sense of being empowered, as Senator Lees said, in the circumstances of their condition. But some therapies have the potential to be harmful to a conventional medicine regime. We can overcome that problem if we focus on the interface between the two areas.
Another important recommendation to support that position is that there should be a peak body of some sort, a forum or committee of complementary therapies and providers in this country, so that they are able to deal on more equal terms with the conventional medical hierarchy. We all know that there is something of an art form to writing a good application, and probably no more so than when it comes to seeking large numbers of dollars for research. But very often we have heard that some of those therapies are not in a position to put together suitable and acceptable funding applications, and we need to give them a pathway to ensure that they do not slip outside the mainstream merely because they do not conform to those conventions. I remind the Senate that therapies like acupuncture, for example, were long regarded as quackery but now occupy a very respectable place within conventional medical procedures. Other alternatives deserve to be considered as the evidence comes forward that they are in fact efficacious.
I also believe it is important that we focus on the recommendations about a multidisciplinary approach towards cancer. It is clear that patients do not have a single, one-dimensional set of needs. They are not focused just on the physical presence of a cancer in some particular part of their body. There are a range of problems—psychosocial problems, for example—which absolutely must be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach towards the treatment of a person with cancer. With a greater focus in conventional medical education on how those sorts of multidisciplinary approaches could be achieved, as well as some reorganisation of funding mechanisms to ensure that, I believe we will give much more hope and much more satisfactory experiences to people diagnosed with cancer.
There is also a recommendation in the report that we should encourage doctors to focus on communication techniques. That is obviously achieved partly through medical education as well. It has been disturbing throughout this inquiry that we have heard of so many cases of poor bedside manner used by doctors who come to offer services to their patients. That very clearly is a matter for improvement. I seek leave to continue my remarks. (Time expired)

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2005-06-23,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Marshall, I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee entitled The cancer journey: informing choice, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate Senator Marshall’s tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
This report, entitled The Cancer Journey: Informing Choice, is the result of an inquiry established in February 2005 by Senator Peter Cook into services and treatment options for persons with cancer.
The Committee received over 100 submissions from a range of groups and individuals. The Committee especially thanks the cancer patients and their families who provided submissions and gave very moving testimonies of their personal cancer journeys. The Committee has given voice to these people in the report and hopes that it has done justice to their stories.
This is a unanimous report. It is the Committee’s hope that the recommendations will be a guide for government and non-government institutions to improve cancer treatment and services in Australia for all cancer patients regardless of where they live.
Australia can feel justifiably proud of its internationally recognised achievements in the areas of decreased mortality and increased survival for people with cancer. However, despite our achievements and advances in treatment, there are inequalities in the system and not all Australians have access to best practice cancer care. This is true even in some outer metropolitan areas but particularly for rural and Indigenous Australians.
We want to assist all cancer patients to receive best practice care. Cancer is perhaps unique in that it usually requires a whole range of different services to treat it. For example, patients may need to see not only surgeons but also radiographers, oncologists, pathologists and other allied services.
One of the key messages from cancer patients was that their care had been fragmented and disorganised. The Committee heard from witnesses that multidisciplinary care is best practice and provides the cancer patient with a team approach which agrees on a precise diagnosis and a treatment plan and includes a designated care coordinator. Patients experiencing multidisciplinary care report greater satisfaction with services, less personal distress and improved outcomes.
To improve coordination of care along the care continuum, the Committee recommended that multidisciplinary care be widely promoted through a range of measures including: multidisciplinary cancer centre demonstration projects, enhancing current Medicare Benefit Schedule arrangements to support participation in multidisciplinary meetings and including multidisciplinary care as part of any system of accreditation of cancer services.
Care coordinators play a vital role to reduce fragmentation of care and improve the provision of information. The Committee recommended that all State and Territory governments that have not yet done so, establish designated care coordinator positions to help cancer patients navigate their way through treatment and provide support and access to appropriate information. The Committee recognised the success of the breast cancer nurse model and recommended State and Territories undertake recruitment drives for skilled health professionals such as retired nurses to help fill these positions.
Another key message from cancer patients was the lack of information from the very start of their cancer journey. Along with the shock of the diagnosis, there are a myriad of questions to be answered, the health system to navigate, choices to be made regarding specialists and treatments, and unfamiliar medical terms to learn.
To make more information available to the cancer patient, their families, care coordinators and health professionals, the Committee recommended that Cancer Australia provide access to authoritative, evidence-based information on services, treatment options, government and non-government assistance and links to appropriate support groups.
To provide more information to physicians and patients at the time of diagnosis and to assist making decisions regarding treatment, it is important to link referral pathways to services which are accredited and physicians who have appropriate credentials. The Committee has recommended that Cancer Australia together with the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia and the Cancer Council of Australia develop and introduce accreditation and credentialing systems.
Cancer patients also stressed to the Committee that life goes on regardless of cancer and sometimes the emotional and practical issues they face can be just as challenging as the physical ones. Many stressed the lack of support available and the Committee has recommended that psychosocial care be given equal priority with other aspects of care and be fully integrated with both diagnosis and treatment, including the referral to appropriate support services where necessary.
To address a major concern for regional cancer patients, the Committee has called on State and Territories to adopt and implement a consistent approach to travel and accommodation benefits which should be indexed or reviewed annually.
To improve the survival rates for Indigenous Australians, we have recommended that Cancer Australia, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the States and Territories, auspice work to improve access to cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment for Indigenous people that is culturally appropriate.
Cancer patients are increasingly better informed and many want to be active participants in their treatment plans. Complementary therapies was another area highlighted by patients where there is a significant need for greater information. They referred to the negative attitude taken by many medical professionals at attempts by patients to help themselves and investigate complementary therapies.
The Committee heard that the reasons behind the growth in complementary therapies include: greater individual attention from practitioners, holistic values, dissatisfaction with medical outcomes, a desire for improved health, increased access to health information as well as a growth in research based evidence supporting their effectiveness.
There is substantial research literature and growing understanding by patients that some of these therapies can enhance quality of life such as meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy, support groups and relaxation. There is also emerging evidence that some therapies can not only enhance but may contribute to life extension.
In the USA and Europe, the benefits of complementary therapies have been acknowledged and are being actively introduced into the conventional health sector as part of integrative medicine. Integrative medicine combines the best of both worlds, the scientific aspects of conventional medicine with the scientific aspects of complementary medicine.
To support informed choice and attitudinal change in Australia, the Committee has recommended steps to provide greater access to information on complementary therapies, increase knowledge of their potential benefits and increase Australian complementary therapy research.
With increasing numbers of people, including cancer patients, accessing complementary therapies, the Committee has recommended that Cancer Australia access information available internationally on different complementary therapies and alternative products in order to provide authoritative, evidence-based, up-to-date information.
To develop complementary therapy research in Australia the Committee has called on the NHMRC to provide a dedicated funding stream, assist complementary therapists applying for research funding and appoint representatives with a background on complementary therapy to be involved in the assessment of research proposals.
The Committee considers that complementary therapy organisations need to speak with a more influential and unified voice and has recommended that the complementary therapy organisations form a national body to enable its members to discuss issues such as regulation, research, collaboration and cancer initiatives at the Commonwealth, State and Territory levels.
The increasing numbers of people being diagnosed with cancer and living longer with cancer will place pressure on the national health budget and present challenges to the delivery of optimal cancer care services in Australia. We hope this report will contribute to the development of a national, evidence-driven, consumer-focussed approach to cancer care, involving greater coordination of the cancer patient’s journey and greater provision of support.
I commend the report to the Senate and I look forward to a positive response from the government.
Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to all members of the Committee for their empathy and cooperation throughout the hearings and through the compilation of the report and recommendations in the short timeframe available. I also thank the staff of the Community Affairs secretariat who were ably assisted in this inquiry by Lyn Beverley, Ian Kemp and Clive Deverall.
—The Chairman of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Gavin Marshall, and the committee have asked me to table this report. I thank them sincerely for the opportunity to do so. I recognise in the gallery members of the committee secretariat. The committee secretariat served us well. This report had a tough deadline and a tight scheduling of hearings. At all times we were conscious of the importance of the subject—cancer—and the need to do a thorough job. I believe we achieved that. Without the help of Mr Elton Humphery and his staff , especially Ms Lyn Beverley and Mr Ian Kemp, it would not have been possible. In particular, I am grateful to my own staff member Mr Clive Deverall for the help he provided. I believe we all owe a debt of gratitude to them.
When I moved the terms of reference for this inquiry in the Senate, I had just come through a traumatic and frustrating period in my life. I had been diagnosed with secondary melanomas and undergone extensive surgery, only to be given a dismal prognosis. Fortunately for me, a lot of good friends came to my aid and helped me, together with outstanding doctors at the Sydney Melanoma Clinic, later at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and many others, to develop a strategy to improve the odds.
When I was diagnosed I knew nothing about the disease. Initially it was a frightening and frustrating experience. With little or no knowledge I had to make life-critical decisions in an urgent time frame. Faced with that immense task it is very easy to despair and give up. What I needed was a rational evaluation of all the options—information on diet, exercise, emotional wellbeing and guidance on what was snake oil and what held promise among the alternative treatments. Most of all I needed advice on the various conventional therapies available. Eventually I found my way through to a treatment strategy that has given me confidence. In all that I have learnt, I have learnt that there is no such thing as a silver bullet here—no single, one solution—and that the answer, if there is one, lies in integrating a number of treatments, or sequencing them in a way to make sure that one treatment does not negate or block another. The other insight I gained is that, as a patient, I had to take responsibility for my own healing.
As I said, I was fortunate to have good friends who referred me to the leading researchers and clinics in all the capital cities of Australia and overseas. Indeed, it was because of these referrals that I came across a congressional inquiry into cancer treatments conducted in Washington some 15 years ago. A book published about it gave me the confidence to assess all of the options, both conventional and complementary, before making a choice on an integrated regime. That American inquiry is now some 15 years old. We have the chance in Australia to replicate and update that very worthwhile work. In fact, we have, I believe, a duty to do it. Cancer patients should not be left to the luck of the draw or to serendipity in order to have their disease treated in the most effective way.
In moving for this inquiry I recognised that the options I eventually chose may not be appropriate to everyone facing cancer. But I believed that the Senate could help others navigate their way through the maze to find the treatment regime which best suited them. An inquiry could survey the field, consider the options, and point to possible solutions; importantly, it could do this by standing in the shoes of cancer patients and hopefully make sense of the system on their behalf.
Too many individuals and families in Australia suffer from cancer or experience its effects at first hand. On current statistics, one in three Australians will have to deal with cancer before the age of 75, and cancer has now, unfortunately, supplanted heart disease as the biggest single killer of Australians. Some families cope well, survive their treatment and carry on with their lives. But there are far more who do not cope, do not survive, and become grim statistics—the technical classification is ‘cancer mortality’. And there are those who achieve remission but live the rest of their lives struggling with the disease.
Our report looks at the experience of cancer patients who have survived what many call their ‘cancer journey’—from the impact at the time of diagnosis through sometimes lengthy cycles of treatment. Others gain full remission or cure, or the knowledge that their cancer cannot be cured and they cope with maintenance therapy until they die—often of something else. One thing we do know is that more people in Australia are getting cancer, in all its forms, and that the incidence is going to increase as our population ages. I hope that our report, which quotes all the statistics, will help people who are currently being treated and significantly improve the outlook for those who are diagnosed in the future.
Australia has a good record, by any international comparison, in terms of its cancer treatment results or ‘survival’, as it is technically described, but we believe it has the opportunity to do better. However, all the statistics of incidence and survival mask the real, everyday problems that cancer patients face on their individual journeys. All the statistics can never describe the psychological trauma at the time of diagnosis; the financial impact on families as they lose income; the nausea, vomiting and fatigue that so many patients experience as side effects; and the burden that has to be carried by their carers.
During the inquiry we heard details of how patients adjusted their lives and tried, together with their carers, to cope with the progression of their disease and its treatment. It was very evident to all of us on the committee that cancer treatment services in Australia could and should be improved. The system by which patients are managed after their diagnosis and how they are referred is not a scientific or medical issue; it is a health management issue. We received powerful evidence during the inquiry that the present system of referral can be erratic and poorly managed. It often works against the best interests of the patient. The best illustration of how it should be done is from the breast cancer treatment sector, which, since the early 1990s, has been overhauled and brought into line with the modern approach of multidisciplinary care.
Multidisciplinary care is identified by the committee as vital to improving the treatment of cancer in Australia. Multidisciplinary care is teamwork where the different medical disciplines or experts, assisted by allied heath professionals, are involved in the treatment program. This includes the psycho-social support of the patient. Multidisciplinary care has been well demonstrated nationally and internationally. It allows GPs to refer their patients to the best-qualified and best-equipped centres which specialise in the treatment of specific cancers. Components of multidisciplinary care, all of which are described in the report, support the patient and their carer throughout the cancer journey.
Included as part of integrated multidisciplinary care is a care coordinator, who guides the patient through their cancer journey. The care coordinator can be a nurse or other trained health or allied health professional who works in the multidisciplinary team and plays a major part in organising the patient’s treatment program. Keeping the patient informed and discussing the options available, as well as supporting the patient emotionally, is part of the role of the care coordinator. The National Breast Cancer Centre has already demonstrated the effectiveness of breast care nurses in the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of breast cancer. It has been established that a care coordinator is not only of great comfort to a patient and their carers but also helps to ensure the most efficient use of professional time.
Part of the pedigree for multidisciplinary care is a national accreditation system that rates the clinic or hospital and a credentialling process that assesses and rates the clinicians who work there. The committee was unanimous that multidisciplinary care must be available for the treatment of all cancers. The systematic introduction of multidisciplinary care in Australia will also improve treatment services in rural and remote regions of our country, including culturally appropriate services for Indigenous Australians. It is also important that, when cancer patients are treated, we know how they were treated and the outcome of the treatment is measured and recorded. This is an important part of data collection and multidisciplinary care. Data collected should also include information on the patient’s quality of life.
Another method of improving treatment standards, in addition to multidisciplinary care, is clinical trials—which also feature positively in the report. Clinical trials help to introduce new treatment techniques, including new drugs, into the Australian treatment protocols which keep Australia up to date internationally. Dramatic improvements have been achieved as a result of clinical trials, especially for treatment of cancer in children.
Several recommendations in the report relate to complementary therapies, or CTs. Complementary therapies are used by over 60 per cent of cancer patients being treated in Australia, yet they are provided, in most cases, outside the Australian health system with few medical rebates. Australians spend upwards of $1 billion per annum on these forms of treatment.
From evidence presented to the inquiry, it was clear that there is a great divide between conventional medicine and complementary therapy including alternative medicine. Collaboration appears to be virtually non-existent. So we have this strange situation in this country where there are thousands of cancer patients being treated in our hospitals and at the same time a majority of these same patients are using complementary therapies and alternative products without any exchange of information between the two systems. Some witnesses at our inquiry spoke about how in their case their specialists derided their inquiries about specific complementary therapies, or of the ignorance of many doctors about them. There is a void when it comes to the public having access to authoritative, accurate and up-to-date information.
In contrast, the committee heard evidence from overseas witnesses, who included representatives from the famous centre in New York, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre; the Macmillan Cancer Relief centre in the United Kingdom; Mount Vernon Cancer Centre in London; and the Lance Armstrong Foundation. All the representatives told the committee about their use and endorsement of complementary therapies including herbal medicine and acupuncture, which were described as ‘an integrative part of mainstream cancer treatment’.
Integrative medicine is now a standard course of study in most American university medical schools. Australian witnesses representing this sector emphasised how nutritional medicine and techniques such as massage, meditation, sequential muscle relaxation and aromatherapy helped cancer patients having conventional treatment cope better with the side effects of their treatment as well as improving their outcomes. Complementary therapies also help patients who are in remission after successful conventional treatment to maintain good health.
It is the committee’s view that Australia is, in comparison with Europe and the USA, behind in the use of complementary therapies. It is clear from the evidence provided that respected scientific journals have published positive results relating to the use of complementary therapies. It also appears that Australian patients are already voting with their chequebooks by their widespread use of complementary therapies. Consequently the committee recommended that the government should publish authoritative, up-to-date information and, in addition, that complementary therapies should be incorporated within multidisciplinary cancer care.
Professor Jane Maher, an overseas expert witness from the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, recommended that Australia needed to find champions from the conventional medical sector who, like her, would be prepared to foster the use of complementary therapies and alternative medicines in their clinics as well as to encourage more research. The committee recommended that the NHMRC convene an expert working group to identify research needs which must involve representatives from the complementary therapy sector.
I believe this has been an extremely useful inquiry conducted by this Senate committee. Yesterday I delivered my valedictory speech, but now that this is an addendum to what I have done in my 22 years in this chamber I must say this may well be the most important inquiry I have sat on. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Gavin Marshall; the deputy chair, Senator Sue Knowles; and the other members of the committee for the work they have put into what I regard as being a vital and important inquiry.
I hope these findings not only reflect the evidence, as I am sure they do, but also receive a sympathetic and understanding ear in government as we try and work our way through improving on the already first-class treatment that this country provides to cancer patients. There are some other steps we can take, and this report recommends them. I think it does so sensibly, and I commend it to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,10,2
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2005-06-23,"—I would like to begin by paying tribute to Senator Cook for his courage and determination at a time when he could be excused for moving on and not putting such energy and effort into something when he is facing a very personal challenge. I would also like to pay tribute to the committee, and this will be for the last time. The community affairs committee is a fabulous committee. I pay tribute to Elton and his team.
For me, this inquiry was quite a moving experience. I think the essence of it was about empowering people who find that they have cancer. One of the big gaps in Australia is the lack of access to alternatives—to complementary therapies—or even finding out about what the alternatives are. As we looked overseas and had overseas evidence by phone linkage we saw that, particularly in the US and also in Europe, they are so much further ahead than we are. We also looked at the breast cancer model in Australia. We saw there the breast cancer nurse and the contact that is made with the woman within the first few days—someone else who has had the experience gets in touch. There is a process then of explaining alternatives, and we are not talking about going on a diet instead of chemotherapy; we are talking about the other things that can be done to help the cancer sufferer and their family through what is a very daunting experience. This is about action. This is about looking at what we do now and better coordinating the excellent services that are available in our hospitals with what people want and, indeed, as Senator Cook has said, what people are paying for out of their own pockets, because the holistic approach is simply missing in Australia.
For me, one of the specific issues we need to deal with urgently is that of adolescents. There is a gap between excellent childhood cancer services and adult services, which tend to be focused cancer by cancer. As I said, the breast cancer model is the one that we should be moving across into all the various sorts of cancers. But somehow the teenagers seem to be slipping through. They do not want to go into cancer wards in the big hospitals. A lot of the adult services are quite daunting for them. So I make an appeal to the government on this to look at firstly making sure that this battle between what is conventional and what is complementary stops, that doctors are supported through the process of understanding that if you empower someone with a chronic illness—if they actually feel better—they will get better. It is very much a part of the process, and this is not going to cost a lot of money.
I only have three minutes to speak on this, and in my last couple of seconds I want to stress that we are not talking about huge input from the budget. We are talking about reorganising what we have got, focusing it on the individual and understanding that anyone with a chronic illness needs to have firstly a real understanding of what they are facing but then some real alternatives and to feel in control of themselves.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-06-23,"—This cancer inquiry has been particularly significant for all affected by cancer, both today and tomorrow. I congratulate Senator Cook on taking the initiative to initiate this inquiry. It was a very significant inquiry and it was, in many cases, a very alarming inquiry. The things that have been revealed to this inquiry are certainly food for thought for governments all around Australia and also for medical practitioners. It is very disturbing to see that there is so little communication between various levels of the medical profession where they could aid cancer patients right from the moment of diagnosis all the way through their journey.
Senator Cook well and truly needs to be congratulated for, as Senator Lees said, taking on an inquiry with quite an arduous hearing schedule when clearly it would have been very easy for him to sit at home with his slippers on—so congratulations, Senator Cook. I also will take this opportunity, Senator Cook, to wish you well in your future journey and also for your retirement. I do not want to use much time; in fact, I would like to allocate what time I have left over, when I have concluded my comments, to my colleague Senator Humphries. As everyone knows, Senator Humphries is the future; I am about to be the past. So I think it is important that Senator Humphries has considerably more time.
I would like to make special mention of Senator Marshall’s chairmanship of this inquiry. I think his chairmanship has been absolutely superb. There were a lot of people who were very emotional and very affected by the evidence that they were giving. Thank you, Senator Marshall, for your care, patience and tolerance and the compassion that you showed in your chairmanship. I also, again, would like to thank our wonderful secretariat for the work they have done on this. But I would also like to have the indulgence for a moment of the Senate because I did forget to thank two very significant groups of people in my valedictory speech. One is Hansard: bless your souls, you have managed to get down all the words over 21 years and make sense of them at times. I would also like to thank the library. Both have been wonderful resources over the time. But, as I said, I wish to leave my extra time to Senator Humphries. Congratulations again to Senator Cook and the committee on an excellent report that I hope will see great benefits extended to those who are diagnosed today and deal with it tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,10,2
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-06-23,"—I was privileged to be part of this fascinating inquiry. I feel that a real contribution has been made to public policy in Australia by virtue of that inquiry having been conducted. Like other members, I commend Senator Cook for the opportunity he created, by virtue of his own experience, to throw the spotlight of the Senate onto this important issue. I think it has produced some value in public policy terms.
As senators have already heard, this problem is a significant problem for an increasing number of Australians. Between 1991 and 2001 there was a 36 per cent increase in the diagnoses of cancer in this country—a frightening statistic. In recent years, it has led to the calculation that half a million potential years of life are lost each year to Australians by virtue of this insidious set of diseases. It is important to note that, although there are certainly improved survival rates for a number of cancers, in fact for the majority of cancers, across Australia in recent years because of improved technology and medicines, the fact remains that all too many Australians each year are finding that diagnosis suddenly placed in front of them. Steps need to be taken to ensure that they are better supported through the process of the cancer experience, the cancer journey.
It is true to say that overall the quality of cancer services in this country is quite good. We have survival rates which are quite high by world standards, and it is important for us not to lose sight of that. Indeed, what this report focuses on is not so much recommending massive new amounts of money to be spent on cancer research or cancer services per se—although, of course, more money would be welcome and would go a long way—but rather looking at ways in which we can improve the delivery of service to Australians by looking at the range of services available in Australia, the information available to Australians who are diagnosed with cancer, particularly the way in which we integrate conventional cancer services with what are variously called complementary therapies and other things for people who find themselves in that position.
An important recommendation from this report is the one that suggests that, with so many information pathways available to Australians affected by cancer, it is extremely important that we begin to channel and tailor packages appropriate to people who are diagnosed with cancer. There is a huge amount of information for people in these circumstances. In fact, there is much information which is probably unhelpful or inaccurate. There is much very useful information provided by clinical outlets, government and semi-government agencies, research bodies and so forth. But, for those freshly diagnosed with cancer, we found evidence that there were too often confusing portals into that information and a lack of a clear set of principles and explanations of clinical pathways available to them. The opportunity created by Cancer Australia’s formation to bring this all together is very significant. I think it is most important that this report be taken up by that new body to establish a very clear set of principles for how information is provided to those newly diagnosed.
I want to touch on the issue of complementary therapies. My view during the course of this inquiry about those therapies swung around quite dramatically. I was sceptical about the value of such therapies but have come to the view that they are extremely important for the emotional and spiritual wellbeing of cancer patients. The fact that so many cancer patients in this country turn to them, often sidestepping clinical advice available to them from their GP or specialist, is evidence of the important place that they occupy in the cancer scene by offering hope to people who otherwise might be told by conventional medicine that they have little or no hope.
It is important that we provide a pathway for people who are diagnosed with cancer to access accurate information about complementary medicines. I particularly commend to the Senate the recommendations that provide for the NHMRC to establish a funding stream dedicated to research into complementary medicines, and not because I think it is likely to bring a large number of alternative therapies in from the cold and somehow make them acceptable to mainstream medicine overnight. That may happen over time but it is not likely to happen anytime soon. But it is important for people to know where they stand with those medicines, to know what implications they have in connection with conventional medicine. Many complementary therapies are beneficial, as I have said. In an emotional and spiritual sense they support patients with a diagnosis of cancer. They give them a sense of being empowered, as Senator Lees said, in the circumstances of their condition. But some therapies have the potential to be harmful to a conventional medicine regime. We can overcome that problem if we focus on the interface between the two areas.
Another important recommendation to support that position is that there should be a peak body of some sort, a forum or committee of complementary therapies and providers in this country, so that they are able to deal on more equal terms with the conventional medical hierarchy. We all know that there is something of an art form to writing a good application, and probably no more so than when it comes to seeking large numbers of dollars for research. But very often we have heard that some of those therapies are not in a position to put together suitable and acceptable funding applications, and we need to give them a pathway to ensure that they do not slip outside the mainstream merely because they do not conform to those conventions. I remind the Senate that therapies like acupuncture, for example, were long regarded as quackery but now occupy a very respectable place within conventional medical procedures. Other alternatives deserve to be considered as the evidence comes forward that they are in fact efficacious.
I also believe it is important that we focus on the recommendations about a multidisciplinary approach towards cancer. It is clear that patients do not have a single, one-dimensional set of needs. They are not focused just on the physical presence of a cancer in some particular part of their body. There are a range of problems—psychosocial problems, for example—which absolutely must be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach towards the treatment of a person with cancer. With a greater focus in conventional medical education on how those sorts of multidisciplinary approaches could be achieved, as well as some reorganisation of funding mechanisms to ensure that, I believe we will give much more hope and much more satisfactory experiences to people diagnosed with cancer.
There is also a recommendation in the report that we should encourage doctors to focus on communication techniques. That is obviously achieved partly through medical education as well. It has been disturbing throughout this inquiry that we have heard of so many cases of poor bedside manner used by doctors who come to offer services to their patients. That very clearly is a matter for improvement. I seek leave to continue my remarks. (Time expired)

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-06-23,"—Senator Lundy asked me some questions yesterday in relation to credit card fraud and I promised I would get some answers for her. I seek leave to incorporate those answers in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answers read as follows—
Senator Lundy asked me questions in relation to the following four matters on 22 June 2005:
(1)      Was the government informed six months ago that Australians were exposed to potential card fraud?
(2)      Why was no consumer alert issued by government six months ago?
(3)      Will the banks be permitted to charge customers for obtaining statements for purpose of checking if they have been defrauded?
(4)      Are customers responsible for identifying fraudulent transactions before they can be reimbursed?
The Treasurer has provided the following answers to Senator Lundy’s question:
(1)      Relevant Ministers have made it clear that they only became aware of the credit card security breach in the United States earlier this week when it was reported in the press.
(2)      It is understood that suspicious transactions, later determined to be associated with the US breach, were first reported in December 2004.
Visa International has advised that it was not until May 2005 that there was formal recognition of the extent of the problem. MasterCard and Visa were instructed by the US authorities not to make any public announcements regarding the situation until investigations were carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). The FBI declared the matter a crime scene on 1 June 2005. It was not until the end of the week commencing 13 June (Thursday/Friday) that the FBI advised that MasterCard and Visa could speak publicly.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) and the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sherry, George Campbell and Wong today.
I want to make some comments about the non-response from Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister representing the Treasurer, about the issue that Labor has raised on a number of occasions concerning the ballooning, dramatically increasing national debt of Australia and the increasing current account deficit—the difference between exports and imports.
As a matter of fact, the current account deficit—that is export-import deficit—has reached a record of 7.2 per cent of economic production, gross domestic product, in the March quarter and net foreign debt has more than doubled since 1996 to some $425 billion in the March quarter. Two out of every three dollars generated in the economy each year are now owed to foreigners. That is an astounding figure: two out of every three economic dollars are now owed to foreigners. And there is some $21 billion that flowed out of the economy over the last year to meet just the interest payments on foreign debt.
The minister’s non-answers today reflected a complacency and an arrogance about what is a serious economic problem. Presumably the minister’s logic is that it does not matter how big the debt gets—it could double again and we do not need to worry about it. That is the minister’s contention. The Liberal government has been very complacent and has been showing signs of arrogance about this serious problem. It is pretending that in fact there is not a problem, and we have seen that again today.
The government has falsely claimed that the debt service ratio has fallen sharply, when it has barely changed. It has fallen from 11 per cent to 10 per cent. The government is ignoring the fact that the debt service ratio has barely improved despite low global interest rates, record high commodity prices and a strong US dollar—favourable circumstances in terms of exports versus imports—and yet the current account is at the worst level we have ever seen. It is arguing that debt is not Australian debt—it is not government debt; it is private debt, therefore it is not relevant. That is absurd! This is Australian national debt. The response the minister puts has been dismissed by the OECD. It does matter that it is Australian national debt. At the end of the day the government is not just responsible for government debt; it also has an important role to play in setting positive policy to reduce our foreign debt—the country’s debt. The government boasts about its economic credentials while ignoring warnings from Standard and Poor’s—they are a leading economic ratings agency—that Australia’s credit ratings and interest rates are at risk as a result of this ballooning national debt and current account deficit.
The minister likes to quote a number of sources to defend the government’s complacency and arrogance. When the current Treasurer was in opposition, foreign debt was at half the level that it is currently at. When in opposition, the current Treasurer, Mr Costello—the Darth Vader of the Liberal Party—claimed that the foreign debt levels posed a serious threat to mortgage interest rates, and he cited numerous experts in support of his argument. One of those was Professor Tom Valentine, the Dean of Commerce at the University of Western Sydney, who said:
Of course the debt has an impact ...
This causes higher mortgage rates.
I’m amazed there is even debate about this issue.
He quoted Mr Chris Caton, who said:
It’s quite clear that the current-account deficit at 6 per cent—
this is when it was six per cent; it is now over seven per cent—
of GDP [gross domestic product] has an impact on long-term rates ...
He also quoted Professor McKibbin, who said:
Any country that has a large debt tends to pay a premium over the risk-free range.
That is a reference to interest rates. Given that monthly mortgage payments of Australians are already close to historically high levels, the government cannot possibly justify its ongoing complacent and arrogant attitude to what is a serious problem that grows worse and worse—hundreds of millions of dollars worse in national debt each week. Something has to be done about this. First of all it needs a recognition from this government that there is a serious problem here that grows worse and worse each week. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-06-23,"—It is disappointing to me that Senator Sherry does not seem to understand the difference between, and the different economic consequences of, sovereign debt and non-sovereign debt. One of the most striking differences between the economic position of this country today after nine years of Peter Costello’s stewardship in the Treasury and the economic position of Australia after 13 years of Labor government is that sovereign debt—debt owed by the Australian government or Australian governments overseas—has been reduced to virtually nil. Today sovereign debt constitutes only 3.2 per cent of all Australian foreign debt. The debt is held by the private sector.
Senator Sherry asserts: ‘Well, this could have a significant influence on mortgage interests rates.’ Not so, Senator Sherry. When a government is heavily indebted, heavily burdened by sovereign debt, when the net government debt comprising foreign borrowings and domestic borrowings is high, then the government has to go into the market to borrow to support that debt, and that is what drives interest rates up. But that is a consequence of there being an inflation of sovereign debt. There is virtually no sovereign debt owed by Australia today. Certainly the debt position bears no comparison to the situation after 13 year of Labor government.
Standard and Poor’s, the respected ratings agency on which Senator Sherry relies, reaffirmed in the report that they published in February that Australia enjoyed the highest rating that that organisation can give: a AAA rating. Do you know what happened in the 13 years that Labor was in government? The same ratings agency, Standard and Poor’s, downgraded Australia’s sovereign debt rating three times: from AAA to AAA-, then to AA, then to AA-. And you might ask yourself, Mr Deputy President, when was the last time Australia’s sovereign rating had been downgraded so severely by the international markets? It is no surprise that you have to go back to the previous period of Labor government, when Mr Whitlam was the Prime Minister and Dr Cairns and Mr Crean were the treasurers, because then too Australia’s creditworthiness in the eyes of the international markets and the world was downgraded.
That is the undulating pattern. Under coalition governments, running strong economic policies and strong budget surpluses, Australia has historically enjoyed the best international credit rating in the world, AAA. That was the case throughout the sixties. Along comes the Whitlam Labor government and, for the first time in memory, in the 1970s Australia’s debt serviceability, its international credit rating, was downgraded. Along comes the coalition and our creditworthiness rating was restored. Then, after 13 years of Labor government, we are downgraded again and again and a third time by the international markets while Labor governments clock up a $96 billion deficit, much of it borrowed from overseas.
Along comes the Howard-Costello government in 1996 and all but a few billion dollars now of that $96 billion has been paid off and Australia’s international credit rating, by the very agency that Senator Sherry relies on, Standard and Poor’s, goes up to the highest international rating, AAA. That is the real story of debt. It is not a tale of two cities; it is a tale of two parties: the Labor Party that left this country debt ridden and the Liberal-National Party coalition that has restored its economic fortunes, a fact acknowledged by the ratings agencies and the international markets.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,20,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I rise to speak on the motion of Senator Sherry. At the outset perhaps we should talk about what this government has presided over in its term of government when it comes to locking in the drivers of our future productivity growth so our standards of living and prosperity can be maintained. We have a government that has presided over a massive skills shortage in this country, a government that has turned away from TAFE about 270,000 Australians over their period in government. And now we have a skills shortage. They say: ‘We’ve got a skills shortage. What are we going to do?’ Instead of training young Australians first and training young Australians now, what is their response? Their response is some technical colleges, where we will not see any new apprentices graduating for a number of years, and to bring in skilled migrants, as if that is the only solution.
The fact is this government has been complacent in terms of investing in the skills of the Australian work force, which is one of the foundations of our future economic prosperity. But I want to particularly talk today about one aspect of that failure to invest in skills and in services which ensure people can get into the work force with proper job skills, and that is the Job Network. Senator Abetz was asked some questions today, which again he failed to answer. It is unfortunate that, when he does not know an answer, he does not do the right thing and take the question on notice. Instead, he engages in a harangue of the opposition rather than answering some important questions. There were two relevant issues raised in question time today. One was a report by the Auditor-General into the government’s oversight of the Job Network services. That report showed that, under these arrangements, there is a very substantial failure of Job Network providers to meet their contractual obligations. These are services for which the government is paying, for which taxpayers are paying. Because of the cumbersome and inefficient management system that this government is presiding over, we are seeing taxpayers paying for services that job seekers are not obtaining.
I will say at the outset that I am not critical of all Job Network providers in this. The vast majority of Job Network providers do a good job. The vast majority of them try and do the right thing by the people who they are supposed to provide services to. They are lumbered with a system which has been described by the OECD as costly and cumbersome. They are lumbered with a system under this government which is more about form filling and getting up people’s star ratings than about delivering practical services on the ground. There is an important issue which was raised today, which the government has failed to answer, about ensuring that contracts which governments enter into are performed adequately and that the systems in place enable the contracted providers to provide the services efficiently and in accordance with the contractual obligations.
The Auditor-General has found, for example, that in relation to disadvantaged job seekers only 61 per cent of the contacts between the Job Network provider and the disadvantaged jobseeker that were supposed to be scheduled were actually scheduled. If you were in the private sector and you have a 61 per cent compliance rate, I think you would probably be out of business pretty early. But this government is presiding over a system where that is occurring. It is occurring for a range of reasons, most of which are associated with how cumbersome and inefficient the management of the Job Network is under this government. The assessment of job seekers’ needs—a very important aspect of ensuring that you can identify skills deficits, work out what training they need and where they need some additional assistance—was very limited and appeared not to meet all the contractual obligations that were required.
On top of this Auditor-General report, we then have the OECD report that was released this week. Not only did it describe the Job Network as costly and cumbersome, but it reported the fact that Job Network members report they spend 30 to 40 per cent of their time on tasks such as filling in forms simply to achieve a higher star rating. This is the Job Network that the government says is its primary vehicle for delivering employment services to sole parents, low-income partnered parents and disabled people entering the work force under their so-called Welfare to Work reforms. This is the Job Network that the government says is its primary delivery mechanism for services. This is where sole parents and people with a disability have to go. Finally, it is extraordinary that, given the requirements that will be placed on people with a disability—(Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-06-23,"—What we saw in question time today, reinforced in this debate by Senator Sherry, was a typical Labor tactic, and that is to attempt to assert that there is a problem where in fact none exists. Senator Sherry made the false postulation that there is a problem with Australia’s foreign debt. Even if for the sake of this exercise we accept that false proposition, what do we hear from Labor apart from that? Is there one possible solution suggested by Labor to the problem raised in that false proposition? Of course not. This simply reinforces that Labor is a policy-free zone. It has remained a policy-free zone now for more than nine years and it continues to be one. What that really reinforces is that in reality there is no problem at all as far as the level of foreign debt is concerned.
The fact is that, as Senator Brandis said a few moments ago, over the life of this government the massive debt for which the government has responsibility—that is, the government debt, government borrowings—has reduced from $96 billion to $23 billion currently, and by next year it will be down to $6 billion. That is a tremendous record on the part of the Howard government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who have implemented policies that will see that debt reduced by some $90 billion. It was the greatest level of government debt ever inherited by a government. Indeed, under Labor, it was the greatest government debt ever produced by a government, and it was inherited by this government. Over the life of this government it will soon have been reduced by some $90 billion, back to a more than sustainable level.
That is why, since this government came to office in 1996, on three occasions the Standard and Poor’s rating agency has upgraded Australia’s rating, so that it now stands at AAA, the highest rating that is applied by Standard and Poor’s to rate countries in terms of their credit situation. As I said, the rating has been upgraded three times since 1996 as a direct result of the policies of this government and the government’s success in reducing that massive inherited debt. That is in direct contrast to what happened under the Hawke-Keating Labor government when, between 1986 and 1989, Australia’s credit rating was downgraded three times, from the AAA that applied when Labor came to office down to AA-. The rating agency, in its report when it upgraded Australia’s credit rating, said:
Government finances are strong and the ratings on Australia remain underpinned by robust government finances which continue to strengthen.
That is the situation as far as that portion of debt for which the government has direct responsibility is concerned.
The foreign debt which is emerging of course is private sector debt—an area of debt which is not the government’s responsibility and over which it has no control. It is debt created by the decisions of private individuals as to their own spending and investing habits. What we need to recognise is that, even in that situation, the level of assets which Australian individuals hold compared with their level of debt is massive. For every dollar of debt in Australian households, they hold $2 of financial assets and more than $6 in total assets. So the level of debt is covered six times by the level of assets held by Australian households. That is because, under the sound policies of this government, the nominal wealth of households has increased by about 11 per cent for each and every year this government has been in office. That compares to growth of only six per cent—about half that rate—during the last eight years of the previous Labor government.
We now find ourselves in a situation where household net nominal wealth is $4.3 billion, more than double the level of about $1.74 billion when this government came to office. But do not rely on my words; hear what Professor Tony Makin, Professor of Economics at Griffith University and a man who well understands debt—he worked with the IMF in 2003-04—said:
… given the sizeable fiscal surplus at present, Australia’s current account deficit—
that is, level of debt—
is easily sustainable …
He also said:
… the high current account deficit remains the best measure of the extent to which foreigners are expressing confidence in the Australian economy.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I also seek to take note of answers by Senators Minchin and Abetz during question time today. It is important to note that the responses that we got from both those ministers to the questions asked in respect of foreign debt and in respect of skills training in this country were both tired and predictable—just like the arrogant Howard government itself. This is a government that has no economic plan for the future. It has no plan for an innovative industry policy. It has no industry policy. It does not have a strategy about developing Australia’s manufacturing base. It does not have a policy about promoting innovative manufacturing industries capable of competing in the global marketplace.
If you look at what has occurred since the transition from the Hawke-Keating years to the Howard years, you will see there has been a very significant decline in the export of elaborately transformed manufactures, from about 18 per cent to about 3.4 per cent. More worrying is that, on top of that, we are now starting to see the flow of manufacturing jobs out of this country to elsewhere around the globe. In fact, what the Howard government has managed to do is translate our industry strategy from one of exporting elaborately transformed manufactured goods to actually exporting manufacturing jobs—a terrific strategy indeed, a really innovative strategy from the Howard government!
It seems—and it is obvious from the two speeches we have heard from the other side—that the Treasurer has issued to every member of the government an economic cheat sheet of myopic facts and half-truths that can be trotted out to dull any criticism of their shoddy record. And what a record it is. They have been asleep at the wheel in terms of the Australian economy for the past nine years.
I want to deal with the issue of debt. We have heard Senator Chapman say, ‘Foreign debt is no longer an issue; we are dealing with it.’ We have heard Senator Minchin say, ‘We have to separate public debt from private debt; we have to distinguish between the two.’ I did not hear the Prime Minister or the Treasurer in 1995 arguing that there was a distinction between public debt and private debt. I did not see anything on the debt truck that said, ‘This half of the debt truck is public debt, that half is private debt and you only have to worry about the front half.’ It was all lumped in together. The argument by both John Howard and Peter Costello in 1995 was about the totality of our foreign debt and the impact that that was having on the Australian economy. What has happened to that foreign debt? It has grown to an extent where it is now $427.7 billion—$20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country.
At the same time, despite what Senator Chapman says, we have seen household savings slump to where they are now in the negative. We owe more money in this country per head of population than we are earning. That situation has escalated and grown under the Howard government’s management of the economy. We are also seeing Australian industry struggle to compete in the marketplace. Why? Because it cannot get the skilled workers that it requires to retain and build its productivity. That is why productivity is in decline. (Time expired)

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—by leave—I have two responses to returns to order and two statements to make. The first statement is on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Brown, as agreed by the Senate on 21 June 2005, and it relates to correspondence concerning deductible gift recipient status for environment groups. The minister wishes to inform the Senate that he considers this request to be an unwarranted diversion of resources away from the government’s key role of protecting the environment. The minister would like to inform the Senate that the routine process for assessing an application from an environment group for deductible gift recipient status requires input from the proponent and relevant ministers. Once a decision has been made, this is duly conveyed to the applicant in question.
The second statement again relates to an order of the Senate following a motion from Senator Brown. The order relates to correspondence between the Prime Minister, his office and his department, from July 2002 to the present, with Gunns Ltd regarding their proposal for a pulp mill in Tasmania. The Prime Minister takes seriously any request from the Senate for the production of documents that will assist in its role as a house of review. However, he is not prepared to divert the resources of his office to searching all office records for the preceding three years to identify any potentially relevant correspondence.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT GROUPS</title>,<title>Returns to Order</title>,MOTIONS,30,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-23,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement and the statement made earlier today.
This is a sign of things to come, Mr Deputy President. Here is the government refusing to give perfectly warranted material to the Senate—not to this senator but to the Senate. An order has been issued by the Senate for documents that relate, firstly, to deductible gift recipient status for environment groups and, amongst other things, correspondence between the Assistant Treasurer, the tax office and the Institute of Public Affairs, which has no doubt been gunning for environment groups. The correspondence involved and the pressure brought by the government in that should be transparent. It should be open. It should be debatable. It should not be something that the minister is ashamed of. It certainly should not be something that allows the minister in a fickle, offhand and quite rude fashion to say to the Senate, ‘I am not going to comply.’
Secondly, when it comes to the Prime Minister’s office, he was simply asked to release correspondence over the last three years between his office and Gunns which relates to a pulp mill. It is a very confined, very specific and much warranted request for information by the Senate, but the Prime Minister has turned it down. This is the government showing its hubris not just towards this house of review, which depends upon information to be able to review what the government is doing, but also towards the Australian public, who want this place to be informed, want this place to be able to dissect what the government is doing and know full well that that cannot be done in the absence of information being supplied by the government, as requested by the Senate.
Two requests via the Greens—but with the power of the Senate behind them—to the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage being turned down might be seen as a bit of political failure by the Prime Minister and the minister respectively. But, when one looks at the Notice Paper, one sees more than a dozen such requests for information on a whole range of issues covering a range of portfolios, from pretty well all parties involved, being ignored in that the government has not responded to them. If you look at page 27 of the Notice Paper, you will see orders for the production of documents still current from previous parliaments, going back to the start of this administration. There are 68 requests for information from this government that have been ignored.
This is a government that represses information, wants to keep the Australian people and their parliament in the dark and does not understand—or maybe it does understand—that the currency of democracy is information. It is so insecure about its ability to present itself in a robust debate that it has to hide information from the parliament and the people of Australia. This will catch up with the government. The absence of information does not make the progress of affairs under this government any better. It simply shows a government which has become arrogant and lost its regard for democracy and the parliament in this country.
The problem is that it is likely to do that even more so after 1 July. I think it is going to fall in a heap when it tries to do so. One of the things that is going to happen after 1 July with requests like this is that every single member of the government is going to be in the position to ensure that at least the request goes forward and to put pressure on the government to see it is complied with. Every single member of the Senate on the government side is going to be empowered in a way they have not been this last decade. Every single member of the government and the weakest member of the government can become the most powerful person in this place by simply taking a 10-metre walk across the floor.
If the government thinks that it can obfuscate in the Senate by turning down 68 warranted requests for information that would allow for a better debate and a better basis of judgment by the parliament and the Australian people when it gets a majority in this place—a rort of the first order—it ought to think again. Nevertheless, ultimately one must have faith in the people of Australia and, insofar as this government thumbs its nose at proper democratic forms and its right to keep informed the people who voted it in, it is headed for a downfall.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—I would be happy to do that. Often things we understand to be the case turn out not to be the case. You had recent experience of that when you rang my office asserting quite strongly that the government was delaying consideration of Mr Chen’s protection visa claim and that the interview should be held much sooner, purporting, by virtue of making the call, to know his circumstances and to know that he wanted it dealt with sooner.
I suppose it was a matter of some embarrassment for you to realise that Mr Chen was not in fact ready to do his interview that week through the people who were acting for him, which did not include you, and that you had, as I understand it, no authority to ring and purport to speak to the government as if you knew what he wanted. But as a consequence of your phone call, we checked with the people who were in fact acting for him and found that they did not want the interview that week; they wanted it postponed. So you might like to explain to the parliament how you came to that misunderstanding as to your own capacity to ring on Mr Chen’s behalf.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-23,"—Minister, I am so pleased you invited me to do so because it all comes down to an abject failure by you to carry out your responsibility with regard to a diplomat who had defected in this country. One would have thought, amongst many other things, including security analysis, that you would have ensured that a person in Mr Chen’s position would have had legal advice. But you did not. Instead, you or your officers were busy contacting the Chinese authorities without Mr Chen’s authority. It was therefore left to the Greens to do your job. The Greens, in your absence and because of your failure, set about getting Mr Chen legal advice.
In the wake of that legal advice, no doubt there was a request to take more time in the consideration, and I salute the advisers for that. But no thanks to you, Minister. Might I add, no thanks to you regarding the government’s failure to give asylum to Mr Chen. Your fellow minister the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, seems very frail indeed about putting in writing his turning down of at least two requests for asylum—that is, political or territorial asylum. At first he denied he had even had this, but he was again found wanting when the evidence was produced that he had had it in the clearest terms. So if you want to debate that issue—which I do not think is quite germane to the matter at hand—I would be very willing to do just that, but that would open up a whole array of failures by you and your government. I would counsel you to get back to Nauru.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1

Mr Chen has not been denied a protection visa. His claim is being considered. I note that Senator Brown declined my invitation to explain to the Senate why he rang my office with the air of agitation that he often has about him—I do not say he was in an agitated state; it is the air of agitation that he often has about him—alleging that Mr Chen should be interviewed very soon when in fact that was not the advice from the people who were properly appointed to represent Mr Chen.

—No. That is not the phone call I am talking about.
—That is the one I am talking about. I rang the minister’s office to urge that he get protection and asylum. The minister’s office informed me that it was not her responsibility; it was the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When I rang his office, it became vice versa. We had Spenlow and Jorkins at work. But the minister had done nothing. As I said earlier, it was left to the Greens to do the government’s job and get the legal advice, which led to the situation the minister is talking about. As I said earlier, I think the minister is in a whole realm of failed responsibility here and she would do well to get back to answering the questions I asked her about the security checking of people on Nauru or Christmas Island who have not had an answer to their request for visas.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—I want to go back to the answer that the minister gave in relation to TPVs. If I understood correctly, she was saying that people who make applications for permanent residency who are currently on TPVs will have that processed within three months. Is that a guarantee whenever a person who is on a TPV makes an application for permanent residency? If somebody is currently on a three-year temporary protection visa and they have got two years to go, my understanding is that they would not normally be able to apply for permanent residency until that had expired. When you were talking about people who have not put in applications yet but, if they did put in applications, they would be assessed within three months, is that only for people whose TPV has expired? If somebody had two years to go, could they put in an application now for permanent residency and have it dealt with in three months time, rather than having to wait for the two years to expire before they got that permanent residency decision?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—Let me see if I can help you by putting this in perspective. There are people whose TPV, temporary protection visa, has expired. They have put in applications, as they are entitled to do, to have their matter reconsidered to see if they can get either permanent protection or—in the case of some people who have been through other countries of primary protection and, incidentally, have been able to seek that protection; that is an important point to make—further temporary protection. The on-hand cases are expected to be completed by the end of October. There will be some people who have got current TPVs that have not yet expired and probably because of the time run of the visa are not yet in a position to make that subsequent application. When they make that subsequent application, the expectation is that that will be dealt with, in the primary instance, within three months and similarly by the RRT if they are unhappy with the primary decision.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1

You said there are some people whose TPV has not yet expired, and if they put in an application it will be dealt with in three months. I do not understand why you are saying there are some people in that instance who have their application for permanent residency dealt with in three months. Or do you mean that anyone who is on a TPV and puts in an application for permanent residency will have it dealt with in three months? You used the word ‘some’ and it seemed to be a qualifier.

Because of the agreement, we expect that protection visa claims—not permanent residence claims—would be dealt with in three months. One example that I can think of would be Mr Sisalem, who was the last man on Manus Island. I notice that his cat, which was apparently brought here by some charity group, has now ticked off. It would not be the only partnership that has broken up once they got where they wanted to be. The cat is just like everybody else, I suppose. Mr Sisalem has not had three years on his visa, so he is not yet in a position to make a further application.

(1)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (line 9), at the end of subsection 4AA(1), add “and that before a decision is taken to detain a minor, or to continue to hold a minor child in detention, the best interests of the minor must be taken into account and any alternatives to detention considered”.
This is an amendment to ensure that operations like those on Nauru do not exclude people from their rights to Australian law. That is effectively what it does. We have had that debate in this place before on the specific legislation that was designed to cut such people out of their access to Australian law, but I think that should be tested again. It is unfair and it denies refugee seekers their right under international law to be adequately heard in the country which has control of their destiny.
—I confirm that we are dealing with Greens amendment (1) on sheet 4619.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—This amendment deals with the issue of children in detention. As with all of the Australian Greens’ amendments, we are seeking at this committee stage of the debate to move amendments that have previously been put forward by the member for Kooyong, Mr Georgiou. We are moving those amendments that seek to give effect to his private member’s bill rather than moving amendments that represent the Australian Greens’ position on immigration detention. I moved a second reading amendment which outlined the Australian Greens’ policy on immigration detention, which is the abolition of mandatory detention, the ending of forced deportations, the closing of immigration detention centres in Australia and overseas, the abolition of temporary protection visas and returning to a system where people live in the community whilst their claims for asylum are assessed.
That amendment was not supported by the Senate, so now I am moving a series of amendments which all relate to the private member’s bills of Mr Georgiou. They are a series of amendments and a proposal seeking to bring more compassion and humanity to the treatment of asylum seekers. They have previously enjoyed the support of not only the Greens and the Democrats but, I understand, to some degree the Labor Party and also members of the Liberal-National coalition. That is the series of amendments that I will be moving on behalf of the Australian Greens. Our intention is to allow a debate in the parliament about Mr Georgiou’s bill and his position on the way mandatory detention should be oriented. I should say that it was his position before he reached an agreement with the Prime Minister last Friday. That is the intention and that is what this series of amendments does.
The first amendment relates to the section at the beginning of the act which says:
... the Parliament affirms as a principle that a minor child shall be detained only as a measure of last resort ...
We talked about this previously and the minister said that it was being put there not for a legal reason but to provide some comfort for people and the assurance that that was the position of the government. We know it is a position that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission called on the Australian government to take over a year ago. We have passed that deadline, but now we have seen the government move in this direction.
In the original bill that Mr Georgiou put forward, the sentence about only detaining a minor as a measure of last resort continued on. The continuation of that sentence was ‘and that before a decision is taken to detain a minor child, or to continue to hold a minor child in detention, the best interests of the minor child must be taken into account and any alternatives to detention considered’. This Australian Greens’ amendment inserts the second half of the sentence that Mr Georgiou had in his private member’s bill into this act that the government is putting forward. I cannot understand, if the government is accepting a position whereby they only detain people as a last resort—something that HREOC have been calling for them to do for a year—why they are not equally prepared to say that they will therefore ensure that they take the consideration of the children at the first instance to be the determining factor when making a decision about whether they should be detained or how they should be detained.
That is why we are moving it: Mr Georgiou put it forward and the second half of that sentence has been dropped off. I will be interested in hearing from the government as to whether this is an indication that they do not want to make decisions about detention on the basis of the child’s best interests. Does that create legal difficulties for them if they receive an opinion from an expert psychiatrist, for example, saying it is in the best interests of the child that they not be detained? Does that create difficulties for the government? Is that why the second half of the sentence has been dropped out? I do not understand why. We are moving it again to put it in there. If the government would like to explain why the second half of that sentence has been dropped off, it would be greatly enlightening for all of us.

(Senator Brandis)—Senator Nettle, it appears to us at the table that the next two Greens amendments are part of the same package of amendments. Would you like to move them as well as the amendment that is currently before the chair?
—I was going to move amendments (1) and (2) separately, then seek leave to move amendments (3) to (8) together and then move amendment (9) separately.
—You do not want to move the next two amendments cognately with the amendment currently before the chair, in other words.
—No, because this one relates to children and the next one relates to Nauru.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—That was a valiant attempt to try to get those together, and I applaud the chair for the effort. I will speak generally first. Senator Nettle, it seems to be your intention to move amendments which were part of Mr Georgiou’s private member’s bills in the other house and which then had different names. The bills never got to the House, as I understand it, though, and were not tabled there. The proper iteration of that is to say that they were draft proposals by Mr Georgiou that might or might not have been tabled in parliament, depending on what Mr Georgiou was intending to do. What eventually did happen was that Mr Georgiou and Mr Howard came up with an agreement, which is reflected in the bill that we have before us now.
In relation to the concepts that were included in the Georgiou bills—for want of a better name—the Labor Party has proposed a number of amendments to give effect to our position, a position that we think is better than both Georgiou and the government’s position on these issues. I think it is quite clearly known that getting all children out of detention and out from behind razor wire is one of the main issues that we have been pursuing for some time. Mr Laurie Ferguson, the shadow minister for immigration and the federal member for Reid, has been progressing issues such as removing all children from behind razor wire; establishing an independent inspector-general of detention centres to monitor conditions; requiring the Ombudsman to report on people detained for more than 90 days and on a monthly basis thereafter; guaranteeing independent medical and media access to detention centres; and giving certainty to TPV holders.
That is Labor’s effort in relation to this debate and in respect of our position on the Georgiou bills. We are seeking to bring about a more humane and just detention system, which is something this government seems to have swept under the carpet. On that basis, we say that our amendments, which I will not go into in detail now but which I foreshadow we will be moving in this debate, are a better position—with all due respect—than Mr Georgiou got to. His bills never actually got to the parliament in any event, because he was waylaid en route. He did not get to the position of progressing the bills that he had been waving about.
We prefer our position—and the amendments that we intend to move—to Mr Georgiou’s, which I understand is represented by the Greens amendments today. We are not in fact meeting the Greens amendments as such but are meeting Mr Georgiou’s amendments, which are being progressed by the Greens. The Greens are not suggesting, of course, that they are representing Mr Georgiou or presenting the amendments on his behalf, and I do not take that to be the position, but it seems a strange way of progressing in any event. Be that as it may, we are not going to support this amendment, on the basis that I have outlined.
The position we have adopted and the amendments we have are in principle much better than what is reflected in the amendment that we have before us. We support the principle that is contained in the Greens amendment we have before us, which is that we should ensure that children are not detained. Ours is a better iteration of the substantive issue. It is preferred. We think it is more concise and goes to the actual point itself. Therefore we will not be supporting this amendment that the Greens have put forward this evening.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—Just for the record: the Democrats are happy to support this amendment. I think there will be a few amendments coming forward over the course of this debate that are derived from what are being called the Georgiou bills. The Democrats’ view—as it has been on a whole range of legislation and amendments across a range of areas over many years—is that, if an amendment moves something in a better direction and gets it closer to what we believe is a desirable outcome, then we are likely to support it. Therefore we support this.
Without pre-empting debate on the Labor Party’s amendments relating to children, I think both of them are slightly problematic in a best case scenario in that the Democrats’ view is that the principles surrounding detention should be ones that move away from mandatory detention, ones that move away from the inherent problems of indefinite detention, tacking on special arrangements to soften the position for children and families. Aligning it to an existing regime that is fundamentally flawed is understandable and we support that, but I think the core point needs to be made—whether in this amendment or in future ones—that the Georgiou bills themselves were a compromise, in my view. It may even be the case—I cannot speak for Mr Georgiou—that he assessed them as not necessarily going as far as what he thought was ideal, but as far as what he thought would be reasonable for the government to accept. That is a bit of speculation on my part but, certainly from the Democrats’ point of view, the bills themselves were compromises. Obviously, the agreement that Mr Georgiou and his supporters chose to make with the Prime Minister was, again, a compromise on that compromise. It is still a step forward and therefore worthy of some plaudit, but it is still short of what needs to happen.
To avoid repeating myself throughout this debate, the Democrats will support amendments linked to the Georgiou bills, despite the fact that we believe the Georgiou bills themselves fell short of what is needed. Anything that moves us forward is desirable and this amendment does that. The real problem of setting up special arrangements probably goes more to Labor’s amendments regarding just children and families which, to some extent, is inherent in the subtext of the bill before us as well. It potentially creates a perception that detention is okay for adults but not for children. I know that is not what this amendment suggests. I do not seek to portray it that way, but prolonged detention is damaging to everybody and we need to re-emphasise that. The Democrats do not oppose immigration detention per se, as long as it is properly defined, has the rule of law surrounding it, is not long term and is not indefinite—unless there are clear health or security risks to the community. In relation to all such amendments that will come forward throughout the day, the Democrats are willing to support them.
I should emphasise, as I suspect is the position of some others in this chamber, that we are not wanting to put ourselves or the chamber in a position where we are being accused of stopping legislation passing and keeping people behind the razor wire. If the government refuses to accept these amendments in the other place then that would certainly inform our position, were the bill to come back here. But, as it is appropriate for the Senate to put forward improvements to legislation and ask the other chamber to consider them, in that context we would support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—On behalf of Senator Brown, I move Greens’ amendment (2) on sheet 4625:
(2)    Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 28), after item 5, insert:
5A  Subsection 5(1) (after paragraph (c) of the definition of migration zone)

Add:

         and (d)   any Australian-funded, controlled and operated detention, migration or refugee centre, whether operated by Commonwealth employees or on contract and wherever situated;
This amendment, again, relates to the immigration detention centre on Nauru and the intention, as with the previous amendment that Senator Brown moved, is to lead to the closure of the detention centre on Nauru. The last amendment sought to do it by focusing on a memorandum of understanding between the Australian government and the Nauruan government. This amendment seeks to do it by saying that
... any Australian-funded, controlled and operated detention, migration or refugee centre, whether operated by Commonwealth employees or on contract and wherever situated ...
but run by the Australian government would be subject to the requirements of the act, which clearly is not the case.
The detention centre is obviously in another country; it is not subject to our legislation or our Migration Act. This amendment says that where it is an Australian funded, controlled and operated immigration detention centre—so essentially an immigration detention centre being run on our behalf—it should be subject to the legislation. It is a different way of expressing our view that we do not support the immigration detention centre on Nauru. We believe that it should be shut down. This debate is somewhat similar to the one we had on the first amendment that Senator Brown moved; it is just another way of achieving the same outcome.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—The opposition does not support this amendment. The amendment seeks to add:
and (d) any Australian-funded, controlled and operated detention, migration or refugee centre, whether operated by Commonwealth employees or on contract and wherever situated.
It seemed to be the case that if the first amendment did not get up then this is another way of trying to achieve the same outcome. It appears, although I do not think they are quite that alternative in nature, in any event; they seem to do and can do different things. But Labor has indicated that, in terms of the excise of offshore processing, it is not a matter that we are going to revisit during this debate. There has been debate with respect to that issue and it has been determined that there is in the Migration Act 1958 the ability to have excise offshore processing. Therefore, we will not use the bill currently before us as a way of revisiting that issue. There is no doubt that, in terms of the Pacific solution, we have stated that it is the wrong solution and that it should end. It is certainly within the government’s purview to bring that situation to an end and to bring it to a conclusion as soon as possible.
In terms of this particular amendment, as I said, we are not going to reopen that issue in this bill. We do not know what was in the minds of Mr Howard or Mr Georgiou when they came up with their final solutions or whether there are any further agreements that might be pending or any further legislation that may be in the tube, so to speak, that might come down between Mr Howard and Mr Georgiou. We can only deal with what this amendment seeks to do in respect of the outcome of that particular negotiation, no matter how poor we think Mr Georgiou might have been in agreeing to so little in terms of where he started the debate. That matter in itself is a debate not for a committee stage, in any event, and we have made our position plain about those issues. Labor do not support this amendment for the reasons that I have articulated. (Quorum formed)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I understand Labor is not supporting this amendment, so this is probably academic, but I do wonder what sort of legal effect it would have given the amazing ability of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to interpret words in a particularly unique way. The principle behind the amendment is one the Democrats support very strongly. In effect, it is one the opposition has supported in supporting all of the remaining people on Nauru being brought to Australia, which is the subject of a motion which passed this chamber earlier this week.
But the amendment seeks to bring the operations of Australian funded and Australian controlled and operated migration centres—detention centres—under the scope of the Migration Act. There are potentially problematic aspects to it, I suppose, if you want to speculate on all the different ways it might apply but, obviously, we support it in the current context of Nauru. It is often not realised that the detention facility on Nauru is completely outside Australia’s law, despite the fact that it is funded at massive cost by the Australian taxpayer and has been for over 3½ years. Despite the fact that DIMIA officials are doing all of the assessments of people’s claims there, they are doing so outside the operations of the Migration Act.
Indeed, if you needed a clearer indication of this reality, I note the correspondence from the Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. I am a member of that committee and have been for quite some time. That committee expressed an interest in going to Nauru to see the facilities there and potentially meet some of the people detained there, and it wrote to the minister about that. One would think that would be a perfectly reasonable request—the committee was established to oversee migration issues and the operation of the Migration Act and to consider annual reports by the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.
The minister’s response firstly continued to insist that it is not a detention centre but a processing centre—that is another one of those lovely euphemisms we have. Secondly, her response said quite clearly that the committee reports on regulations made or proposed to be made to the Migration Act and the activities within the centre on Nauru do not fall within such boundaries. That is true: it does not fall within the Migration Act at all. As I said, it does involve DIMIA officers doing quite a lot of work on a lot of cases over a long period of time, assessing, reassessing and reconsidering.
All of that activity operates completely outside the Migration Act. That has been used as a reason by the minister to say that it is nothing to do with the parliament’s migration committee. In my view that is quite bizarre, because DIMIA’s annual report, and output 1.5 that we consider in estimates—from memory it is output 1.5, having sat through it so many times—deal specifically with Nauru and the department of immigration’s responsibility on Nauru. But all of that happens completely outside the framework of the Migration Act.
Regardless of what you think about all of the issues to do with this policy, I would suggest that that is not the best approach to regulating the activity of Commonwealth officers, because there is no regulation at all. It is completely ultra vires. It is outside the act, and therefore so are the actions, decisions and processes—everything that happens. There is no scope for people to respond to those administrative decisions through any form of process other than pleading back to the department, and that is what has been happening.
We have seen again in recent times a few more people get visas after people have resubmitted more information, made extra pleas and pointed out inconsistencies in earlier decisions. It should not have to take that. If there were any scope for independent or judicial review of those cases, or any scope for oversight of those cases outside of the department, those people who are being freed now after 3½ years would have been freed long ago, in my view. I think that is highly unsatisfactory. It is an example of why it is such a dangerous precedent and such a dangerous situation. It is perpetually to the shame of the Labor Party that they supported this set-up in the first place back in 2001, though they have now contracted their position back down to Christmas Island, which I suppose is an advance of sorts.
I really cannot pass up the opportunity to emphasise to people that we have a whole cell of activity conducted by Commonwealth officers, through a Commonwealth department, scrutinised by estimates and reported in an annual report of that department, which is completely outside our legal jurisdiction—so much so that the minister’s reply to the committee which one would think would have a special interest in this was, ‘It’s nothing to do with you guys because it’s nothing to do with the Migration Act.’ That is a ridiculous situation but that is what we are faced with. It is important to emphasise that each time.
As senators may know, I have visited Nauru and the processing or detention centre there three times over the years. I do not think a member of the government has done that even once since the early days of the facility when the former minister, Mr Ruddock, went there. I think that is an indictment in itself. When you are trying to find out what the status is of cases on Nauru, you once again fall into one of those magical Alice in Wonderland sorts of conversations that you have in this arena, where you can be told: ‘These people’s cases are not open. Nobody’s cases are open on Nauru. They have been assessed, reassessed and assessed again and have not succeeded. Their cases aren’t open.’ But then in the next breath you are told, ‘Their cases aren’t closed; they can always be looked at again if you give more information.’
People interested in some of the magical elasticity of language in this arena might care to consult the transcripts of the Senate estimates hearing of the evening of Thursday, 26 May—right near the end of that hearing—and read some of the extraordinary descriptions of the status of these people’s cases or non-cases or non-status that were tossed around. Whatever you think about this particular area of policy, border control and everything else, that is not a way to oversee the activities and decision making of Commonwealth officers. To just grab people and stick them outside in some legal shadow land is not a way to regulate immigration activities. The Democrats will continue to call at every opportunity for that situation to be ended not only to get the people there off the island, because they have suffered so much, but also to end the whole sad and sorry saga. It is a particularly appalling precedent and, every day that it is allowed to operated—at a continuing large expense—the longer that precedent survives.
The number of asylum seekers left on Nauru is, I think, down in the thirties now and the number of employed staff through the facility run by IOM is in triple figures. When I was there last I was told that there were about 80 local people employed and international officers from OIM put it over the 100 mark. That is a hell of a lot of money to spend to look after a small number of people. The only reason that we are keeping those people out of here is to keep them outside any legal rights, and I think that is a pretty sad state of affairs. We strongly opposed the decision at the time and we will keep opposing it. One day this situation will end—and the sooner the better. This Greens amendment will not make it happen. It might if it were passed and became law, but it is not going to. We support it anyway because of the reasons that I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—I want to respond briefly. This bill is not about Nauru. Nauru is another country. The people who are there do not have legal rights in Australia. So, by virtue of them being there, it is not correct to say that they are denied the legal rights that they have. They did not get here, so they do not have them. If they had got to Australian soil they would have them, but they did not. That is the whole point. It is not the case that people who are roaming on the high seas are entitled to nominate the country that hears their protection claim or, for that matter, to nominate where the protection will be offered.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-23,"—I will not go right over this debate again, but one cannot allow that to stand. As the minister knows, these people were picked up under Australian government direction and, despite their wish to come to Australia, were directed to another country where this camp, which denied them their legal rights under international law, was established. This Greens amendment is to correct the government’s abrogation of its obligation to the folk who are in detention on Nauru by the artifice of the Howard government.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—I move Greens amendment (2) on sheet 4619:
(2)    Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 3), after item 6, insert:
6A  At the end of section 36
Add:
Protection visa to permit holder to remain in Australia permanently
         (8)    A visa issued under this section shall permit the holder to remain in Australia permanently, despite any other provisions of this Act or of the regulations.
This amendment seeks to abolish temporary protection visas. We have already had some discussion today about temporary protection visas and the way in which they are discriminatory and limit access to particular services within the community for people who have been found to be genuine refugees.
Concerns have been raised by groups such as the Refugee Council about the way in which the temporary protection visas that exist in Australia do not comply with our treaty obligations under the 1951 refugee convention. They highlight a number of sections in that refugee convention. One of those sections is article 31, which reads:
The contracting States—
including Australia—
shall not impose penalties on account of their illegal entry ... on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ...
People who access temporary protection visas and who have come to Australia unlawfully but are found to be genuine refugees are given a legally sanctioned form of discrimination in which they access a form of visa that gives them less access to services and entitlements than a refugee who has come here by other means—not by unlawful means—has had their claim for asylum assessed and has also been found to be a genuine refugee. That is one of the concerns raised by the Refugee Council about the way in which our international obligations are not being met by these temporary protection visas. Another part of the refugee convention that the Refugee Council point to is article 28, which requires contracting states such as Australia to ‘issue to refugees lawfully staying in their territory travel documents for the purpose of travel outside their territory’.
People on temporary protection visas are not able, as it currently stands, to get travel documents to travel outside Australia. That is a concern raised by the Refugee Council about another part of the convention, article 28. They believe—and it seems so to me, simply by reading it—that our temporary protection visas mean we do not meet those obligations. The council raise another area of concern: the requirement that refugees undergo periodic re-examination of their status as refugees is contrary to international practice and to the spirit of the convention. The Refugee Council have pointed out those three ways in which they believe we are failing to meet our international obligations under the refugee convention.
As we know from people who deal with refugee advocates, temporary protection visas also put a tremendous amount of pressure on advocates in the community who are supporting people on temporary protection visas. Those refugees are not able to access services, such as English language services or whatever service it may be. A tremendous amount of pressure is put on people who are providing refugees with the support that the Greens and others believe the government should be providing them. They have been found to be genuine refugees. We think they should have access to entitlements and services that enable them to be a part of the community. When they are not, it puts tremendous pressure on people who are supporting them and providing them with those services, including access to English language services.
Several years ago I worked in a centre that provided free English classes for people, but it was not allowed to provide them for people who were temporary protection visa holders. As workers in that particular community centre wanted to provide free English classes for people with temporary protection visas, it had to be done at a different time. It could not be done under the entitlements that we had to provide those English language classes because it was outside the sorts of services that holders of temporary protection visas were able to access.
Another issue about temporary protection visas is that, by their very nature, they are temporary, which means they do not provide any certainty for people who have been assessed to be genuine refugees—to know that they can rebuild their lives, start to develop long-term relationships, put down roots in the community and become responsible civic members of their community because they are going to be there for a long time. They cannot do that with the uncertainty of a three-year temporary protection visa. Studies have been done about the mental health implications of temporary protection visas where that lack of certainty exists. One study that I am aware of was carried out by Greg Marston from the Centre for Applied Social Research at RMIT, entitled Temporary protection—permanent uncertainty: the experience of refugees living on temporary protection visas. Social researchers, psychiatrists and other health individuals have looked at a number of studies of the ongoing uncertainty for people on temporary protection visas.
There were comments earlier about part of the agreement being that the government had agreed to assess people’s claims for protection visas—for people who are on temporary protection visas—within a limited period of time. That strikes me as an acknowledgment that there are difficulties in the uncertainty provided by the temporary protection regime and that the government have sought to reach some compromise to ameliorate the concerns of members of their own party and people in the community about that uncertainty. I would be interested to know whether the government see it that way—as an acknowledgment of the difficulties that exist for people who are on temporary protection visas. The minister indicated that, whilst the government have given commitments about the period of time in which they would assess people who are on TPVs and are then seeking other forms of protection visas to be assessed within a period of three months, it is not in the legislation.
For all those reasons, the Australian Greens do not support temporary protection visas. Clearly, that was the position of Mr Georgiou in drawing up the private member’s bill. That is where the amendment comes from. It is an amendment that the Greens support and it is clearly supported by the writers of the private member’s bill, so I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—In summary, with respect to the amendment moved by Senator Nettle, the government’s position provides no certainty. That is how I understand the bill before us. The Georgiou bill—if I may use that terrible expression—seems to say no to the idea of TPVs. Labor has a position which we will seek to explain later. I will not go to the detail of it but I foreshadow that we will move an amendment. It provides a clear-cut position. Therefore, Labor is not going to support the amendment that the Greens have moved. It attempts to abolish the use of TPVs. Labor understands that the use of TPVs in certain circumstances can be beneficial, but there are a number of provisos—not with what this government is going to do with them, though. The Labor Party says that in the way that you deal with those visas, you can also fashion certainty and ensure that they are a useful device for certain categories.
Labor’s amendment in relation to the TPVs, which we will debate later, would allow those applicants with short-term needs to be granted a TPV. For those with long-term needs, where protection is no longer required, Labor would offer better alternatives, as we have indicated, such as permanent residency. The Labor amendment provides certainty. I will not go to the detail of that now, but it would provide certainty to the detainees and fairness to the system. Of course, that does not rule out the issue of where Labor would allow TPV holders to access settlement services, including English language training and the Job Network. Determining what their needs might be really depends on the circumstances of the TPV holder in that instance—the circumstances of the person and their family, their position and how they arrived in this country.
Saying there should be no TPV does not provide the range of mechanisms that might be available to ensure that fairness and equity are provided and that, in those cases, people can be treated, in respect of their circumstances, in the way that they may wish to be treated. Therefore, the Labor Party is not minded to support the amendment moved by the Greens. Of course, as I said, one of the other issues is that there are circumstances where the type of outcome granted will really go to what is presented. We have to keep that in mind. However, I think the Greens have got the government’s position right, and I can agree that it is clear that the government does not provide any certainty.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I need to put the Democrats’ position on the record. This is one amendment that we very strongly support. The introduction of temporary protection visas is another major blight on this chamber. Frankly, it is a major blight on the Labor Party, and it is astonishing that they still have not figured out that they should reverse that position. The Democrats, via me, moved to prevent the introduction of these visas on 24 November 1999. I think it is fair to say that most of the things that we predicted were wrong with them and the problems they would cause have been shown to have come to pass. It is an important issue. It clearly will not get up this time. I guess Labor’s current policy is slightly better than the existing law, but the fact is that temporary visas are iniquitous for a refugee.
People have been mentioning those who have recently arrived from Nauru. After all that time on Nauru, they get here, which is great, but they have a temporary visa and, after all the trauma they have been through, with the added extra trauma for many of them, they have to spend more years wondering what their future holds. One of the men who arrived here from Nauru just a few weeks ago is married with children but has not seen them since 2001 and will not be able to see them for at least another three years. In my view, there is no justification for that.
I take the opportunity to briefly outline the history of this. Temporary protection visas were initially a One Nation policy, released in mid-1998, that argued that refugees should only be given temporary protection. At that time, the then immigration minister, Minister Ruddock, responded: ‘Can you imagine what temporary entry would mean for them? It would mean that people would never know whether they would be able to remain here. There would be uncertainty, particularly in terms of learning English, in addressing the torture and trauma so they healed from some of the tremendous physical and psychological wounds they have suffered. So I regard One Nation’s approach as being highly unconscionable.’ Former health minister Michael Wooldridge, in a speech he made launching a GP’s manual on refugee health, said that this policy created ‘uncertainty and insecurity’ and it ‘is one of the most dangerous ways to add to the harm’. He said:
We must not and will not turn our backs on those who come here for refuge.
I do not use those quotes to try and score political points. I use them to highlight what was blatantly obvious until we got these extraordinary blinkers put on. It is one of those examples of the emperor’s new clothes phenomenon that seems to inhabit this area—people seem to be capable of blinding themselves to immense suffering that is a direct consequence of this measure. All of those problems and more are a direct consequence of it. Until it is removed from our laws, it will continue to cause immense suffering. As Senator Harradine, who we have all been praising this week, said in the disallowance debate to the motion I moved in 1999, ‘The worst aspect from a supposedly pro-family government is how it quite deliberately splinters families.’ That in itself adds enormously to the stress of people.
Think back to how long ago the Tampa and that election was. These people have still not been able to move on from the trauma they experienced and fled from way before that time. It seems like a different world to us—pre 2001, pre September 11, pre-Tampa—but they have not been able to move on from that different world, because their direct connection with that trauma is still there and is unable to be resolved, and temporary protection visas play a key part in that. That is why it is so offensive to the Democrats. To require people to re-prove their refugee status is very iniquitous. It is also, I might add, extraordinarily inefficient administratively. This is a policy that damages Australia.
Putting the damage to refugees to one side for a minute, there are people here in the community—and we have seen that the vast percentage of them have stayed after they have received further protection visas—who have suffered trauma and the deliberate denial of access to services, such as English language classes and family reunion. These services have been denied to people who are going to be part of the Australian community anyway. Why would you do that? As this minister quite rightly points out from time to time, we have actually done a good job in assisting refugee settlement—better than many other countries in the world—because we recognise that it is in our interests, once people are in the community, to help them settle. Why the hell would you make it harder for them? Because it sends a message or something?
It is such a counterproductive policy on so many fronts. There is the extra administration of having to reassess thousands of visas again. Consider all of the numbers that went up through the Refugee Review Tribunal with very large overturn percentages in some categories. It is so inefficient. It is so much trauma. There is all of the extra hassle for the minister and her staff. I would have thought she would have liked to have less of a burden and workload in this area. Think about all of the advocates who have to spend their time hassling the minister and the government about all the individual cases. We all know how much time and energy that takes up—it is so inefficient.
The main impact that it had was to dramatically increase the number of women and children who came here by boat as well. Now the circumstances have changed and that is a good thing. There is a whole range of reasons for that and we have different views in this chamber about why they have changed. But I do not see any evidence that the temporary protection visa is part of those reasons. People still kept coming; the only difference was the women and children came in much larger numbers, which was why so many women and children drowned on the SIEVX when it sank.
There are other factors that have led to them stopping. Some of the factors I support, some of them I do not. The simple reality is that temporary protection visas generate extraordinary suffering to people who have already suffered a lot. They are very inefficient in an administrative sense. My view is that they are bad law on a whole range of fronts. It is important for us to take the opportunity in this debate to make those points. This is probably one of the more critical amendments to try and keep pursuing. It will not get up this time around but it is a reminder as much to the Labor Party as it is to the government.
The government has moved in response to public pressure. I have found in talking to people around the country that, more and more, they have identified temporary protection visas as an unjust aspect of the system that is causing unnecessary suffering. It is an area where I would encourage people to keep the pressure up. We have seen the government shift in response to public pressure, and that is good. It is good that the government is listening and it is good that it is moving. We are going to keep the pressure up from the Democrats side of things and encourage people in the community to do so too because they have obviously got work to do on the Labor Party as well. That job will probably take a while longer, I might say. It is a job where people should not lose energy until this is expunged from our laws.
This is one example that I often cite of a policy that was specifically and consciously designed to generate suffering. To do that towards people who have already suffered so much makes it particularly appalling. It is one issue that I signal that we will continue to push strongly on. I encourage the public and those within the various parties here to do so too. This was originally a position of Mr Georgiou’s and I am sure that he would still like to move to that position eventually. I am sure there are others in his party who would think that way. I know that there are others in the Labor Party who think that way. The Democrats and the Greens think that way. Brian Harradine thinks that way and there are many in the community who think that way. So people need to keep pushing for it. They should not feel that the debate is over now, because until the injustices that are inherent in the law are removed then inevitably the injustices that it inflicts on people will continue.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—Firstly, I am very proud—as is every member of this government—to be a part of a government that has taken every possible step to ensure that the boats do not continue to come. In particular we want to ensure that boats like the SIEVX do not continue to come so that people do not lose their lives. That was just one of the consequences of leaving things as they were and allowing the boats to continue to come.
Secondly, we are very proud to be part of a government that has consistently, certainly since we have been in government, been in the top three countries that offer resettlement to people most in need. I believe this was the case under previous Labor governments as well but I have not checked. If we want to talk in the compassion stakes about where my heart lies first, it is with people in refugee camps who do not have running water or power. I will always take every step I can to give them preference over people who have enough money to pay a crim, spivvy people smuggler. I am very proud to be part of a government that does that.
Thirdly, the UNHCR is not of the view that people who have to flee their homeland for whatever terrible reason are best to leave and stay away forever. Amongst people who are genuinely interested in refugee issues, as opposed to using them for political point scoring—I do not include you in this category, Senator Bartlett; I understand that you have a longstanding committed view with respect to these temporary visas—the primary aim is to settle whatever hazard there is so that people who have had to flee can go back. That is the primary aim: that people can restore their lives as they were and, if they cannot restore their own lives, they can at least contribute to restoring a portion of their country, or their whole country, if that is at risk. So, bearing that in mind, I do not see a problem in offering people protection for as long as they require it. That is Australia’s position. Anyone here who needs protection will get it. If they need continuing protection they will continue to get it, but we will continue to offer permanent visas to those people who come from offshore lawfully and are stuck in refugee camps. We will always give them priority.
The business of government is not easy. I remember being in opposition, thinking getting into government was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. I think I still do think that, but it was not quite the sort of sliced bread that I might order. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said at one of our conferences once that education teaches but responsibility educates. There are frequently decisions to be made that are not easy. Government is not about saying: ‘Here are three easy choices. Which one would you like? Here’s the lucky dip; you’ll always get a prize.’ It is frequently about choosing to give priority to competing principles, when you would really like to have both but the circumstances will not allow you to give equal weight to them. You are forced to make a choice. Or you are forced to make a choice between policy alternatives, and you do not want either of them but you have to have one. Or you are forced to choose between alternatives when you want both of them but you cannot have both.
Government is not about the luxury of writing on a whiteboard what is the ideal world; Mrs Ros Kelly’s sports rorts put aside. It is not about the luxury of sitting in academia and saying, ‘What would be ideal?’ It is about what must be done in the national interest at this time and what is fair. Senator Nettle, I understand that you have this longstanding view. I would not even call it a begrudging admiration that you continue to raise it, provided that you accept that other people have, legitimately and fairly, a different view. I have that and this government has that.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—The minister was speaking about giving permanent protection to people who come via offshore processing and temporary protection visas to people who come via other means, who come unlawfully. Does the minister believe that Australia is complying with its obligations under the refugee convention, which talks about not discriminating against people—in relation to the kinds of protection visas they get—on the basis of the way in which they have arrived; for example, if they have arrived illegally? I raised before the concerns that the Refugee Council has. Does the minister want to inform the Senate of whether the government shares those concerns in relation to our obligations under the convention? I also asked previously about the changes that the government has made to temporary protection visas. To me, they—and the commitment to make assessments within three months—seem to be an acknowledgement of the uncertainty that is provided for people on temporary protection visas. Am I correct in making that assumption?

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 4623:
(1)    Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 19), after item 9, insert:
9A  After section 194
Insert:
194A  Independent medical access etc.
                  The Secretary must ensure that independent medical professionals and media representatives have access to a person detained under section 189 or 196.
This Labor amendment guarantees independent medical and media access. It will allow independent medical assessment and treatment for detainees by giving medical professionals access to detention centres, and it will allow media access. Unfortunately, the government’s claims that they provide a fair and humane mandatory detention system do not extend to the health of detainees. That has certainly been evidenced by the treatment by Ms Solon and Cornelia Rau. It may also be evident in other cases which have not yet come to light.
The government’s Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 does not address the need for independent medical professionals to access detention centres. This omission is a clear illustration of this government’s lack of commitment to preventing further cases like the Rau case. When a government detains a person, for whatever reason, whether that detention is just or unjust, the government becomes responsible for that person’s health and wellbeing. There is no argument about that; that seems clear. Even murderers and other people in prisons have a right to adequate health care. Independent medical access will allow medical professionals to assess and recommend treatment for detainees. A number of detainees have had seriously mental health issues and it seems that provisions relating to independent medical assessment will ensure better monitoring of health, psychiatric services and better treatment.
We have all heard some of the sadder stories about children in particular in need of psychiatric care or other types of counselling. We have heard stories of abuse that have not been investigated. I am sure many here would have referred to the HREOC report dealing with cases of children in detention. From reading some of the stories that are contained within that, and its recommendations, it is clear that some of the most shocking things that you could imagine have gone on. The case of Cornelia Rau brought that to the public’s attention. It shocked the Australian public. We must deal with the underlying faults in the system which caused that person to be locked up. We must also ensure that people who are detained have access to decent health care, because it is in fact a right all Australians enjoy—although it seems to be a right that has not been extended to detainees in every instance. It is a basic right; it is not a privilege that should be granted to detainees only if the government wants to provide it.
Currently, the parliament must order the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to allow detainees access to independent medical professionals. It is clear that the physical and mental health of detainees has been neglected. That is what the Palmer report, if it ever sees the light of day, will demonstrate, I am sure. Whether the government will act on it is another issue altogether. But detainees must have the right of access to independent medical professionals as soon as they need it, not when the government thinks that they need it and not after the approval of a bureaucrat. Bureaucrats are not doctors; nor are they psychiatric assessors.
This amendment will also allow media access. The current policy of treating detention centres as though they are some kind of prison camp to which people are sentenced without right of communication must end. People in detention centres are not criminals. They are unlawful noncitizens being detained by the Australian government. That is their status. They have the right to be able to speak and associate within the limits which the government sets in terms of their status as unlawful noncitizens. But those limits should not extend to the denial of the right to communicate. Media scrutiny and detainee access to the media are independent safeguards against the various abuses that have been unveiled. As every bureaucrat knows, the media being there is akin to someone ensuring that you treat people well. If you hide things away and allow no scrutiny and no independent check, then you can never be sure that people will not abuse the process.
The media are not always going to be in those places. But the ability to ensure access and the thought that the media can have access acts as a terrific deterrent and ensures that people do behave within reasonable bounds. I think that has been demonstrated across the board in a range of areas, not only in this one. It is also the case that, by involving the media in these issues, whilst one cannot say that what happened to Vivian Solon, Cornelia Rau and those 200 other cases would not have happened, the bureaucracy and the media have the ability to ensure—and do their very best to ensure—that those issues are exposed. If they can be prevented then this is one more way of ensuring that prevention can occur. I put that to the government and seek support from the minor parties.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—I will respond briefly. I understand what Senator Ludwig is saying but I do not agree, for the following reason. In effect, the way the amendment is drafted, I am advised, really makes detainees objects. There is no requirement that a detainee ask to see anybody, whether it is the media or medical staff. The requirement is only that those people have access. What is to stop any TV station or radio station saying, ‘I want access as per the act,’ then marching in and filming people who are going about their daily lives? Despite the fact that they are in immigration detention, they are still, in my view, entitled to a degree of privacy. The amendment as drafted at the moment overrides the right of detainees to decide what is appropriate for them.
It is not just that alone. Let me go to the point about who might then want to take advantage of this. I can assure the Senate that there are times when members of various groups such as Circle of Friends and others—and I am confident they believe they are doing the right thing—get an email message telling them to ring the minister’s office that day and say a particular thing about somebody. A good number of these people have never met the person. They are just part of a campaign. That is a perfectly legitimate exercise for people to engage in, but it takes an enormous amount of time. This amendment gives potential for people who do not have a specific interest in individual people to just show up and turn immigration facilities into something that I do not think any of us would want them to be.
As to the media, there have been times when, in my view, the department has perhaps been a bit harsh in terms of exclusion. That is why I have arranged for a number of opportunities for the media to visit. Certainly they had a visit to the residential housing project. I think Mr Skelton was refused access. I will let him speak about the circumstances in which that happened, but it is my understanding that he did not indicate that he was there at that time for the purposes of an interview and he did in fact conduct an interview. These people are not social museums or political opportunities for people to take advantage of. Nonetheless, even if Mr Skelton did make that mistake—that is my understanding of what he told me and he will obviously have something to say if I have got that wrong—for one reason or another, anyway, he was deprived of access to Baxter. He approached me, I said that that was not my view and he was given access to look around.
It does not matter who you go to in the gallery, they do not always get it right. I think of Mr Skelton’s recent article asserting, as it is so easy to do from under the cloak of anonymity, that he had been told that Mr Palmer had approached the government twice with two quite serious matters. I would have thought one of them, at least, was quite a serious matter of concern. The first matter was that he was not getting cooperation from the department. That is the serious one. The second matter was that someone in the department said that the inquiry would only take three weeks. That is a bit less serious because, frankly, what someone in the department thinks about how long it will take is almost irrelevant. Neither of those conversations took place. This is confirmed not only by me but also by Mr Palmer. Yet someone reading the Age would believe that to be the case.
I believe we need an independent and free media, but I do not believe that we should put our trust in them. They get it wrong as everyone else occasionally gets it wrong. I do not see them as the great protectors, always, of our freedom. In fact, I think that bad reporting damages the parliamentary system and the parliamentary system is in fact what protects our freedom.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—The minister has been helpful in talking at least about media access, but the amendment went a bit broader—it went to medical access as well. I am sure she intended to answer that as well in her reply. I think she raised the question of providing a filter in the process because unlimited medical or media access might be unwarranted and might create a system where busybodies can come in. The amendment goes to the media as the people who are controlled.
The other question, in terms of asking for permission, is who would grant that permission. I see we are going to have a bit of a challenge on our hands in respect of this issue. Who would grant that permission and at what level would the bureaucracy grant that permission? Would it be the minister herself who would be the filter in that process? I will go through that again so that the advisers can understand that question. She might want to come back to it. There is also the issue of responding to the medical part of the question in the motion that we have moved. The minister has responded only on the media issue. In the answer she gave, she indicated that, in the government’s view, it would not be a question of condoning access on any basis; there should be some filter, such as someone to grant the permission.
Our response to that would be: who would be the person who would give permission? At what level would they get permission? In other words: at what bureaucratic level would the person be who would provide that filter? We do not want—and this is clear—to have a situation where all that happens is that another filter is put in that filters out everybody except those favourites that are wanted in certain circumstances and in only certain places, because if that were the case we would just be right back around to where we started.
The Labor Party is not pursuing a situation where busybodies could pursue issues on behalf of a person. Busybodies might want to come in and visit detention centres; that is not what this is about. This is about ensuring detainees have access to services for their medical needs and that the media have access as well. Both of those issues go (1) to their health and wellbeing and (2) to ensuring that there is no ability to hide behind the detention facilities or to hide people in those facilities away from public scrutiny and examination of how this bureaucracy has treated those individuals.
Again, I will mention that HREOC report. It highlights where adequate media involvement would have, in my view, gone a long way to preventing some of the issues that arose in that report. It also would ensure that the media have, as they do in this country, access to most places. They can request permission and they can seek and pursue issues—that is the ability of the media to ensure that they have available those people that they wish to interview or talk to. The media have credentials and they can identify where they are from—which newspaper they represent or which television station they are acting on behalf of. Those matters can be dealt with and that is what the substance of this amendment goes to.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I will just put on the record that I think the minister made some reasonable points in her contribution.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—by leave—I move Labor Party amendments (2), (4), (7), (8), (17) and (18) on sheet 4623.
(2)    Schedule 1, item 10, page 5 (line 26), after “189”, insert “or 196”.
(4)    Schedule 1, item 11, page 7 (line 9), after “189”, insert “or 196”.
(7)    Schedule 1, item 11, page 7 (line 28), after “189”, insert “or 196”.
(8)    Schedule 1, item 11, page 8 (line 2), after “189”, insert “or 196”.
(17)  Schedule 1, item 20, page 15 (line 5), after “189”, insert “or 196”.
(18)  Schedule 1, item 20, page 15 (line 10), after “189”, insert “or 196”.
These are additional amendments that were not moved by the Labor Party in the House. They came up only as late matters that were pointed out to us. They are reflected, I think, in the Bills Digest on this migration bill. The amendments seek to correct apparent omissions in sections 195A(1), 197AA, 197AC(1) and items 20 and 21, if anyone is following those numbers. These refer to all persons in detention under section 189 of the Migration Act. While section 189 of the Migration Act authorises the initial detention it is in effect section 196 that provides for continuing detention—that is, an unlawful noncitizen detained under section 189 must be kept in detention until he or she is removed, deported or granted a visa. Under section 189, the initial detention is authorised; in other words, the department can detain. But the ongoing detention is authorised under section 196. In other words, it establishes the lawfulness of a person being kept in detention until one of three things happen: they are removed, deported or granted a visa. They are the three conditions which operate under section 196 for determination of the status of the unlawful noncitizen. So the initial detaining power, as I have said, is granted under section 189 and the duration of that detention is determined by section 196. It is clear then that the length of the detention is a condition which is operated on by section 196; in other words, it is shorter or longer depending on when you are removed, deported or granted a visa. ‘Duration of detention’ of course is the heading of that provision.
The Labor Party is concerned that if you took a narrow view of this section—and this seems to be the view of the Bills Digest as well—the new provision in the bill to allow the minister to grant visas or make residence determinations may be ineffective. I am not going to comment on what the High Court may or may not do, but they may very well take a narrow view, as has been their wont of late. It would mean that the new provisions in the bill before us today do not deal with section 196. Strictly speaking, people in ongoing detention are in detention under section 196, so a provision that applies to people in detention under section 189 may have no application for them. The argument is that the current bill goes to section 189, but that relates only to the point of detention. The point of continuing detention—in other words, to keep a person in detention—comes under section 196, which the detention bill currently before us does not go to. It might be a technical amendment, and I am sure the advisers have a short answer to this and that I can move on to another point, but, just in case, if this bill is going to work effectively, it would seem that it would have to address section 196, which is the continuation of the detention provision. Without that, you end up with a provision which only operates on the part of detention under section 189.
Part of the argument in the Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) HCA 37 High Court case was about whether section 196 authorises indefinite detention. At the very best, the government could argue that the case held that a combination of sections 189 and 196 authorises ongoing detention. It seems to be the best argument that could be run with regard to that. At any rate, the current detention bill does not address section 196; it only addresses the point of detention, or section 189. It seems to be that, to accurately reflect the stated policy position of the government and the advice given to it in the explanatory memorandum, the bill needs to refer not only to section 189 but also to section 196. That seems to be the position. It may be a belt and braces approach. I am confident that I can be told that I am wrong in my view about that, but I will wait for the government’s advice.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2005-06-23,"—The government’s view is that this amendment is not necessary. Section 196 refers to detention under section 189 and describes the process for the end of detention, not necessarily the process for detention, so it is the government’s view that this amendment is superfluous.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I am sorry, I missed that argument. Why do you say it is superfluous? That is what I cannot quite understand. You say that section 189 is the power of detention, but section 196 is the continuation of that detention, which then allows three operants to work. If you do not include section 196, how does the relationship between section 189 and section 196 operate? I did not quite get the answer.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2005-06-23,"—As I said, section 196 refers to detention under section 189, so section 196 refers to the process for the end of detention. Detainees are detained under section 189, not section 196.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I see the argument, but that is the argument I am putting in the reverse. Section 186 of the Migration Act states:
(1) If an officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone (other than an excised offshore place) is an unlawful non-citizen, the officer must detain the person.
(2) If an officer reasonably suspects that a person in Australia but outside the migration zone:
                  …         …           …
(b) would, if in the migration zone, be an unlawful non-citizen;
the officer must detain the person.
Subsection (5) then refers to subsection (3) and (4). In other words, that is the power to detain unlawful non-citizens. That is where an officer makes the original determination, but it does not mean that they can continue to detain and it does not indicate how detainees will cease to be unlawful noncitizens in detention. Section 196 talks about the duration of detention, so they are separate provisions; they are not the same provision.
The provisions only refer back to the sections under which they are detained. They are not sections that can be read together; they are separate. One has the power to detain and the other one has the power to detain until certain circumstances are met—in other words, it is the continuation of the detention. The section states that detainees must—and ‘must’ is the operative word—be kept in immigration detention until he or she is removed, deported or granted a visa. Once you have an unlawful noncitizen detained under section 189, if you operate on section 189, you have not got to the nub of the problem. The problem will exist in section 196 whereby, once you have detained, they must be kept in detention until you remove them, deport them or grant them a visa. No other conditions are provided for. If your non-compellable power only operates on section 189, a person can decide not to detain or to detain but, if a person is detained, it cannot operate; it can only operate under section 196, and you have not mentioned section 196. If you currently have a person in detention and the provision does not refer to the non-compellable power, how do you then make a determination to exercise that non-compellable, non-appealable power?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2005-06-23,"—The detainees are in detention under section 189. Section 196 deals with the circumstances of release, not detention. That is the argument the government makes. I think that we are essentially arguing different views on that particular issue, but section 196 deals with the circumstances of release, not the circumstances of detention.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1

We expect that you will not support it but we ask the Democrats and minors to support it. What we say to you is that you should have a look at it overnight, and get some counsel to have a look at that provision to see whether or not you have made a technical omission there—or at least ask counsel to say I am wrong about this. I am happy to be wrong if, in fact, I have missed the issue completely or have failed to understand how section 196 operates. If I am right about that, you can come back and say I am right about that—and give credit to the Bills Digest as well, perhaps even more than me.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I am not sure I want to get into the competing interpretations of this bill. I might be very regularly critical of the government’s policy and laws in this area, but I have a reasonably high regard for their officials in terms of their understanding of the law, much as I do not like it a lot of the time. But Senator Ludwig is not too bad at this stuff either so I hate to pick sides in such a jousting of interpretations. If the government’s view is that this amendment is merely redundant, then I cannot see much of a problem in supporting it, frankly. On that basis, and subject to reinterpretation by the government of the word ‘redundant’ to mean ‘will stuff the whole thing up’ as opposed to ‘just doesn’t really matter’, I am inclined to go with the opposition on this.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I move:
(3)    Schedule 1, item 10, page 6 (after line 7), after subsection 195A(4), insert:
Considerations to be taken into account in granting visas
      (4A)    In exercising the power under subsection (2), the Minister must have regard to whether a person has a need for temporary protection or for permanent protection.
       (4B)    If the Minister considers that a person has a need for temporary protection, the Minister may grant the person a visa for a period not exceeding two years. At the end of that period, unless the Secretary has presented evidence to the Minister that satisfies the Minister that the decision to grant a visa should be reversed, the Minister must grant a further visa permitting the person to remain in Australia indefinitely.
       (4C)    If the Minister considers that a person has a need for permanent protection, the Minister must grant the person a visa permitting the person to remain in Australia indefinitely.
      (4D)    If the Minister considers that a person does not have a need for permanent protection but considers that the person has made, and can continue to make, a long-term contribution to economic, social or community life, the Minister may grant a visa permitting the person to remain in Australia indefinitely.
This amendment gives certainty to temporary protection visa holders. This amendment aims to grant permanent protection to TPV holders who have been in the community for longer than two years if ongoing protection under the refugee convention is required. In those cases where it is determined that protection is no longer required, permanent residence will be offered to the TPV holder who passes a rigorous public interest test, where it is found that the person is the sort of person who Australia could otherwise select for a migration program.
The government bill speeds up the processing time for TPV holders. This is a welcome change and perhaps even a significant change for this government, given its history. However, the bill does not provide any certainty for TPV holders. People deserve to live their lives with some certainty. Labor finds it truly unacceptable to have human beings strung along for long periods of uncertainty associated with temporary protection visas. This is an issue that I raised previously during this debate in the committee stage, but I make the point again.
The amendment moved by Labor contains a better model for processing of visas for persons in detention. Our model removes the delays and potential unfairness involved in the use of the non-reviewable ministerial discretion by substituting an independent assessment for any compelling special humanitarian claim. The government’s proposed bill simply provides non-compellable power to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to grant a visa to a person in detention. The government’s changes keep the process in house, rely on catching the minister in a good mood, one would assume, and continue to avoid transparency and accountability.
I did not want to go to the Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters, but I think its report—and I am sure Senator Brandis is familiar with it—highlighted that the ongoing inability to ensure that there is transparency and accountability, as highlighted by the use of section 417, needs to be revisited. In this instance the government proposes a time frame for primary assessment, but the reality is that TPV holders will still be in limbo. That is clear; that is the situation you are still going to have. They will be unable to form long-term relationships or plan for their futures—or even the futures of their children. I urge the government to look at this amendment, look at the position they are going to put people in, and change their mind and accept it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,33,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I have given a copy of my speech on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 to the Government Whip. I intend to incorporate it, but I need to say a few words because I understand that there are some organisational procedures involved in getting Democrat senators et cetera.
 (Senator Brandis)—It is okay.
—I am told it is okay. In that case, I just need to make a few comments about the second reading amendment that I will be moving on behalf of the Labor opposition, but that obviously we are not voting on in this hour. The amendment reads:
At the end of the motion add:
         “but the Senate calls on the Government to within six months:
         (1)    report to the Senate, the long term revenue cost estimates of the mature tax offset until 2040; and
         (2)    undertake and publish econometric modelling of the labour market impact of the offset.”
With those comments, I seek leave to incorporate my speech on this legislation.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

Yet again those in this side of the Chamber find themselves in a position where we witness the Government having to correct its own mistakes. And this one is a spectacular error.
This bill TLAB 1 2005 and the next matter we are to consider TLAB 2 2005 both have major amendments made to them by the Government after the initial bills presented by the Minister were the object of scorn many in the sector.
But it comes as now surprise to us Mr Deputy President that this is occurring. As I keep saying to this chamber Minister Brough has form on this.
It is getting to the stage that those in the Opposition have begun to coin a phrase when referring to a major error: it’s not called a `stuff up’, we call it a “brough up”.
The Shadow Minister has captured the matter deftly in his media comment yesterday entitled: YET ANOTHER “BROUGH UP”.
And this is exactly what has occurred in schedule 3 of this bill.
Minister Brough has been forced to agree to Labor’s request to amend his own bill in the Senate after Labor identified significant problems with the bill.
Brough’s original bill was over-reaching in its attempts to apply GST to the supply of rights by foreign tour operators.
The bill would have had a major negative impact on inbound tourism.
Labor has supported measures to correct the anomaly that allows foreign tour operators to claim input tax credits without paying the GST. Now that the Government has heeded Labor’s call will support the amendments in the Senate.
However Labor remains concerned about the differential treatment of foreign tour operators and domestic tour operators. The Government needs to address this. I now call on the Minister to except that the differential treatment of these supplies by domestic and foreign tour operators is a taxation non-neutrality, and a negative tax expenditure.
This needs to be addressed and I now call on the Minister in this Chamber to put it to his colleague in the other place that this is a matter he needs to urgently address.
I will also note that the way in which the Minister has brought forward these major amendments without sufficient time for review represents a total contempt of the parliamentary process.
After 1 July when the Government controls the Senate they may seek to take the checks and balances away which have highlighted the inadequacies of this and previous bills.
If this flagrant abuse of process continues, taxpayers should expect a very “Brough” ride from this incompetent and arrogant Minister.
I might also say, that when the office of the Shadow Minister asked for Treasury brief on this bill the minister’s staff to truncate the briefing to my staff on the bill to 30 minutes . Its just another example of towering hubris from a Government that is starting to display its arrogance as a badge of honour.
I will now turn to the bill as a whole:
SCHEDULE ONE: FBT CONCESSIONS
Schedule 1 to this bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to:
provide a fringe benefits tax (FBT) exemption to cover the engagement of a relocation consultant to assist in the relocation of an employee;
broaden the FBT exemption for eligible work-related items (that currently includes laptops, and mobiles, airport lounges, journals etc) to include personal digital assistants and portable printers designed for use with portable computers; and
broaden the FBT exemption for remote area housing to cover employers in industries where employer-provided housing is not customary.
These measures were announced in the last Budget.
Although this measure is described as providing greater incentive for small business these measures are not especially targeted to this sector. In fact it appears that the title of this EM was probably worded in this way to try to make the bill seems more targeted to this sector than it might really be.
Still, we understand that small business has asked for removal of the requirement that employment sponsored housing permitted an FBT exemption outside of the a sector in which such provision is customary. Labor supports these FBT related concessions to the extent that small business identifies them as important and necessary for labour productivity. The remote area housing concession may foster regional development.
SCHEDULE TWO: EFFECTIVE LIVE CAPS
The Commissioner of Taxation progressively updates the effective live rules of assets for depreciation purposes. A significant review occurred last year and came into effect on 1 January and was announced in a recent determination of the Commissioner. This significantly increased the effective lives of buses, light commercial vehicles, trucks and truck trailers (on average to 15 years). This means that since an asset is allowed to be depreciated over a longer period, a smaller annual deduction would apply. This is neutral tax treatment which enhances economic efficiency and good tax practice.
But in an election context the Government moved to override this determination by legislation (as it has already done in some other sectors). This bill specifies that the effective life is capped at 7.5 years.
Mr Deputy speaker, this is a straight tax concession to the sector. Such concessions create economic distortions. Labor’s approach to tax policy is to seek to minimise such concessions to enhance the efficiency of the tax system and to defend the tax base to fund social programs like reform of health and education systems.
However, we recognise that there are times when their could be good social policy reasons for tax concessions. There are legitimate concerns over safety and environmental issues associated with older buses and trucks. So there could be social or environmental benefit (a positive externality to use the economic parlance) from the measure from encouraging firms to renew the fleet and get old trucks off the road.
There are two points to be made here. The first is that the Government in the Explanatory Memorandum simply failed to mention this benefit. So the Government has put forward a tax concession without any social or environmental justification. What this tends to imply that the Minister does not proceed in relation to tax policy from a coherent microeconomic framework but simply creates a tax concession at the bidding of section of the business community, in an election climate for purely political reasons.
The second point to be made is that this concession should really include a sunset clause. If the justification for the measure is to renew the fleet of heavy vehicles then even this fleet have been updated the concession (which is not an insignificant cost to revenue at almost $200 over the forward estimates) should be phased out. Labor will support this schedule because of the social and environmental benefits we believe are contained in it, but this is not a concession which we now commit to agreeing to ad infinitum.
Labor is concerned that this bill was not introduced earlier as it is retrospective from 1 January, Retrospective tax legislation is poor tax design and bad legislative practice. The Australian business community requires Government to act with greater timeliness to reduce uncertainty of investment decisions and avoid retrospectivity of tax legislation. Retrospective measures like this, even if they increase concessions, are not good tax design.
SCHEDULE THREE: GST TREATMENT ON FOREIGN TOUR OPERATORS.
Schedule 3 as original drafted sought to close a loophole that allowed an option to purchase certain services (mostly room nights in a hotel) to be available to offshore wholesalers without imposition of the GST. So this effectively means that a package of tourism services can be constructed GST free to a foreign tourist.
The main group of non-residents that are able to make supplies in these circumstances are non-resident tour operators. Typically, these operators acquire Australian package holidays from resident tour wholesalers and then on-supply them to tourists. If these supplies constitute supplies of rights or options to acquire things to be consumed in Australia they will not be connected with Australia as required under the GST Act. This is contrary to the policy intent that GST should be paid on supplies of Australian package holidays to both Australian residents and non-residents.
Most GST regimes in other countries tax the services of an enterprise that operates in the host country. Australian tax law operates rather strangely in imposing a different test: the services need to have a sufficient connection to Australia. The need to legislate this issue is one of the outcomes of this definitional approach.
Notwithstanding the numerous uncertainties that this definitional approach entails, Labor supports the broad measure of the Government to close this loophole. We do not believe that foreign tour operators should be able to claim input tax credits, as some appear to be doing, while not paying the GST.
However, the Government was somewhat overzealous in its approach Labor has consulted with experts on this schedule, even though time has been short. We have been advised that the approach in the bill is highly deficient in that it may mean that foreign contracts between countries with nothing to do with Australia are caught by GST (and also subject to similar taxes in another country). For example some contracts that relate to services that have at best a very weak connection to Australia may have to pay GST as well as UK VAT. And neither of these parties may be enterprises that operate in Australia. We have been advised that this measure may not be welcomed by other nations as it seems to impose tax outside our national jurisdiction. There is a concern that the ATO may have to vet all these foreign contracts which would effectively make the law totally unforeseeable. Unenforceable laws are bad jurisprudence.
In terms of the local industry there is a concern that the bill will not simply tax the supplies of the services by also the overseas wholesaler’s margin. This may drive up the price of the service. In tax terms this has the effect of disadvantaging Australian inbound tourism relative to other markets.
Given this Labor has no choice but to force the matter to be further considered in a senate committee process. The hearings incorporated some rather unusual eventualities that are worthy of being reported to the Senate:
Senator Watson appeared to be in receipt of some crucial information relating to the number of foreign tour operators (FTOs) affected by the proposed measure. This information was not made available to the Committee, nor was it produced in evidence or via submissions to the Committee. Still, the large number of FTO’s alluded to by Senator Watson (some 400 according to the transcript), bolstered arguments made by some sector representatives that the overall impact of the measure may have been underestimated by officials from the Treasury.
The nature of the questioning of witnesses by Senators Brandis and Watson appeared to be favourable towards the bill being amended to deal with concerns raised by inquiry participants. Senator Brandis invited witnesses to propose amendments to the bill (especially the IACA).
Senator Watson’s questioning of Treasury officials secured the response that the bill was more far reaching than simply an integrity measure designed to close the loophole whereby FTOs could claim input tax credits without paying GST on elements of a foreign tour package. This directly contradicts statements made by the Minister that the bill is an integrity measure only, placing officials’ statements at variance of those of the Minister.
Deloittes, in a supplementary submission following the hearing, called for the bill to be returned to the House and recommended that the revenue figures be clarified.
Amendments to this Bill have been proposed by industry experts. We take this opportunity to thank those how have included such amendment in their submissions. The proposed changes fall broadly into two groups. The first is to apply an input taxing model which effectively removes the FTOs from the GST system leading to no GST liability and no input tax credits (ATEC, IACA, Deloitte). The further rules based model of PWC would apply a special definition of ‘connected with Australia’ for non-resident entities as an exception to the basic rule that applies in GST law.
Both models could achieve the desired outcome of reducing the scope the bill to the primary policy intent of closing the loophole associated the FTOs getting input tax credits. We can accept either model, and call on the Government to return to the debate on the Bill in the Senate with an amendments that gives effect to one of these two proposed models.
The proposed amendments involving the PWC model do solve the problems in the tax law in a much better manner than the original bill and should be supported.
However, Opposition senators note that this opting out approach to the GST system for FTOs will not apply to domestic tour operators. This is a distortionary outcome in the tax law. The Government should come forward with further amendments to address this.
I also note that the Government pre-empted the Committee report by putting out the amendments before the report was tabled. But this is just a minor brough up, minuscule in comparison to the embarrassment caused to the Minister by the scope of these amendments.
Minister will you now admit to this chamber that the original bill was deficient, that it should have been released in exposure draft form. Will you request that Minister Brough make wider use of these exposure drafts.
In Conclusions of schedule 3 I state that we on this side of the chamber are of the view that the proposed amendments are a satisfactory manner to solve the problem addressed but:
amendments should have been provided with greater time for review and with an supplementary explanatory memorandum; and
the amendments will create non-neutrality of treatment between domestic and foreign tour operators. The Government needs to address this concern.
SCHEDULE 4: MATURE AGE WORKER TAX OFFSET
Schedule 4 to this Bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce a tax offset for workers aged 55 years and
over. Eligibility for the offset will be based on age and net income from working. This is income that is mainly a reward for the taxpayer’s personal effort or skills or income from a business that the taxpayer carries on, less any relevant deductions).
Certain amounts of income are specifically excluded from the definition of `net income from working’. These amounts relate to eligible termination payments; payments received on retirement or termination of employment in lieu of long service leave and annual leave; and passive income.
There are a number of important point to be made in relation to Schedule 4. Labor does not seek to oppose those measures in which the Government can legitimately claim an election mandate. The basic policy intent of the mature aged offset is an election commitment.
However, it is clear that the Government has introduced a number of new elements to the proposal that were not announced in the election context.
This is clearly seen by the increased costing of the overall measure. The costings exceed estimates by at least 25%. Why is this?
Firstly, the government has now extended the scope of the measure to include more persons. A key reason for this is that Government underestimated the number of persons who were over 55. Simply put, the Government did not know how many aged person were going to be working. They simply did not have a clear idea of who many people over 55 were in the workforce. This is a rather embarrassing admission for the Government.
What does it indicate? It indicates that this is a measure that was tied together in an election campaign without the assistance of Treasury in a very haphazard manner. It is policy on the run. It was not well thought through and poorly costed. This stands a reason to question the fundamental rationale of the whole offset.
More importantly the government has extended the measure to include not just gross income in the means testing measure but income from working net of tax deductions. This a strange way to construct a means test: almost unprecedented in the income transfer system. To base a means test on net income after tax deductions adds to the complexity of the whole system. It is a basis that is inconsistent with measures adopted in the family payments system and other elements of the tax system. This is another example of how the Government just adds another layer to the overall income transfer system in a haphazard way. The whole system looks like a house under constant renovation. There is no blueprint, not coherent architectural plan just another dodgy extension. As these new layers are added to the whole structure it begins to look increasingly unwieldy.
The Government has also extended the measure to include partnership income. An further extension of which it has no mandate.
Treasury has been consulted and asked as to whether the measure included an estimate of the gains from labour market participation mature Australians. Labor sought some indication of the dynamic gains of the measure. We have been told that Treasury has no calculated any such gains. So we can but conclude that there are no such gains associated with the measure.
The basic rationale for the offset is to increase labour market participation and thus drive up GDP and GDP per capita. But if Treasury cannot quantify any such dynamic gains then it appears the measure is bereft of any real justification in terms of macroeconomic dynamics and growth accounting principles.
Labor market participation of makes if a notoriously sticky variable. It simply has not moved in 30 years. There appears no reason to believe that any individual will decide to defer retirement and stay in the workforce over 55 simply as a result of a modest tax offset of $500 pa.
In the absence of an quantification of such dynamic gains Labor can only conclude that the measure was simply another pre-election bribe an expensive $500m per annum tax break to older Australians to buy their votes. This is not good economics. It is poor fiscal discipline.
Labor does not seek to amend this schedule in the Senate. However, given the extensions to the measure and the lack of evidence of dynamic benefits Labor will seek to have a Senate committee further consider the underlying parameters of the costing of the measure. If the government believes that this offset is more than a mere election bribe, if it is more than mere policy on the run, then Government will have an opportunity to prove this in the context of the Senate Inquiry.
However, if such analysis is not presented this will be a tacit admission that this measure has no real economic benefits at all.
The ball is now in the Government’s court to justify the basic economic rationale for the tax offset, or admit that no such rationale exists.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,35,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I want to speak very briefly on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005. I want to make some comments, give some credit for the work that was done during the consideration of the bill in the hearings of the Economics Legislation Committee that were undertaken and acknowledge the work that you yourself did, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, in expediting a resolution to what was a difficult issue.
Submissions made to the committee by key representatives and advisers to the tourism export sector put forward some strong arguments that the bill in its current form would create significant adverse impacts. The testimony of witnesses at the hearing on 26 April 2005 strongly supported the arguments made in these submissions. Taken together, the oral evidence and the submissions present an overwhelming case against passing the bill in its current form.
The hearings incorporated some rather unusual eventualities that are worthy of being reported to the Senate. First of all, Senator Watson appeared to be in receipt of some crucial information relating to the number of foreign tour operators that were going to be affected by the proposed measure. This information was not made available to the committee, nor was it produced in evidence or via submissions to the committee. Still, the large number of FTOs alluded to by Senator Watson—some 400 according to the transcript—bolstered the arguments made by sector representatives that the overall impact of the measure may have been underestimated by officials from Treasury. Senator Watson’s questioning of Treasury officials secured the response that the bill was more far reaching than simply being an integrity measure designed to close the loophole whereby FTOs could claim input tax credits without paying GST on elements of a foreign tour package. It was welcome that you, as the chair of the committee, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, invited witnesses to propose amendments to the bill. That is what we have before us today as the government’s amendment to the bill.
We were also concerned about some of the deficiencies in the bill—certainly the scope of the bill, which goes beyond redressing the concern that some FTOs are claiming input tax credits without a GST liability. Naturally, we support the policy intent of closing this loophole. Still, that needs to be done without adverse unintended consequences that appear to flow from the way the bill has been drafted utilising the critical definition of ‘connection with Australia’ for assessing the GST liability. This appears to create the opportunity for goods and services that will not be consumed in Australia to be subject to the GST through the imposition of GST on wholesalers’ margins, which appear to fall within the definition of ‘having a connection with Australia’ under the bill.
As well, amendments to the bill were proposed by industry experts. We take the opportunity to thank them for including such amendments in their submissions. The amendments broadly fell into two groups. The first was to apply an input taxing model, which effectively removes the FTOs from the GST system, leading to no GST liability and no input tax credits. And there was a further rule based on the model provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which applies a special definition of ‘connected with Australia’ for non-resident entities. Both models could achieve the desired outcome. I understand that, in the amendment, the government is going to go with the PricewaterhouseCoopers model. We note that this opting out approach to the GST system for FTOs will not apply to domestic tour operators and that this is in fact a distortionary outcome in the tax law. The government should come forward with further amendments to address this.
We are of the view that the proposed amendments are a satisfactory way to solve the problem and we again express our appreciation for the work that you have done in dealing with what was an extraordinarily difficult situation, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis. We note that the amendments will create non-neutrality of treatment between domestic and foreign tour operators, and the government will need to address this concern.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—
There is something quite extraordinary taking place in relation to this bill before us today.
The government has introduced five pages of amendments to its own bill. This is another moment of considerable embarrassment for the government. Alarmingly, the Government has become a serial offender rushing tax legislation through without adequate consultation or scrutiny.
There is even greater risk of this post 1 July when the government has the control of the Senate.
There is a chance that such a bill might fall foul of s55 of the Constitution. Currently machinery measures for taxation are usually included in an Assessment Act and don’t require a separate act.
However if a bill that was passed that purported to be a mere machinery measure but did actually constitute a tax imposition measure and became part of an Assessment Act, then there could be adverse consequences. Under the second limb of s55 of the Constitution, the totality of the amending act would be invalidated.
This massive exposure is extremely worrying. While ever the government continues down this path pushing tax bills through the parliament, there is the potential to have assessment acts invalidated.
The government must end this fast food approach to tax legislation and ensure that sufficient time is given to the drafting and introduction of bills in this place.
But before speaking to the controversial schedule 6 amendments, I want cover the less controversial aspects of the bill
Schedule 1 simplified imputation system
The amendments will provide greater flexibility to private companies by allowing them, in certain situations, to pay franked distributions during the income year in which they first incur an income tax liability, without incurring the penalty that reduces their franking deficit tax offset by 30 per cent for that year.
Because franking credits are not received until the end of the year, a private company cannot really pay a franked dividend in its first profitable year without sending the franking account into deficit. This measure corrects that anomaly.
The Opposition supports this measure
Schedule 2 CGT roll-over for superannuation entities that merge under new superannuation safety arrangements
An automatic CGT roll-over applies during the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2006 inclusive (transitional period) for the transfer of assets by a registrable superannuation entity whose trustee is not licensed to one or more registrable superannuation entities whose trustees are licensed.
The effect of the CGT roll-over is that the capital gain, or capital loss, that would otherwise be recognised when the transfer occurs is disregarded —the recognition of the accrued capital gain or loss is deferred until later disposal of the assets by one or more successor registrable superannuation entities.
This change is needed to ensure that the introduction of the tougher regulatory environment of `superannuation safety’ does not penalise superannuation fund members by creating a potentially adverse CGT event.
The Opposition supports this measure but seeks to raise with the Minister, questions associated with amendments he has proposed to the bill. In particular, items 1 and 2.
Items 1 and 2 in the amendments circulated in his name amend items 1 and 2 of the original bill with a somewhat curious form of words. The current bill uses the words “trustees are” on page 4 item 9 and the amendments replace these with “trustees are or will be”.
Now this amendment to his amendment to the law might at first sight, appear innocuous.
But it begs for closer scrutiny. The superannuation safety provisions apply from 1 July 2004 with a 2 year transitional period ending on 1 July 2006.
The newly proposed wording seems to be very open ended. Is the minister proposing that the CGT rollover provisions will apply to the transfer of an unlicensed trustee to a trustee who is also not licensed?
Is this exemption to apply in perpetuity as the words “or will be” seems to imply.
This is not an insignificant change, the policy intent of which the Minister has not yet made clear to this House.
I call on the Minister to clarify whether this very open ended form of words implies some additional exemption to or derogation from the provisions of the superannuation safety regime.
In the absence of the Minister presenting a supplementary explanatory memorandum the Minister needs to clarify these changes.
I remind the Minister that his comments on this issue in this House are of great importance and may be considered if there is any judicial review related to these proposed changes.
If the Minister cannot adequately explain the change then the matter will need to be referred to a Senate committee.
Schedule 3 providing capital allowance deductions for certain telecommunications rights
These amendments will allow capital allowance deductions for expenditure incurred on acquiring domestic telecommunications cables (Irus) and for expenditure incurred by licensed telecommunications carriers, on acquiring telecommunications site access rights.
Domestic Irus will be written-off over the effective life of the underlying telecommunications cable. Telecommunications site access rights will be written-off over the term of the right.
The new treatment will only apply to expenditure incurred on or after 12 may 2004 and the law contains integrity measures to stop access to the new taxation treatment where existing arrangements are `refreshed’.
Refreshing describes the situation where an existing arrangement entered into prior to a date of effect is essentially terminated and an arrangement on similar terms is entered into to qualify the expenditure for more favourable taxation treatment.
Changes in the telecommunications market have resulted in these rights to use the cable network being a significant expense to a telecommunications provider. Such rights should be deductible as any other capital expense.
This is an important recognition of changing commercial realties in this market and the Opposition supports the changes
Schedule 4 changing from annual to quarterly payment of PAYG instalments
These amendments allow taxpayers to continue to pay only an annual PAYG instalment in the income year in which they become ineligible to be annual PAYG instalment payers. Generally, these taxpayers will begin paying quarterly PAYG instalments from the first instalment quarter of the following income year. Those taxpayers who are eligible to pay two quarterly instalments annually will commence paying quarterly PAYG instalments from the third quarter of the following income year.
This measure reduces the compliance burden of the bas and gives firms time to adjust to quarterly reporting after GST registration. It is an important small business initiative.
While Labor supports this measure cannot be asked why this was not introduced before and why this change is not further evidence of the ongoing nightmare of GST implementation.
Schedule 5 deductible gift recipients
Schedule 5 to this bill amends the income tax assessment act 1997 (ITAA 1997) to update the lists of deductible gift recipients (DGRS).
The list includes the page research centre, the nationals’ `think-tank’ (if one forgives the oxymoron).
Treasury has advised that the Chifley research centre will soon receive DGR status via legislation in tax laws amendment bill no 4 2005. This bill has been introduced today and I note that the Chifley research centre has been listed for DGR status.
I will now move to schedule 7
Schedule 7 superannuation and family law
These amendments to the income taxation law extend the same taxation treatment currently provided to superannuation split on marriage breakdown to superannuation annuities split upon marriage breakdown.
If the superannuation annuity is an immediate annuity (i.e. an annuity that is presently payable) that has been split on marriage breakdown, then the amendments will ensure it is subject to the same taxation arrangements as apply to a pension in a superannuation fund that has been split in similar circumstances.
If the superannuation annuity is a deferred annuity (i.e. an annuity not payable on purchase) that has been split on marriage breakdown, then the amendments will ensure it is subject to the same taxation arrangements as apply to a superannuation interest in the accumulation phase that has been split in similar circumstances.
These amendments to the income taxation law also correct minor anomalies which Labor supports.
These changes are needed to ensure that tax law is consistent with family law changes.
Schedule 8 fringe benefits tax —worker entitlement funds
These amendments will replace the current condition that contributions to approved worker entitlement funds must be required under an industrial instrument in order to be eligible for an exemption from FBT. Following the amendment, contributions to an approved worker entitlement fund must be made under an industrial instrument.
Concerns with this schedule have been raised with the opposition.
We have been told that the reluctance of treasury to remove the “registered agreement:” requirement appears to emanate out of the office of the minister for employment relations. we have been told that this seems to be based on a view that to remove the “registered agreement” requirement will give trade unions ‘a free kick’ in attempts to persuade the larger employers (who have registered agreements) to renew them in a “go early campaign”, and to put replacement registered agreements in place before the coalition government has control of the senate.
I call on the minister in his summing up to respond to the claim that has been put to us. Is this his policy intent?
Schedule 6 goods and services tax and real property
I now turn to the real issue with the bill, another occasion by the minister when he has been the victim of a major problem with drafting in tax law originating in treasury of schedule 6 of the bill.
I do not say innocent victim, although given the repeated nature of the offence I cannot but be moved to sympathy, but under our Westminster system he is responsible.
The department’s blunder is his personal blunder, and what a howler it is!
Have you ever heard of it Mr Deputy President, 3 months after introducing a major tax bill with some moment for a wide section of the community, he takes the key measure out of the bill more or less completely, he cuts the heart of his own bill. Why? Because he has found out that this is deficient.
So we have it 5 pages of amendments, why has the minister introduced such a major revision to this proposed amendments to the law. The reason Mr Deputy President is that he wishes to avoid a Senate review of the process as occurred in tax laws amendment bill No l 2005.
In this bill, treasury clearly did not adequately capture the policy intend of its changes which have been judged by sector participants and independent observers to be overreaching in their scope.
In a review of the changes to the GST on supplies of rights of foreign tour operators even the government senators called for changes to the proposed law!
This whole process is messy and remains unresolved.
Seeing the possibility of repeating this embarrassment the minister has sort to avoid the senate review process and make the amendments himself.
Still what is clear is that the minister has effectively conceded by the scope of his own amendments that the original bill is highly deficient.
Were this one off we might be more sanguine on the matter.
But it is not. This is the sixth major error that has occurred in the sort time the minister has been holding this portfolio.
It is a reasonably long list for a short period of time and serves to add fuel to the smouldering sense of dissatisfaction with the minister’s performance in dealing with significant changes to tax law.
Minister, please listen that this is not a minor concern, these errors and omissions create a lack of clarity for economic decision makers and have economic costs.
The way to avoid this process if to make greater use of exposure drafts on proposed tax changes and I now call on you to commit to the use of this process in all tax law changes, except where exceptional circumstances prevail or a strict and tightly focused integrity measure is proposed.
The proposed clean up of your proposed changed in schedule 6 of the bill is complex.
The matter requires further consideration in a senate committee. Still, the minister now should clarify a few points.
I refer the minister to item 17 of his new proposed changes to item 16 of the current bill. This provision at first glance may in fact expand the existing concessions on the GST margin scheme to the supply of real property associated with property acquired from joint venture operators of a GST venture.
The minister may seek to argue that the change is purely interpretive and seeks to clarify the existing law. But without a supplementary explanatory memorandum it is difficult to judge this.
There is the chance that this item actually leads to an expansion of the current concession with a revenue cost. Minister please state in your summing up what is this revenue cost and why there is no regulatory impact statement on the proposed new amendments. You should have simply removed the whole schedule and reworked it in its totality and presented it again to this house with proper explanation. But you have not done so trying against to push through suspect tax changes under time pressure.
Its bad legislative practise minister and the opposition condemn the practice.
The key change in the newly proposed schedule of amendments to the bill is in item 26 which removes from the bill the primary measure that the schedule was created to implement.
This original schedule proposes major changes to the margin scheme associated with the application of GST to real (physical) property. The key provision is to apply a hard valuation date of 1 July 2000 for the use of the margin scheme. This increases revenue from the margin scheme arrangements in a manner neither expected nor previously announced.
Under the GST act, registered businesses can calculate GST payable on supplies of new residential or commercial property under the basic rules and pay GST at 1/11th of the GST-inclusive price. However, it is usually better to make use of the margin scheme in which GST is levied at 1/11th of the margin: the value added since acquisition. If you use the margin scheme you cannot claim input tax credits.
The most controversial element of the original bill related to the setting of the valuation date of 1 July 2000 for the use of the margin scheme on real property. Treasury has argued that a later date cannot be set because it is just too difficult to find the appropriate point from which to quarantine off all the input tax credits as required under the margin scheme. The neatest date is the date from which the GST began. This is clearly true, but it has been asserted that through this measure treasury have sought to increase the tax base in an underhanded way that could be a breach of the agreement with the states.
The origin of the concern is that if the property is purchased after 1 July 2000 then there has likely to have been considerable capital gains since that time. This means that the base from which the valuation is set is higher and the margin to which the GST is applied is lower. If the date of 1 July 2000 is applied all capital gains since that date are excluded and the margin is higher and the GST liability greater.
The fact that the minister has omitted the key active provision in item 16 of the bill in item 26 of the newly proposed amendments is clear evidence that the concerns expressed by the sector have validity.
We welcome the back down from the minister which the Shadow Assistant Treasurer called for in the house in his second reading speech to another tax bill tax law amendment bill no 3 2005.
But what will happen minister after I July when the government controls the senate. Will you allow us to use senate committees to review your bills. You should, given your dubious record on getting it right on the first pass.
I now call on you minister in your summing up to make the commitment that you will not use your imminent senate majority to frustrate this important process of scrutiny of these complex bills.
Mr Deputy President, lets face it, Minister Brough’s bungling on this bills is bad for business. It creates confusion and increases the burden of tax compliance. On this occasion he is condemned by sheer scope his own embarrassing amendments.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I commenced my contribution to this debate yesterday. To recap very briefly, we are dealing with the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. It represents some major amendments to the superannuation choice legislation that passed through the parliament some months ago. I have already made the point that, from the point of view of certainty, it is not good policy or practice to be dealing with some substantial amendments to what is by any judgment a radical change to the structure of superannuation so close to the time of its implementation—the legislation will take effect on 1 July, which is in just over a week’s time.
Connected to that are the issues relating to the financial services act which require disclosure—which is a central but, in my view, inadequate protection for employees. Involved in that is the issue of product disclosure statements under another piece of legislation and regulation which have not yet been finalised. So the concise, clear and informative product disclosure statements that consumers need to, hopefully, make an informed choice are not going to be ready by 1 July. That is also not an appropriate way to deal with what are such significant changes to the superannuation system. In my comments yesterday I outlined the significant difficulties that this new regime presents for business. There is a significant and costly new red tape burden imposed on business, and I have gone into the details of that.
Our first concern was the issue of complexity. The second theme of concern that I want to deal with now is the issue of safety from the employee’s point of view. Before I get to the theory of choosing a superannuation fund, I point out that most Australians have choice in the form of investment choice—they can select an investment option within a fund. We are dealing here with joining a superannuation fund. The economic theory, at least, is that there is more choice and more competition. The government have claimed time and time again that the cost of superannuation will decline as a consequence of this competition. That is the economic theory, but it is dependent on what is known as an informed market.
We know from all of the financial literacy surveys that have been carried out that financial literacy with respect to superannuation is low. Therefore, will a competitive and informed market make rational decisions and drive down prices? It is Labor’s argument that at least in some areas that will not happen. In fact, prices will go up because it is not an informed market. People will seek additional advice and they will pay an additional cost as a consequence.
The ultimate test of the outcome will be the various fees and data surveys that are released in coming years. So we will be able to judge on the evidence available what happens with fees over coming years. There are obviously private fee companies. The regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, APRA, does quarterly superannuation trend surveys with considerable fee detail. So we will know what happens with fees. I would point out that on best estimates that is not easy to obtain at the moment because a large section of the superannuation industry savings is in small self-managed superannuation funds—it is a very substantial part of superannuation—and the tax office administers that. APRA does not have fee details on that section of the superannuation industry. There is approximately $800 billion in superannuation, and we know from the available data that the level of fees is between $800 million and $900 million per annum. It is a substantial amount of money.
The second defect in the argument about rational choice competition with respect to superannuation is that it is not a voluntary purchase; it is compulsory. Superannuation by its nature is a very unusual product from a consumer point of view. You are compelled to belong; it is compulsory. Therefore, by the very nature of its being underwritten by compulsion, you incorporate in it a significant group of people who do not wish to belong; and therefore the economic theory of informed choice is difficult to achieve. So we will look at the outcomes in terms of fees and charges at some future date.
The other issue, which I have touched on, is that there are some caveats. We are not dealing with a full choice of fund regime. There are caveats on it, and I mentioned those in my speech yesterday. So it is not choice of fund for everyone. The government’s propaganda is choice, but it is not choice of fund for everyone.
There is another important exception, and that is the half a million Australians who cannot exercise choice because of the fee structures of superannuation. About half a million of the 10 million superannuation fund members cannot exercise choice because of the exit fee structure of superannuation. An exit fee is not an administrative fee of $40, $50 or $100 to pay for the cost of the administration of moving from one fund to another; it is a deliberate financial barrier or wall created by the financial institution to stop a person from exercising choice of superannuation fund. So that is another barrier—a financial barrier—which this government has done nothing about.
A lot of publicity was given to the impact of exit fees in July last year. I think it was John Garnaut who did a very good analysis of this in the Sydney Morning Herald. We know that that analysis is broadly correct because ASIC, the independent regulator, has confirmed that there are about half a million Australians that will have exit fees. A large section of the superannuation industry that have argued for choice have, of course, done nothing about exit fees. On one hand, they want choice of fund—where it suits them; on the other hand, they did not want to do anything about exit fees that prohibit people from moving to other funds.
There was a lot of publicity about this last July. The Treasurer, as is his wont, expressed concern and said he would do something about it. He said he would talk to the superannuation industry, particularly the retail funds. From the evidence we gathered on Monday night, nothing has happened—the Treasurer has not spoken to the industry. I stand to be corrected by the parliamentary secretary or whoever is going to respond. The Treasurer has done nothing. As usual, he talks tough but does nothing. Nothing has happened on exit fees.
One of the other interesting issues about choice from a consumer point of view is safety. Labor argues that the fee structures themselves, in a limited-knowledge market, are dangerous. I have mentioned exit fees. Interestingly, going forward, exit fees are legally still allowed to be charged—even if nothing is done about them retrospectively. In the context of superannuation and the issues I have touched on this evening and yesterday, Labor has long argued that you need to regulate the structure of fees. To ensure competition, you need to remove anticompetitive fee structures by regulation. Of course, some in the superannuation industry view this with great concern. They want regulation to compel employers and employees to contribute to super, but they want to be able to charge what they like, or, in some cases, get away with. Those who argue against fee regulation want regulation to make it compulsory to be in superannuation. They want it both ways.
Labor has advocated some structural fee regulation—specifically, the prohibition of entry and exit fees, which are inappropriate in the context of superannuation, and regulation of trail commissions. Labor argues that trail commissions are a fundamental conflict of interest. It is not well understood that a trail commission is a percentage fee paid to an adviser for advising on the fund an individual may join. Therefore, they represent a direct conflict of interest. They are anticompetitive, they are anti free market and regulatory structures should be put in place to deal with these anticompetitive arrangements. If we are going to have competition, if we are going to have choice of superannuation fund, then my view is certainly that we should move to total choice of superannuation fund, other than the default fund. Therefore, we have to make sure that any barriers to choice or any anticompetitive arrangements that lead to favouring one form of fund over another need to be regulated out of existence. These are our concerns. We have some amendments in the committee stage, and we will deal with those in due course.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,37,1

INTRO

The fact that we are here today debating yet another major change to this Government’s Super Choice legislation just weeks before it comes into operation highlights the fact that this is poorly considered policy…
Poorly considered policy that will put both small businesses and consumers at risk.
Policy that is too complex and unsafe for both employers and employees.
This legislation encapsulates small business in even more red tape and exposes vulnerable employees to fierce marketing from superannuation providers attempting to sell a product many consumers do not understand.

SMALL BUSINESS

In 1996 the Government made a commitment to reduce red tape for small business by 50%.
Yet this Government just keeps handing small business more hoops to jump through—first it was Goods and Services Tax and Business Activity Statements and now with this super choice legislation it is more red tape, more forms and more time spent for businesses complying with new Government policy rather than focusing on their customers.
The Howard Government has not only misled Australian Small Businesses into thinking they will reduce red tape—they have increased it and increased it exponentially!
Smarter and wider consultation with small business—one of the major stakeholders in respect to this change would have shown this Government that they had needs that required respect and consultation.
Consultation would have shown the Government what a red tape nightmare the super choice regime would become—only adding to the pressures and uncertainties of running a small business.
They would have seen that prescribing big business policy does not work for small business with less than 20 employees and made changes and exemptions accordingly.
Instead small business once again is stuck with the compliance burden suited to big business—there is no doubt that the Government has made a mess of this legislation.
This legislation changes the way small businesses deal with employees superannuation.
As of July 1 the process will change from a three step process that has operated since the introduction of superannuation. Where the employee makes contributions in accordance with the relevant state or federal award or you make contributions in accordance with your workplace agreements or certified agreements. If neither of those applies, you make contributions as determined by the employer and employees.
This legislation will see that small businesses go from that simple three step structure to a 34 step process!
Super Choice is not new.
Many small businesses already give their employees choice in regards to their superannuation fund.
Choice does not always work for the small business owner…
Bruce was a franchisee—he employed nine staff he offered his staff a choice of superannuation funds. For his nine employees they chose six different funds. Each fund required a different form and a different web interface and multiple lodging. Bruce had to take on an additional employee to deal with the additional paperwork.
Bruce realised that choice was not efficient for his business and spent 12 months working with staff to get back on to one scheme.
Around 70% of small business already offer choice—however most of these funds are dealing with only 2-3 funds.
The difference between choice of fund as it stands now is that it is under a measured approach that the small business puts in place—it is not controlled by ill-considered Government guideline and regulation.
This regime is not one that where employers can assist their employees by offering examples of research and some constructive advice.
Under the Government’s regulatory regime—a small business operator providing any form of financial advice would be liable for penalties of up $22,000 and 2 years imprisonment.

THE CONSUMER/EMPLOYEE

The Howard Government tries to offset the burden on small business with the immense benefit to the employee.
They continue to tell the Australian public that this legislation is about giving consumers a choice about their superannuation needs.
What the Government does not tell employees is that to make an informed choice…
They will need to know the intricate ins and outs of the way Australian superannuation schemes operate to generate returns.
They will need to read a booklet over 50 pages in length to understand the government’s new scheme.
They will then need to identify, consult and compare particular funds by wading through piles of fund specific information laced with fine print.
They will need to be savvy enough separate super funds marketing tactics from their actual benefits.
And finally—they will need to make this choice without any advice or assistance from their employer.
What is worse is that when the employer sees that the employee is making a poor choice they cannot do anything… They must sit back see the employee suffer and hope that the employee will realise on their own that they are making the wrong choice!
How does this Government expect any employee who could spend most of their lives organising their family, moving to and from work and going to the footy on the weekend, to be able to sit down, and work their way through the complex problem of superannuation choice with no assistance from their employer—who in most cases is the only logical person who they may be able to contact for help?
This legislation exposes vulnerable employees to fierce marketing from superannuation providers attempting to sell a product many consumers do not understand.
The Howard Government did not consider the complexity of superannuation advice when drafting this legislation. They have provided the power for superannuation providers to specifically target those with the least ability to understand the fine print in the volumes of information provided to them.
This poorly considered policy that can only be seen to benefit a few of the Howard Government’s ‘big business mates’—small business and vulnerable consumers will suffer.
Debate (on motion by Senator Colbeck) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,37,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—We are dealing with the Superannuation Bill 2005 and a related bill. The government has announced the closing of the existing Public Sector Superannuation Scheme to new employees from 1 July 2005. That has been done by regulation, and the Labor Party supports that. There was significant negotiation between the government and the Commonwealth and Public Sector Union, and of course there was some discussion with the Labor Party. It is not often that I do this but I would like to thank the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, for involving me in some private and confidential briefings on this matter last year.
The Labor Party has not opposed the closure of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. It is a defined benefits scheme, and the average level of defined benefit for the PSS is 15.4 per cent. The most important aspect of the closure and the creation of an accumulation fund is that the government has given a commitment to pay in an accumulated form 15.4 per cent of contributions from the employer. Defined benefit funds, which are in rapid free-fall throughout the Australian economy, where they have existed, give a guaranteed outcome, usually in the form of a pension and perhaps a lump sum payout when the individual has accrued sufficient years in order to reach what is usually a scaled entitlement. The politicians’ Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme is a classic example of a defined benefit fund. It has now been closed as well, but obviously the level of benefit is more generous than that which exists in the PSS.
DBs, as they are known, have been in rapid decline not just in Australia but throughout the entire Western world. I have mixed views about that. Obviously a DB, because it gives a guaranteed final outcome, provided the years of service are completed, gives greater certainty. The employer is required to ensure that there is full funding, except in the case of the state and federal public sectors in this country. We are also fortunate in Australia that private sector defined benefit funds, where they exist, have a legal requirement for full funding. That can be under or over, depending on the asset backing and the movement in the markets.
By and large, Australia does not have some of the problems of countries where DBs are underfunded. We have the classic example in the United States at the moment with American Airlines, I think, which has an underfunded defined benefit fund. New accountancy standards are coming in and they are required to top up the funding of the defined benefit fund. If they do that in the short term, it will bankrupt the airline. So what has happened in the United States, and in varying degrees in the United Kingdom, is that employers are simply refusing to pay the moneys required to fund the DB, and in the United States they can legally hand it over to a statutory guarantee corporation run by the government. That has occurred in the case of the airline sector in the United States. They have passed the cost on to the government through the guarantee corporation. The guarantee corporation in the United States is technically bankrupt and does not have sufficient money; nevertheless, the private sector effectively passes the matter over to the public sector. There is of course a cap on entitlement in the defined benefit fund if it is passed to the guarantee corporation, which means that employees will receive a lesser benefit than they would otherwise have been entitled.
In the UK the situation is not quite as serious; however, defined benefits are being closed. Defined benefits are a guaranteed outcome. I acknowledge that probably for the majority of employers in DB funds in the private sector not only is the effective level of contribution in excess of the nine per cent standard community payment but also many employers pay the insurance and the administration costs, which gives a higher end benefit to the employee. I acknowledge that this exists in the public sector, and it is also widespread in the private sector. The demise of defined benefit funds is not a good thing generally; nevertheless, it is a reality driven by the factors I have outlined plus the ending of lifelong employment—the increasing portability or transience, if you like, of the work force in general.
The public sector fund is closed by regulation on 1 July 2005. The Superannuation Bill 2005 is the legislation that will allow new employees to enter into the accumulation fund—rather than the old PSS Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme—and, as I have said, be paid an employer contribution equivalent to the PSS defined benefit contribution of 15.4 per cent. From 1 July, because the government in this case is legally required to pay the contribution—the accumulation of 15.4 per cent—it is fully funded from that point on.
One other aspect of this is that the government has agreed to pay the administration costs. The new employees in the public sector accumulation fund will receive not only the 15.4 per cent contribution from the employer but also, effectively, those investments of the management and administration fees being paid by the appropriate government department. In that sense it is a very generous arrangement for new employees going forward, albeit in the form of an accumulation rather than a defined benefit.
As an interim position, the accumulation fund is being administered by what is known as a subplan of the existing PSS defined benefit scheme. Once this bill is passed into law there will be a new PSSap—Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan—established as a separate legal entity for administration and investment purposes. It is understandable that that should occur. However, we have an existing trustee structure in the CSS, the old Commonwealth defined benefit public service fund, and the existing PSS board. The trustees of the PSS board will be deemed to be trustees of the accumulation fund. That is a good arrangement. It is sound because we are sharing the costs of the trustee structure. Why have a new trustee structure?
The moneys will be invested by the commissioner and overseen by the Commissioner of Superannuation in the same way as about $13 billion of employee moneys is invested in the CSS and PSS. So there will be an administrative and investment efficiency established even though a separate legal accumulation entity is being created. The PSSap will be a default fund for the purposes of choice of superannuation fund. Going forward from 1 July the new public sector employees will be able to choose the fund into which they want their 15.4 per cent employer contribution to go. The PSSap is what is known as the default fund.
Frankly, it would surprise me if any employee were to choose any fund other than the PSSap. Why would they when the administration costs and the investment management costs are to be paid for by the department? The PSSap will certainly be one of the most efficient funds—if not the most efficient—with the lowest fees in existence, albeit they are being picked up by the government. At the moment the PSS and the CSS have a wholesale funds investment management cost of about 0.3 to 0.35 per cent of moneys under investment, whereas most other superannuation funds outside the public sector have an investment management fee of half a per cent up to one per cent and, on top of that, an administration fee. So, going forward from 1 July, the services as to PSSap trustee administration investment will be highly advantageous for new employees.
I refer to the administrative and legal requirements for the PSS, the defined benefits scheme. It is technically, administratively and legally difficult to have the DB fund, the PSS, going forward administering the accumulation fund, so Labor accept that the hybrid fund approach in these circumstances should be changed. We will be supporting this legislation. Separate schemes are the best approach, provided that the advantages I have outlined in terms of the accumulation PSSap scheme are not lost to new employees. As I have mentioned, there is a trustee board with employer and employee representatives. That is to remain the same—that is a good thing.
I have mentioned the economies of scale in investment management fees. From what I can find out, there is no better scheme—so that is maintained. The administration costs are paid for by the employer—the government departments—so that is maintained. As for the record, we have examined the rates of return in the PSS and CSS. Over the 10 years to 30 June 2004, the average yearly net rate of return is 8.51 per cent for the PSS and 8.35 per cent for the CSS. These are obviously due to trustee boards which have done a very good job. Also, these are a function of economies of scale. When you have got a superannuation fund with some $13 billion under management, you can negotiate the much lower funds management costs to which I referred earlier, so it is a highly efficient funds management fee scale. The public sector has one other advantage that most other superannuation funds do not have—one employer. One employer is a lot easier for administration purposes. You certainly do not have as high an employee turnover in terms of casuals and part-timers as other schemes have.
So this new arrangement going forward from 1 July preserves the existing advantages of the current arrangements, albeit in accumulation fund form. Compared to arrangements in the private sector—or indeed in other government sectors—it is highly advantageous. With a couple of exceptions, all state public service defined benefit superannuation funds have been shut off and usually contribution levels are anywhere between 15 and 20 per cent. I point out that in those cases both Liberal and Labor state governments have been paying only nine per cent, not the equivalent to the defined benefit, so the Commonwealth proposal is generous compared to the activities of all state governments, Labor or Liberal.
There are two issues with this legislation that do concern us. I have mentioned the closure of the public sector defined benefits fund. When the government decided to close the fund last year it carried out what is called an actuarial projection with the debts going forward. Obviously if you are closing the fund to new employees and therefore funding it with accumulation moneys, the level of debt that was projected to go forward from unfunded liabilities in the public sector superannuation will decline. There is no argument about that. The government had an actuarial projection carried out but it has not been published. Despite requests from me at estimates in February and May for the publication of the new actuarial assessment, it has not been published. That is not only information that should be made public in the context of the superannuation bills we are considering but also important information to have in the context of any debate around the Future Fund. The Future Fund is to be established for the purposes of unfunded superannuation public sector liabilities. We would like to know what those liabilities are going forward. In any sort of debate about how those liabilities increase and then generally fall away—we know that as a percentage of gross domestic product they will decline—we need to know what is occurring in this area.
We know from the estimates figures that I obtained in the last estimates round two weeks ago that the CSS is $47 billion; the PSS is $11 billion—and that will be lower over time; the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits scheme is $22 billion—and is still being kept open; the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme is $7 billion; and the other schemes—for the Governor-General, judges and the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme—is $1.5 billion. The schemes for judges and the Governor-General are still open. The raw figure of $91 billion rising to $140 billion sounds serious; however, there is an element of scaremongering in these figures. A more balanced and informed approach to this debate would be to provide those updated debt figures as a percentage of gross domestic product, not simply in a raw monetary figure. That has been the traditional way in the actuarial reports on the major funds—both the money figure and the percentage of GDP projected through for 40 or 50 years. As a consequence, there will be a second reading amendment criticising the government for not providing the up-to-date actuarial reports.
In committee we will move an amendment that relates to workplace agreements. This is an interesting issue which I will expand on in greater detail in the committee stage. Under choice of superannuation fund a workplace agreement can override the individual selection of a fund. There are some exceptions also. If an employer is paying more than nine per cent, which they are in this case, they can require, as they would in this case, that the PSSap be the superannuation fund for the receipt of all of the contributions.
Labor argue that in the context of this bill an Australian workplace agreement, where a government department could go out and for whatever reason override the PSSap as a default fund and override individual choice with some other superannuation arrangements, is an undesirable feature. I suspect that it is probably not going to happen but who knows what may happen after 1 July. Some particularly ideological head of a government department may introduce an AWA, which overrides choice of superannuation fund and also the default fund, and a new default fund. We are concerned about that, and in the committee stage I will be moving an amendment that the Labor Party believe will prevent that from happening. It would be an undesirable outcome.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ian Macdonald) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,39,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—I would have incorporated my speech on the Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 1) 2005 and the Shortfall Interest Charge (Imposition) Bill 2005, but I cannot because the bills were brought on so quickly. We have incorporated where we can.
Since 1986-87, Australia has operated a system of self-assessment of income tax. Under self-assessment, taxpayers’ returns are generally accepted at face value in the first instance, and the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, may verify the accuracy of the return and if necessary amend an assessment within a prescribed period. The ATO now has the power to reopen assessments after many years. This has led to some uncertainty and calls for constraints on the Commissioner of Taxation’s capacity to enforce payment with penalties long after the original tax return has been submitted. Concerns of this nature have received some attention in the case of schemes propagated by tax promoters—mass marketed schemes and employee benefit arrangements. Even when a private ruling from the ATO was received, the commissioner had the power to impose tax in contravention of the ruling and impose penalties.
A general view emerged that reform was needed to provide greater certainty for the taxpayers—that, after a period of examination, there was a need for refinements to the present system to reduce both the level of uncertainty for taxpayers and the compliance costs associated with self-assessment while preserving the capacity of the ATO to collect legitimate tax liabilities. In December 2004, the Treasurer announced that he accepted the findings of the review committee and would, where needed, legislate their effect. This bill is the first and most preliminary stage of the process of the implementation of the review’s findings. The full list of recommendations is included in the attachments to the bill.
I turn to the contents of the bill. Schedule 1 creates a new tax, the shortfall interest charge. A shortfall is where the taxpayer has paid too little tax. This usually relates to an amended assessment by the ATO. Late payment is different, as this relates to a known assessment not paid by the due date. The issue with the shortfall is that a taxpayer may not know for some time that he or she has a shortfall—say 18 months. But the current penalty charge, called the general interest charge, at 12.5 per cent, applies not from the date the taxpayer is advised of the error by the ATO but from the original date of assessment. So the high tax penalty applies from a period when a taxpayer has no knowledge that they have underpaid tax. The problem has been exacerbated by taxpayers with multiple assessments involving shortfalls. In some cases, this could occur over a number of years. The bill ensures that the general interest charge will not fall due until 21 days after the ATO advises of the shortfall. Before that, a concessional charge will apply, called the shortfall interest charge, at three per cent plus the prime rate.
Schedule 2 of the bill repeals the special penalty for those failing to follow a private ruling—25 per cent of the shortfall. It also requires the Commissioner of Taxation to supply reasons why a penalty has not been remitted in full and makes a technical clarification about when a position is reasonably arguable. The latter point is not insignificant as the law strictly imposes a high standard on what can be reasonably argued. A position that is reasonably argued avoids the imposition of penalties even if the commissioner disagrees with the assessment.
The current threshold is that the position is as likely to be as correct as incorrect. The ATO interprets this more loosely as ‘about as likely to be correct as incorrect’. The bill enshrines the ATO’s looser and more concessional definition. There are some interesting policy issues around these changes. Simplicity and transparency in the process of taxation administration are matters of justice. Taxpayers have a legitimate expectation that a good faith disclosure of relevant facts combined with a diligent attempt to comply with the law will not lead to the imposition of significant penalties. There are also economic benefits. Taxation uncertainty can threaten business survival and adds risk premiums to finance, increasing the cost of capital. Regulatory transparency, especially in taxation, will lower business compliance costs with consequent gains to productivity and economic welfare.
The reforms in this bill are sound in terms of basic principles of justice, administrative law and tax policy. However, the reforms come too late for those who have been disadvantaged by relying on ATO advice and subjected to penalties. Labor has received many representations in relation to this bill. Many individuals have given evidence to the Senate inquiry identifying the deficiencies in the ATO’s handling of this matter.
I hope the Senate committee review process continues after 1 July, because I think it is a very important check on executive government. There have certainly been many shortcomings identified in pieces of legislation, even though they have gone through the bureaucracy, cabinet, the parliamentary party caucuses and their own committees. The Senate committees play a very effective role in identifying weaknesses in legislation. The Senate committee review process concluded that the bills do not go far enough to address shortcomings identified by the Treasury review of aspects of income tax self-assessment. The establishment of a shortfall interest charge, known as an SIC, which will replace the general interest charge, the GIC, for shortfalls of tax paid in the period between when a taxpayer submits a tax return and when the ATO reassesses the return addresses a notable shortcoming in the GIC system. The GIC is set at a higher rate—currently the 90-day bill rate plus seven per cent to encourage the prompt settlement of tax debts.
The Treasury review has rightly observed that, until they receive an amended assessment, taxpayers are not in a position to respond to this incentive to settle. As such, applying the GIC to reassessments in this way is inequitable. The effects of applying the GIC at a higher rate can be very punitive. The Treasury review notes that over a six-year period the GIC can, at current interest rates, more than double a tax debt. This can result in crushing liabilities from which affected taxpayers can find it difficult to recover. Many of the submissions received by the committee confirm that this is the case. The Treasury review rejects the use of the GIC as a penalty. As the review rightly observes furthermore, the perception that taxpayers are being penalised twice for the same offence, or being penalised where it was decided that no culpability penalty should apply, is undesirable.
In introducing the SIC the government clearly recognises that in many circumstances the GIC is both inequitable and applied inappropriately. Yet, instead of the government taking steps immediately to address the shortcomings that have been identified, the SIC will apply only to the 2004-05 income year and future years. This means that back assessments which can still be conducted for ordinary taxpayers, as distinct from those who are reassessed under part 4A, can still be subject to the GIC for up to four years. Further, the ATO will have to administer two systems in parallel for up to six years—the period it will take for the changes proposed to be fully implemented. Labor senators therefore consider that the SIC should apply to back assessments made from the date of royal assent to the bills and recommend that the bills be amended accordingly.
We will be moving some amendments in the committee stage to deal with some of the issues that I have outlined. One amendment that I will be moving will not be genuinely retrospective but will try to make it possible for those audited on recent returns to enjoy the benefits of the new regime. We would argue that amendments to give effect to some level of benefit for those who have been audited would reflect some of the comments that Senator Murray made on behalf of the Democrats in the committee process. Labor senators recognise that some people who have already been assessed and who have paid or are in the process of paying their tax debts under settlement arrangements may feel unjustly treated as they do now. It is administratively impractical to reopen such cases. However, and this will be reflected in later consideration, Labor senators will at least ensure that all assessments after the bills receive assent will benefit from the introduction of the SIC.
Labor senators were also concerned about the apparent conflict between evidence received from the ATO and Treasury and from the many persons and organisations that made submissions. The ATO evidence appeared to indicate that the mass marketed schemes issue had been settled and that all participants were offered favourable terms. This may be the case for many of the agricultural and franchise scheme participants, but it is of concern that there may be substantial numbers of other people who found themselves entrapped by bad advice in schemes such as EBAs and retirement home schemes who have not been offered realistic settlement terms. Many of these people have been ruined financially as a result, and there was substantial comment at the latest estimates in the questioning of the ATO again on this issue. It has been a running issue with the Taxation Office over many years.
Labor senators urge the ATO when making future settlement offers to be mindful of the policy intent in introducing the SIC and to ensure that the GIC is not applied as a quasi penalty in such cases. Labor senators, in their observations, concluded that changes should have been introduced earlier in order to minimise the concerns and the various ongoing problems. I think some 40,000 taxpayers would not have been suffering under the burden of crippling tax debts or penalties that have applied in many cases.
The other issue, on which I will conclude, is the future operation of machinery provisions relating to taxation involving more than one type of tax. Labor are concerned about this issue. We argue the government has shown a propensity to try to push tax law through the Senate with undue haste. Labor believe there is even greater risk of that after 1 July. Labor understand, and this is reflected in some of the more recent tax bills, that Minister Brough in the other place has had the carriage of a significant number of errors and mistakes. The Labor Party recognise that errors and mistakes can occur—they have been far too frequent, I have to say, on Minister Brough’s watch—but, if you make a mistake on a tax matter, own up. It is a complicated area. Do not stick out press releases, attempting to cover up your error and referring to enhancements, trying to bury them in either other tax bills via amendments or TLAB bills that subsequently have amendments added to them. Tax law is complicated. Where a mistake is made, there should be a frank admission of the mistake.
Obviously, the Labor Party, being the reasonable opposition that we are, understand that where those sorts of mistakes occur we should immediately have corrective action. The Labor Party are supportive of that. We do not blame public servants. Tax is a complicated area. Mistakes are made relatively frequently, despite the best intentions. There are advisers in minister’s offices. Ultimately, ministers are paid for this, they have to take responsibility, and they should own up and obtain the cooperation of Labor and other parties in the Senate to ensure speedy corrective action is taken.
As I have said, Labor argues that, after 1 July, with the government in a rush of blood with control of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives, it is more likely that tax bills might fall foul of section 55 of the Constitution, which requires each new tax to be in a new bill. Machinery measures for taxation are usually included in an assessment act and do not require a separate act. If a bill that was passed purported to be a mere machinery measure but actually constituted a tax imposition measure and became part of an assessment act, there could be adverse consequences. If this were to occur, under the second limb of section 55 of the Constitution the totality of the amending act would be invalidated.
There are many precedents confirming the need for additional scrutiny because of a failure to make corrective changes in the first instance. A good example is the consolidation regime, which was introduced in 2002 but which has now been amended 11 times. The consolidation regime, an attempt to simplify tax law in some areas, has now been amended 11 times. So a simplification effort becomes more complicated and we start to revert to the very complexity of the tax base that is being sought to be simplified. It is also true that international tax changes have been amended a number of times in the same way. So Labor are concerned about the number of errors in tax bills that are having to be corrected, and we are concerned that there will be an increased propensity to rush legislation forward in the tax area and for the number of mistakes, which has been on the increase, to increase further. We do not believe that that is a good thing.
When we get to the bill in committee we will be moving a couple of amendments that we believe are important in respect of the general interest charge. Over the last hour—I do not say unfortunately; it is part of the job—I have incorporated a number of speeches on two tax bills. We will deal with the second reading amendments on those bills in the committee stage. In order to save time, I have incorporated speeches on two superannuation bills—I was halfway through speaking on one. For this third tax bill, which I have been speaking on for the last 20 minutes or so, due to the very quick notice for the bringing on of this legislation in order to cooperate with the government’s program, regrettably I was not able to obtain the necessary composite material in order to submit the speech that I have just given. I have had to give it from notes rather than incorporate the speech; otherwise, I would have been in a position to save time. Nevertheless, I stress that the opposition has effectively cooperated by delivering speeches on the second reading on five pieces of legislation in the hour we have had in lieu of the dinner break.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (IMPROVEMENTS TO SELF ASSESSMENT) BILL (NO. 1) 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,40,1

              (b)    has requested the Minister to:
                    (i)    make a determination under section 48B; or
                   (ii)    exercise the Minister’s power under section 417;
and has not received the decision of the Minister.
         (2)    An officer may detain a person to whom this section applies if the officer has reasonable grounds to consider that detention is necessary in order to:
              (a)    verify the identify of the person; or
              (b)    assess the application; or
              (c)    protect public safety or welfare; or
              (d)    ensure that the person is immediately available for health checks; or

         (3)    A person to whom this section applies who is detained must be given a written statement of the reasons for detention.
         (4)    A person to whom this section applies who is detained may apply to the Federal Court for an order that he or she be released because there are no reasonable grounds to consider that detention is necessary for the reasons specified in subsection (2).
         (5)    A person to whom this section applies may be detained for a period not exceeding 90 days unless the Federal Court makes an order under subsection (7), a further order under subsection (9) or an order under subsection (11) that the person must be kept in immigration detention.
         (6)    The Secretary may apply to the Federal Court for an order under subsection (7), a further order under subsection (9) or an order under subsection (11) that a person to whom this section applies must be kept in immigration detention.
         (7)    The Federal Court may make an order that a person to whom this section applies must be kept in immigration detention for a period not exceeding 90 days if the court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to:

         (8)    In considering whether it is necessary to detain a person to whom this section applies in order to assess the application or to ensure that the person is available for removal if his or her application is unsuccessful, the Federal Court must take into account the effectiveness and appropriateness of imposing conditions of release which would ensure that, should the person be released from detention, the person would be available for the assessment of the application for the visa or for removal if the application is unsuccessful.
         (9)    If the Federal Court has made an order under subsection (7) or a further order under this subsection, that a person be detained for a further period specified in the order, at the end of that specified period the person must be released from immigration detention unless the court has made a further order under this subsection that the person must be kept in immigration detention, provided that a further order under this subsection must not order that the person be kept in immigration detention for a further period exceeding 90 days.

      (10)    The Federal Court may order that a person who is released from detention must comply with reasonable conditions to ensure that he or she is available for the assessment of the application or for removal if the application is unsuccessful.

196B  Detention of unsuccessful asylum seekers who are subject to removal
         (1)    This section applies to a person who made a valid application, which has been finally determined, for a visa under section 36, and that application was unsuccessful. To avoid doubt, an application for a visa under section 36 does not include a request to the Minister to make a determination under section 48B or to exercise the Minister’s powers under section 417.
         (2)    An officer may detain a person to whom this section applies if the officer has reasonable grounds to consider that detention is necessary in order to:
              (a)    protect public safety or welfare; or

 (6)
   
 The Secretary may apply to the Federal Court for an order under subsection (7), a further order under subsection (9) or an order under subsection (11) that a person to whom this section applies must be kept in immigration detention.


        
 (7)
   
 The Federal Court may make an order that a person to whom this section applies must be kept in immigration detention for a period not exceeding 90 days if the court is satisfied that:


             
 (a)
   
 there is a real likelihood of the person being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future; or


             
 (b)
   
 if the person were allowed to leave immigration detention, there would be a significant risk that the person:


                   
 (i)
   
 would represent a danger to the safety or welfare of the Australian community, or to a segment of that community; or


                  
 (ii)
   
 would not be available for removal from Australia.


        
 (8)
   
 In considering whether it is necessary to make an order under subsection (7) or a further order under subsection (9) to ensure that the person would be available for removal, the Federal Court must take into account the effectiveness and appropriateness of imposing conditions of release which would ensure that, should the person be released from detention, the person would be available for removal from Australia.


       (9)
   
 If the Federal Court has made an order under subsection (7) or a further order under this subsection, that a person be detained for a further period specified in the order, at the end of that specified period the person must be released from immigration detention unless the court has made a further order under this subsection that the person must be kept in immigration detention, provided that a further order under this subsection must not order that the person be kept in immigration detention for a further period exceeding 90 days.


      
 (10)
   
 The Federal Court may order that a person who is released from detention must comply with reasonable conditions to ensure that the person would be available for removal from Australia.


      
 (11)
   
 The Federal Court may order that a person who has not complied with conditions of release imposed by the court may be detained for a period which the court considers reasonable in the circumstances.

       (12)    A person to whom this section applies who is released from detention must be granted a bridging visa which provides that the holder is entitled to the same entitlements as are provided under a Bridging R (Class WR) visa.
These amendments provide for judicial oversight by the Federal Court. They require a written statement to be given to detainees at the time they are detained about why they are detained. They set a 90-day limit on the detention of people and after 90 days the ongoing detention must be reviewed by the Federal Court. The Federal Court assesses their ongoing detention against the criteria of whether they are a danger in any way to the community and the likelihood of their absconding. The Federal Court can then decide either to release them or to continue to detain them for another 90 days. The Federal Court has the capacity to direct the minister to either release them or to continue to detain them. The Federal Court can also put conditions on the release of the detainees. The amendments provide that, when detainees are released, they are able to work and support their families in the community and are also able to access health services.
The amendments also provide that, if a detainee is found not to be an asylum seeker, this section allows unsuccessful detainees to apply to the Federal Court to be released into the community on a bridging visa while they await removal. Again, while they are in the community they have the capacity, on the visa proposed in the amendments, to work and support their families and to access health services during that period.
Amendment (8) seeks to bring in an independent body to determine whether or not detainees’ detention can continue. I referred to this issue already in my speech in the second reading debate and compared it to the way in which state or federal police forces have a requirement for people who are being detained for a long period to go before a magistrate or a member of the Supreme Court—whatever the various level may be; it varies in all the different jurisdictions. But in respect of almost every other form of detention, there is a requirement that an independent legal body review the ongoing detention. That is what this amendment seeks to do. It potentially means that a large number of people would be released from detention. It would mean there would be a body outside of the department of immigration that would be making determinations about whether people’s ongoing detention should continue. I hope that the amendment will enjoy the support of the chamber.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—In effect, amendments (3) to (8) are what we have been referring to this evening as the Georgiou bill. As I have indicated previously, they did not make it to the House—one does not know whether or not they might have been continued in that way, or amended or changed in some other fashion. In Labor’s view there were a number of problems with their implementation and how they would work. Now that the Greens have sought—I will not use the word ‘adopted’—to progress those amendments in here they still suffer the same problems to do with how they will work effectively.
Broadly, we are supportive of the general thrust of the idea or principle that is behind them. However, we are not in a position where we can actually support the amendments because we do not think the flaws can be overcome in here. As I have said this evening, Labor has its own package of amendments which advances the position significantly from that of the government in respect of this bill.
Parts of these amendments are consistent with amendments that we are proposing as well, so parts of these amendments move towards Labor policy. However, differences lie in the mechanisms and the way they will be implemented. We think that our amendments and the way our mechanisms will work will get to the objectives that we have outlined in a far better way. For example, proposed section 196A is to do with detention of asylum seekers and 196A(7) is related to the role of the Federal Court in reviewing cases where detainees are held for 90 days. Labor agrees that applicants should be reviewed at the 90-day mark and monthly thereafter. However, we believe that this duty is more efficiently fulfilled by the Ombudsman.
Also, these amendments call for the Federal Court to ensure that the person is available for removal if his or her application is unsuccessful. Again, while Labor agrees that people should not be detained unnecessarily, the implementation of such a policy is not really practicable. I suspect that may have been pointed out during the negotiations that we were not privy to. It may have even been recognised by Mr Georgiou himself. This was his opening position, and it may have subsequently changed or been altered by the time it got here or during the process he sought. It is not a case where we can simply say, ‘We will adopt them.’ We do not know what might have happened to them. We have our own amendments which go to the heart of how the process will work. We think they are better structured and will achieve the objective Labor has sought to progress here.
Therefore, as a whole, we do not support the amendments. We would, however, be happy to discuss a couple of the issues. We will get that opportunity during the inquiry into the migration matter itself. I am certain that Senator Nettle will be along to that committee, as will Senator Bartlett. I probably will be, too, and we will have the opportunity of hearing submissions and having a look at some of those issues again.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—Obviously, the government does not support the amendments. There are a couple of reasons for that. The amendments are a repeat of some draft ideas thought up by someone else. I make the point that what is coming from the other end of the chamber is catch-up politics. These are not initiatives that were originally moved or felt passionately enough about or strongly argued enough by people down that opposite end of the chamber. These amendments are now being moved with the idea that they are some sort of embarrassment or something—I do not know. They are certainly not original ideas from the people who are moving them.
I also make the point that the people who did have these ideas in the first instance have had hours and hours of discussion about getting a practical solution. The people who first thought of these ideas and were prepared to move them are happy with the arrangements that have now been put in place. I note that the people who are moving amendments that were originally planned by others have taken no account of what the original creators of those amendments now think. That is not a terribly edifying situation for any party—the Greens or anyone else—to find themselves in.
The next point I would like to make relates to the suggestion that we need judicial oversight. There is a vast amount of litigation covering this area. I made remarks earlier about the efficacy of the advice that is offered to litigants: since most of them lose, it is obviously not very efficacious. I make that point in order to point out that simply providing judicial overview does not necessarily give people a better outcome. It often means that people who are destined to not get a better outcome are simply dragged through the litigious mill. That is often all it means: it is not a magic wand. With respect to the judiciary, we have a fabulous legal system in this country and, by and large, top quality judges. But that is what they should be used as: judges, to decide matters of fact and to interpret the law. To somehow think that you can just wheel in the judiciary every now and then as a second guesser of the executive is a mistake in terms of understanding the separation of powers and what each of their responsibilities actually are.
I want it to be clear on the record that there is plenty of opportunity for review of departmental decisions. That already exists. People may not be happy with it, but it already exists. What is being suggested here—if I can borrow a phrase from Anton Scalia, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and rephrase it—is a judicial mugging of the executive. That is what it is. His phrase originally was ‘a judicial mugging of the legislature’. He is far more conservative than I but, when I heard him speak, I did think I would have gone to more constitutional law classes if he had been teaching them, because he spoke plain English. I understand what ‘a judicial mugging of the legislature’ means and, because of that, I also understand what ‘a judicial mugging of the executive’ means.
We have executive responsibilities, and they have to be carried out. The political system allows for them to be challenged and reviewed. The media, for all their faults, do a pretty good job of checking that. That is not to say that they are perfect all the time—I would be the last person to say that—but they do have a tremendous degree of freedom to query these things. I do not think that a judicial mugging of the executive is appropriate. That is why we are not supporting it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—The Democrats support these amendments as far as they go. As I made the point earlier, the draft Petro Georgiou bills were themselves comprised originally. They certainly do not meet what Democrat policy is. We think the core issue here is, as moved in our second reading amendment, the whole principle of indefinite detention without charge or trial, with decisions surrounding that totally contained within the executive and government officers. I think that is a bad principle and almost inevitably leads to some of the injustices we have seen and heard of in recent times. It is not necessary for departmental officers to be particularly bad people or whatever, but I think that it is almost inevitable that injustices will occur when you have a law that gives so much power with so little proper oversight on something as serious as taking away people’s freedom for a prolonged period of time.
These amendments, whilst they do not precisely match what my ideal solution is, are not something that a few backbenchers just thought about out of nowhere; they broadly reflect the general thrust of recommendations from a range of reports going back quite a number of years. I have mentioned them a few times in speeches in this chamber in the last few weeks, so I will not go into them in detail again. Suffice to say, the general notion of putting some sort of limitation on migration detention and some sort of limitation on how long someone’s freedom can be taken away before that removal of freedom has to be justified in front of some independent body is the general thrust of what has been in any number of reports. That continues to be a goal that I believe is achievable and eminently reasonable.
I do take on board what the minister said about some of the issues to do with what things you get courts and judges to do and not do, but this is detention. Whilst it might be called ‘administrative detention’, you are taking away somebody’s freedom. In terms of the main migration detention centres, you are locking them up in extraordinarily jail-like environments with guards and officers who are, in many cases, actually ex-prison guards and certainly have a prison-type mentality. I contrast it—as I do from time to time—with the mentality of the IOM people at the camp on Nauru. Whilst I am clearly strongly opposed to that camp and believe it should be closed down, there is a difference between people approaching something as imprisonment and confining people, as opposed to people residing somewhere and you are looking after them or you have responsibility for them until you can find a viable solution for them. There is a very different mindset and it manifests itself very differently in how the officers who run the contrasting camps act and the environment and atmosphere that the detainees have to exist within. That is not to say that the camp on Nauru or the IOM are perfect, by any means, but this is not the time for that debate.
The broad principle has been put forward many times in this chamber by the Democrats over a long period of time—back to when mandatory detention was first introduced. The Democrats opposed the introduction of mandatory detention. While others may disagree with that position, I would hope that they would at least concede the consistency in it. The concerns that we have about that principle are probably stronger now than they were then, because we have seen how it is operating in practice. While we support, in a limited way, attempts to ameliorate some of the negatives of that principle as it currently exists under the law, until you actually take that unacceptable principle out of the heart of the law and cast it aside, we will continue to have injustices and continue to have these debates. As I am sure that we will continue to have these debates, I will not go on any more now. I am sure we will be talking about it again some time down the track.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—Not to get too poetic at this reasonably early hour—I think I will save that for later—there is a collection of phrases that I have never forgotten which someone put before me when I was much, much younger. I want you to remember this, Senator Bartlett, because it will come back at some point to what you have just said. It goes like this:
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers—
and the bit I want you to remember, Senator Bartlett, is—
And things are not what they seem.
I am not at liberty to go any further than that. I know it is a bit of a tease, but I want you to remember it, because it will come back to you.
—Okay.
—I like to say something that will keep you thinking.
—That is very deep for this hour.
—I have never forgotten it. It was deep enough to go right in and stay there—and it has stayed there for about 30 years. I have no idea who wrote it, and I do not really care. It is the substance of it that matters.
Senator Bartlett, you remarked that detention centres are prisons. I freely admit that I have not been to a prison, but I do not think they have big green yards or trips to the movies. For example, I do not think that people in the housing projects get to go to the swimming pool or to school et cetera. The analogy is poor. It is true that these people do not have the freedom to leave the detention centres and interact freely in the community, but they do have the freedom to leave Australia. That brings me to my third point. You talk about indefinite detention, and that is not the case. The people in detention are people who the government genuinely believes are here unlawfully. They are entitled to challenge that through the courts. That is not indefinite; that will come to an end.
There is another category of people—and Mr Qasim would fit into this category—who either cannot or will not identify who they are, and that makes it difficult to send them anywhere. Before the negotiations we had very limited capacity to deal with those people, but the new legislation gives us a much greater capacity to handle them. I do not believe that you need any further capacity than that which this legislation provides.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—I have a distinct recollection that the minister was here when I moved the first amendment for the Australian Greens. I said at that time that these are not Greens’ amendments. The Greens’ position was put forward in the second reading amendment that we put up. That was lost. What I said was that we were facilitating the process—that is what we did when we introduced the bills into the parliament this week—to ensure that debate could occur in the Senate, because at that time of the week it seemed that the Prime Minister was intent on ensuring that debate on these issues, which have been publicly debated in the media for about a month, could not occur in the House of Representatives. That was our intention in moving these amendments.
As the minister would know, there is tremendous support behind the private member’s bills put up by Petro Georgiou, and support continues in the community. As I indicated at the beginning of this debate, we are allowing the debate to occur in the parliament by moving the amendments. They are not our position and we have never sought to say that they were, but we have said that we are allowing debate to occur on the issues that have been in the public arena for the last month. We are putting the issues. I have a distinct recollection that the minister was here when I outlined this at the beginning. Perhaps she did not hear what I was saying or perhaps she did not have the grace to hear what I was saying.

The point that I am making is not that you have not acknowledged that they are someone else’s ideas; the point I am making is just that they are someone else’s ideas and not yours.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-23,"—A better world it would be if the minister borrowed somebody else’s ideas instead of implementing her own. She talked about judicial mugging of the legislature. Let me interpret it for you. It is having a go at the law. The judicial mugging comes out of the law of the land catching up with manipulative legislators who want to subvert either the Constitution or the norms of society. Isn’t it always the case that it is the conservatives who end up wanting to do that? The conservatives do not like democracy, do not like the parliament and do not like the judiciary when it catches up with them and says, ‘You observe the Constitution, you observe the international law’—and in this debate we have heard how often laws from this minister transgress international law—‘and you observe international covenants.’ But the minister does not do that and then claims foul when the judiciary says, ‘You must.’ It is thinly veiled disdain for both the democratic system and the legal system in this country that the minister is expressing.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,—The answer to the minister in relation to this amendment went to some of the detail of the bill. That was the argument that was put to Mr Georgiou as to why he should not progress the bill. It seems to have been put with some force today. I wonder whether that argument persuaded him not to adopt it. I think the minister foreshadowed earlier that there may be further amendments in the pipeline.

              (a)    a child aged less than eighteen who is in immigration detention and who has made a valid application under section 36 for a visa or on whose behalf a valid application under section 36 for a visa has been made; and
              (b)    the parent or parents and sibling or siblings, if any, of a child in immigration detention, who is or are also in immigration detention, and who has or have made a valid application under section 36 for a visa.
         (2)    The Judicial Assessor must, in respect of each person to whom this section applies, consider whether, if the person were allowed to leave immigration detention, there would be a significant risk that:
              (a)    the person would represent a danger to the safety or welfare of the Australian community or to a segment of that community; or
              (b)    the person would not be available for the assessment of the application for a visa; or
              (c)    if the application for a visa has been or may be unsuccessful, the person would not be available for removal from Australia.
         (3)    In considering whether there is a significant risk in accordance with paragraph (2)(b) or (c), the Judicial Assessor must take into account the effectiveness and appropriateness of imposing conditions of release which would ensure that, should the person be released from detention, the person would be available for the assessment of the application for a visa or for removal from Australia.
         (4)    The Judicial Assessor must:
              (a)    if satisfied that it is necessary that a person to whom this section applies should remain in immigration detention—advise the Minister accordingly; or
              (b)    if satisfied that it is not necessary that a person to whom this section applies should remain in immigration detention—advise the Minister that a bridging visa should be granted to the person.
         (5)    If the Judicial Assessor advises the Minister that a bridging visa should be granted to a person, the person must be:
              (a)    granted a bridging visa permitting the person to remain in Australia pending the determination of the application for a visa or removal from Australia; and
              (b)    released from immigration detention as soon as practicable.
         (6)    A bridging visa granted under paragraph (5)(a) must provide that the holder is entitled to the same entitlements as are provided under a Bridging R (Class WR) visa.
         (7)    A bridging visa granted under paragraph (5)(a) must provide that the holder must comply with the reasonable conditions, if any, that were recommended by the Judicial Assessor to ensure that the person is available for the assessment of the application for a visa or for removal from Australia.
196E  Act of compassion for temporary protection visa holders
         (1)    If a person is the holder of a temporary protection visa on the date of commencement of this section, the Minister must grant the person a visa permitting the person to remain in Australia permanently.
         (2)    Subsection (1) is to be taken as sufficient authority for the grant of a visa permitting a person to remain in Australia permanently notwithstanding any inconsistency with any other provisions of this Act.
196F  Permanent residence for people who cannot be removed from Australia
         (1)    This section applies to a person who:
              (a)    has been subject to an order for removal for a period of 1095 days following the final determination of a valid application for a visa under section 36; and
              (b)    has been granted a bridging visa pursuant to a recommendation of the Judicial Assessor or otherwise.
         (2)    For the purposes of subsection (1) and to avoid doubt, an application for a visa under section 36 does not include a request to the Minister for a determination under section 48B or for the exercise of the Minister’s power under section 417, 454 or 501J.
         (3)    A person to whom this section applies must be given a visa to remain permanently in Australia unless the Minister reasonably believes that:
              (a)    the person does not pass the character test, as provided for by section 501; or
              (b)    the person unreasonably failed to cooperate with the processes for determining the visa application or for arranging removal from Australia.
         (4)    If the Minister decides to refuse to grant a visa to a person under this section, the Minister must, as soon as practicable after making the decision, give the person a written notice that sets out the decision and the reasons for making it.
         (5)    A person who has been refused a visa under this section may appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
         (6)    A visa granted under this section must provide that the holder is entitled to the same entitlements as are provided under a Bridging R (Class WR) visa.
This amendment is, in effect, the other Georgiou bill. We have had one that related to judicial oversight. This is the other one and it relates to four areas. It was originally labelled ‘the act of compassion’. It relates to long-term detainees, to families and children in detention, to the opportunity for people who are currently on temporary protection visas to permanently reside in Australia, and to people who cannot be removed from Australia and their capacity to reside in the community.
The way in which it seeks to do that is by saying that anybody who is in detention for over one year will have their detention reviewed by a former or serving Federal Court judge or a former Supreme Court judge. They will assessed, again against the same criteria as in the previous series of amendments that were dealt with, to see whether they are a danger to the community and whether they are likely to abscond. There are the same provisions dealing with the type of visa under which they would be released into the community. That visa would allow them to work, support their families in the community and access health services. That provision relates to people who are in detention for over one year. In this amendment the same process is proposed for children and families in detention. It is proposed to have their cases reviewed by the same judicial assessors against the same criteria. If they are released into the community, they will be able to work, support their families and access health services.
I have already described the proposal dealing with temporary protection visas, whereby all people currently on temporary protection visas would be allowed to remain permanently in Australia. The final provision in the amendment relates to when a detainee is found not to be an asylum seeker but has been granted a bridging visa in order to live in the community and has been subject to removal for three years. They will be given a visa to remain permanently in Australia. One other hurdle is proposed in the amendment, which is a character test. This amendment would relate to somebody like Peter Qasim, for example, or to anybody who is found to be stateless. There are a number of Palestinian refugees and Bedouin people who may be found in this situation. The amendment relates to those who cannot be returned to their home country because it is a war zone, such as Afghanistan and Iraq. It also covers people who face persecution for a variety of other reasons. Iranian Christians are one group that comes to mind, but there could be a whole raft of people who do not fit the determination of a refugee but who are found to face persecution elsewhere. The amendment allows them to live in the community.
That is all I have to say about what the amendment does. It goes to those four areas. We support these changes not because they are our policy but because we are advocating changes that have been discussed in the community, in the coalition and in a whole range of different places over the last month. We are putting the amendment forward for debate and for the opportunity to be supported in the Senate. I hope that it is supported.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—Senator Nettle was helpful in providing two parts to the bill to give a bit of focus to this evening’s work. This is the second part of the Georgiou bills which, as Senator Nettle has said, deals with acts of compassion, long-term detainees, families and children. She does not call it the abolition of TPVs, but I think that is the effect of it, because if you give permanent residency to people on TPVs then is there still the ability to have new TPVs? I suspect not. We will not argue semantics. I will call it the abolition of TPVs and attract the criticism of Senator Nettle. Be that as it may.
Labor do not support the amendment moved by Senator Nettle. I think we have made that plain on a number of occasions in respect of the Georgiou bills. Much of the Georgiou bills is supported by Labor in principle. We have said that this evening on a number of occasions. We argue that the mechanisms that Labor have put forward in our amendments—both in the amendments that we moved earlier and in the ones that are yet to be moved—provide for a better process and a better outcome for the migration detention regime. They provide a better outcome for the bill that is currently before us. They will ensure that those people who will be dealt with under the bill will have a much better outcome than under what the government is providing.
As we have indicated earlier, some of the mechanisms that the Georgiou bills have outlined are problematic. It is not known how they would work or whether in fact they would work at all. There are difficulties when you look at how the judicial assessor will deal with those people who might abscond. Those matters have not been worked out clearly in the Greens’ amendment. For those reasons it is not supported. We do not know how the judicial assessor will work in practice. One of the interesting issues that this highlights is that Labor have proposed oversight by the Ombudsman with an end point, not just a filter. But the government’s response to this is to always intervene as a discretion, which not only is a filter but also might lead to no outcome. That is the problem with the government’s position.
The problem with the Greens progressing the Georgiou bills is that the mechanisms may not create favourable circumstances for the people who are going to be most affected—that is, those people who are in detention and who are unlawful noncitizens. The mechanisms put forward by Labor embody a couple of basic tenets. They are there to assist, they are there to have a conclusive outcome and they will ensure that the process works. The mechanisms will ensure that there is some point where it clicks over; in other words, that it does click in and work. The government’s position is still dependent upon what the government might decide. The way it works with their Ombudsman is that there is only a recommendation, effectively; there is no certainty for people that the report will be taken on board. They do not know whether it will be ignored or dealt with at all. The government might argue that that is a good thing, but I am not so sure about that. Labor have put forward, as I have said, a more workable solution, and we remain convinced that it is a preferable position to that which has been put forward by the Greens this evening. For those reasons, we are not in a position to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I will just put on the record again, to make the point, that the Georgiou bills themselves were a compromise initially but, nonetheless, they still contained some positive aspects. This notion of act of grace, act of compassion and that type of thing has been pushed for some time by many refugee advocates in the community, as well as by me, and I tabled a fairly sizeable petition in this place along those lines. It is not as good as abolishing mandatory detention completely, but in the absence of that it is certainly a step forward.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—The government do not support this amendment. Some people have perhaps been a bit harsh when they say that it is a mandatory release provision. We believe the modifications we are making are appropriate. We are giving the minister extra power to handle exceptional cases. We have a new visa to handle people whom, for one reason or another, we cannot remove and who can still go on with litigation when the primary decisions have been made. The minister has another non-compellable power for special circumstances unrelated to the ones I have just mentioned. We believe this can be handled. We do not believe the appropriate solution is mandatory release at 12 months.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—I have some questions for the minister that relate to the obligations of the Ombudsman that are provided for in the bill. Is there any time frame either set out in guidelines or envisaged by the government for the Ombudsman to make their assessment to the minister? I note the time frames for when the Ombudsman must be notified and when the minister must respond. Does the government have any view about how long that process of assessment by the Ombudsman may take? If you do not have a view, maybe you have an idea of how along those kinds of assessments have taken or should take. Does the minister have any comment on that? In the statement on the financial impact of the bill, there was an indication about additional resources to be provided to the Commonwealth Ombudsman in order for them to carry out those duties. Have the government determined what size that additional resourcing will be or do the government have an indication of that, if that is valid?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—Firstly, I think I compliment Senator Nettle by saying that she may have missed her calling. I noticed that, when she was referring, yet again, to the fact that these are someone else’s ideas and not her own and that this was the second of the Georgiou bills, we had the body language that is usually seen from a teacher. Body language is not revealed in Hansard, so, for the purposes of Hansard, I will spell it out. You put your hands out in front of you and say, ‘We had the first bill,’ and you put your hands separately to indicate ‘one bill’ over here; and then you turn a little to the other side and say, ‘And then we had the second bill,’ and by still keeping your hands separate you indicate that there are two ideas. Most of us have got that by the numerical concepts of one and two, but I do appreciate the graphic presentation of it. Senator Nettle, if you ever lose your seat, you could have a very good career in primary school teaching.
Your questions after that were relating to the Ombudsman. As you know, the Ombudsman already has the power to investigate whatsoever he or she chooses. A number of cases are referred to the Ombudsman, and they can do investigations of their own motion. So there is already a very extensive oversight by the Ombudsman. What is being added here is a requirement that the Ombudsman report—a required report—on the department after a matter has not been concluded after a period of time. The resources will be provided. I do not think the level of the resources has been resolved.
I have not heard anyone question the length of time the Ombudsman takes. I am sure the Ombudsman does these things as expeditiously as he or she can. It is an ongoing question. Who guards the guards? is one of the Senate reports that I have been a party to. Who keeps a check on the Ombudsman? Who keeps a check on the Auditor-General? These are very interesting questions. The Auditor-General has looked at some issues, and the report has come out four months later and is, frankly, useless in a political sense because the moment has passed. Who does that check on the Auditor-General? Who says, ‘Thanks very much, but producing a report four months later is a bit useless’? Who keeps a check on the Ombudsman and the Auditor-General is an interesting question. Not many people are interested in that. I am, but I have not heard anyone query or suggest that the Ombudsman has been lax before, and we do not think they are either. We think they will do it as expeditiously as they can.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Nettle’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—I think it has been a very long time since unaccompanied minors have been in detention and certainly in detention centres. They are largely in foster care. We certainly do not have any unaccompanied minors at the moment in detention centres. With respect to children, I simply put on record that it was the Liberal Party that introduced housing projects. They were never there under the previous government when hundreds of kids were in detention. I would just make the point that, for a variety of reasons—not only because of my own intervention, but partly because of it—there are now half the number of kids in detention centres that there were when I got the job.
I acknowledge what Senator Ludwig says. I do not think he is right in making the assessment that he says the Labor Party has made—that is, that I am lacking in compassion. But he is right in saying—although I might choose different words—that he cannot see where that exercise of compassion is. I have covered that in this place before, but I will briefly refer to it. When people seek ministerial intervention, if they do not have a very successful case or a doubtful case, it does happen—not necessarily more often than not—that they seek media intervention. They seek media intervention because every case for ministerial intervention is a sad case. That is simply because they have been through all of the processes and had all of the reviews by tribunals and judicial officers and they have been given a no. But they still desperately want to stay in Australia, so they seek ministerial intervention. To get a no from that is, of course, a very sad situation. Legally it might be quite appropriate, perhaps, but personally it is sad. We all know that newspapers, radio stations and TV outlets love a sad story because it sells papers.
On the other hand, those people who have a good case less frequently go to the media. But, more importantly, whether they go to the media or not, there are good cases. I have not to this point thought it appropriate to try to find a way to highlight the number of people who have had the benefit of ministerial intervention. I can think of one case—I cannot remember now whether it was a 351 or a 417—of a young child who was destined not to get the appropriate health care in his country. That health care was a transplant. I was delighted to have the opportunity to help that family. I can think of another child who had some very sad circumstances with respect to the death of his mother and associated with his father and who we were able to help. Another child who came here had a father who was either deceased or ticked off and we do not know which it was. He was from your state of Queensland, Senator Ludwig. He was found by another mother, who had the sense to offer this boy some sort of hospitality to get his confidence. She finally got him to deal with child-care authorities, who put in an intervention request. We were very pleased to give that boy, very quickly, a visa to stay in Australia. There is no reason that this kid should have been living in parks for 18 months or so not knowing where his parents were. I could go on.
Turning my mind to the way I can do this without doing what some do; that is, inviting TV cameras into their life to drum up a story—a tear-jerker story, positive or otherwise—to influence intervention. I have had to be very careful to ensure that I was not misusing the opportunity I have been given to help these people, in a political way by inviting them to participate in some media opportunity. I can assure you there are plenty there, but I want to put on record that I understand that you cannot see them.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—Given the time and the reality of what is going to happen I will process, rather than go through, some of my arguments, which are not dissimilar to what I have already said, and just indicate that we will support these amendments.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—by leave—I move Labor amendment (10) on sheet 4623:
(10)  Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 23), after item 18, insert:
18A  Before Part 9
insert:
Part 8BA—Inspector-General of Detention
486KA  Inspector-General of Detention
As soon as practicable after this section commences, the Minister must appoint a person as the Inspector-General of Detention (the Inspector-General).
486KB  Functions of Inspector-General of Detention
         (1)    The functions of the Inspector-General are to:
              (a)    receive and make determinations concerning complaints from persons in immigration detention; and
              (b)    pay particular attention to the needs of children in immigration detention, in community care or in residence at a place specified under section 197AB; and
              (c)    consider general or systemic matters the Inspector-General decides of his or her own volition to consider; and
              (d)    consider all matters the Minister directs the Inspector-General to consider.
         (2)    For the purpose of this section, in immigration detention means being detained in a place accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition of immigration detention in subsection 5(1).
486KC  Exercise of functions of Inspector-General of Detention
         (1)    The Secretary must ensure that the Inspector-General is given unrestricted access to:
              (a)    detention centres and immigration processing facilities (including those on Christmas Island); and
              (b)    detainees; and
              (c)    the staff of the Department or of private contractors employed at detention centres or immigration processing facilities; and
              (d)    all records relevant to a complaint made under section 486KB.
         (2)    The Inspector-General may make a finding about any matter considered by the Inspector-General.
         (3)    The Secretary must take action to give effect to any finding made by the Inspector-General.
This is one of the main areas where the Labor Party has been arguing for an independent, formalised review system. Labor’s amendment seeks to establish an independent inspector-general of detention centres. The inspector-general will be able to enter detention centres, community care facilities and settings, and immigration processing facilities; receive and resolve individual complaints from detainees; and monitor conditions.
It goes one step further because, when you look at the work that HREOC did when they went to detention centres and produced their report, you will see that they could not then take the next step. Instead, they could only make recommendations to government, and government at that time did not listen, much to my disappointment. In this amendment the minister, in addition, would also be able to direct the inspector-general to inquire into a detention issue and receive recommendations about it; so the inspector-general will have not only that power but also the power to enter, receive and resolve individual complaints. It gives a much better system of ensuring that there are better outcomes for those people who are detained.
The government’s bill does not provide a systematic way in which detention centres, community care facilities and the needs of applicants that have been detained for any given period of time can be fairly and independently reviewed. Introduction of an inspector-general would illustrate a true willingness by the government to operate a transparent and fair mandatory detention system. In light of many recent revelations of mismanagement at detention centres, other wrongful detentions and information not being passed through proper channels or not at all, an independent intermediary is required on an ongoing basis to monitor conditions and resolve complaints. When Mr Georgiou was perhaps of a more open mind, before he came to the Howard-Georgiou compromise, if I can call it that, he said:
... no government department has greater unscrutinised power over people’s lives than the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ...
He went on to say:
... I do not believe that it is acceptable to leave decisions about detentions in the hands of DIMIA officials without additional independent scrutiny and intervention.
The only matter I would raise in respect of that is that I think he overconcerned himself with the department and not with the minister, in that instance. Perhaps for his own particular reasons he did not.
This amendment would also minimise situations such as female detainees being viewed in the shower or toilet by male guards, as are some of the allegations that have been made, and the placement of detainees in management cells without justification or scrutiny for weeks at a time. Of course, that also ensures employees of those detention centres, the department and their officials have safeguards in place. Earlier, Minister Vanstone commented that she was ‘satisfied with the detention system’ after revelations of systemic failure in immigration detention. The minister went on to comment: ‘I am sure that there are systems that can be made to improve.’
We have taken that comment on board and taken it to heart, and only under Labor will there be an adequate, fair and transparent immigration system. Currently there are no regular systematic performance audits that are made available or public. There are no independent review mechanisms for detainees’ situations and complaints that are made available. They certainly may be in place or exist, but there are certainly none that we are aware of. Many of the recent detention dramas illustrate the many issues of concern about the management, operation and administration of detention centres. Under the current government and Mr Howard’s proposed changes it remains inadequate and inappropriate and still there is no accountability and no transparency.
Labor’s proposed inspector-general of detention would not solve the problem but it would rectify many of the chronic problems inherent in the detention system. In particular the inspector-general would pay particular attention to the needs of children in immigration detention—it should not be a case of there being fewer children; there should be none unless, as I have indicated before, there is a very good reason—and receive and make determinations concerning complaints from detainees. This is in line with the Labor Party’s policy of a humane, dignified and transparent approach to immigration detention.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—I thank the senator for his contribution. First of all I want to put on record that I strongly disapprove of the albeit smoothly delivered but nonetheless personal attack on Mr Palmer by way of suggestion that he may have, for his own political reasons, not said something that the Labor Party might have preferred him to say. I am happy to leave it until the Palmer report comes out for people to judge whether or not Mr Palmer is his own and an independent person. I personally see it as an unsatisfactory contribution in the Senate when an aspersion is cast on someone before they have even had the chance to speak. We have seen a bit of this denigration through the media—no doubt it will continue. It is not quite as vacuous as some of the comments made earlier tonight from the other end, but it is not attractive in any event.
As to the question of an independent inspector-general, the Ombudsman is there. I have not heard any argument that the Ombudsman is not independent. He was there under the Labor Party; he is there under us. No-one has made the case that the Ombudsman is not independent. No-one has disputed the fact that anyone can take a complaint to the Ombudsman. No-one has disputed the fact that the Ombudsman can, of his own motion, carry out an investigation. No-one has disputed the fact that, to the best of my knowledge, the Ombudsman has never been denied access to any information that he has required to be given. No-one has acknowledged in the debate on this amendment that we have enhanced and highlighted the role of the Ombudsman.
In other words, the caretaker is already there. Frankly, to appoint another one seems to me to simply ensure that you have another body, another public servant who is the personnel person, more cars, more phones, more officers and no better job done than is already being done by the Ombudsman. This in itself is a criticism of the existing Ombudsman, and I have not heard the case for that criticism made out. The access is there; the opportunity is there. It is all there. No case at all has been made out to say that what is happening at the moment with regard to scrutiny is inadequate. In order to make that case out, someone has to say that the Ombudsman has not used the powers that he or she has. That case has not been made out.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—With regard to Mr Palmer, we can sweep that debate aside if you would confirm that he will make his report public. If you answer that in the affirmative, I will take the criticisms that you have levelled at the Labor Party about Mr Palmer. I think Mr Palmer is an excellent person. It is not about him personally—and I have been very careful about saying that in this debate. I have met him a number of times before. It is not about his qualifications or his job; it is about the report, the inquiry, the way you set it up and what should have been done. It has always been the case that we have put it that way.
With regard to the Ombudsman, the view that the Labor Party have expressed is the concern that the Ombudsman’s determinations in terms of this detention bill before us are non-binding: you do not have to take into consideration what the Ombudsman recommends or does; it is simply not binding. That is the point we make. If you make them binding and say: ‘We’ll make them binding; not only will we have them reported to us but we will then do something about them,’ that might go some way to ameliorating the situation. Alternatively, explain why you will not. That might assist in the debate as well.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—I can respond briefly to both of those points. Firstly, with regard to Mr Palmer, it is not my view that you can weasel out of the remark on ‘his own political reasons’ by saying, ‘It’s a question of whether he’ll make it public; that’s all I was really saying.’ The words ‘his own political reasons’ do not go to publication or otherwise of his report; they go directly, specifically and clearly to whether Mr Palmer would let some political views he may or may not have be brought to bear on his report. No amount of dancing around can change those words, and I do not take what you have just said to be any withdrawal at all of your remarks. I feel confident that Mr Palmer would not either. Nonetheless, let us let that pass, because he is a grown man and I am sure he can handle it, but let us not pretend for the record here that you have done anything other than make a very specific and direct accusation that this man, whom your party appointed and my party reappointed and who has worked as police commissioner in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Federal Police—he has trained as a lawyer and as a police officer and is pretty good at change management—may be using his own political views and bringing them to bear on his report. That is what you have done, and you have not taken it back.
The second point you make is in relation to the non-bindingness of the Ombudsman’s reports as they may be at the moment. With respect, you have approached this subject with a degree of frankness that surprises me. It is the same degree of frankness that Senator Nettle brought when she, as I indicted, displayed her own vacuity by indicating that she was just trouncing out someone else’s ideas. Senator, what you have done by saying that the Ombudsman is not helpful unless his determinations are binding is indicate the incompetence—
—I did not say that. You added words to that.
—I did not interrupt you, Senator. We are not having a debate without the Hansard; hopefully we are having it in a civilised and ordered manner. What are the consequences of saying, ‘The Ombudsman’s not much chop unless his determinations are binding’? What is the purpose of an ombudsman’s report? It is so that someone who is independent can put an alternative view and it can be debated publicly and politically. If an opposition come to the point where they then say, ‘The government must be bound by the Ombudsman’s report,’ they are doing two things. First of all, they are saying that there should be some sort of ombudsman’s mugging of the executive but, I think, more damaging than that—because we can handle that argument—is that they are admitting their own incompetence or impotence. You have a report by an independent authority put out there into the political field and what you are saying is: ‘We the opposition couldn’t possibly make anything of it. If the Ombudsman had an adverse finding, we couldn’t do anything with it; we’re hopeless.’ I can see why you might come to that conclusion. If you are really saying that you want an independent ombudsman to do your job, Senator, you are battling.
—Ask Cornelia Rau what she thinks.
—I have read the papers on what has happened over the last few days, and I will resist comment on that. The temptation is too great and the debate might go on for too long. But I hope you take this as genuinely as it is meant: the solution to the political problems of parliaments, who are there to keep a check on the executive, is not to subcontract out to someone else so that other people can sit in here, be the opposition and not do their job. That is not the solution. The Ombudsman is a tool that is there for the community and particularly the opposition because the Ombudsman will provide an independent assessment of what the executive has done. If we are now in a position where the Labor Party throw up their hands and say: ‘Oh, look, even with all that help we can’t do it. Make the Ombudsman be the executive instead!’ it is a damning indictment of your incompetence, Senator.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-23,"—When the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs gets it wrong, she really does get it sensationally wrong. The Ombudsman is a concept from Scandinavia to help deal with ministerial and bureaucratic bungling. It is not to be toothless but to be empowered so that its findings can be utilised through the court system to bring that bungler—whoever it might be—to justice. What we have here, however, are a minister and a government who do not accept that that is the way ombudsmen work. She is saying: ‘Well, on this occasion, to make it look good in public’—and Prime Minister Howard signed off on this, and I pity the minister because she has to try to argue his outcome—‘there will be a judgment made by the Ombudsman.’ However, on this occasion there is no action that can be taken on the judgment when it arrives, except a political debate.
So, having had a go at the judiciary and the parliament, we now have the government devaluing the office of the Ombudsman in this country. The minister would know that the Ombudsman does not report to the minister as such, and was never meant to, but reports to the parliament because it is not a position to be politicised. Its position is to defend the public interest against politicians, particularly ministers and bureaucracies. But on this occasion the government is legislating differently so that does not occur. What happens is that you get an Ombudsman’s report and that is where it ends. You can have a political debate, but no empowerment beyond that. In particular, you do not give the parliament the power to act on that report.
If this were genuine and the Ombudsman made an adverse finding, it would be regulated in this parliament and then it would be up to the parliament to allow or disallow that finding—but not this government, because they do not trust parliament, and they particularly do not trust a parliament in which they are going to have a one-seat majority in the forthcoming Senate. Do you know why? Because they do not trust each other. So there is not going to be a disallowable instrument, as it is called, companioning the Ombudsman’s finding. The minister says, ‘There will be a political debate.’ What a failure to understand the office of the Ombudsman, to understand its relationship with parliament and, above all, to understand that the parliament is elected. Not the executive, not the ministers, not even the Prime Minister; the parliament is elected. This government have shied away from the idea that parliament is supreme because they believe the executive should reign supreme. That is what this legislation does: it says the executive can accept or reject a report of the Ombudsman and parliament will be sidelined with no power to act. That is why the amendments are here and that is the point that the minister either does not understand or does not want to confront.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—Senator Brown obviously has a different view about the role of parliament.
—You’re right. You got it!
—How insightful the senator is this evening! He apparently sees parliament as an impotent debating society. He has not recognised the power the parliament has, which is not always to substitute one executive decision for another decision made by parliament. But it has the power to raise issues to such a point that it becomes imperative, in the political environment we live in, for the executive to change its view or to act. There can be no better example of that than this debate. The senator sits down calmly with his legs crossed and his hands on his lap as he is comfortable in the knowledge that he did not start this debate. He had nothing to do with it.
—I had a lot to do with it.
—Nothing to do with it whatsoever. It reminds me of something that a former colleague of mine once told me—he was then the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—that I had occasion to reflect on recently in my capacity as a minister because it relates to ministers as much as it does to members of parliament. Senator Fred Chaney said to me: ‘Members of parliament have got all the power they need. They just have to have the courage and the sense to use it.’ If there are people here who do not understand how to use the power they have, it is unacceptable, in my view, to say, ‘Give it to someone else.’ If you do not understand that, Senator, that is fair enough, but I can assure you that when you do you will be a lot more effective.
I had occasion to think recently that this applies to ministers as well. I am not going to give you the details, but there was an occasion recently when I was very, very uncomfortable with the proposition in my head that there was potentially a wrong and I could fix it, leave it or go to a halfway mark. That is what each of us has to face up to in our jobs. Ministers are different from members of parliament, but my view is that we all have as much power as we need. What we have to have is the strength and the wit to use it, and you do not get that by giving your power to someone else.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-23,"—The minister can be very silly at times and to imply that we all have equal power and that Mr Chaney—and I have the greatest respect for Fred Chaney—would believe that everybody has the same amount of power; it is just a matter of how they use it—
—I didn’t say that.
—I did not say you said it; I said you implied it—and you did. I think it points to how silly this minister can be when she does not want to argue the facts about the Ombudsman that I put before the chamber. What we are saying is: ‘Let’s empower the parliament to allow or disallow the Ombudsman’s recommendations. Let’s give him the equal power that the minister talks about.’ What she will do is vote that down.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I assume that this bill will come back later tonight in any case as a message. The government is not going to accede to all of the amendments that have been passed, and there have been a few. I think this might be one of those occasions when I have been swayed by the debate and the course of history has been changed, although I guess the end result will be the same and that the government will reject any amendments. But I actually agree with the minister’s argument in relation to this amendment. As things stand at the moment with the detention system and the number of people in it and everything else, I do not see the value of having an inspector-general of detention on top of everything else. I am not convinced it would be necessary at this point. So never let it be said that a few well-chosen words cannot influence other people, because I am not of a mind to support this amendment.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Ludwig’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (11) to (16) on sheet 4623:
(11)  Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 2), omit “2 years”, substitute “90 days”.
(12)  Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 10), omit “2 years”, substitute “90 days”.
(13)  Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 11), omit “2 years”, substitute “90 days”.
(14)  Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 15), omit “2 years” (twice occurring), substitute “90 days”.
(15)  Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 22), omit “6 months”, substitute “one month”.
(16)  Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 31), omit “6 months”, substitute “one month”.
These amendments relate to the debate in respect of the Ombudsman. These amendments would mean that the Ombudsman would report on every detainee whose application has not been determined after 90 days and on a monthly basis from then on. These amendments provide for the Ombudsman to undertake an independent review and report on these cases. Such a review must be completed within 90 days and on a monthly basis thereafter under Labor’s proposed amendments. This is consistent with Labor’s policy of seeking to determine 90 per cent of claims within 90 days. That is the only effective way you are going to get a beneficial outcome for unlawful noncitizens who are detained. The Ombudsman’s recommendations will be made public and laid before parliament. If the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs does not accept the recommendations, the minister will be required to provide an explanation before parliament. That is the nub of the process. It does not mean that, as in the bill that is before us, they will simply be tabled.
Unlike the government’s bill, in our amendments the two periods of waiting before action are based on the objectives of fast and fair processing, transparency and accountability. They also ensure that justification must be given to parliament if the minister refuses to take up the recommendations of the report, thereby removing the ability to hide behind the non-compellable power of the minister. It avoids unnecessary and prolonged detention and ensures a humane system which is not punitive. In the government’s bill, on the other hand, until two years of detention have passed detainees are denied the right to challenge detention and have no independent review mechanisms for issues that arise. The Ombudsman only intervenes in cases where a person has been in detention for two years or longer. You have got to question whether this is an unnecessarily prolonged, drawn-out and arbitrary approach.
The tabling of reports detailing failures to meet time limits does not provide a remedy for the breaching of time limits—we are not suggesting they should, but they do not under the current detention regime and so there is no basis on which to say that that is a fair or equitable system. The process may be sped up, but there is no certainty provided in it. I do not think the minister has grappled with this. However, if you look at the detail in the amendments, we are not saying that the Ombudsman’s report is binding. We are not saying that there should be a mandatory execution of each recommendation made by the Ombudsman. The amendments go to the detail of what we have been putting, and I have outlined how that operation would work.
It is clear that it is still a matter for government—government has not lost its ability to make decisions as the executive. No-one is walking away from the ability of government to hold the decision-making power. But government should be in a position to explain in parliament the decision-making process. It should be open and transparent. I accept that the minister argues on occasion that if I could see inside the black box I might see fairness and equity, although certainly not transparency. That could be the case—I do not know. I can only argue for a fair, transparent and open system. That is the only system that Labor would progress.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-23,"—In response to that I would like to say a couple of things. It is of interest to me that it is being put that the government can see the value of an Ombudsman’s report that is not binding for 90 days but cannot see the value in two years; that somehow the Ombudsman is impotent after a two-year report but quite useful for a 90-day one. I am a bit lost, Senator Ludwig. If you were trying to confuse me, you have succeeded, because I cannot make the jump that the time difference is that critical—that somehow an Ombudsman’s report is not useful at two years but it is at 90 days. But let us put that aside, because you might have some other reasons for that.
The basic practicality of this is one of the very serious problems. By and large, most people who put a claim in for protection are dealt with in 90 days anyway. I realise this does not relate only to people who are seeking protection, but that is a diminishing case load. We hope to keep it a diminishing case load (a) by dealing with the case load that we have got and (b) by stopping it increasing—stopping the inflow—which will leave us, as we are now, largely dealing with a compliance case load. A very significant portion of those—I think it is towards 50 per cent, if not over—are dealt with in under this time because they have gone. The reason they have gone is that they have already overstayed their visa, they have had bridging visas—some of them on a condition that they leave—and they get caught for one reason or another. They are in the smaller group who do get detained and we just have to get documents or something to get them to go.
Nonetheless, there is a baseline case load of compliance people who do present difficulties—people who come in on one passport and then announce that that was false and they have another identity; they only used the false passport because they had to to get out of their country or for whatever other reason they want to suggest—and, with respect to some countries, it can take significant time to actually get to the bottom of the matter. If you adopted this you would end up with a recurring turnover of the same issue—added to which, 90 days is not that long for the difficult cases. As I say, we get most of them out in that time. The expectation is that we should be able to do that. But, for these cases that I am thinking of, part of the reason that they are there for more than 90 days is that we cannot get the facts—and neither will the Ombudsman be able to. If the Ombudsman can get more facts than us that would be a good thing, but I am sure in this respect that he could not get more facts.
So I think this will be a bureaucratic nightmare. By the time the Ombudsman starts his inquiry, the person will presumably have gone—or, if they are one of the harder cases, they will be there next time under the same circumstances because the reasons are beyond our control. Another example is people who come here and overstay a visa. They might have a couple of kids and then they have two or three more. They do not register them in the country that would be the child’s citizenship country—because it is certainly not an Australian citizenship—and the process of registration takes some time. All of this is a bureaucratic nightmare, particularly when you already have the capacity for the Ombudsman to make a report either on his own motion because advocates have put it before him or because an advocate is aware of something that they think is unsatisfactory and they take it to the Ombudsman. I really put it no higher than that, Senator.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—If I say I agree with the minister we will probably have another division, so it might save time if I agree with the ALP, given it is all going to be the same thing in the end. So I think I will do that.
—Could you just put it on record anyway? If you put your view on record we will not call a division. We will just say it is a miscall.
—Perhaps I could just say that, based on the contributions to date, I think the minister has made the more compelling case. Nonetheless, in the interests of a wide range of broader factors, I recognise some of the underlying components of the position put forward by the Labor Party spokesperson and, taking all of those things into account—not the least of which is the time—we will vote for the Labor Party amendment in this case.

Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise today to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No.1) Bill.
This bill deals with a range of taxation issues. I will deal with them individually.
Schedule 1 is the introduction of a fringe benefits tax exemption for the engagement of a relocation consultant, a ‘personal digital assistant’ and portable printers. These changes are expected to have an ‘unquantifiable but insignificant’ financial impact.
Schedule 2 contains changes to the depreciation rates for large vehicles such as buses, light commercials and trucks. The schedule caps the effective life of these vehicles at between 7.5 and 10 years. This allows a greater depreciation deduction in the first few years after the post-1 January 2005 acquisition of a large vehicle.
The Democrats have been lobbied about the effective life of buses. We note that the Taxation Office has deemed the effective life of a bus to be around 15 years. The legislative change to deem the effective life to be 7.5 years will allow businesses to purchase buses in a more tax-effective manner. The result should be that we have more newer, cleaner and environmentally safe buses on the road and accordingly this is a change that the Democrats strongly support.
Schedule 3 introduces a GST integrity measure dealing with the supply of rights or options offshore. This measure targets a scheme in which offshore tourism operators were selling Australian package holidays and recouping GST on the onshore component of the costs such as accommodation and transport. This schedule increases revenue by $110m per year.
The Senate Economics Committee considered the impact of the original schedule and concluded that the original measure in the bill would cause an undue compliance burden on offshore suppliers of Australian holidays. The government has now introduced amendments allowing offshore suppliers to ‘opt out’ of the Australian GST system.
Despite this, ATEC, the Australian Tourism Export Council, is still not happy with the outcome. They argue that the differential in GST treatment may result in Australian tour packages being one to two per cent cheaper if sold offshore.
However, the government amendments remove the compliance difficulties and remove the GST anomaly which created a 10 per cent price differential in favour of offshore tour operators. Accordingly the Democrats will be supporting this measure.
Schedule 4 introduces the mature age worker tax offset. This is a maximum rebate of $500 for the workers over 55 earning income under $58,000. This was an election commitment. The cost of schedule 4 is around $480 million per year. This is a significant amount of money, however, like other Treasury costings it ignores the incentive for more mature workers to stay in the work force.
This is the actual intention of the measure and, we support this intention. Accordingly, the beneficial impact of the additional tax revenue generated and reduced pension payments is likely to offset the $480 million year.
Labor have circulated a second reading amendment. The Democrats do not support that.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-06-23,"—I will sum up the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005 on behalf of the government. I thank all senators who have taken part in the debate on this bill. It continues the government’s program of modifications and improvements to the tax laws, providing greater flexibility to taxpayers in managing their affairs. Firstly, the bill amends the simplified imputation system, allowing private companies, in certain situations, to pay franked dividends during the income year in which they first incur an income tax liability.
By way of background to the next measure, the new superannuation safety arrangements commenced on 1 July 2004 with a two-year transitional period. New licensing requirements for trustees of superannuation funds evolved from these arrangements. In order for funds to meet the new licensing requirements, they can merge with other funds. However, merging would normally give rise to a capital gains tax liability or loss. The measure in this bill provides an automatic CGT rollover for the transfer of assets. A rollover is also available when assets are transferred to one or more superannuation entities whose trustees are not licensed at the time of the transfer but where it is reasonable to assume that they will be licensed by 1 July 2006. Conversely, if the trustees do not acquire the required licence by 1 July 2006, the rollover will be treated as if it had not happened.
The third measure allows capital allowance deductions for expenditure incurred in acquiring indefeasible rights of use over domestic telecommunications cables and expenditure on acquiring telecommunications site access rights, thereby facilitating the sharing of telecommunications infrastructure within the telecommunications industry and, furthermore, decreasing inefficient replication of infrastructure. The fourth measure simplifies the rules for pay-as-you-go instalment payers to move from annual to quarterly instalments by allowing taxpayers who become ineligible to pay annual pay-as-you-go instalments during an income year to commence paying quarterly instalments in the first quarter of the following income year. This measure reduces compliance costs and increases certainty for taxpayers. Schedule 5 lists several new organisations as deductible gift recipients. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities.
The sixth measure amends the GST act to remove unintended outcomes that arise from the interaction of various provisions of the act, allowing property owners to reduce their GST liability on supplies of real property. It ensures that entities joining a GST group have appropriate adjustments to input tax credits and addresses certain aspects regarding the application of the margin scheme. The government has decided to carry out further consultation with industry on proposed new rules for calculating the margin for the supply of real property that was initially acquired as a GST-free going concern or GST-free farmland. This will ensure that the margin scheme applies appropriately to suppliers of real property.
The seventh measure of the bill will amend the income tax law so that superannuation annuities split on marriage breakdown can be taxed in the same way as other superannuation benefits are taxed on marriage breakdown. In addition, some minor anomalies in the income tax law relating to superannuation benefits which are split on marriage breakdown will be corrected. The final measure of the bill will remove the condition that contributions to approved worker entitlement funds must be required under an industrial instrument in order to be eligible for an exemption from fringe benefits tax. Instead, it will be enough if the industrial instrument creates the obligation to make the payment but does not specify that it has to go to an approved fund. Also, the transitional arrangements for the FBT exemption from certain contributions to worker entitlement funds will be extended by one year. In concluding, I suggest to the Senate that the measures proposed in this bill will make the taxation regime more equitable in a number of ways. For these reasons, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,43,1

Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

I rise today to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No.2) Bill.
This bill deals with a range of taxation issues. I will deal with them individually. Schedule 1 amends the simplified imputation system to ensure that, in certain situations, private companies that pay franked distributions will not have their franking deficit tax offset reduced in respect of the income year in which they first incur an income tax liability. The Democrats support this compliance measure. It will have no financial impact on the Federal Budget.
Schedule 2 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide an automatic capital gains tax (CGT) roll-over for the transfer of assets of registrable superannuation entities that merge during the transitional period to comply with licensing requirements under superannuation safety reforms.
The CGT roll-over ensures that the capital gain or capital loss that would otherwise be recognised when the transfer of assets occurs is disregarded and that the recognition of the accrued capital gain or loss is deferred until later disposal of the assets by one or more successor registrable superannuation entity trustees. I understand that this licensing must be completed by 1 July 2006 and this is one of the reasons for the urgency in this bill. Again, this measure has no financial impact and is supported by the Democrats.
Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide appropriate taxation treatment of expenditure incurred on acquiring certain telecommunications rights. It has a minor cost to revenue of around $14m over four years. Note the comments of the Parliamentary Libraries’ concluding comment to the bills Digest states:
“It is a policy decision for the Government to determine whether telecommunications carriers and service providers should be provided the effective taxation deduction enabled by this legislation, given their past history of slow cable system rollout. There is a public policy argument in that, as long as the bulk of the population is denied affordable broadband access, carriers should be encouraged to quickly provide quality communications.”
This Schedule removes some of the inconsistency in the taxation treatment of telecommunication rights and, accordingly it is supported by the Democrats.
Schedule 4 simplifies the transition from annual PAYG payments to quarterly PAYG payments. It has no impact on the revenue and is supported by us.
Schedule 5 updates the list of deductible gift recipients. The new funds include Freedom Across Australia, the Rotary Leadership Victoria Australian Embassy for Timor-Leste Fund Limited, National Police Memorial, Page Research Centre Limited, and the Russian Welfare Aid to Russia Fund. The Democrats support this measure.
Schedule 6 to this bill amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to prevent entities from reducing or eliminating their goods and services tax (GST) liability on supplies of real property through unintended outcomes arising from the interaction of a number of special rules in the Act. It also clarifies the operation of the margin scheme and ensures entities joining a GST group have appropriate adjustments to input tax credits. The Government has introduced a range of technical amendments to this Schedule which the Democrats will be supporting.
Schedule 7 ensures the appropriate taxation treatment for superannuation assets that have been split upon marriage breakdown. It is expected to have a ‘very small’ impact on revenue.
Schedule 8 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to remove the condition that contributions to approved worker entitlement funds must be required under an industrial instrument in order to be eligible for an exemption from fringe benefits tax (FBT). It has been the most controversial aspect of the bill, primarily because the change does not remove the FBT problem for Western Australian employers.
We have received representations from the WA Construction Industry Redundancy Fund raising concerns that Schedule 8 dealing with FBT and Worker Entitlement Funds did not adequately correct an anomaly as intended. The Master Builders Association of Western Australia also wrote to me saying that the “This bill will have a negative and unfair impact on the operation WA Construction Industry Redundancy Fund.”
We asked for this to be looked at in the Senate Inquiry but were told that because other parts of the bill were urgent, this was not possible.
We then put forward, what we considered to be a reasonable amendment which would have solved the problem for WA employers; it must be remembered that it is the employers that will pay any FBT liability if this bill is ineffective, however, the Government, did not support this.
Accordingly, we have agreed to a compromise proposal that permits a further twelve month transition. This will give time for the matter to be satisfactorily resolved. I understand that WA employers and the Construction Industry Redundancy Fund are comfortable with this result.
The Democrats will be supporting this bill.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-06-23,"—As I am not quite gone—give me a few hours—I rise to speak on the Superannuation Bill 2005 and the Superannuation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2005. The Democrats will be supporting this legislation. It is a matter that has been around for quite a long time. In fact, the question of closing down the Public Service scheme to new entrants has been around for the whole period of this government. I am very pleased that, with this legislation, the government has done it the right way—that is, it has reached an agreement with the Community and Public Sector Union and the other unions in the area to ensure that this is done in a way that does not disadvantaged any employees; in fact, it advantages them.
This legislation provides significant advantages to new employees of the Public Service after 1 July because they will have complete control over where they put their superannuation. Their superannuation will be fully funded and paid upfront, and they will have complete control over where it goes, even after they leave the Public Service. That is a huge advantage compared with the current unfunded scheme, which results in the government paying out the employer contribution of super only when a person retires. For former Commonwealth employees, like me, that results in their superannuation being preserved until age 60, accumulating at the CPI rate, and it cannot be transferred to another fund. On behalf of the many hundreds of thousands of people who are in the same boat as me—although I will add that the CPI has been much better than the superannuation fund’s performance for the last three or four years, and I am thankful to the Commonwealth government for that—it makes much more sense to give people much more control over where their superannuation goes and much more control over where it goes after they leave employment. Also, importantly, it ensures that superannuation liabilities are kept under control by the government paying as they go.
This is a very welcome advance in superannuation policy for the public sector, and the Democrats will support it. The only tiny concern I have—and this is from someone who is interested in the development of national savings in this country—is that, with the shift to a 15.4 per cent employer contribution, the requirement for the employee to make a contribution, which exists under the current public sector scheme, will be lost. I hope that future public servants will decide to put away a little more of their own money, as they do now—between two per cent and 10 per cent—as a co-contribution into the fund of their choice. That will be a matter for them to decide, but I certainly believe—and it is of tiny concern—that, as a result of this measure, whilst people have more control over their retirement savings, they may end up with less retirement savings because requirements to make that voluntary co-contribution will no longer be there. That is a decision that each and every person must make. I certainly urge the Commonwealth and the unions in this area to educate people, to encourage them to make co-contributions in their own right, because ultimately they will be better off. With that small caveat, I wish to indicate that the Democrats will be supporting these bills.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,44,1

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—We are dealing with the Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 1) 2005. This is the first in a series of bills that will apply as a result of the Treasury review of the income tax self-assessment system. This particular bill, if my memory serves me correctly, deals with but six of about 54 recommendations. It reduces the interest payable on tax shortfalls—in other words, moneys owed to the Taxation Office—by four per cent. It provides the tax commissioner with greater powers to remit penalties and requires him to explain why a penalty has not been remitted, and it clarifies the definition of a reasonably arguable position. All of those things improve equity for affected taxpayers.
The Senate Economics Legislation Committee examined this bill. Both the committee and senators such as me, who deal with the taxation area, have had a large number of letters and submissions from taxpayers seeking for this bill to apply retrospectively. These taxpayers appear to have entered into a range of mass-marketed tax avoidance schemes in the 1990s that were subsequently considered by the Taxation Office to not provide the taxation benefits that the promoters had promised. The vast majority accepted an ATO settlement that no interest or other penalties apply. I will say again that those people were greatly assisted by the Senate inquiry and the subsequent negotiations conducted by Labor, the coalition and the Democrats with the ATO. That resulted in nearly $800 million worth of relief, by my calculation. About 38,000 people—87 per cent—accepted an ATO settlement.
There has been a campaign for these measures to apply retrospectively. In a number of cases that is meant as genuinely all the way back to 1987, and to 1994 in some of the submissions. But also some people are of the view that it should at least go back as far as the period that is available for the ATO to subsequently verify the accuracy of the information in the return within the prescribed period. Those periods, just to restate them quickly, are two years after the date tax became due and payable under the assessment if the taxpayer is subject to a shorter period of review, four years after the date tax became due and payable under the assessment, six years after the date tax became due and payable under the assessment where the assessment provided the taxpayer with a tax benefit, and at any time under part IVA where there has been an avoidance of tax due to fraud or evasion.
I must say that personally I have little difficulty with the concept that the provisions of this bill should in fact apply back within the prescribed period, which is what I would refer to as the period where time has not expired. However, there is no support for that. The government does not support that position and neither does the Labor Party, as far as I understand. Because the financial impact of the current bill is around $100 million over the next four years, which is a clear indication of its beneficial nature for taxpayers, and because this bill does improve process and equity from the perspective of taxpayers, I think it is appropriate to support the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (IMPROVEMENTS TO SELF ASSESSMENT) BILL (NO. 1) 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,45,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-06-23,"—I will sum up on behalf of the government on the Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 1) 2005 and the Shortfall Interest Charge (Imposition) Bill 2005. To begin with, I thank all senators who have taken part in this debate. On 24 November 2003 the Treasurer announced the review which has led to this bill being introduced. The review was to determine whether the self-assessment arrangements struck the right balance between protecting the rights of individual taxpayers and protecting revenue for the benefit of the Australian community. As part of the review, the government released a discussion paper. In response, Treasury received over 30 formal submissions and held face-to-face consultation with practitioners and other government agencies. The review identified a number of refinements to the self-assessment system to reduce uncertainty and compliance costs for taxpayers while preserving the Australian Taxation Office’s capacity to collect legitimate income tax liabilities. The Treasurer announced that the government would adopt all of the legislative recommendations made in the report from the review. As the Treasurer said:
The Review has identified a number of refinements to the current self assessment system that will reduce uncertainty and compliance costs for taxpayers, while preserving the Tax Office’s capacity to collect legitimate income tax liabilities. The recommendations—
that is, the recommendations from the review—
will move the balance of fairness markedly in favour of taxpayers who act in good faith and will build more flexibility into the self assessment system. These measures are another major step in this Government’s ongoing commitment to improving the Australian taxation system.
This bill contains the first tranche of these recommendations. Under current tax law a shortfall or underpayment of income tax is treated in the same way as a late payment, with a general interest charge accruing on the underpayment from the due date of the original assessment to the time the amount is paid. We are introducing a new penalty with a lower interest rate to cover the period before a taxpayer is notified of the shortfall, when he or she may or may not know of the problem. The new penalty will replace the general interest charge. It will be calculated in the same way as the general interest charge rate but will be four percentage points less per annum. It will have a three percentage point uplift over the base rate, which is an average of bank bill yields, in contrast with the seven percentage point uplift used by the general interest charge.
The Commissioner of Taxation will have the power to remit the charge when fair and reasonable to do so. In addition, there will be some other changes to the penalty provisions. We will abolish the penalty for failing to follow a private ruling issued by the Commissioner of Taxation. The penalty is being abolished because of concerns that it is acting as a disincentive to seek rulings in the first place. We will require the commissioner to give reasons to taxpayers for why they are being penalised and why the penalties have not been remitted in full. We will clarify when a statement by a taxpayer about their income tax liability is reasonably arguable in relation to income tax law. A taxpayer is not penalised if he makes a claim for a tax concession that is reasonably arguable. The clarification will make the law consistent with the ATO practice, which is not to penalise if the argument is about as likely to be correct as incorrect. A strict reading of the existing law would require a higher standard and therefore subject more people to penalties.
I believe that some of the concern about this bill stems from a belief that it goes further than it actually does. Many people have suggested that the review of self-assessment provisions should be retrospective. This argument is often raised in discussion about the treatment of investors in mass-market schemes. However, the amendments should be considered in a broader context. This government has a good record when it comes to improvements in tax administration and this bill is merely the latest in a long list of changes. As the review points out, over the last few years this government has shortened the period of review for taxpayers with straightforward tax affairs, introduced binding oral advice, reduced the rate of interest on shortfalls and late payments, and introduced the office of the Inspector-General of Taxation—a new statutory officer with responsibilities for investigating systemic tax administration issues.
The bill should not just be viewed through the prism of the treatment of mass-market schemes however. It is a wider measure which will give interest charge reductions and other benefits to a wide range of taxpayers in a variety of circumstances.
Finally, the Shortfall Interest Charge (Imposition) Bill 2005 accompanies this bill. The imposition bill will impose the new shortfall interest charge. I believe these are a very sound set of amendments and I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-06-23,"—I do thank honourable senators who have made a contribution to this debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. The government’s choice of fund policy is about giving people the right to choose the fund to which their employer makes compulsory super contributions on their behalf. The government believes that people should be able to decide who manages their superannuation which, for most people, will be their second largest asset after the family home. Choice will create a competitive environment that ensures superannuation providers are doing their best to increase the retirement incomes of all Australians. It will promote competition and place downward pressure on fees and charges. We have already seen evidence of this with a number of major funds reducing their fees in anticipation of choice and at least one new player looking to enter the market. These fee reductions and competitive pressures provide hard evidence that Labor’s opposition to choice has been and is counterproductive and detrimental to the retirement savings of ordinary Australians.
This bill gives effect to announcements made by the government earlier this year to ease the transition to superannuation choice for business and employees and to minimise the burden on employers in complying with their choice obligations. It has resulted from ongoing consultations between the government, employer organisations and the superannuation industry. The bill will ensure that the choice of fund legislation does not impose unnecessary costs on employers by specifying additional circumstances where the standard choice form does not have to be provided to employees. Employers wishing to use the superannuation holding accounts special account to meet their choice obligations will be given an additional year to make alternative arrangements before it is closed. The employees will be able to exercise their choice of fund without risk of being charged by their employer for the cost of contributing to their chosen fund. This bill ensures that the choice of fund legislation strikes the right balance between allowing employees to choose who manages their superannuation and minimising costs for business. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,46,1

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-23,"—The Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2005 is absurd. It represents another triumph by the religious Right, which continues to press the government on conservative and symbolic reforms that have little or no impact on reality. For this reason it is a pyrrhic victory for reactionary forces. This bill illustrates the way in which the coalition continues to politically gesture to the more extreme church groups and how Labor has not learnt its lesson in trying to copy the government in this regard and trying to corral the same voting base. This bill is victory of style over substance, of superstition over reason and of ignorance over education. This bill is a fool’s illusion because it cannot and does not achieve the outcome that it claims to provide for.
This bill is not about suicide. It does not address the causes of suicide, nor does it even pretend to address them. At its heart, this bill is nothing less than the religious Right attempting to shut down and censor voluntary euthanasia support groups and voluntary euthanasia discussion in the broader community. We can see this clearly simply by looking at the key individuals and groups which made submissions to this bill and which pushed for its introduction in the first place. They are the usual subjects. They are a who’s who of the religious Right in Australia. And in spite of their disingenuous secular names, they are fundamentally religious organisations. Their push for this bill is all about laundering their religious belief into a secular argument, hiding church from state and translating their personal religious views into public policy and then imposing them on all citizens. It represents yet another push for theocracy over democracy. It is about the minority of Australians who oppose voluntary euthanasia and who do so largely because of their belief in God—however they define him or her—as being the only arbiter of who lives and dies, and their desire to remove that personal right from people who may want to decide that for themselves.
It is also about such people believing that those in pain and despair must suffer and not choose a dignified death over a life of suffering. This arrogant view ignores the fact that many Australians hold dearly to the view that if they are in uncontrollable pain or suffering, that if life has become unbearable and that no amount of medical help will alleviate this, then they will want the option to choose the right to die with dignity. Such deaths are not suicide in the general sense of the word. We should be clear about this. There is a gulf of difference between those people who, because of emotional pain, confusion or depression, may contemplate suicide and those people at the end of life’s road who, due to tragic circumstances or great age and frailty, may make the perfectly rational decision to opt for euthanasia.
Opinion polling continues to show that an overwhelming majority of Australians support voluntary euthanasia. Yet, while the vast majority of Australians support voluntary euthanasia, it is the organised political base of the religious Right, putting the squeeze on government in marginal seats, who have had a win in this instance. But it is not sustainable. Despite the excitement by supporters of this bill about its pending passage, it does not and cannot do what they think it does. In a general sense, the mythology surrounding this bill is that it will be cracking down on suicide sites on the internet. This is code for voluntary euthanasia sites on the internet. Those people with a limited or poor understanding of the internet might think that this will happen or that it is even possible. It is not. But just as previous well-meaning but clumsy attempts to censor the internet in this place, on issues such as pornography and online gambling, have been technical failures, so too will this bill.
The bill will fail for two key reasons. Firstly, it has no international reach. Given that the internet is an international medium, this is like removing a grain of sand from the beach and then claiming there is a discernible difference. It is nonsense. Simply by typing the words ‘How to kill yourself’ into the Google search engine I was able to access more than 7,230,000 hits in 0.1 seconds. This includes the site ‘How to kill yourself using the inhalation of carbon monoxide gas’ which comes complete with step-by-step pictures. This bill will not and cannot ban this site or the thousands of others like it. In other words, simply with the click of a mouse, any computer can and will be able to access tens of thousands of pages of information on the topic of voluntary euthanasia, suicide and methods of killing yourself.
Defenders of this legislation might argue that international cooperation is the long-term goal of this campaign, but of course legislation such as we have before us today would be unthinkable and, indeed, impossible in places such as the USA because that would breach the constitution as it applies to freedom of speech. But, as Australia is the only Western democracy without a bill of rights, the rights and freedoms of our citizens can be trampled, and that is what is being attempted here.
Although the outcome of the bill is unclear because of its hazy vagaries, it may be the case that, if passed, this bill will restrict the activities of legitimate domestic voluntary euthanasia advocacy groups. Opponents of voluntary euthanasia will argue at the first opportunity that this is the case and that the mere existence of voluntary euthanasia web sites constitutes a breach of this pending law. This is because the bill creates the extraordinary situation whereby it may be deemed that simply providing voluntary euthanasia information domestically constitutes unlawful counselling or inciting when provided via the internet, including email, or over the phone yet it is not unlawful if the same information is provided by regular post. It means, for example, that the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of New South Wales or Victoria or Western Australia, or wherever, may find itself in breach of the law simply by advocating for the introduction of voluntary euthanasia in state parliaments and discussing this online with members and supporters. I suggest this is the real agenda behind those conservative and religious organisations which most push for this bill. I predict it will likely result in civil disobedience, with voluntary euthanasia groups around Australia daring the Commonwealth to prosecute them in an environment where the populace overwhelmingly supports voluntary euthanasia.
This brings me to my second point—that is, the law, as it is perceived, will not be complied with. Indeed, my advice to these groups would be: ‘Ignore this law; it’s a joke. Carry on what you’re doing and as you’ve always done. Treat this idiotic law with the contempt it deserves.’ This law is conservative symbolism that will be much more honoured in the breach than in the practice. And you can see this as a pattern of process that spans a wide variety of what are sometimes called ‘moral issues’, or where you find an intersection between religion and politics.
Let me give two examples of what I mean. Firstly, I go to homosexual law reform. For many years the same groups and individuals, and their like, who most pressed for this bill also strongly opposed the decriminalisation of homosexuality. This was most acute in Tasmania. They argued that the laws were a deterrent—to what exactly, I am uncertain—and that it was an important symbol of community morality. But such laws crumbled under the weight of public opinion, most especially when gay men handed themselves into the police, forcing their hand, and daring them to charge and jail them. The result was that the laws were brought in disrepute and ultimately repealed.
Another example I will give is that of abortion. In my home state, successive governments, under pressure from conservative forces, failed to make terminations lawful, even though this was clearly at odds with public opinion. But all this was brought undone when just a few years ago police pressed charges against one doctor who readily confessed to performing abortions and, once again, the weight of public opinion brought the law crashing down and reform was implemented. So too it will be with this legislation, if—in the highly unlikely event—at some point in the future voluntary euthanasia groups around Australia are arrested and charged under the ridiculous ‘counselling’ and ‘inciting’ definitions contained within this legislation. And I suspect the Commonwealth full knows this, and that would explain the remarkably low penalties prescribed in this bill. Civil disobedience will render this legislation useless.
To highlight the silliness of this bill, consider the bizarre situation it creates, for example, in that providing quotes and chapters of the book Final Exit, by author Derek Humphry, via email may be unlawful yet buying the book from a newsagent remains lawful. Then there is the question as to whether purchasing this book from online company Amazon.com constitutes an offence under the act. I suggest it may well do so, even though this book remains freely available in bookshops and libraries. This is ridiculous and brings public policy into disrepute. The bill lacks rationale and consistency, and it demonises the internet. It preys on the ignorance and misunderstanding many people have of the internet by perpetuating the myth that it can be censored as easily as a book or a film. It cannot.
But, most importantly, this bill completely fails to address the causes of suicide or offers any suggestions to help mitigate this tragedy. Suicide is a difficult social issue, and it is more common with elderly people than with the young, as is the perception. Yet elderly people are much more likely to get information about voluntary euthanasia through books and brochures than by attempting to do this online. The government says that the bill is a response to the incidence of suicide; yet, ironically, research shows that suicide rates have in fact fallen since the internet became publicly accessible in 1994. There is therefore no rationale between this bill and the government’s argument for it. As the Law Society of New South Wales rightly said in its submission:
The major factor leading to suicide is despair, which can be triggered by tragedy such as personal despondency, loneliness, depression, mental illness, family breakdown or death of a loved one, poverty, unemployment, financial ruin, substance abuse or the chronic pain of a terminal illness. People at risk, in particular young people, require far more pro-active measures to address the causes of suicide and to help them rebuild their lives.
I have long had an interest in youth suicide prevention, most particularly from the demographic of gay and lesbian youth. A shocking statistic is that up to one-third of all same-sex attracted youth, those who are lesbian or gay, questioning their sexuality or perceived to be homosexual, attempt or succeed at killing themselves. I repeat: one-third. Australian and international research has repeatedly shown that harassment, discrimination, intolerance and prejudice aimed at young people who are homosexual, or presumed to be so and victimised for it, are key reasons for youth suicide.
The Commonwealth and the states have, to varying degrees, recognised this phenomenon and taken some limited steps to address it. Counselling, support and self-esteem programs, such as the Working It Out program in Tasmania or the Here For Life program in my home state, are examples of this. So I cannot let it pass without noting the bitter and cruel irony that many of the religious organisations which made submissions in support of this bill are also some of the most vehement opponents of civil and human rights for gay and lesbian people, and they host, refer to or advocate web sites that denigrate and vilify homosexual people. These includes anti-gay sites—mostly from the US—which state or imply that gay and lesbian people are mentally ill, morally depraved, diseased, corrupted and child abusers, amongst other things.
This anti-gay hatred and promotion is part of the problem that leads many young people to kill themselves. It contributes to an environment of fear and isolation many young homosexual people face, and it can result in homophobic harassment and violence towards vulnerable youth. There is a clear, academically established link between the fear and loathing promoted by anti-gay groups and the death of many young people.
It sickens me that religious organisations which passionately support this bill because of their declared passion for preventing suicide in fact have blood on their hands when it comes to their own contribution to the appalling levels of anti-gay violence and youth suicide amongst young people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, or perceived to be so. And it is not acceptable that the Commonwealth remains silent on this nexus, despite its professed desire to limit suicides in Australia.
There are mixed views in my party on the question of voluntary euthanasia, and rightly so. It is rightly a conscience matter for senators. But, above and beyond this, my party believe strongly that voluntary euthanasia groups, or indeed any other lawful group, should be able to advocate their cause without parliamentary interference. We also believe strongly in the separation of church and state and that no church group should be allowed to unduly trespass on the role of parliament. But from my own perspective, and as the Democrats’ spokesperson for IT, I cannot endorse legislation that takes a clumsy, ham-fisted and nonsensical approach to the internet, that blames it for social ills and demonises it and that panders to ignorance about modern IT communications. I strongly oppose this bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,47,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-23,"—I cannot much improve on my colleague’s speech but I offer some slightly different perspectives to it. I, too, strongly oppose the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2005 and will vote against it. The Bills Digest points out a lot of the problems associated with this legislation. It is not clear in what situations material would indirectly ‘promote’ or ‘provide instruction’. The issue of intention in the third of the three offences might cause problems because, according to the Bills Digest:
... should a person put material on the internet, it might be difficult for them to refute the proposition that they were ‘aware’ that it might be accessed by someone who would then use it to counsel suicide etc.
They say there is an uncertainty about what constitutes ‘material’. Is a private conversation on the telephone between two people ‘material’? I have had such conversations with people over the phone about euthanasia. Would I be guilty of a crime? The bill does not require anyone to actually commit suicide or even attempt to do so in order for an offence to occur. They are just some of the legal issues and lack of clarity with regard to this bill. There are also all those other technical problems about dealing with the internet which my colleague Senator Greig has already raised.
It seems to me, as it does to him, that this is not a bill that has anything to do with suicide. If the government were really serious about reducing suicide levels there are many things that it could do to achieve that. For one thing, we know that, if this government and others were more interested in improving services for people who have mental illnesses, many suicides could be prevented. Mental illnesses such as depression and serious conditions like schizophrenia so often give rise to suicide, and are probably the major cause of suicide in this country. If we had governments more interested in tackling that problem then we could be reassured that there was something serious going on here to reduce suicide rates. But that is not what this legislation is about.
Hundreds of submissions have already been made to the mental health inquiry telling tragic story after tragic story about people who have sought treatment for mental illness and who have been turned away or who are discharged from hospital too soon, or simply do not know or accept that they are ill. There is great anguish, particularly for parents and other carers, when their son or daughter harms themselves or threatens to suicide because the pain of their illness is too much to bear. Parents tell stories about how they knew that their son or daughter was suicidal and likely to take their own life and yet their pleas for assistance and for medical services to stop that happening fell on deaf ears and those people ended up going through with the act in the depth of their illness.
These parents do their best to protect their sons and daughters but, as I said, the awful truth is that they are too often unsuccessful and the deaths that those young people experience are usually very violent ones. In other words, they step in front of a train, hang themselves or overdose with drugs like sleeping tablets, none of which they do as a result of any incitement or counselling on suicide. It is very easy to kill yourself in this violent manner if that is what you are on about.
What is this bill about? Like my colleague I think it is about stopping people from discussing the cause of voluntary euthanasia. It is about stopping those who want the freedom to end their lives because they are terminally ill or because they have reached the end of their useful lives as they define it. It stops these people from finding non-violent ways to end their lives. It stops them from talking with others about how they might do this.
We had a very long euthanasia debate in this place some years ago when the Northern Territory were stopped from allowing their citizens to have control over their deaths. Territorians who wanted the right to die with dignity at a time and in a manner of their own choosing were stopped by this parliament from doing so. That did not stop the awful rate of suicide. It did stop people from achieving a peaceful death. I think my colleague is right in saying that people will object to this legislation and continue doing it. They will flout the law because it is an ill-considered and bad law.
Because I am a strong proponent of people’s right to die with dignity and for them to be players in determining how they will die, I attract a lot of correspondence from people who think likewise. I want to read one letter that I have received in relation to this bill from someone who recognised that the right to die with dignity and euthanasia generally was what was being attacked by this legislation. This woman says:
I am in remission with ovarian cancer. I come from a family of five, four of whom have major heart defects. Two have died and two have had heart surgery. Recently I asked in emergency that my records be marked ‘Do not resuscitate.’ The doctor refused, saying I would need counselling prior to this action. I told her that I was conversant with the Medical Treatment Act of 1988 in Victoria and asked again, to no avail. Given my options, I would much rather die quickly of a heart attack than slowly with secondary cancer. It is because of these types of stonewalling that people have stepped outside the square. I am a very strong advocate for a hastened death for people who see their lives as having no purpose other than pain, loss of dignity and death regardless of treatments. I believe strongly that I represent the public face of activism on behalf of those less able to help themselves. Numerous overtures to all members of state parliament have failed to produce one positive sign that anyone gives a sh!!—
and ‘sh!!’ means ‘shit’, obviously—
about us. We can’t even get living wills enforceable by law. Palliative care is not an option for some people. They need the knowledge that a peaceful pill is possible to end their suffering if and when it is needed. I just know that under this bill I will be a criminal eventually. My five grandchildren will have to know many years hence that I take this stand today to protect their wellbeing in years to come. That advocating a hastened death is treated the same as terrorism is really scary stuff. Please leave the discreet work that some sites undertake alone. Thank you.
We were told in the debate on euthanasia that those laws were the slippery slope to killing off old people we no longer value, saving the state money in medical treatment and allowing greedy and malicious family members to get rid of people for their inheritance or because they were simply a nuisance. I suggest this is a slippery slope for free speech. What will we see next from this parliament? Will crime writers be stopped from writing novels about murder? Will films that show theft be banned? Will cops-and-robbers movies also be banned because in them will be some violence, demonstrations of illegality, murder and shooting and so forth? Is this another slippery slope against our freedoms and liberties in this country?
Where will we go from here? If we are not allowed to talk about voluntary euthanasia amongst ourselves, on the internet or over the telephone, where will this go next? What else will we not be allowed to discuss? What else will we not be able to contemplate? What happens to those people who will continue to advocate euthanasia in this country? And why should they not do that—that is what they are asking.
This is a ridiculous bill. Sadly, I think it is going to pass. That would seem to be the indication that we have had so far. It is not going to be a conscience vote, sadly. It masquerades as the kind of bill which will help us to solve the very serious rate of suicide in this country, but that is not what it is about. It is not going to make a scrap of difference to the number of people in this country who take their lives when they should not—who take their lives because they are unwell or for a whole range of reasons that should have been solved by other means, whether that is through the health service, providing the homeless with accommodation or providing young people with support at certain times of their lives. There are a whole range of ways in which we could tackle suicide but this bill is not going to do that. This bill is fairly and squarely targeted at voluntary euthanasia and any discussion about it, and it should be condemned.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,47,1

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2005-06-23,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
I rise to speak about the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill.
Suicide is a serious problem in Australia. More than 2,200 people commit suicide each year. That’s more than the annual road toll of over 1,500 deaths per year that we see regularly reported on the television news.
The World Health Organisation states suicide is “. . . a huge but largely preventable public health problem, causing almost half of all violent deaths and resulting in almost one million fatalities every year . . .”
The World Health Organisation reminds us that “deaths from suicide are only a part of this very serious problem. In addition to those who die, many more people survive attempts to take their own lives or harm themselves, often seriously enough to require medical attention. Furthermore, every person who kills himself or herself leaves behind many others—family and friends—whose lives are profoundly affected emotionally, socially and economically. The economic costs associated with self-inflicted death or injuries are estimated to be in the billions of US dollars a year.”
To help tackle this problem the Federal Government introduced this bill to stop pro-suicide groups promoting suicide or providing information or material on how to commit suicide using the Internet, email or telephones. The bill is consistent with research that says one of the most effective ways of reducing the suicide rate is to limit people’s access to the means of suicide.
Legislators have a responsibility to protect the community, for the common good. It is important to ensure that those who are vulnerable are encouraged to seek help rather than end their life. Laws such as the bill under consideration educate society that there is value in the life of every human being, and that special care should be provided to those who are vulnerable for any number of reasons.
Dr Philip Nitschke, complained to the Legal and Constitutional Committee that what he called “rational adult Australians” will not be able to access information to commit suicide. But his position is not consistent.
Dr Nitschke is on record saying suicide pill information should be provided to all who want it—not just rational adults. He said: “Someone needs to provide this knowledge, training, or recourse necessary to anyone who wants it, including the depressed, the elderly bereaved, the troubled teen.”
And who decides who is “rational”? Nitschke, of course. Not that he goes to much trouble to check. Rather than seek the opinion of a psychiatrist, he says “common sense is a good enough indicator”.
Yet depression—a treatable condition—is one of the major factors driving the suicide rate.
Whether a patient is suffering from depression or not is a matter for expert medical assessment. The World Health Organisation says “depression plays a major role in suicide and is thought to be involved in approximately 65-90 per cent of all suicides with psychiatric pathologies”.
Undiagnosed depression is a major danger for suicidal people. Depression is more difficult to detect than many other health conditions because those suffering the condition are often unaware of their illness. Yet it is ignored by providers of do-it-yourself suicide information. Research shows people with suicidal thoughts, but who are ambivalent about committing suicide, can be encouraged on Internet chat sites to take their life.
Vulnerable people see in suicide advice an endorsement of their disordered thinking. They see a justification for committing suicide rather than seeking the help they need.
Compassion is not giving someone information on how to commit suicide. Compassion is looking to the reasons they want to take such desperate action. It is addressing pain, depression, loneliness or fear. It is helping them with their mental health, physical illness or substance abuse.
There’s no dignity in being told you’re right to want to commit suicide because your life is awful.
The proposed laws are necessary because they target those who prey on the despair, depression, sadness or loneliness of others. But the legislation is not enough in itself. The Government must also address the health, social and personal factors which drive people to consider suicide.
Let’s tackle the problem of people committing suicide rather than trying to increase the numbers.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,47,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-23,"—in reply—The Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2005 is designed to protect vulnerable people who can be targeted over the internet by people who do not want to espouse a cause or to argue free speech or a policy or anything of that sort but who intend that a vulnerable person should take their own life and are inciting them to do so. That is, of course, a different aspect to the discussion of the question of euthanasia. Indeed, the bill itself has a proviso that it should be a defence for anyone that they are engaged in free speech or advocating a point of view in relation to euthanasia. I want to make that very clear and it is important that the government make that clear, because we do not want to limit freedom of speech.
But there is evidence in relation to suicide that people who are in a vulnerable position are being encouraged to take their own lives. Unfortunately, that does happen, and a variety of means are used to achieve that end. This is but one measure to try to protect people who are vulnerable to those sorts of people who, with malintent, want to encourage them to end their lives—that is a very different question to the discussion of euthanasia and to advocating a position on that issue. This bill sets out to achieve that.
There are amendments, which I will address later in more detail, which I think take up the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s recommendations. But I will just note that it is important that we approach this matter in a very rational way, without emotion. I would just remind the Senate of that. Suicide is a very emotional topic, and Senator Greig has pointed to the situation where, to take one particular case, a third of gay and lesbian youth, he says, attempt to or successfully commit suicide—I think that was the percentage he mentioned. That is indeed a tragic situation, and the government is totally committed to reducing the rate of suicide in this country, and particularly so for young people. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,47,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-23,"—As we indicated in the debate, the amendments were defeated in the House. The amendments included one of a technical nature. We thought the government might have had the opportunity to have a better look at it to improve the otherwise incremental improvement in the migration detention regime but they unfortunately failed to see the sense of that belt and braces approach. Let us hope that their view is right; perhaps I am wrong in relation to that technical amendment, or the Labor Party is, I should say.
However, I would like to put on record a couple of things. We indicated that we would not insist on the amendments because it was in the interests of ensuring that even this incremental change will make some difference, some improvement, to the migration detention system—notwithstanding Senator Vanstone’s or Mr Ruddock’s position as the current minister and previous minister, notwithstanding the cultural issues that seemed to have been alluded to during this debate, notwithstanding the maladministration that so characterises this area and notwithstanding the inability of the minister to call a royal commission into what would otherwise only be described as a shambles. The department is in crisis and is leaderless, in our view. It has not had a minister with the strength of character to see that there were problems that needed to be addressed and to understand that those issues needed to be dealt with quickly, concisely and openly in a transparent way.
I would like to also take this opportunity to say that the real significance of this bill is that it reflects a major change, but not of the government; I do not think the government has really changed that much in this issue. It does, I think, reflect a major change in community opinion in Australia. We are finally seeing the middle ground of genuine, caring, decent, honest Australians who are starting to assert themselves and who understand that this is a debate that should not divide. This is after years of appalling vilification of asylum seekers by the government, which could only be described as thinly veiled appeals to, I guess, an underlying racial prejudice that might exist.
We have had years of hearing about cases of talkback radio throwing itself into the debate with gusto, which was unnecessary, to bring about a position where you start hearing people talk about things that we had thought we had put behind ourselves as a nation—where people say things like ‘sink the boats’ or ‘shoot them’. After years of that abuse, denigration and name-calling, I think we have come to a new position. The Prime Minister uses the words ‘tilting point’ with regard to a number of issues. I go back to the older style language and say we have come to a watershed. Maybe it is not quite a complete dam but, as a nation, I think we are starting to at least look at the debate and come to a better position about the issues rather than the emotive matters that might underpin them.
We can start to look at this government in the light of what it did in respect of the hysteria it created around 2001. Thankfully, the Labor Party have maintained a consistent line in this area throughout. We have not agreed with the government. We have got a different position. We have put together a policy which reflects a concern but which also maintains that this area should be open and transparent and that government should be accountable. This latest revolt by the backbench only illustrates how strong this sentiment is becoming and how much community attitude is changing in this area, and it is pleasing to see that at least. We can reflect on how much Mr Georgiou has progressed this issue and, in truth, how little he then settled for in this area.
If we put that aside for the moment, we are in a position where I think we can move forward and we can look at how we can ensure that there is fairness. We will have the ability, as Senator Bartlett knows, in the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee migration hearings to argue our position from the Labor Party’s side, and I am sure Senator Bartlett will take the opportunity to argue for his position. Our positions are not always concordant, we are not always singing from the same sheet, but I think we do share the same interest in ensuring that there is fairness in the migration area. But it is still a long way until we get back to what was once a bipartisan approach to this issue.
It is really quite an incredible journey when you go back to where settlement services were significantly progressed, when you go back to the late Al Grassby and see how he sought to ensure that migrants from all walks of life would be welcomed into our country, resettled and able to find employment and come to see Australia as their home. Then you go through into the reports and the progress we have made. You can track it clearly from Al Grassby through to the Galbally report under Fraser and to Hawke and to Keating, right up to the global diversity conference in 1995, where we had by and large maintained a bipartisan approach on immigration, settlement services and multicultural affairs. All of that fell apart under Howard. We had the rise of Hansonism. We had Mr Howard almost putting on this Aussie bush hat image of saying, ‘We’re back to colloquial Australia.’ That divide started there and that rift between what we saw as the way forward and what Howard did got wider and deeper.
I think we have come a little bit back to where we can realistically look at how we can start to rebuild some of these bridges to ensure that all Australians can feel that Australia is in their heart and is their homeland. One of the things the Liberals and the coalition need to be aware of is that Australia does not only belong to them but belongs to all of us. This backbench revolt, if we want to call it that—or perhaps a storm in a teacup—demonstrates that there is community interest in ensuring that there is fairness in the system. Rather than delaying it too much longer in talking about some of those issues, I will take the opportunity during the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee hearings to progress some of those issues.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,48,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—The Democrats will not insist on those amendments either. As I made clear in my contribution to the second reading debate and during the committee stage, we have quite serious concerns about some of the principles contained in this legislation and some of the expansions of a power that we believe has already been shown to have significant problems in how it operates. But we are not going to stand in the way of legislation that will enable some people to be released from detention—either by being released into community detention, in which case technically they are still in detention, or by being granted a visa more easily than they currently can be. I think it is bad law the way it is being done, but I am certainly not going to be accused of holding up a mechanism that allows that freedom to happen.
There are a couple of comments I would like to make along the way, though. Senator Ludwig mentioned the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, which has just received a reference to examine a range of the issues to do with decision making about visas, detention, deportation and administration of the Migration Act. He talked about how he would be able to put his position and I and the Democrats would be able to argue our position in that committee. I am not sure I know what he was saying in relation to that, but I would like to put it on the record that I am not looking at that inquiry as a process to argue my position; I am looking at it as a way to get information, to get more facts on the table and to give the opportunity to the public to contribute information and put forward their viewpoints. That will inform my position and then I will argue it.
I hope that all of us will engage with that, and I am sure we will—at least from the non-government side—in a genuine attempt to look at these issues. I do believe that, beneath all the political arguments about this, we want a system that works better. There are clearly major problems at the moment. Despite all the attacks I have made—quite valid attacks, I believe—on this government and indeed on the opposition for their approach and their policies in this area, I have repeatedly acknowledged that this is a very difficult area. It is always going to be hard. If as much as possible we can work to try and find an approach that will work better, that will help us deal with some of the issues that are a bit more ephemeral, about culture, that have been talked about. If we can approach this inquiry with that mindset, then it will increase the chance of getting a more constructive result.
Having said that, I do have concerns that this government opposed the setting up of this inquiry. There are undercurrents around the place at the moment—and we will find out one way or the other in a couple of months—about committees being removed, references committees being collapsed back into legislation committees, and some inquiries that the government do not like being cut short. I do not know if that will happen or not, but the government actually opposed this inquiry being set up—an inquiry that quite clearly there are compelling good public policy reasons for installing, however much the government might find it embarrassing. The fact that the government opposed it, and indeed called a division in the forlorn hope that they might get lucky and jag an Independent or two on their side and stop it happening, does not fill me with confidence that they will approach this in a constructive way. It is a politicised area at the moment and that does make it harder. I appreciate that. But, if we can all approach it as much as possible with a genuine attempt to grapple with some of the issues and look seriously and openly at what some of the problems are, then it will be better for the whole country.
Over the years, I have become more immersed in the migration area and have gained a fuller appreciation of just how pivotal it is to the future of Australia and indeed to the here and now of Australia. The migration area in all its aspects and the migration law and how it operates are key. The migration area is one of the most critical public policy areas. I think people underestimate how important it is, perhaps because so much of the debate is focused on what is actually a very small part of it. The asylum seeker area is a tiny part in terms of numbers of people, but the failure to address that issue in a proper way, in a way that accords with decent administrative practices and the rule of law, has infected like a cancer the entire Migration Act and the administration of it, and that affects our entire country and our country’s future. It is important and I do hope we can approach that committee inquiry with that in mind, and I hope the government can do likewise.
Let us look at what is in this legislation, even aside from community detention—which is another one of the strange word plays that we have in the migration area: for the purposes of the Migration Act, people are still considered to be in detention even as they are wandering freely around the streets. It is a bit like the excision zone, where people might be in Australia but, for the purposes of the Migration Act, they are not in Australia. There are a couple of people in Maribyrnong detention centre at the moment who have been there for a couple of months but are technically not in the migration zone of Australia; they are here on transitory visas and are still sort of technically in Nauru. These are the sorts of absurdities and legal fictions that have been put, one on top of the other, throughout the Migration Act to get around different situations, different court rulings, different bits of public pressure. The big catch-all escape hatch is the ministerial discretion.
We now have in this bill the power for the minister to use his or her discretion to grant a visa to anybody in migration detention. Literally, the minister could clear out everybody in detention tomorrow and give them all a visa. She is not going to; indeed, I would not argue that she should, because some people are there for short purposes prior to deportation for valid reasons. But this gives sweeping power. It is not even implying bad faith, although you can argue that from time to time. It is literally inevitable, if you give a minister, Commonwealth officer or any official carte blanche power without having any appeal mechanism, any real review mechanism or even any mechanism for transparency about how that power is used—why it is used in one case and not another—that you will get injustices, inconsistencies and a corrosion of the integrity of the Migration Act. We have seen all this in committee inquiries before.
I cannot believe that I am using the phrase ‘the integrity of the Migration Act’ because that is the one the government always use. They say, ‘We’ve got to do this to maintain the integrity of the migration regimes.’ It is one of Philip Ruddock’s favourite phrases. He used to say it every day as soon as he got out of bed. But it is true; you need to have the integrity of the Migration Act. This stuff undermines the integrity of it—this wide-sweeping carte blanche power to dish out a visa when you feel like it. It is a reality, but it is still not a desirable reality to have visas being granted on the basis of public and political pressure. It reinforces the perception that you have to go to the media, you have to create public opposition to what the government is doing and you have to create public sympathy for a particular person. That is not the way to grant visas.
Apart from anything else, it is unfair for the person. It can be incredibly traumatising to be suddenly thrust into the public spotlight and have your individual life circumstances ripped apart from every side as people make a judgment about whether or not you deserve to stay here. It is not the way to do things. But that is actually what this is encouraging. It is going to encourage more of this because people know that the minister can do anything to anyone in detention. They can all get a visa now, so everybody is going to be clambering left, right and centre. We will need to put more staff on to deal with it. It all comes back to one person: the power rests in the hands of one person and it cannot be delegated. One person has been given that absolute power without proper transparency.
I heard Senator Troeth talking about transparency. It may seem nice and transparent to table things in the parliament and say that you have used it but, having seen how it operates, we know now that it is not transparent. The lack of transparency and the lack of any idea about how or why this power is used are farcical. That undermines faith in the integrity of the system. I am all for the integrity of the migration regime. Having heard Philip Ruddock talk about it for so long, I have adopted the mantra. I just wish the government would adopt the reality. In that way, I believe that this bill goes down a bad path, and I feel very uncomfortable, in that respect, supporting it. But if it is the only way, and it is the only way at the moment, and the only path that is open for people to be released from detention, then I do not think we have any alternative.
But we should all be wary. We all know, of course, that the political tide can turn, particularly if the government puts its mind to it. In the same way as these powers can be used to loosen up and become more compassionate, they can also be used to crack down. The same problems apply with the lack of legal rights, the lack of scope for appeal and the lack of transparency. It is all fine in theory. Most people do not worry about transparency and appeal rights if they are being doled out in a nice, compassionate, cuddly way. But when they are being applied in the other way—cracking down, putting people back into detention, denying visas and all those things—then concerns arise. But it is too late then. That is the broader concern I have with the process here.
The whole matter was only finalised and agreed on less than a week ago. It was some time on Friday afternoon in the negotiations between the Prime Minister, Mr Georgiou and others. It was rushed into this place in legislation that appeared on Tuesday. It was rushed through here, with some questioning and some extra elucidation, on Thursday—less than a week later. We have heard tonight that the guidelines are still being sorted out as to how some of these powers are going to be used, not that the guidelines are legally enforceable; we cannot appeal about how the powers are used or not used anyway.
So it is bad law in lots of ways, and the rushed nature of the process adds to the apprehension I have. But that is the situation. It does seem that the government is reacting to ever-growing political and public pressure about this. I have just heard tonight that a large number of Iranian detainees have had discretion exercised under section 48B, which allows them to reapply for their protection visas. The general assumption is that they will all—or mostly—be successful. That is a hell of a messy and roundabout, non-transparent and almost arbitrary process, but if it gets them visas then I guess it is better than not. But the process is such a mess, and that is why we have such a mess at the moment in the whole migration area, as in some of the cases that have come to light publicly and—quite frankly, as I am sure the department and the minister well know—in some cases that have not come to public attention as yet but undoubtedly will. This is built on what is almost a national hysteria for control at all costs in the area of migration. We do need control and we do need a coherent regime, but we do not need some psychotic and obsessive mania for control at all costs. The result of that is a ridiculously overcomplex and over-regulated, inconsistent, badly administered and politically infected migration regime with a lot of bandaids stuck over all the gaps and the bits that keep falling off the side. This legislation is another big bandaid. As I have said a couple of times, it is a bit like the emperor’s new clothes—nobody wants to acknowledge that the whole thing is a facade: they just keep putting on one more imaginary coat over another to try and keep kidding people that it is all okay.
It is clearly not okay and it not going to become okay until we take off the blinkers and have an honest look at it. That is something all of us from all sides need to do—those of us like me and others who advocate strongly and continuously for more rights for people need to do so with the realistic recognition that it is a difficult area which has its constraints. But clearly we have got it wrong at the moment, and until we can get that initial recognition that we have got it seriously wrong from both the major parties then we are going to be back here again and again. It is just as well I find it interesting and enjoy these speeches and discussions and hearing other people’s points of view. But what would be even more enjoyable than these sorts of ongoing discussions and debates would be having a Migration Act that was functional and worked properly, and I am sure that DIMIA officials would prefer that as well, so let us try and get that instead.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,48,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-23,"—The Greens will not be insisting on these amendments passed by the Senate, which were opposition amendments. This is essentially because we do not think they are worth insisting on. They support an ongoing system of mandatory detention. They support discriminatory temporary protection visas. They continue to support the holding of innocent people in Nauru. We are not going to insist on them.
Senator Bartlett has already talked about some of the concerns that have been raised in the debate on this particular bill, including the excessive amount of ministerial power that has been given to the minister and the way in which that will almost inevitably lead to abuse of that power. This piece of legislation sees no fundamental changes to the system of mandatory detention but does provide opportunities for some individuals to be released from detention, but not because there has been a systemic change—it is not an across the board; there are still many people in detention. I spoke with one person tonight who has been in detention for five years. There is nothing in this legislation that indicates that he will be able to be released.
There are some improvements in this bill, and I think that some congratulations need to be given to the people all around the country who have been involved in the campaign that has led to the small improvements that we see this legislation. First and foremost, congratulations go to Mr Georgiou, to the other members of the coalition backbench who have played such an instrumental role in this campaign and to the senators in this chamber who have indicated that they are prepared to stand up for compassion and humanity in these issues.
But most importantly support needs to go to all the people in the community who have been advocating for changes to the system of mandatory detention, some of them since 1996 and some of them since 1992. It has been their pressure and their voices in our newspapers, on talkback radio, in people’s workplaces and in chats in cafes that have led to the changes in this legislation today. I think it is really important that we pay tribute to that groundswell of support within the community for more compassion and humanity and for relabelling ourselves as a welcoming country.
I think it is worth acknowledging people such as a woman I met who has been up in the public gallery. She flew over from Perth three days ago and she has been moving back and forth between the Senate and the House of Representatives to watch and to engage in this debate. Clearly it is something that she feels passionately about so she has been involved and come along to hear the debate. They are the sorts of people it is worth acknowledging in this debate because, if it was not for their contribution, commitment and passion, we would not be seeing coalition backbenchers prepared to stand up and fight for changes, some of which we are seeing in this legislation. I want to acknowledge their contribution in shaping the bills that we are debating today.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-06-23,"—I am not sure whether Senator Conroy has summed up, but I will be brief. I would like to thank senators who have made a contribution to the debate. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is an important step forward in terms of protecting the delivery of high-quality telecommunications services into the future.
This legislation forms part of the government’s response to the regional telecommunications, or Estens, inquiry. Senators would be aware that this inquiry made 39 recommendations in relation to regional telecommunications, all of which the government accepted. A number of the recommendations related to what Mr Estens described as future-proofing, and this legislation relates to these recommendations. The bill does two things: it establishes a requirement on all future governments to conduct regular independent reviews of regional telecommunications services and it ensures that a local presence plan prepared by Telstra can be approved as a condition of Telstra’s licence.
The Howard government has a proud record when it comes to improving telecommunications services in regional Australia. We have overseen the introduction of full telecommunications competition, we have developed tough legislated consumer safeguards and we have provided necessary targeted assistance which has led to marked improvements in regional telecommunications in recent times. The highlight of the government’s assistance is the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, which formed part of the response to the Estens inquiry. We can say without question that consumers in regional Australia have never had better telecommunications services, they have never had greater choice of provider and they have never had stronger safeguards.
Looking to the future, we want to make sure this continues, which is what this bill is about. Trying to predict the precise future telecommunications and communications needs is impossible. Not only does technology change at a rapid pace but so do expectations and legitimate needs of consumers. What we are putting in place with this legislation is a mechanism which ensures that services do not slip backwards but continue to improve in the future. Under this legislation all future governments will have to initiate regular independent reviews of regional telecommunications services. Importantly, the legislation sets the framework for the reviews rather than trying to predict precisely what they should consider or, indeed, when they should occur. What we have said is that they must occur at least every five years, but if it is clear that they should be conducted more frequently then the legislation allows this to occur. This seems to be a point lost on many.
In terms of scope, the reviews quite deliberately focus on the adequacy of services for rural, regional and remote Australia. This is for good reason. It is not because we are ignoring metropolitan Australia; it is because we recognise that rural, regional and remote Australia is at greater risk of missing out on the benefits of new technologies. I am aware that a series of amendments are proposed by Labor which the government will be opposing—we think they would have the effect of totally undermining the bill. Under Labor’s proposed approach there would be no review mechanism specifically looking at regional Australia; instead, the supply of services across Australia would be caught up in a perpetual cycle of reviews. The legislation also sets out that the reviews must be independent of government and that governments must respond to the reviews. There will simply be no excuse for governments to ignore these reviews.
The second part of the legislation relates to Mr Estens’s recommendations about Telstra maintaining a local presence. Telstra’s Country Wide model has been a great success both for Telstra and for the communities it serves. We know how important it is to have local people in local communities able to deal with local issues. The bill provides a mechanism to allow Telstra’s local presence plan to be approved by the minister or the regulator. One of the great myths put about during the debate was the suggestion that somehow we were trying to develop a local presence plan in secret to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. This is wrong. We have always said the requirement to prepare a local presence plan will be set out in a licence condition, which is a disallowable instrument. The plan itself will be developed by Telstra. This was in fact the approach recommended by Estens. But in preparing the plan we will require Telstra to undertake public consultation.
Regional telecommunications services are something that we do take extremely seriously. We feel that the bill is targeted to meet these concerns and issues and to respond to the Estens recommendations as we said we would. This bill helps to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to regional telecommunications services. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-23,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bills.
This provides an opportunity to reflect on the Government’s performance particularly on financial matters.
There are two issues on which I would like to focus: Financial mismanagement of Government programs and dishonesty of the Government as to the financial sustainability of programs.
In doing so it is quickly apparent that not only is the Government incompetent but that it can’t be trusted.
During the course of Senate estimates, I questioned the Department of Finance and administration at length of the budget and costing process.
The Department confirmed that it must approve all program costings.
It also confirmed that it had resumed their monitoring expenditure on a program level—something that had been abandoned in 1999.
It seems remarkable that Finance—which once describes itself as the Chief Financial Officer of the Government—ever ceased monitoring program expenditure. How many CFO’s of public companies would keep their jobs if they did not monitor how company money was spent?
They advised that updated program expenditure is provided by agencies on a monthly basis.
What is clear is that the Department of Finance—as it should—has the capacity to detect very quickly when program expenditure is running ahead of estimates.
After this general discussion, we then turned to the specific issue of the Medicare Safety Net.
Finance advised the committee that yes, the Medicare Safety Net was one of the programs whose cost is monitored by Finance.
Finance was involved in costing the program from its beginnings in April 2003.
At that time the scheme was estimated to cost $67.1 million over four years.
Finance indicated it had approved the Department of Health and Ageing costing of $199.2 million for the expanded scheme announced in November 2004 based on a $500 threshold for concession card holders and $1000 for all others.
Officers were also generally quite forthcoming on the assumptions underpinning the forecast.
The Department was also in prepared revised costings when relevant thresholds were amended in the Senate to $300 and $700 respectively.
The program came into effect on 12 March 2004.
A Press Release from the Minister for Health and Ageing indicated that the Government expected that “450,000 will benefit from the Medicare Safety Net in any one year, costing $266 over the four years”.
A further Press Release from the Health Minister on 9 April 2004 stated that 34,000 individuals or families had accessed the schemed in its first month of operation, 80 per cent through the lower thresholds.
At the Senate hearings Finance confirmed that the costings did take account of proportion of people who would access the scheme through the two different thresholds —clearly a key assumption underpinning the cost of the scheme.
However, they were unable to advise what had been assumed and whether the 8 1 per cent was consistent with the assumption.
After the luncheon adjournment, Departmental officials clammed up saying they were not going to comment publicly on assumptions.
At that time Senator Minchin intervened stating:
“...the Department is quite properly not prepared to engage in a dialogue with you about the details of the way in which it costs this or any other policy.”
This is an extraordinary statement: the Department responsible for approving costings is not prepared to reveal to Parliament the assumptions upon which the costings were based.
This is particularly the case when the assumptions made were clearly well wide of the mark.
We know this because when the budget was presented on 11 May 2004—a little over a month after the Health Ministers Press Release—it provided for additional funding for the safety net of $241.3 million.
The Department confirmed that this brought the total cost of the scheme to $547 million over five years.
Finance also approved this costing.
On 28 June 2004, we had yet another Press Release from the Health Minister boasting that in just three months 415,000 people had accessed the scheme as compared to the 450,000 forecast for the whole year.
Costing Government programs is clearly a difficult task but the assumptions underpinning were hopelessly inaccurate.
The Department was asked whether this had been picked up in the monthly review of program expenditure.
They indicated they had “started to look at the estimates” and there were “indications” that the costs were increasing faster than estimated.
Another press release from Mr Abbott arrived on 23 August 2004.
650,000 people were had accessed the scheme after five months —200,000 more than the initial full year projection of 450,000.
Officials indicated that by that time they
“were in close consultation with the Department of Health and Ageing and we were looking very carefully at the numbers”.
They also advised that:
“Towards the end of August it did become clearer that the program was increasing faster than we had estimated at budget time.”
However, they went on to say
“...on 31 August at 5 o ‘clock the caretaker period commenced. We worked with Health and Ageing to get the revised estimates, which we got and validated on our system on 2 September. The caretaker period had commenced and we were not in a position to advise the Minister of that change.”
They did however state that they “had discussions with his office at officer level, prior to...the caretaker period.”
They indicated that there were 2 or 3 telephone discussions prior to the commencement of the caretaker period on 31 August.
At that time they said they did not “know the real magnitude of the change “but knew it was “significantly greater.”
The Finance Minister recalled that he was aware of the content of these discussions stating:
“My recollection is that my personal staff indicated to me the gist of the conversation they had had with Finance, indicating there may be some increase in the cost of the safety net.”
However, he noted that there had been “no piece of paper, no formal briefing
He then went on to say
I do not like relying on what to me at that stage amounted to hearsay. “
“It was not actionable information.”
How are those remarks to be interpreted?
Hearsay is defined as
“Unverified information heard or received from another.
“Not actionable” would suggest quite simply that no action was taken.
So it would seem that the Minister had been advised of conversations between his office and the Department about an increase in the cost of the Medicare safety.
However, he testified to the Committee, it was hearsay and was not information on which any action could be taken”.
It was not actionable information, the Minister testified, and so presumably he took no action.
That would mean, I suppose, he did not make any telephone calls.
And presumably, according to his testimony, he did not write any letters.
However, just to be sure, I did ask the Minister whether he had written any letter about the matter.
Specifically, I asked him whether
“...as Finance Minister, did you write to the Prime Minister or any other Ministers regarding the cost of the Medicare safety net before the election was called on 31 August...”
It would seem entirely proper that, as Finance Minister he would have considered advising key Ministers that he had the department may have identified what they termed a “significant” increase in the cost of a key component of the Government’s health policy.
In fact, if he was doing his job, he should at least have alerted the Prime Minister that he had reason to believe that the cost of a program that was central to the Government’s health policy and to any future election campaign was advised at a rate that was unsustainable.
The Minister had said that the information was not actionable.
It therefore curious that when the Finance Minister was asked whether he wrote to the Prime Minister or any other Ministers regarding the cost of the Medicare safety net before the election was called on 31 August he responded:
“I am not sure that I would want to comment one way or another on my correspondence with other Ministers”.
It is curious why the Minister wouldn’t answer the simple question. He had described the advice as “hearsay” and “not actionable”.
If that is the case why would he have any problem with saying “no I did not write to the Prime Minister.”
If on the other hand he thought “well its such a key program that I should let the Prime Minister know that we have preliminary advice that there has been a significant increase in the cost”?
Of course when the Government broke its election promise and lifted the thresholds on the Medicare Safety Net after the election he they were not aware before the election that the cost of the was blowing out.
But if that is the case, the Finance Minister shouldn’t have any problem with saying he didn’t communicate with the Prime Minister Department of Finance concerns that there was a “significant blow-out in the cost of the scheme”.
So in summary
Finance is able to monitor program expenditure on a monthly basis. The Medicare Safety Net is one of the programs monitored.
There were “early indications” that the cost of scheme that the cost of the scheme was blowing out in June 2004.
There was evidence there was a “significant” blow out in the cost in August.
This was communicated by the Department of Finance to the Minister’s staff by “two or three” telephone calls in the final days before 31 August.
The Minister of Finance says his staff told him about the verbal advice. He described it as “hearsay” and “not actionable”.
Nonetheless, he refused to say whether he wrote to the Prime Minister on the matter before the election was called on 31 August.
The question which lingers is why he won’t say?",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,51,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-06-23,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak about the Appropriations Bills for 2005-2006.
There is something fundamentally wrong with a budget that ensures that I personally will receive a larger weekly tax cut than all the staff who work for me receive in total.
How do you construct a system that says to the low paid that six dollars a week is fair or reasonable when at the same time you say to the minority paying the top rate that 65 dollars a week is.
This Government makes much of their claims of real wage growth over the last nine years.
They make this claim as a badge of honour, the vast difference between their time in office and the last Labor administration.
What they never acknowledge is that during Labor’s time in government there was a Wages Accord.
An Accord agreed between the Government and the Union Movement where wage increases where delayed for the promise of improvements in the social wage.
An Accord that delivered Medicare in return for wage restraint!
Now compare what happens.
You go to the GP and reach into your own pocket and pay 45 dollars.
You then go to a Medicare office and get 28 dollars back.
Each trip to the doctor now puts you out 17 dollars.
Effectively wiping out three weeks worth of tax cuts for each trip to the doctor!
And the real tragedy in this is that Australian taxpayers pay for Medicare.
It is called the Medicare levy.
The Government spent millions telling everyone about their new policy for Medicare and in this budget they quickly threw that promise out.
This is a Government that pretends to be concerned about Medicare and yet it slowly but surely inflicts the death of a thousand cuts.
This budget and these appropriation bills should have been the opportunity for this country to be set up for the next decade.
Instead what we got was a series of measures designed to set up the Treasurer for his run at the Prime Minister.
We see measures that are designed for no other reason than for the government to run political agendas not to build for the future.
One of the great tragedies is of course flagpoles, flag raising ceremonies and the money available to schools which conform.
The Australian flag flying at every Australian school will increase our national pride and recognise our predecessors’ efforts in building this country.
A worthwhile aim!
One that the Government has also seen fit to tie to funding.
No flag pole then you can’t apply for certain funding.
However even with this the Government cannot help itself.
They start by saying that schools can be reimbursed for the cost of the flag poles.
However the catch is that a member of the Government has to attend the flag raising ceremony for the money to be paid back to the school.
A Member of Parliament who is not a member of the Government is not acceptable.
A State Premier is not acceptable.
One wonders whether the Queen or a member of the Royal Family would be acceptable.
Under the guidelines the only person who can officiate is a member of the Government.
Of course this would be OK if those opposite and in the other place did nothing else with their time over the coming years except go from school to school to preside over these ceremonies.
The reality is that schools have incurred the expenditure and now are waiting—months in some cases for someone from Government to be able to attend the flag raising ceremony.
Thankfully in the state of Western Australia sanity has prevailed.
Once the stupidity of the current Federal policy was apparent Premier Geoff Gallop immediately moved to ensure that the flying of the Australian flag at schools in Western Australia would not be politicised.
As the Premier said and I quote
“It is not John Howard’s or Brendan Nelson’s
money that is being used to fund this worthy
program—it is the Australian taxpayers’ money.
It is not their flag either—it belongs to all of us”
The Western Australian Education Department is now writing to all Western Australian schools telling them that they can access state funding with no conditions attached as to who will officiate at the flag raising.
It would seem that the Federal Government could learn from the common sense approach being adopted in Western Australia.
Above all else the Australian flag should not be politicised in the way the Howard government wants.
Taxpayer’s money should not be appropriated for party political purposes regardless of how the government of the day wants to dress it up.
One of my other serious concerns with these appropriation bills is the failure to address the infrastructure of this country in two regards.
Firstly, physical infrastructure such as roads, ports and water.
Secondly, the skills shortages or the people infrastructure that are affecting the labour market and the economy’s ability to grow.
Western Australia and to a lesser extent Queensland are the engine rooms of economic growth in Australia.
The resources boom especially the long term contracts for north-west gas will continue to have a significant impact on the Australian economy for at least the next two decades.
Most resource projects fall into two main stages—construction and then operation.
Both stages generate significant numbers of jobs—high skilled and highly paid jobs.
One of the key priorities for government is to ensure that there are no constraints to the effective delivery of these projects.
What we are starting to witness and what these appropriation bills fail to do is to address these issues.
Whether it is ageing port infrastructure which is not able to efficiently handle the number of vessels requiring to be loaded or the lack of skilled labour these infrastructure constraints are starting to impact.
Recently it was announced that one of the new rigs required for the North West shelf will be built off shore because of skill shortages in Australia.
Hundreds of jobs—skilled—highly paid jobs are going off shore—not because our labour is too expensive, too inflexible, or too unionised but simply because they do not exist.
This government has been asleep at the wheel.
Skill shortages do not suddenly appear without warning.
For years this Government has committed a deception on the Australian people.
It has pretended that its new Apprenticeship scheme was supplying our future needs.
What they failed to tell anyone was that the New Apprenticeship scheme was not training large numbers of new tradespeople.
It was training large numbers of people in Child Care, in retail, in hospitality and other industries.
However it was not training record numbers of tradespeople.
Now of course when confronted with the crisis—of their own making—we got a surge of activity.
A lot like a hamster running on an exercise wheel—heaps and heaps of running and going exactly nowhere.
What did our skills shortage get from the Government.
A tool box, 24 new technical colleges and 20,000 skilled migrants!
Paying for a tool box is not a bad policy but to pretend that it will address our skill shortage is just nonsense.
24 new technical colleges—none of which will be operating before next year—none of which will produce a single trades person before the year 2010 will help but not for at least four years.
In Western Australia which will have one of the largest demands for skilled labour in the coming years there is only one technical college.
And finally we get the 20,000 increase in skilled migration.
This from the party that said we will decide who comes to this country and the manner in which they come is now throwing open the door to anyone with skills.
Do we know how this is going to work?
Are they only going to import labour in traditional trades areas or will we get 20,000 HR managers?
This of course is the problem with their policy approach.
Lots of headlines, lots of activity and making it up as they go.
I know from the people who contact my office seeking help with skilled migration that we are not talking about a huge surge in tradespeople.
This of course is the problem with imported labour.
It sounds like an efficient way to deal with skill shortages but it relies on the person wanting to come.
What about all the people who are in Australia without full time skilled employment?
What do these appropriation bills hold for them?
More of the same is what they can expect.
No national retraining scheme.
No decent scheme for adult apprenticeships.
No attempt to move the hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australians from the casual unskilled or semi skilled sector of the workforce to the highly skilled jobs needed now and in the future.
No they get more of the same and the government will source the skilled labour from overseas.
Underlying all this is of course the impact it has on wages.
Skill shortages lead to wage increases.
So while the Government wants to introduce sweeping Industrial Relations changes to maintain or increase flexibility in the labour market it may all become absolutely meaningless in the face of skill shortages.
They can legislate all they like to reduce conditions but the reality will be that employers will pay for skilled labour for simple supply and demand reasons.
You can change the regulatory settings as much as you like but in an acute labour shortage it is the employee who determines what price they work for not the employer.
So much for the party that pretends they are the good economic managers.
They are so competent as managers of the Australian economy that we face a skills shortage.
They are the competent managers and yet capacity constraints exist in our transport infrastructure.
There is also another issue that I would like to touch on and that is one that came to light during the Estimates process.
During evidence from the Bureau of Meteorology it appeared that improved weather radar using Doppler technology was being trialled in six sites around Australia.
In fact the first will be in operation in Adelaide later this year.
According to the Bureau these Doppler radars come in at about 2 million dollars per unit and they do not add significantly to maintenance costs.
They have a range of about 100 kilometres which is about half the range of existing weather radar.
The main advantage of the Doppler technology is that it allows the Bureau to detect severe weather conditions more accurately and therefore provide better warnings.
In the United States they have rolled out Doppler sites across the country.
I was surprised to find that there is no Doppler radar site planned for Perth.
Before people complain about me being too parochial I should emphasise that the area to the south of Perth is known in some quarters as Tornado Alley.
In Australia we experience cool air tornados.
Recently the primary school at Bicton was severely damaged by a cool air tornado causing over six million dollars of damage.
Thankfully for all concerned the tornado struck early in the morning well before any students or staff arrived.
Now of course no radar system can prevent the destruction of a tornado—what the new Doppler radar would do is ensure adequate warnings could be given.
I wonder what price we now put on protecting our citizens’ lives.
I would think that a government flush with cash could spend money to build Doppler radar systems around Australia.
The recent budget also included funding to allow the creation of a Tsunami Warning System in Australia with additional funding allocated to the Bureau of Meteorology and Geosciences Australia.
This new funding goes to the heart of what I am talking about.
Government using its funding to provide adequate resources and infrastructure for the betterment of everyone.
The funding in this case will in fact provide assistance to people well beyond Australia and is an indication of Australia as a good neighbour.
The main failing of this budget and of this government is that it has become narrowly focused.
A government concerned about one election win after another rather than working towards a better Australia.
Those on the other side need to understand that simply because it appears to be in their interest doesn’t mean that it is in Australia’s interest.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,51,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-23,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

Appropriations is the end of the process. Once departmental programs and plans have been agreed, resources and needs decided on, Government budgets put down, legislation passed, then the money follows, authorised by Parliament.
Of course some things never materialise and the money is never spent, the program and plan never realised, the people never hired, the capital expenditure never made.
In the next half of this year the media pundits have been telling us that the big political items are going to be big changes to media ownership, big changes to industrial relations, and the sale of Telstra.
The first has little financial consequence for the Commonwealth budget, the second modest financial effects, but the sale of Telstra will be a huge financial issue.
All these proposals depend on their passage through the Senate on the way Government designs them.
You cannot automatically assume that the Government can presume on a Senate majority of one regardless of the proposition put.
The Cabinet will no doubt try to achieve what they will think of as the purest policy outcome, but the politics of compromise will be hovering in the background. The frontbench, the backbench, the Liberals, the Nationals, all making their claim on policy design.
Also in Cabinet’s mind will be the narrow Coalition majority of one in the Senate, a majority they will husband and protect.
The 15 new Senators are unknown in many respects, in character and ability. Two at least come with a yet-to-be-tested reputation for independence of thought and action. There may very well be others of an independent bent, or existing Senators that will show their mettle.
I for one will be trying to give those Senators some advice, particularly any Senators that promise to challenge the Government.
If you are going to change the media laws we are all more at risk than we are now. How are you going to preserve diversity? How are you going to keep owners out of editorial? How are you going to strengthen already weak journalistic independence.
Not by scrapping unfair dismissal laws, that’s for sure.
And strengthening the Trade Practices Act would do heaps for real media competition.
The sale of Telstra is a nice one to try and exert influence on.
If the Nationals are going to sell Telstra they should get something big in return, just for a change, something really meaningful.
When the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 was debated I said a number of things.
I said that economists will tell you that land and labour are two factors of production. They will tell you that continual targeted investment in these factors is essential to long-term sustainable productivity and growth.
A nationalist will tell you that land and labour, our country and our people, are the essential determinants of the nation state.
Investment that starts with a preschool child takes a couple of decades to get a full social and economic return.
Investment in turning around land degradation and material environmental damage similarly take a couple of decades to get a full social and economic return. A failure to invest condemns generations to come.
That of course is what the economic rationalists are guilty of: a failure to invest adequately in our land and labour, a failure that we will be paying for over generations.
In many places our land is in large-scale crisis.
As a West Australian, I am particularly conscious of that. Among others, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation have spelt out just how much money they think is needed, and it is a huge sum.
It runs into the multibillions. It is in the national interest, if Telstra were to be sold, for some of the proceeds to be used for the long-term good of Australia and its peoples.
So the first job of the Nationals is to get a few billions to help reverse the disaster that is salinity, secure better water supplies and to restore the health of our water and land systems.
In various speeches I have said there are great dangers in contemplating media ownership reform, the sale of Telstra or an end to the four pillars banking policy without a divestiture power as a necessary safeguard.
We know from experience that market forces will not guarantee competition in highly concentrated industry sectors. Regulatory powers are necessary safeguards for efficient, effective and diverse competition.
Current divestiture provisions in the Trade Practices Act are very limited and should be expanded. We must look to the success of divestiture laws in other dynamic and productive markets such as the United States. Without them, changing current policy in key market areas such as telecommunications, media and banking raises immense difficulties.
I said that the Telstra structure argument is difficult. The necessity and practicality of vertical or horizontal separation is an issue. Certainly, divestiture provisions in the Trade Practices Act would give the ACCC power to order divestiture post sale if it thought it necessary.
There is the possibility that some of Telstra’s money could be used, for instance, in areas such as increased investment in rail—another infrastructural area badly in need of investment. The states of South Australia, Victoria, NSW and Queensland badly need fast modernised freight train services.
Speaking personally, if I was negotiating I would leave issues like the structure of Telstra, CSO’s and other obligations to whatever the Coalition thrash out.
So, what is the negotiations checklist that I will tell the Nationals to get with the sale of Telstra? In three simple points: strengthen the Trade Practices Act, get money for rail, water and land degradation, and splash out on an essential bit of social restoration.
Top of the list are all the excellent recommendations of the March 2004 Senate Economics Committee’s report into the Trade Practices Act. I’ve watched the Nationals closely on trade practices reform. They have talked the talk but never yet walked the walk.
This is their chance to show what they are made of.
The Telstra sale will be worth tens of billions. Take a few of those billions for rail, for water and for the land. There will be more than enough left for the Liberals.
If it was me I’d also take anywhere up to half a billion to meet the needs of the Forgotten Australians. Reparations alone in that report needs a sizeable sum.
Turning to the Appropriations at large—the Bills appropriate additional funds, predominantly budget commitments.
The 2004-05 Bills are unusual in that they are supplementary to the usual additional estimates bills. However, they are not unusual in that they are, to all intents and purposes, the same as the usual additional estimates bills. Some of these items include:
$160m for transitional relief to compensate eligible entities that lost access to the FBT exemption (This includes the South Australian entities that we lobbied hard for including the Intellectual Disability Services Council, the Metropolitan Domiciliary Care, the Julia Farr Centre and the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science)
$35.1m for the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission;
another $28.2m for the Australian Defence force deployment to Iraq
$23m in increased financial contribution to UN peacekeeping operations
$5.1m for the Kogarah Oval upgrade
$4m to reimburse the States for the cost of providing medical teams under the Tsunami relief effort
The 2005-06 Bills deal with ‘ordinary’ and other annual services of government.
The No.1 Bill comprises the ordinary annual services.
The No.2 Bill of $7.787 billion is larger than the previous years’ appropriation of $5.187 billion largely due to higher appropriations for Defence and Transport and Regional Services Portfolio.
These Bills provide the Government with money to perform its election promises. Although we do not agree with all of the spending priorities of this Government, the Democrats were established with a principle that we would not block Government supply.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-06-23,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Mr President, Hon. Senators, in Hobart in my home State of Tasmania we have 3 centres of excellence relevant to fisheries and marine studies.
There is the CSIRO Division of Fisheries, the University of Tasmania School of Zoology and the Marine Research Laboratories, the last of which have played an important role in the development of Tasmania’s wild fisheries and aquaculture industries.
With the development of these superior facilities, Hobart really has become the fisheries/marine capital of the world.
Tonight, however, I wish to focus on the impressive work being done by the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, which is based at Taroona near Hobart in Tasmania’s south.
The Institute was established in 1998 as a centre of excellence in applied aquatic research to support the development and sustainable management of Tasmania’s living marine resources and since that time has gone from strength to strength.
The Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute (TAFI) is a joint venture between the Tasmanian Government and the University of Tasmania. It has core programs in Wild Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Environment.
It also combines the research resources of the Marine Research Laboratories, the Fish Health Unit, the School of Aquaculture and the School of Zoology.
This partnership has created a store of research and resources and has led to improved funding opportunities and an international reputation as a centre of excellence in applied marine research.
The Wild Fisheries Program is internationally recognised for its excellence in the provision of science necessary for optimising the sustainable use of marine resources.
TAFI’s research assists the sustainable development of my State’s highly valued abalone and rock lobster fisheries, as well as scalefish, giant crabs, scallops, calamari and other fisheries. Commercial and recreational fisheries play a very important role in the social and economic development of our island State.
Research undertaken by TAFI will ensure that these fisheries will be available for future generations to use.
Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry in Australia and Tasmania’s contribution is significant, particularly in its production of Atlantic salmon and Pacific oysters. TAFI’s Aquaculture Program supports the industry through innovative research on aquatic animal health, production of aquatic animals and the nutrition of aquatic animals. The Program also places strong emphasis on developing new species such as the striped trumpeter and the southern rock lobster.
The Marine Environment Program through its work ensures the health and proper functioning of Tasmania’s marine ecosystems, especially in light of their use by multiple stakeholders for many and diverse purposes. It provides research to support the sustainable natural resource management of Tasmania’s marine resources.
The program undertakes research on topics such as estuarine and marine habitat mapping, effects of fishing and aquaculture on marine ecosystems, introduced marine pests and marine animals and seabirds.
The Institute’s Marine Research Laboratories in Hobart have played a major role in developing Tasmania’s wild fisheries and aquaculture industries. The complex includes specialist chemical and biological laboratories, a major aquaculture facility undertaking novel research on new species. It also has a large fleet of vessels providing for various marine and freshwater research activities.
The School of Aquaculture, which is located in Launceston on the University of Tasmania campus, has an excellent reputation for both teaching and research. It has excellent research aquaculture facilities, state-of-the-art laboratories and strong links with industry that allows for work experience, scholarships and employment opportunities.
It has the largest postgraduate research program in aquaculture in Australia with a team of dedicated researchers leading in their fields of expertise. Because of this, the School can boast that its graduates are highly sought after at both the national and international levels. It is also the only university in Australia to offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses entirely in aquaculture.
Aquaculture is becoming increasingly important as global demand for fish and shellfish is increasing, while the capacity of natural fisheries is declining. Consequently, future increases in production will have to come from aquaculture, which currently accounts for 25% of the world’s seafood production.
The School of Zoology is located on the Hobart campus of the University of Tasmania and has internationally recognised research activities in marine and freshwater environments and wild fisheries. Its field training environments are such that they are the envy of zoologists around the world.
Tasmania is an ideal location in which to study zoology, offering exceptional opportunities due to its unique fauna and biogeographical history. Our State also offers easy access to pristine marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats.
The wilderness areas, which are in close proximity, provide a natural laboratory and a unique experience for students. The University of Tasmania is also the only Australian university that has alpine habitat right on its doorstep. It also has more opportunities for underwater research than any other Australian university.
The University of Tasmania, in conjunction with the Institute also offers a course in Fisheries Science, which is the integration of studies in biology, ecology, mathematics, computing, economics, sociology, policy and law. Fisheries scientists have specialist knowledge of marine resources and their supporting ecosystems. The discipline includes assessing and monitoring fish stocks, fisheries production and utilisation, studying the effects of fishing and investigating threatened species.
It is a very important field of study as the future of our global marine ecosystems relies on the decisions that are made by those in charge of such resources today. Fisheries scientists provide crucial advice to help build sustainable fisheries, protect endangered and threatened species, and maintain healthy and proper functioning marine ecosystems.
This program is unique as no other institution in Australia and only a handful of overseas institutions offer this course. There is a national and international shortage of people trained in fisheries science.
The Institute’s strategic plan is aimed at sustainable growth in Tasmanian fisheries and aquaculture as well as improving knowledge of estuarine and marine ecosystems. It also aims to foster the strong relationships it has with other entities such as CSIRO Marine as well as developing new international alliances. It strives for excellence, professionalism, quality, initiative and innovation. All of this is done with the ultimate purpose of ensuring the long-term prosperity of Tasmanians.
I would like to congratulate the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute on the exceptional, important and unique work that it does. Its vision is for international excellence and by all accounts it is certainly achieving this. It is great to see work of this quality being undertaken by our scientists.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute</title>,ADJOURNMENT,56,1
