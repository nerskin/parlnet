The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  Senators, as you are aware on 15 September this year the Clerk of the Senate, Dr Rosemary Laing, gave notice to me that she intends to retire as Clerk on 8 March next year. The Parliamentary Service Act provides for the Clerk to be appointed by the President following consultation with senators. A person may not be appointed as Clerk unless they have extensive knowledge of, and experience in, relevant parliamentary law, procedure and practice.


I consulted with senators on the selection process I proposed to adopt and received support for that process. I was assisted in this process by the Deputy President, Senator Lines; Senator Brandis, as Leader of the Government in the Senate; Senator Gallagher, as the representative of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; Senator Siewert, as a representative of the Australian Greens and the Australian Greens' longest-serving senator; and Senator Xenophon, as the longest-serving senator on the crossbench.


Following an open, competitive and merit-based selection process, the selection panel unanimously agreed that the current Deputy Clerk, Mr Richard Pye, demonstrated greater merit and should be appointed Clerk of the Senate. Following consultation yesterday—



Honourable senators:  Hear, hear!



The PRESIDENT:  I am sure the Deputy Clerk is monitoring the chamber very closely, as a diligent Deputy Clerk would! Following consultation yesterday with the Standing Committee on Appropriations, Staffing and Security, I am pleased to now inform the Senate that I have appointed Mr Richard Pye as Clerk of the Senate to take effect on 9 March next year. I congratulate Richard on his appointment as the next Clerk of the Senate and look forward to working with him in his new role. As a matter of interest, he will be the 14th Clerk of the Senate in 115 years.


So as not to conflate the two issues, and to give due credit to Richard Pye's selection as Clerk, I will be making a further announcement regarding the retirement of our current Clerk, Dr Rosemary Laing, later in the week.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:33):  by leave—Mr President, it is a very big day for the announcement of important constitutional officers. Some three hours ago, the government announced the appointment of the 13th Chief Justice of Australia, and you have just announced the appointment of the 14th Clerk of the Senate. On behalf of government senators, I wish to offer my warmest congratulations to Richard Pye on his selection. Without any disrespect to the other candidates, I think I can say that Richard Pye was the outstanding—indeed, in many ways, the obvious—choice for promotion to the role of Clerk of the Senate.


Richard graduated with degrees in economics and law from the University of Sydney, and he has spent almost all of his career in public service. He first became a member of the Senate staff in 1992, almost 25 years ago. Because this is a 10-year, non-renewable appointment, and as Richard has indicated that it would be his intention to serve the full 10 years, by the time his service to the Australian Senate expires he will have served the Senate for almost 35 years. That is not unique, but it is exceptional. In the modern age it is very, very rare indeed.


Those of us on the government side of the chamber who have come to know and deal with Richard Pye over the years have found him exemplary. He is gracious; he is gentlemanly; he is helpful; he is an authority on Senate practice; he is engaging—he is everything that one would wish an office holder of such an important and, in many ways, sensitive office to be. On behalf of government senators, I congratulate Richard very warmly. He is a popular figure in this chamber. He is one of the characters of the place, and, although not a public figure in the way that politicians are, he is every bit as much a part of the Senate as those of us who serve as senators. We wish him well in what I am sure will be a distinguished term.


There will be another occasion, as you mentioned, to express our deep, deep appreciation for the service of Dr Rosemary Laing, the retiring Clerk of the Senate. But that can be a matter for another day.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:36):  by leave—I rise on behalf of opposition senators to add our congratulations to Richard Pye on this appointment. We have obviously had the opportunity over many years to work with him, and we echo the comments of Senator Brandis as to his capacity and competence. I asked the Clerk when Mr Pye started, and I was told 1992. I was trying to recall what some of us might have been doing in 1992. He began as a journals officer, I am told. As you have said, Mr President, he is the 14th Clerk. 


I would just like to make a brief point, if I may, about the tradition of which Richard Pye is a part. I think we have a strong tradition, an important tradition, in this chamber of parliamentary officers who are both principled and competent. The country is well served by the outstanding officers who make up the parliamentary officers associated with the Senate. They are in many ways the guardians of the role of this chamber and the tradition of this chamber. Many of them outlast many senators. They perform an extraordinarily important role. We look forwarded to working with Richard Pye. We have no doubt that he will continue the outstanding tradition to which I have alluded. 


In relation to Dr Laing, there will be much more to say—I am sure she is very happy to hear that—before we rise on this occasion.

We can all recall him at different times. If you have been working here for a period of time you would have seen Richard in different places. When we were in opposition, the assistance he gave us in the drafting office, for example, was absolutely essential. Somebody who has worked in almost every element of assistance to this chamber is, I am sure, going to bring a great deal of experience to the job. I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Nationals, to congratulate him.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:40):  I stand to oppose this bill on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. Working people have got a lot to fear from this bill and a lot to fear from this coalition government. We have a government with a weak Prime Minister. It is a government which is controlled by the extremists in the coalition. We have a Prime Minister with no values and absolutely no principles. He will do whatever he needs to do, whatever he has to do, to placate the worst elements in the coalition, and this bill epitomises some of the worst elements of the coalition in its antiworker approach to Australian workers around this country. This is a Prime Minister who has no coherent economic plan—no plan on how to take this economy forward. So what do you do? You simply attack the trade union movement and give in to the worst elements in your party. 


We had this GST plan from the Prime Minister. A GST was going to be put in place. When that fell apart—it did not last very long—the plan was that the states could tax themselves. That did not last very long either. And then we got down to the nitty-gritty of the coalition: their economic plan to attack the trade union movement and provide a $50 billion tax cut to some of the biggest corporations, some of the multinational corporations, in this country, which give money to the coalition to allow them to run their election campaigns. So the money would go back again through the public purse in a $50 billion tax cut to the big end of town. In addition to that, the government want to give the big end of town even more rights over working people. They want to take their rights away in order to limit bargaining in this country like no other country in the world. No other advanced country in the world has laws like those being proposed by this government right now. 


We certainly know why the government are running this agenda. This is a former Prime Minister Tony Abbott special: attack the union movement. When you are in trouble, break glass, attack the trade union movement—and this government is in trouble. They are an absolute rabble. They are fighting with each other. They have no agenda for this place other than to attack workers rights. This is a government that has not got a lot of legs; it has certainly got no backbone in terms of looking after ordinary working people. It will give in to former Prime Minister Abbott, because former Prime Minister Abbott is gunning for the current Prime Minister. We know that there is chaos and division within this government. We saw it the other day when Mr Abbott was publicly telling Mr Turnbull that we should revisit the 2014 budget. Remember that budget? It was the budget that was going to cut pensions; the budget that was going to take rights away from some of the poorest and weakest welfare recipients in the country. People who cannot look after themselves were going to be thrown to the wolves. Young Australians who may live in an area where there are no jobs, where too many people are looking to get into too few jobs, would have to live on fresh air for six months. This is the type of government that it is. And we see the pressure to revisit that—cutting pensions and coming after the poorest and weakest in our society.


And part of this is their industrial relations agenda—because the one thing that stands between unscrupulous employers and bad governments like this government is the trade union movement of Australia, which has won every significant right for workers in this country. This is not a government that has ever stood up and supported increases for workers in the old Fair Work Commission. They have never done that. They have never stood up for workers. In fact, their DNA is laid out for all to see. You do not need a microscope to see their DNA because it is written all over them—and it is Work Choices. It is about forcing workers to negotiate individually with their employer. It is about subjugating workers to the will of the employer. It is about complete managerial prerogative for the company and the boss over individual workers.


If that had been the state of industrial relations in this country over the last so many years, what would the living standards of workers be now? Those living standards would be down the tube. Those living standards would be decimated. If workers think it is hard enough to make ends meet under this government, it would have been impossible to make ends meet if there had not been strong trade unions out there bargaining for the trade union movement and then those increases flowing through to the rest of the non-unionised economy. These are the issues that underpin this bill. It is about giving more power and more rights to the people who sit in the back of their Bentleys handing out brown paper bags with $10,000 in them to Liberal candidates in Newcastle—the property developers who want to build their properties cheaper and cheaper and do not want to pay a construction worker a decent rate of pay but are prepared to send a brown paper bag with 10 grand in it over to a Liberal politician, in breach of the law.


We hear much from this mob about the rule of law. But look at the Liberal Party in New South Wales. When they are faced with 10 Liberal Party politicians having to resign or get kicked out because of breaches of the law, what do they do? They sack the ICAC commissioner and they get rid of ICAC's teeth. That is what they do—because they do not want to be embarrassed with their faulty memories in front of ICAC. They do not want to have to front up to show where the money is coming from to fund their election campaigns. We know where it is from. It is from the property developers. It is from the big tier 1 companies that are going to benefit from this bill. This is all about payback to the big companies in return for diminishing workers' rights.


If this bill goes ahead, we have heard arguments that it will reduce costs in the building industry by 30 per cent. I have not seen any economic modelling or arguments to say that that is the case and would then lead to improved productivity because you reduce costs. Those two things actually do not go together. But let us think that that is right. If there is going to be a reduction in costs of 30 per cent, who do you think will be shouldering that reduction in costs? It will not be the executives on multimillion-dollar salaries. It will not be the human resources officers earning half a million dollars a year. It will not be the management group. It will be the carpenters, the riggers, the boilermakers, the fitters and the tilers who go out there every day and give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. They are the ones who will lose from this bill. They are the ones who are being attacked. You will get all this argument about 'this unlawful industry'. Well, I put it to you that building workers go out there every day in this industry and they never experience anything like what we hear from those opposite. They do not experience it. They have a decent enterprise agreement through their unions—mainly the CFMEU in the building industry, a union that is out there looking after working people. But what do this mob do? They pick the worst elements. And there are bad elements in every area. You only have to look at the banking industry. They will not have a royal commission into the banking industry, will they? No—because the banking industry is the big end of town. It is too powerful and there is too much money going into their coffers for them to actually take the banking industry on.


But they will take on the union movement because the union movement is what actually keeps wages and conditions up in this country. As we see wages stagnating in this country, never has there been a greater need for strong trade unions in this country, not weakened trade unions. And if there are people misbehaving, if there are people breaking the law, they should be dealt with under the law. There are more than enough laws without bringing in a bill like this, which provides power to probably the worst statutory office holder in the country, Nigel Hadgkiss. Mr Hadgkiss, who will head up this body, has an absolute contempt for accountability. He has a contempt for the Senate. He has a contempt for the estimates process, which is about public officers coming here and being open with the parliament about what they are spending money on and what they are doing. He has an absolute contempt for that. He has a contempt for senators in this place. In fact, this is a statutory office holder who has lied to my face on at least three occasions. I have asked for him to provide his diary—as many, many public servants and statutory officers have to do—for accountability issues. And this statutory office holder, Nigel Hadgkiss, says: 'I don't have a diary. I don't keep a diary.' Can you imagine any senior public servant, any statutory office holder, who does not have a diary? We said, 'There must be some way that people keep tabs on what you're doing.' When I asked the chief financial officer of the Fair Work Building Commission why Mr Hadgkiss did not keep a diary and did they keep a diary and did they know what he was doing, they said no.


So we have a public officer who wants to operate in complete secrecy. What we have found out is that he does have a diary, because under a freedom of information request we got a copy of one part of his diary. So this person lies to the Senate. This person is a bully, this person is unaccountable, this person is into cronyism and gets rid of whoever he does not like within that organisation and puts his own cronies in. He is surrounded by cronies. He is vindictive against anyone who would stand up to him. He is absolutely secretive and, as I have indicated, he has lied to the Senate. This is the man who is in charge of the Fair Work Building Commission now and who they obviously want to put in charge of the ABCC, if ever it comes in.


There are a number of amendments before the Senate today. Senator Xenophon has put up a range of amendments. I must say, I have not had a chance to see the detail of those amendments, and here we are because the government wants a victory. In my view, this is going to be a Pyrrhic victory if it goes through. I need time and the Labor Party needs time to sit down with Senator Xenophon to ask some questions about the implications and the intent of some of the amendments that will be coming through. There is a need to do that. This is a bill that is complex. This bill, in terms of its impact on ordinary Australians, is absolutely terrible. This is a government which, as I said, have Work Choices in their DNA. They will attack the trade union movement. If there are people doing the wrong thing they should be dealt with under the laws as they exist. We have a regulator—a very strong and powerful regulator in the Fair Work Building Commission—but what this does is impinge even more on workers' rights to collective bargaining. So we will have a number of issues that we want to raise. In closing, Senator Cash, do you intend to appoint Mr Hadgkiss as head of ABCC? If so, why— (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-11-29,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:55):  The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 is ruthless, not just to building workers but to all working people in Australia and all Australians. While in the first instance it is directed at building workers, the intent is to weaken industrial relations across the board, and if that occurs the flow-on impact for all Australians is huge. Organised working people established so many of the conditions that we all enjoy in this country, not just conditions of work but so much to do with our health conditions and our education conditions. Right now we have to deal with the ABCC legislation. We are in committee and we are about to get our teeth into the amendments. But we also need to acknowledge the context. There is now a real desperation around the Turnbull government. The clock is ticking down on the last few days of parliament. They have left it to the last hour and this legislation has to be passed. It is not legislation that will bring benefits to the country but legislation that delivers for the constituency of the Turnbull government.


The Turnbull government have some big friends in corporate Australia. They donate millions of dollars to the government and they expect something in return. While they are friends, the Turnbull government are probably looking forward to a few Christmas parties and sharing a few cocktails and a few drinks with their corporate colleagues, their corporate mates, who have helped deliver them into power. But they would know that those apparent corporate friends can turn on them if they do not deliver, and right now at the top of the agenda they have to deliver. The registered organisations bill went through, but the ABCC legislation is what they want in their pocket and they want it before Christmas. Corporate Australia is sweating on it and, as I said, they can change overnight for the Turnbull government.


This is shocking legislation because what it would do to a section of the workforce is treat them as second-class citizens. They would have reduced legal rights and reduced rights at work—something that we have not seen in Australia for a while. You would probably have to go back to how we treated Indigenous people before the 1960s, before the 1967 amendment, when you had second-class laws for a group of people who were working for greater productivity in Australia and working to assist all of us with the benefits that come when you have new hospitals, new schools and homes are built—all those sorts of things.


It is important, as we go into the committee stage and start considering the amendments, to remember why the government is doing this. This is where the big lie comes in. It is very relevant to our debate now. The government has a constituency, corporate Australia, that wants the industrial relations laws of this country weakened. That is in fact what all conservative governments have done. You can go back to the Menzies government. Penal powers were part of the arbitration act then. Ordinary Australians opposed that very strongly. Going through the Fraser government and the Howard government, they have all had their signature legislation to do something similar, but you would probably have to come to this legislation to see something as atrocious as what the Turnbull and Abbott governments have come up with.


Why do they want it? Why do they want the industrial relations laws that affect working conditions and affect how union officials operate in the workplace? Why is this legislation being brought forward? If you weaken working conditions, if you weaken how unions can operate and if you weaken how working people can come together and collectively organise, you are actually assisting the corporations to increase their profits, because the fewer conditions and the fewer regulations they have to cope with the more they can get away with doing a whole lot of things. That is why you have heard so many of the speakers in the second reading debate detail the tragic deaths that are occurring on our building sites. That is a result of poor occupational health and safety standards, and we will see that occur more.


But also, if unions are weakened, working people cannot come together so readily and collectively organise, and it is harder to get pay rises. This is the reason the government is doing it: corporate Australia wants it. Corporate Australia is on the earth—its job, its legal requirement, is—to do the best for its shareholders. What do its shareholders want? Its shareholders want more profits. They want more money in their pockets. That is its job.


And that is where the job of governments should be to get that balance right, to ensure that we have fair industrial relations so unions can organise and workers can come together collectively and so the young apprentice who turns up on the job, has only been there for a few days, is ordered to go on to the roof and do some repairs and ends up falling off might have a bit of back-up to say: 'Hey, don't do that, mate. That's actually unsafe. We need to ensure that you've got a harness on.' They are the sorts of practical things that we are dealing with here.


We know the speeches from the government benches were really disgraceful. You really would not have thought people mattered from the way they delivered their speeches. That is why the coalition are desperate to get this legislation through. They want to be able to go to their Christmas parties and enjoy it there with the developers, with the property investors, who are hanging out and who have been lobbying hard for these changes.


The other part of this story is that the government, Senator Cash as the responsible minister and Prime Minister Turnbull, the leader of the government, cannot go out and say: 'We really have to get this legislation through. Our corporate backers, who give us all these donations, really want us to do it.' They cannot say that. Obviously, that is not going to wash with the public. It would really give you an insight into how government works. So they come up with their reasons, and the reasons they have come out with are quite unbelievable. I will just give you a couple of them.


Prime Minister Turnbull linked the whole issue of union activity with the housing crisis. I suppose he, or maybe somebody's office, thought: 'Let's solve two problems in one. We'll blame the housing crisis not on the way we run government, with our negative gearing and our capital gains tax discounts; we'll blame it on the unions.' This is from the Prime Minister. He expressed sympathy for 'young Australian couples that can't afford to buy a house because their costs are being pushed up by union thuggery'. According to the government, that is one of the reasons why we need these rules.


I have to say that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, really took the cake when he came up with his excuses. This is a quote from Peter Dutton:


When young Australians go to an open house this weekend, to a unit that they may not be able to afford or that they have been saving up for, they know that that unit is more expensive because they have seen building costs increase as a result of the involvement of the unions and bikies.


Now they have even pulled the bikies into it as causing the housing crisis.


There they are blaming the unions for the housing crisis. That one blows up in their face, because, if you look at all the causes of the housing crisis, there is no link here. It is worth going through this, because these are the lies the government has been relying on to try and justify the legislation that we now have before us. We are now about to start debating the amendments, so it is very relevant when senators come to consider the amendments.


These arguments from the likes of Prime Minister Turnbull and Minister Dutton rely on various hypotheses. I will just go through them. They include that union activity has expanded in construction, that construction wages and labour costs have accelerated as a result, that total construction costs have also accelerated correspondingly and that housing prices rise in tandem with escalating construction costs.


Let us look at the reality here. This falls over monumentally. How Prime Minister Turnbull allowed himself to go out with that one, I do not know. Maybe he did not have enough sleep that night. At any rate, I will just go through how they all fall over. Average earnings in the construction industry have grown more slowly than the Australian average over the last five years. Real wage increases in construction have been slower than real productivity growth, with the effect that real unit labour costs in construction have declined.


Then we have construction labour. Construction labour accounts for only 17 to 22 per cent of the total costs of new building. Construction costs in turn account for less than half the market value of residential property. And then there is the main issue—if you want to go back to where they probably started their thesis—that in the housing industry there is very low union activity. Not many construction workers in the housing industry are members of a union.


I thank the Centre for Future Work and the Australia Institute for that analysis, because it is very useful. Here we have a Prime Minister trying to justify why we need to rein in unions, rein in those bad construction workers and bring in the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He says it is because we have a housing crisis and young people particularly cannot afford to buy a house. They heap it all onto the union movement. It all falls over entirely. If we had some honesty from the government, they are the sorts of things that they would bring into this debate that we are considering right now.


The Greens have voted against the legislation in the second reading. We will vote against it in the third reading. But we will move amendments, because at times it is necessary to do that. With appalling legislation that looks as though it could be about to become law, we will do what we can to improve it. Still, our clear position is that it should not pass.


Some of our amendments will be around the issue of procurement. Surely, when we come to talking about the building industry—particularly when you are hearing from the people on the government benches about how we are going to bring in the ABCC and productivity will increase, the economy will bloom and all the rest of the Christmas fairytales that they come out with—if you are sincere about that, what you should be committed to is a building code that includes a requirement for procuring local materials. The steel industry should figure strongly in that, and it would bring such benefit to the country, as the steel industry in this country is on the edge of collapse. Again, it is extraordinary that the government is not giving this more attention. How can you have a country the size of Australia without a steel industry? We have an opportunity to address that in this legislation.


Then there is the issue of local jobs. The Greens will move amendments to require that, where the code applies, jobs have to be advertised locally and the employer must demonstrate there is no suitable local applicant before guest workers can be used. There are a number of people on the cross-bench who regularly talk about the need for local jobs. Here is their opportunity to stand up for local jobs, which are very relevant to this legislation. There are many unemployed construction workers in this country, who often become fly-in fly-out workers, which really disrupts communities. Why is that? It is because they cannot find local work. All senators have an opportunity here to support some very responsible amendments that would help boost productivity in this country and ensure there is jobs growth, particularly in regional areas and in states where there is growing unemployment.


Those are some of the issues that we are looking forward to getting our teeth into, because right now the question is: Minister, can you explain how the housing crisis is in any way associated with the so-called union thuggery that you have been talking about for so long, considering that there is minimal union activity in the housing industry. I ran through the various parameters. None of them stack up to show that there is any link between increased union activity and the housing crisis. I do think that would be a wise starting point for you, to inject some honesty into this debate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:09):  I actually have a question for the minister, which is what the committee stage is about. The committee stage is not about making 15-minute speeches after you have had your chance for 20 minutes in the second reading debate.


I have been listening to this debate quite intently. I have been trying to understand just what it is that the Greens are opposed to in this bill. I am sure Senator Rhiannon does not support the sort of thuggery that we have heard of from union officials or the sort of thuggery, against women in particular, that we have heard of in the royal commission and in various court proceedings around the country. I am sure Senator Rhiannon would not be involved in that. I know Senator Rhiannon was quite openly a member of the Communist Party in days gone by. I sort of understand her political philosophies from that. That is fine. It is a free country. You can support communism if you like. That is one of the glories of being a free country such as this. I am trying to understand why the Greens are opposed. I have listened intently to everything Senator Rhiannon has just spoken about—I was listening on the TV monitor upstairs before I came down—and I cannot find any reason why the Greens would be so opposed to this.


It suddenly occurs to me that perhaps the Greens are getting some political donations, some cash donations, from the CFMEU and others.




Senator Cormann:
  Surely not!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I don't know, and that is why I am exercising my right in this committee stage to ask the minister. Minister, can you assist me. Do you have any information that might answer my query? Do the Greens get money donations from the CFMEU or any other trade union? That can be the only reason why the Greens are so opposed to this.


I know why the Labor Party is opposed. I can understand that. They are all here because the unions put them here. They only stay here for as long as the unions give them the tick to stay here. Senator Cameron, who is in the chamber, will know this well. His good mate George Campbell fell out of favour with the unions, and as a result of that Senator Cameron was able to come in. It was nothing Senator Cameron did; it was the unions that did it. So I understand the Labor Party as clearly as a bell. I am not in any doubt as to what that is all about. But I cannot understand the Greens, unless there is an element of monetary donation to the Greens political party. I know the Greens got the biggest corporate donation in the history of Australian politics—$1.6 million from a single businessman. It was the biggest donation ever. I understand that. That is why there were certain funny arrangements made in Tasmania a few years ago, including an attempt to have tax free status for a certain newspaper that was associated with, perhaps, the donor. But that is all past history. I understand that, but I cannot understand why the Greens are so opposed to this particular bill, unless there is a simple explanation. That might be it; it might not be. I am just wondering whether the minister can help me on that.

Senator Cameron asked me about the appointment of the director of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. In response to that question I refer you to clause 4 of the transitional bill, which provides for the continuation of the appointment of the director.


In response to Senator Rhiannon's question in relation to the impact of costs in the housing market, when you have an increase in costs in the commercial construction sector there is an obvious flow on through the whole construction market. What this bill is designed to do is, obviously, increase productivity and decrease costs in the commercial construction sector, which would have obvious flow ons in relation to the housing market, as you so referred.


In relation to the question posed by Senator Macdonald, my understanding is, yes, the Australian Greens are or have been in receipt of moneys from the CFMEU. It might be that Senator Roberts, who articulated this in his very good speech to the Senate last night, is able to refer to it and provide more information to the Senate, unless of course the Australian Greens would like to.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:14):  Far be it from me to raise the issue that Senator Rhiannon has raised but, as I understand it, Senator Rhiannon was talking about not the commercial building industry but the residential building industry, because that is where the Prime Minister and you, Senator Cash, were saying it would cost more to build a house unless this bill goes through. That is an absolute nonsense. The residential building industry is very, very likely unionised, and it is certainly not unions that determine the rates of pay and conditions in the residential building industry.


I want to go to two other matters while I am on my feet. Given that Senator Macdonald has set the standard by speaking for 10 minutes before asking a question—especially when he said he was going to ask the question and not make a speech—I think the rules have now been set by the other side. There are two issues I want to raise. The first issue is: what is the driver of much of the problem in this industry? What is the impediment to productivity? What is the issue that individual contractors, small businesses and employees face? The issue is that they are not getting paid for work that they do. They are not getting paid. I was very pleased to seek the establishment of an inquiry into insolvency in the building and construction industry. There are lots of things that go to productivity that are much wider than whether there is some rough-haired, stupid union official going onto your site and getting into a brawl with a boss. Come on! That is not the issue. The issue is companies not paying their bills and phoenixing. They are coming back without paying their bills and establishing themselves again as a company.


I saw an analysis of this by a company called Sutton Douglass Lawyers. If you are talking about getting some reasonable industrial relations in the industry then you have to deal with the $3 billion of unpaid bills in the industry that see workers going without any money, companies going bust because they are not getting paid and families breaking up because the chief earner in the household has got no money coming in—and you know all the drama that that can cause in a household.


This firm, Sutton Douglass Lawyers, says that there are a range of issues that go to insolvency, that there are a number of issues that come through. One of those, basically, is that if you do not get paid when you are running a small company then workers are underpaid or paid irregularly. It is not the Labor Party and it is not the unions who are saying this; this is a big-end-of-town litigation company that deals with these issues. They say workers are underpaid or paid irregularly. They say suppliers are not paid. They say superannuation payments are not paid. We know this mob opposite do not care about superannuation. They have never supported a superannuation increase for workers ever since they have been in parliament—and ever since superannuation has been around. Sutton Douglass Lawyers also say workers have their employment status changed from permanent to casual. How often have you seen that happening? Again, this is big-end-of-town lawyers saying, 'Here are the implications for the industry of not paying your debts.' The implication is that warranties or guarantees provided for workmanship by the old entity have become unenforceable and worthless. So, if you actually get a block of flats built and there is a warranty on that flat, the company simply goes bust and phoenixes up again—they might be building the block of flats next door. There is no warranty and there is no comeback on that company. Sutton Douglass Lawyers also say that workers are pressured to take leave while the businesses transfer from the old entity to the new and the interest of company owners and directors takes priority at the cost of creditors, who do not get paid.


There is a detrimental effect on the community, there is an erosion of the revenue base and there are increased enforcement costs that stem from the avoidance of regulatory obligations. We had much evidence from the Australian Taxation Office and ASIC about the problems that they have dealing with this issue of phoenixing. Sutton Douglass Lawyers go on to say that, by not paying their taxes and employee entitlements, companies have an unfair competitive advantage. So you have companies that are out there battling to do the right thing—paying the wages of workers week in and week out, paying the proper tax and fixing the warranty issues up—and then you have these phoenix companies that are just going bust and getting an unfair advantage.


This is the type of behaviour that this government is supporting with this bill. Make no mistake about it: this is the type of behaviour that this government is supporting. I will come back to this down the line, because there was a report that had 30-odd recommendations. This government has not responded to a single one of them.




Senator Dastyari:
  Forty-four recommendations.




Senator CAMERON:
  There were 44 recommendations. There has not been one response from this government.


I want to go to the second issue that is a big problem, and that is this code. Imagine giving the worst public servant in the country the decision as to whether unions are bargaining effectively with employers. Mr Nigel Hadgkiss—a guy who is arrogant, out of touch and simply doing the bidding of the government—has now got the right to determine whether a company is bargaining with its employees. It is not the Fair Work Commission or the old industrial commission anymore. Part of the problem is not just the issues in the bill as they stand but also the code and the implications of the code. The code prohibits a number of clauses in these agreements. Remember, Mr Hadgkiss is the guy who is going to determine these issues. Under the code that is developed by this government, you cannot negotiate to have apprentices employed under your agreement. 


I was a union official for 27 years. I negotiated agreement after agreement after agreement that said that a company would employ apprentices, not only for the benefit of the company but for the benefit of young workers trying to get an apprenticeship. Under the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013, if the CFMEU or any union seeks to have a clause in the agreement for the employment of apprentices, of young kids—no, that is illegal. How stupid can this government be to do that? What is the point of trying to deny young workers access to a job when it is the union movement that has been out there pursuing apprenticeships for as long as I have been in this country? It is the union movement that has championed apprenticeships—not this mob over here, who simply complain about them costing too much and who, through Senator Birmingham, gives $2 million to a former senator who sent his own building company broke. They were going to give $2 million to his pet project. This is the sort of behaviour of this government—you cannot negotiate to employ an apprentice; you cannot put local workers ahead of temporary foreign workers.


I thought One Nation were out there being the champion of Australian workers, yet they are going to sign off on this so that foreign workers will get in before an Australian worker. There will be no checks and balances coming from One Nation. All the rhetoric is out there from One Nation about the need to give Australians jobs, but they now have a chance—there is a test for Senator Hanson and her mob now. We will be moving an amendment to give priority to Australian workers. Let us see how big they are then. Let us see how good they are then. All the rhetoric you get from them—we will see whether there is any substance to that. Today is the chance that they have. 


What happens if you encourage the employment of a mature age worker? You might have a rigger or a carpenter or a builder's labourer who has worked in the industry for 30 or 40 years, and then the young buck comes in—the 21-year-old labourer—and, because he is bigger and stronger and faster, he gets the job, and 40 years of hard work in the industry stands for nothing. Well, the CFMEU stands up for their members. The CFMEU stands up for mature age workers and wants to give mature age workers a fair go. Even if the boss agrees to do that, this bill outlaws that in the code—absolute nonsense. 


What about encouraging site employment levels that maintain safe staffing—safety? Senator Rhiannon outlined some of the issues. Two Irish backpackers—backpackers, inexperienced people—were killed under a massive slab of concrete in Perth. A young female German backpacker fell many metres to her death on a construction site in Perth. Do you hear anything said by this lot over here about that? Absolutely nothing. All they want to do is stop the unions being able to negotiate safe working conditions and safe numbers on the job. 


Here is another one for One Nation. This bill makes it illegal to negotiate with a company to use locally manufactured products and building materials on the job. So we will just bring it all in from China, from Korea, from Thailand. Do not give anybody a fair go in Australia. That is what this bill does—stops a fair go for Australian industry. One Nation have already said they are going to sign off on it. So much for the great protectors of workers in this country—One Nation—when you just cave in on these significant issues.


The employment of safety officers on the job is not allowed. How ridiculous is that? And, if you want to discourage casual employment so that a worker gets a decent number of hours on the job, the code makes that illegal. Casualise the workforce, internationalise the workforce, exploit the workforce—that is this mob over there. Even if a property owner wants to invite a union official onto the site of their own property, they have to go through Nigel Hadgkiss, the worst public servant ever to put a foot in this place. No wonder the advisor in the box is smiling—you have seen him in operation. I certainly know that the public servants have been raising big eyebrows about the operation of this guy. Even if you agree that a union official can come onto your property, this bill outlaws that. 


This bill outlaws consultation about the use of subcontractors. This lot want to get the worst subcontractors in the country with the worst wages, the worst conditions, the worst employment ever, to come onto the job and undermine decent wages and decent conditions fought for by the CFMEU and the other unions. That is what this lot are about. They are absolutely hopeless. If the union negotiate with the employer that there will be no cashing out of entitlements, that entitlements will be maintained, that the workers will take their entitlements from one job to another, that is illegal. For Nigel Hadgkiss to be taking over the role of the Fair Work Commission to police this is an absolute outrage. 


There is plenty there for One Nation, plenty there for Senator Xenophon, plenty there for Senator Hinch—and Senator Leyonhjelm: well, who knows? We will see where you stand on these issues today. We will see whether you actually stand for Australian workers. We will see whether you actually stand for safety on the job. We will see whether you actually stand for older workers. We will see whether you actually stand for young workers getting an apprenticeship. We will be watching how you vote on every one of those issues. This code is a disgrace. Minister, do you intend to proceed with the code? (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-29,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:29):  I will of course be joining with my colleagues in the Australian Greens to oppose this terrible, draconian, antiworker and antiunion legislation. But I have been listening, like Senator Macdonald, very carefully to this debate and I have been reflecting on the contribution that Senator Macdonald just made—though I guess it was more of an unstructured rant than a contribution. I have been wondering why Senator Macdonald and his colleagues in the Liberal Party are in fact so supportive of this terrible, draconian legislation. I know Senator Macdonald's history. I know he has been a member of the Liberal Party for a long period of time, and that is fine; it is a free country. But, as I was wondering why they are so supportive of this terrible legislation, it came to me in a blinding flash: political donations from the property development industry, because over the last five years the Liberal and National parties combined have received, at the very least, $10.3 million in direct donations from the property industry. And who stands to gain most from this legislation? It is the property industry.


Minister, the question for you is identical in spirit to the one you responded to Senator Macdonald on when he asked you about donations the Greens had received. I ask you: can you place on the record, Minister, how many millions of dollars the Liberal Party has received in donations from the property development sector in this country over the past five years? If you cannot place that on the record today, could you please come back into the chamber and provide us with that advice in the future, as I believe you committed to doing for Senator Macdonald.


I am not going to stand here and listen to the rubbish and the drivel coming out of Senator Macdonald's mouth without pointing out the rampant hypocrisy behind his words. He might want to get up and cast aspersions at my colleague and friend Senator Rhiannon in this place, and he is entitled to do that, but he is going to cop it back every time. We are going to expose his hypocrisy. We are going to expose the links between political donations to the Liberal Party and the National Party from the property development sector, who stand to profit massively from these pieces of legislation.


Do not even get me started on the donations that the Liberal and National parties receive from the fossil fuel industry in this country. In order to receive those donations, they of course deliver massive public policy outcomes for the fossil fuel sector in this country, including about $24 billion—that is billion with a 'b'—of direct taxpayer subsidies to the fossil fuel sector in Australia in every budget. While on the one hand this week they are trying to claw back some money from backpackers who contribute to the agricultural sector in this country, on the other hand they funnel out the door these massive donations, many billions of dollars a year, to the fossil fuel sector in return for the significant donations they receive from the fossil fuel sector. Of course, it is the same with property developers. Those opposite claw in money in political donations—$10.3 million to the Liberal and National parties combined over the past five years—and they deliver outcomes. Make no mistake; that is what Senator Cash is sitting in here doing today, flanked by Senator Cormann and Senator Fifield, with Senator Paterson up in the back row. They are delivering for their major donors and their mates in the property development sector.


I will say to Senator Macdonald—even though he is not in the chamber at the moment he can always read the Hansard—that if he is going to get up and have unstructured rants at the Greens then he can expect to be called out for being a hypocrite. He can expect to have his party's very close links with the property development industry, including the millions of dollars in donations it receives every year, called out and exposed.


Minister, the question to you is: exactly how many millions of dollars has the Liberal Party received from property developers? Could you take that back through five years and provide a breakdown on an annual basis please.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2016-11-29,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (13:35):  I stand as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia. These bills are about unravelling building industry cartels, and their union cronies are caught in the crossfire. The bills are about protecting and restoring this industry from the grip of the cartels. Above all, these bills support freedom—freedom of choice for union workers, whether or not they want to be in a union; freedom of choice for subbies; freedom of choice for small business; freedom of choice for taxpayers, so that we do not have to keep paying exorbitant rates for buildings that are controlled by a building industry cartel that includes the CFMEU. These bills support small business. These bills support taxpayers. These bills protect honest union members from their union bosses. These bills support the building industry.


I have had the pleasure of talking with Ken Phillips, who has explained to me how small businesses have been crippled by big businesses that want to suppress small business competition. They are pushing the risk down to the small businesses and they are doing the union's bidding. Unpaid bills certainly are rife in the industry—we know about that—and that is due largely to the power and control of a few large companies.


When I listen, in Queensland, to big, burly, well-muscled men running their businesses and they are in tears because of fear for their families and their employees then I know we have got a problem. Yet what did we hear from the Greens and the Labor Party last night? We heard about Fidel Castro, who destroyed his nation. We heard endlessly about Work Choices, ice dealers, diaries, fatalities. Fatalities are sad, but the fact is that safety improved under the previous ABCC provisions.


We heard all about the Chicken Littles—bwok bwok bekerk!—all the scratching and running around in this house last night, all the pecking, pecking, pecking, the Chicken Littles. I do not know which bill Senator Cameron was reading, but I—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Roberts, resume your seat. Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Yes, the point of order is that the Senate is a workplace for a number of people, such as people in Hansard, who listen very carefully to the contributions. I think that deliberately tapping the microphone should be ruled out of order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Thank you, Senator McKim, you have made your point. Please resume your seat.




Senator ROBERTS:
  I have read the ABCC bill from cover to cover, including the building code, and it does nothing that Senator Cameron alleges. The CFMEU is supposedly bargaining for its members, yet it funded GetUp! to the tune of $1.2 million in 2010. And what I am going to discuss next is a very sad thing, and that is black lung. Black lung is a crippling disease in the coal industry, and we thought it was ended thanks to legislation, thanks to modern equipment and thanks to modern high-velocity ventilation. But in Queensland recently we have seen black lung recur. The CFMEU controls four of the levels of responsibility for preventing black lung, including two levels that are paid for by the industry and for which the CFMEU are responsible. That is an indictment of the CFMEU's attitude towards safety.


We see the CFMEU allied with activists and with GetUp!—who are also connected with American billionaires—funding the destruction, and they admit this, of this country's coal industry. And they are closely allied with President Obama and senior people from Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is indeed payback, as Senator Cameron said, for the people in Australia, for the honest union members, against the large building companies and the CFMEU cronies.


Senator Cameron, in my view, is of the old days, when might was right, when safety was seen as a cost. And then it was a constant battle, because the old view was that safety cost money, and that is no longer appropriate. Senator Cameron still sees safety as an alternative to productivity. It is not, and I will get on to the solution in a minute. In the old days, quality was seen as cost. It is not a cost, but that is what it was seen as. So, companies, managers, people throughout the country and people throughout the world thought that higher quality meant higher cost. That has also been tipped away. The environment was seen as a cost, and the Greens still see it as a cost—to the detriment of our civilisation. But times have changed. Safety now is seen to improve productivity. That is why safety makes commercial sense. When people focus properly on safety they improve the work processes, the work environment, and that leads to fewer injuries, fewer near misses and less waste of materials. Safety improves productivity.


This bill is about putting responsibility back on the employers in this industry, and that will improve safety, as it did under the old ABCC. Quality improves productivity. Maybe people in this chamber are not aware of what the Japanese did. The Japanese focused on quality and dramatically improved productivity, and that has given us the modern miracle of modern manufacturing, which reduces costs. The same miracle will start to apply much more rapidly in the construction sector once management is allowed to behave properly and once the senior management of major companies are required to manage properly. We now see that the environment improves productivity, because the environment is despoiled by pollutants. Pollutants are waste, and when we reduce waste we improve the environment, we improve costs. The Greens, though, seem to think that civilisation and the environment are mutually exclusive, whereas they are mutually beneficial.


I have been made aware of some hours of work—or maybe they are hours of recreation—on the Karara worksite under a greenfields agreement. A typical day during a negotiation—which the taxpayers are paying for—is a 6.30 start; from 6.30 to seven o'clock, workers arrive and attend prework meetings with the relevant foremen. Sounds good. From 7.30 to 9.30 there is a union communication meeting. But wait for it: that is the first communication meeting that they are entitled to. From 9.30 to 10.00 is a scheduled smoko break. It must have been a pretty hectic meeting! And then from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock there is 'limited work'. From 11 o'clock to one o'clock is—wait for it—the second union communication meeting. The union is not very good at communication, I guess! From one o'clock to 1.30—of course, after a tiring morning—it is necessary for a lunch break, and then from 1.30 to 2.30 there is another hour of 'limited work', and then from 2.30 to three o'clock, knock-off, with a staggered finishing time between 2.30 and 3 pm. So, two hours of work—sorry: two hours of 'limited work'—in an eight-hour day; amazing.


Who is paying for this? We are—the taxpayers. The taxpayers are paying for this. Senator Cameron does not seem to understand economics. He feigned ignorance that the building construction industry does not affect house prices. When the price of apartments rises, the price of houses rises. It is that simple: supply and demand. Everyone knows that—well, I would have thought everyone knows that. Some building workers, contrary to what Senator Cameron said, actually go out to work every day, but they cannot get work. They cannot get work because they are black banned, and sometimes they are threatened and are under intimidation. And it is not only them but also their families and their work mates. Dyson Heydon and many judges have confirmed that. Around 100 CFMEU officials are before the courts—and Senator Cameron raises accountability. That is the core of this bill. But how can we have accountability when workers, when foremen, when shareholders, when owners of buildings have to go through the court system to get it? It is not right. This bill and the building code in particular pushes accountability back to where it belongs—to the head of the senior companies. This bill is about freedom, accountability, safety and workers' rights, and improving every one of them.


Senator Rhiannon talks about protecting the CFMEU. Why? It is because it is a major source of Greens' funds. Another point I want to address is the use of labels by members of the ALP and members of the Greens in this Senate. When I hear someone being labelled as arrogant, as a liar et cetera then, to me, it means that the person using the label does not have the evidence. That, again, is an old, outdated tactic and displays behaviours that are no longer productive. In fact, the old unions, which Senator Cameron seems to exemplify, stifled workers, disconnected workers and stifled apprentices. When people are not free to use their talents through demarcation, it has a very crippling effect on work pride and work satisfaction. 


I am of the understanding that when Bill Shorten was minister for employment the number of 457 visas increased dramatically. I am also of the understanding that the board members of GetUp! included Bill Shorten, an ally of the CFMEU. I am also of the understanding that under the previous Labor government Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's used 457 visas. I may be wrong about that, but that is what I have heard.




Senator Cormann:
  Would you like lies with that?




Senator ROBERTS:
  Sorry?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Direct your comments through the chair, thank you, Senator Roberts.




Senator ROBERTS:
  Restricting subbies to a CFMEU panel and not being allowed to employ anyone else, apart from those in the CFMEU panel, discriminates heavily against the worker.


I was in a discussion with Senator Pauline Hanson and one of our office staff some months ago and I had the privilege of being with senior members of the ACTU and the CFMEU and I asked them for their opinions on what the big issues are that are facing this country. One of them said, 'The need to increase wages.' None of them said tax. Tax is crippling our industry in this country and crippling payrolls because we are taxing payrolls and we are taxing gross incomes. That means a decent increase to a person's gross income is prohibitive when it comes to employment in many industries. We are taxing people out of work because the tax system is antiquated and designed for another era.


The ACTU does not raise tax. The opposition leader in the lower house does not raise tax. He said he would not raise tax. The Prime Minister has said that the government will not raise tax. And, yet, jobs are supposed to be a big issue. We must address tax so the cost-of-living pressures are removed from everyday builders and their employees. It seems to me that everyday people are cannon fodder for the ALP unions cartel—the machine that tries to control, in cahoots with big builders, this building industry and is holding our country back. We need to protect small businesses and subbies. We need to protect honest workers, and we need to protect the taxpayers from union cartels in collusion with big business.


Then I come to the Greens—again, the Greens. Only the Greens could tell us that depreciation is a subsidy on hydrocarbon fuels. Only the Greens could lack understanding of accounting so that they could classify depreciation as a subsidy and talk about it in isolation as if only the hydrocarbon industry is getting it. I am tired of the rants, I am tired of the labels and I am tired of the old-world tactics. I need to help this country get on with coming back into the 21st century and improving the efficiency, safety and security of this industry. I am very much in favour of this bill.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (13:51):  Minister, that is disappointing. There were 44 recommendations made. It was quite a bipartisan inquiry. I want to give credit to Senator Cameron, who I think initiated the inquiry. Frankly, while I had the role of chairing the committee, it was Senator Cameron and Senator Cameron's office that did the bulk of the work and then I think Senator Ketter finally presented it. The report itself had 44 recommendations that went to the heart of the issues affecting the building industry. They were largely around the issues of phoenixing—how companies are phoenixing and what the impact of phoenixing has been. Minister, how does this bill, as it currently stands unamended, address the issue of phoenixing in the industry?

As you correctly pointed out, this Economics References Committee report was tabled in December 2015. You would be aware that the legislation was drafted, I believe, over three years ago now. Obviously, the legislation is in the same form as it was when introduced, given that it was a double dissolution trigger.


In relation to the question that you asked: my understanding is that there will be amendments moved by some of the crossbenchers which will address in further detail the concerns which you raised.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (13:52):  Minister, the report itself came through with 44 different recommendations. Again, not having seen the amendments that you are foreshadowing I may speak a little broadly to the issues that were raised regarding phoenixing and, I hope, to those who are in the process of looking at this issue.


This has been a very politically-charged debate over the past few years. This report was not a politically-charged one; some of the reports that we deal with in this place are and some are not. This really highlighted this incredible issue of phoenixing. Again, it was Senator Cameron who bought it to my attention. It is the situation whereby people within the industry will set themselves up to fail: they will subcontract work, will not pay those workers, will feign insolvency or become technically insolvent and then recreate a similar company with a similar name and with a similar board of directors—or second cousins, or friends, or next-door neighbours or faux, sham boards—to recreate themselves.


The evidence found in the inquiry was that some of the horrendous, terrible and deplorable behaviour that has gone on in this industry has occurred as the result of people desperately trying to make sure they get paid. People have hired some horrible people. Let me be clear: that is the wrong thing to do. Nobody should condone that and nobody supports that. What I think is unfortunate is the legislative environment that allows phoenixing to happen to the extent to which it is happening. It creates an environment where desperate people have done desperate things. It is horrible behaviour and it should not be supported. But at the same time, we should look at how we frame an environment where it is not necessary—where that type of behaviour is not needed.


With some of these subcontractors, the fact is that they have to price into their own business models the notion that from time to time they are simply not going to get paid—that people are going to come and shut down their businesses. There is frustration in many of these circumstances. To see someone who owes you money for work you have conducted properly reappear a week later with a different company but with a slightly amended company name is actually a huge problem that is affecting so many lives. There were 44 recommendations by the Senate inquiry, largely around bringing the Corporations Act into line with the insolvency act and also about the powers and focus that ASIC is going to have. I think that is a step in the right direction, in so far as we are having a genuine discussion about how we improve the construction industry. The priority should be phoenixing and how some of these companies have behaved.


Minister, again, I think it is disappointing that it is correct when you say that this piece of legislation was produced three years ago. I feel that this is something which could have been incorporated—or should have been incorporated—into any discussion that we were having around this industry. What the Senate economics committee found was that there was no bigger issue than phoenixing. At a practical level it is affecting those who are trying to make a living or to run a business from day to day.


But here we are again, debating this bill one more time. I hope that after we defeat this bill certainly then the government will move on and shift its focus elsewhere. But in the last week of the parliament, six months after an election, here we are debating this bill one more time. Frankly, look at the priorities we should be dealing with—




Senator Williams:
  This is what the election was about!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Well, you say that this is what the election was about. During the election campaign you guys were not talking about it! They were not talking about this! During the election campaign they could not run further away from this issue. What they are doing now in the last week is trying to stitch up as many deals as they can! Dirty deals being done dirt cheap in this place!



Honourable senators interjecting—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Order!




Senator McGrath:
  You were on a bus in Chinatown!




Senator DASTYARI:
  And you are trying to pull together whatever you can! I am not going to be lectured by Milo man over there! And I am not going to be stirred by your sticky fingers!




Senator Williams:
  Why are you using chopsticks?



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Dastyari—your comments through the chair, please. And the speaker will be heard in silence




Senator DASTYARI:
  Through you, Chair, I am not sure if that is an interjection I should be taking or leaving. Against my better judgement, I think I will let that interjection stand.


This is a bad piece of legislation. This is a piece of legislation that has been defeated time and time again because it does not achieve what it sets out to achieve. This is a bill which is nothing more than a relentless attack on the Australian trade union movement by an ideologically-driven government that is out of ideas, that is out of direction and that is only unified by hate. And when they are not hating each other, when they are not splitting amongst each other, they turn around and start attacking others. And I note that the soon-to-be former Leader of the Government in the Senate has walked in to start question time.


I will say this: this is a bad bill. This is not a bill that should be supported. This is not a bill that should be passed by this Senate, and I await the Senate defeating this bill one more time.

 (Victoria) (13:59):  I have a question for the minister, but before I ask my question of the minister, and in the spirit of goodwill, I want to offer some thanks to other senators. Let me thank Senator Dastyari for very kindly pointing out that it is not a good idea to hire standover men to collect debts from people. That is a great concession on your part, Senator Dastyari, thank you for that. I hope you sent that memo to the CFMEU, because they have not been following your advice on this. That is perhaps why this legislation is necessary.


I would also like to thank Senator McKim for proving that unconstructed sprays are not the preserve of just government or opposition senators, but of the crossbench as well.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:40):  I stand to oppose this bill on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. Working people have got a lot to fear from this bill and a lot to fear from this coalition government. We have a government with a weak Prime Minister. It is a government which is controlled by the extremists in the coalition. We have a Prime Minister with no values and absolutely no principles. He will do whatever he needs to do, whatever he has to do, to placate the worst elements in the coalition, and this bill epitomises some of the worst elements of the coalition in its antiworker approach to Australian workers around this country. This is a Prime Minister who has no coherent economic plan—no plan on how to take this economy forward. So what do you do? You simply attack the trade union movement and give in to the worst elements in your party. 


We had this GST plan from the Prime Minister. A GST was going to be put in place. When that fell apart—it did not last very long—the plan was that the states could tax themselves. That did not last very long either. And then we got down to the nitty-gritty of the coalition: their economic plan to attack the trade union movement and provide a $50 billion tax cut to some of the biggest corporations, some of the multinational corporations, in this country, which give money to the coalition to allow them to run their election campaigns. So the money would go back again through the public purse in a $50 billion tax cut to the big end of town. In addition to that, the government want to give the big end of town even more rights over working people. They want to take their rights away in order to limit bargaining in this country like no other country in the world. No other advanced country in the world has laws like those being proposed by this government right now. 


We certainly know why the government are running this agenda. This is a former Prime Minister Tony Abbott special: attack the union movement. When you are in trouble, break glass, attack the trade union movement—and this government is in trouble. They are an absolute rabble. They are fighting with each other. They have no agenda for this place other than to attack workers rights. This is a government that has not got a lot of legs; it has certainly got no backbone in terms of looking after ordinary working people. It will give in to former Prime Minister Abbott, because former Prime Minister Abbott is gunning for the current Prime Minister. We know that there is chaos and division within this government. We saw it the other day when Mr Abbott was publicly telling Mr Turnbull that we should revisit the 2014 budget. Remember that budget? It was the budget that was going to cut pensions; the budget that was going to take rights away from some of the poorest and weakest welfare recipients in the country. People who cannot look after themselves were going to be thrown to the wolves. Young Australians who may live in an area where there are no jobs, where too many people are looking to get into too few jobs, would have to live on fresh air for six months. This is the type of government that it is. And we see the pressure to revisit that—cutting pensions and coming after the poorest and weakest in our society.


And part of this is their industrial relations agenda—because the one thing that stands between unscrupulous employers and bad governments like this government is the trade union movement of Australia, which has won every significant right for workers in this country. This is not a government that has ever stood up and supported increases for workers in the old Fair Work Commission. They have never done that. They have never stood up for workers. In fact, their DNA is laid out for all to see. You do not need a microscope to see their DNA because it is written all over them—and it is Work Choices. It is about forcing workers to negotiate individually with their employer. It is about subjugating workers to the will of the employer. It is about complete managerial prerogative for the company and the boss over individual workers.


If that had been the state of industrial relations in this country over the last so many years, what would the living standards of workers be now? Those living standards would be down the tube. Those living standards would be decimated. If workers think it is hard enough to make ends meet under this government, it would have been impossible to make ends meet if there had not been strong trade unions out there bargaining for the trade union movement and then those increases flowing through to the rest of the non-unionised economy. These are the issues that underpin this bill. It is about giving more power and more rights to the people who sit in the back of their Bentleys handing out brown paper bags with $10,000 in them to Liberal candidates in Newcastle—the property developers who want to build their properties cheaper and cheaper and do not want to pay a construction worker a decent rate of pay but are prepared to send a brown paper bag with 10 grand in it over to a Liberal politician, in breach of the law.


We hear much from this mob about the rule of law. But look at the Liberal Party in New South Wales. When they are faced with 10 Liberal Party politicians having to resign or get kicked out because of breaches of the law, what do they do? They sack the ICAC commissioner and they get rid of ICAC's teeth. That is what they do—because they do not want to be embarrassed with their faulty memories in front of ICAC. They do not want to have to front up to show where the money is coming from to fund their election campaigns. We know where it is from. It is from the property developers. It is from the big tier 1 companies that are going to benefit from this bill. This is all about payback to the big companies in return for diminishing workers' rights.


If this bill goes ahead, we have heard arguments that it will reduce costs in the building industry by 30 per cent. I have not seen any economic modelling or arguments to say that that is the case and would then lead to improved productivity because you reduce costs. Those two things actually do not go together. But let us think that that is right. If there is going to be a reduction in costs of 30 per cent, who do you think will be shouldering that reduction in costs? It will not be the executives on multimillion-dollar salaries. It will not be the human resources officers earning half a million dollars a year. It will not be the management group. It will be the carpenters, the riggers, the boilermakers, the fitters and the tilers who go out there every day and give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. They are the ones who will lose from this bill. They are the ones who are being attacked. You will get all this argument about 'this unlawful industry'. Well, I put it to you that building workers go out there every day in this industry and they never experience anything like what we hear from those opposite. They do not experience it. They have a decent enterprise agreement through their unions—mainly the CFMEU in the building industry, a union that is out there looking after working people. But what do this mob do? They pick the worst elements. And there are bad elements in every area. You only have to look at the banking industry. They will not have a royal commission into the banking industry, will they? No—because the banking industry is the big end of town. It is too powerful and there is too much money going into their coffers for them to actually take the banking industry on.


But they will take on the union movement because the union movement is what actually keeps wages and conditions up in this country. As we see wages stagnating in this country, never has there been a greater need for strong trade unions in this country, not weakened trade unions. And if there are people misbehaving, if there are people breaking the law, they should be dealt with under the law. There are more than enough laws without bringing in a bill like this, which provides power to probably the worst statutory office holder in the country, Nigel Hadgkiss. Mr Hadgkiss, who will head up this body, has an absolute contempt for accountability. He has a contempt for the Senate. He has a contempt for the estimates process, which is about public officers coming here and being open with the parliament about what they are spending money on and what they are doing. He has an absolute contempt for that. He has a contempt for senators in this place. In fact, this is a statutory office holder who has lied to my face on at least three occasions. I have asked for him to provide his diary—as many, many public servants and statutory officers have to do—for accountability issues. And this statutory office holder, Nigel Hadgkiss, says: 'I don't have a diary. I don't keep a diary.' Can you imagine any senior public servant, any statutory office holder, who does not have a diary? We said, 'There must be some way that people keep tabs on what you're doing.' When I asked the chief financial officer of the Fair Work Building Commission why Mr Hadgkiss did not keep a diary and did they keep a diary and did they know what he was doing, they said no.


So we have a public officer who wants to operate in complete secrecy. What we have found out is that he does have a diary, because under a freedom of information request we got a copy of one part of his diary. So this person lies to the Senate. This person is a bully, this person is unaccountable, this person is into cronyism and gets rid of whoever he does not like within that organisation and puts his own cronies in. He is surrounded by cronies. He is vindictive against anyone who would stand up to him. He is absolutely secretive and, as I have indicated, he has lied to the Senate. This is the man who is in charge of the Fair Work Building Commission now and who they obviously want to put in charge of the ABCC, if ever it comes in.


There are a number of amendments before the Senate today. Senator Xenophon has put up a range of amendments. I must say, I have not had a chance to see the detail of those amendments, and here we are because the government wants a victory. In my view, this is going to be a Pyrrhic victory if it goes through. I need time and the Labor Party needs time to sit down with Senator Xenophon to ask some questions about the implications and the intent of some of the amendments that will be coming through. There is a need to do that. This is a bill that is complex. This bill, in terms of its impact on ordinary Australians, is absolutely terrible. This is a government which, as I said, have Work Choices in their DNA. They will attack the trade union movement. If there are people doing the wrong thing they should be dealt with under the laws as they exist. We have a regulator—a very strong and powerful regulator in the Fair Work Building Commission—but what this does is impinge even more on workers' rights to collective bargaining. So we will have a number of issues that we want to raise. In closing, Senator Cash, do you intend to appoint Mr Hadgkiss as head of ABCC? If so, why— (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-11-29,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:55):  The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 is ruthless, not just to building workers but to all working people in Australia and all Australians. While in the first instance it is directed at building workers, the intent is to weaken industrial relations across the board, and if that occurs the flow-on impact for all Australians is huge. Organised working people established so many of the conditions that we all enjoy in this country, not just conditions of work but so much to do with our health conditions and our education conditions. Right now we have to deal with the ABCC legislation. We are in committee and we are about to get our teeth into the amendments. But we also need to acknowledge the context. There is now a real desperation around the Turnbull government. The clock is ticking down on the last few days of parliament. They have left it to the last hour and this legislation has to be passed. It is not legislation that will bring benefits to the country but legislation that delivers for the constituency of the Turnbull government.


The Turnbull government have some big friends in corporate Australia. They donate millions of dollars to the government and they expect something in return. While they are friends, the Turnbull government are probably looking forward to a few Christmas parties and sharing a few cocktails and a few drinks with their corporate colleagues, their corporate mates, who have helped deliver them into power. But they would know that those apparent corporate friends can turn on them if they do not deliver, and right now at the top of the agenda they have to deliver. The registered organisations bill went through, but the ABCC legislation is what they want in their pocket and they want it before Christmas. Corporate Australia is sweating on it and, as I said, they can change overnight for the Turnbull government.


This is shocking legislation because what it would do to a section of the workforce is treat them as second-class citizens. They would have reduced legal rights and reduced rights at work—something that we have not seen in Australia for a while. You would probably have to go back to how we treated Indigenous people before the 1960s, before the 1967 amendment, when you had second-class laws for a group of people who were working for greater productivity in Australia and working to assist all of us with the benefits that come when you have new hospitals, new schools and homes are built—all those sorts of things.


It is important, as we go into the committee stage and start considering the amendments, to remember why the government is doing this. This is where the big lie comes in. It is very relevant to our debate now. The government has a constituency, corporate Australia, that wants the industrial relations laws of this country weakened. That is in fact what all conservative governments have done. You can go back to the Menzies government. Penal powers were part of the arbitration act then. Ordinary Australians opposed that very strongly. Going through the Fraser government and the Howard government, they have all had their signature legislation to do something similar, but you would probably have to come to this legislation to see something as atrocious as what the Turnbull and Abbott governments have come up with.


Why do they want it? Why do they want the industrial relations laws that affect working conditions and affect how union officials operate in the workplace? Why is this legislation being brought forward? If you weaken working conditions, if you weaken how unions can operate and if you weaken how working people can come together and collectively organise, you are actually assisting the corporations to increase their profits, because the fewer conditions and the fewer regulations they have to cope with the more they can get away with doing a whole lot of things. That is why you have heard so many of the speakers in the second reading debate detail the tragic deaths that are occurring on our building sites. That is a result of poor occupational health and safety standards, and we will see that occur more.


But also, if unions are weakened, working people cannot come together so readily and collectively organise, and it is harder to get pay rises. This is the reason the government is doing it: corporate Australia wants it. Corporate Australia is on the earth—its job, its legal requirement, is—to do the best for its shareholders. What do its shareholders want? Its shareholders want more profits. They want more money in their pockets. That is its job.


And that is where the job of governments should be to get that balance right, to ensure that we have fair industrial relations so unions can organise and workers can come together collectively and so the young apprentice who turns up on the job, has only been there for a few days, is ordered to go on to the roof and do some repairs and ends up falling off might have a bit of back-up to say: 'Hey, don't do that, mate. That's actually unsafe. We need to ensure that you've got a harness on.' They are the sorts of practical things that we are dealing with here.


We know the speeches from the government benches were really disgraceful. You really would not have thought people mattered from the way they delivered their speeches. That is why the coalition are desperate to get this legislation through. They want to be able to go to their Christmas parties and enjoy it there with the developers, with the property investors, who are hanging out and who have been lobbying hard for these changes.


The other part of this story is that the government, Senator Cash as the responsible minister and Prime Minister Turnbull, the leader of the government, cannot go out and say: 'We really have to get this legislation through. Our corporate backers, who give us all these donations, really want us to do it.' They cannot say that. Obviously, that is not going to wash with the public. It would really give you an insight into how government works. So they come up with their reasons, and the reasons they have come out with are quite unbelievable. I will just give you a couple of them.


Prime Minister Turnbull linked the whole issue of union activity with the housing crisis. I suppose he, or maybe somebody's office, thought: 'Let's solve two problems in one. We'll blame the housing crisis not on the way we run government, with our negative gearing and our capital gains tax discounts; we'll blame it on the unions.' This is from the Prime Minister. He expressed sympathy for 'young Australian couples that can't afford to buy a house because their costs are being pushed up by union thuggery'. According to the government, that is one of the reasons why we need these rules.


I have to say that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, really took the cake when he came up with his excuses. This is a quote from Peter Dutton:


When young Australians go to an open house this weekend, to a unit that they may not be able to afford or that they have been saving up for, they know that that unit is more expensive because they have seen building costs increase as a result of the involvement of the unions and bikies.


Now they have even pulled the bikies into it as causing the housing crisis.


There they are blaming the unions for the housing crisis. That one blows up in their face, because, if you look at all the causes of the housing crisis, there is no link here. It is worth going through this, because these are the lies the government has been relying on to try and justify the legislation that we now have before us. We are now about to start debating the amendments, so it is very relevant when senators come to consider the amendments.


These arguments from the likes of Prime Minister Turnbull and Minister Dutton rely on various hypotheses. I will just go through them. They include that union activity has expanded in construction, that construction wages and labour costs have accelerated as a result, that total construction costs have also accelerated correspondingly and that housing prices rise in tandem with escalating construction costs.


Let us look at the reality here. This falls over monumentally. How Prime Minister Turnbull allowed himself to go out with that one, I do not know. Maybe he did not have enough sleep that night. At any rate, I will just go through how they all fall over. Average earnings in the construction industry have grown more slowly than the Australian average over the last five years. Real wage increases in construction have been slower than real productivity growth, with the effect that real unit labour costs in construction have declined.


Then we have construction labour. Construction labour accounts for only 17 to 22 per cent of the total costs of new building. Construction costs in turn account for less than half the market value of residential property. And then there is the main issue—if you want to go back to where they probably started their thesis—that in the housing industry there is very low union activity. Not many construction workers in the housing industry are members of a union.


I thank the Centre for Future Work and the Australia Institute for that analysis, because it is very useful. Here we have a Prime Minister trying to justify why we need to rein in unions, rein in those bad construction workers and bring in the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He says it is because we have a housing crisis and young people particularly cannot afford to buy a house. They heap it all onto the union movement. It all falls over entirely. If we had some honesty from the government, they are the sorts of things that they would bring into this debate that we are considering right now.


The Greens have voted against the legislation in the second reading. We will vote against it in the third reading. But we will move amendments, because at times it is necessary to do that. With appalling legislation that looks as though it could be about to become law, we will do what we can to improve it. Still, our clear position is that it should not pass.


Some of our amendments will be around the issue of procurement. Surely, when we come to talking about the building industry—particularly when you are hearing from the people on the government benches about how we are going to bring in the ABCC and productivity will increase, the economy will bloom and all the rest of the Christmas fairytales that they come out with—if you are sincere about that, what you should be committed to is a building code that includes a requirement for procuring local materials. The steel industry should figure strongly in that, and it would bring such benefit to the country, as the steel industry in this country is on the edge of collapse. Again, it is extraordinary that the government is not giving this more attention. How can you have a country the size of Australia without a steel industry? We have an opportunity to address that in this legislation.


Then there is the issue of local jobs. The Greens will move amendments to require that, where the code applies, jobs have to be advertised locally and the employer must demonstrate there is no suitable local applicant before guest workers can be used. There are a number of people on the cross-bench who regularly talk about the need for local jobs. Here is their opportunity to stand up for local jobs, which are very relevant to this legislation. There are many unemployed construction workers in this country, who often become fly-in fly-out workers, which really disrupts communities. Why is that? It is because they cannot find local work. All senators have an opportunity here to support some very responsible amendments that would help boost productivity in this country and ensure there is jobs growth, particularly in regional areas and in states where there is growing unemployment.


Those are some of the issues that we are looking forward to getting our teeth into, because right now the question is: Minister, can you explain how the housing crisis is in any way associated with the so-called union thuggery that you have been talking about for so long, considering that there is minimal union activity in the housing industry. I ran through the various parameters. None of them stack up to show that there is any link between increased union activity and the housing crisis. I do think that would be a wise starting point for you, to inject some honesty into this debate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:09):  I actually have a question for the minister, which is what the committee stage is about. The committee stage is not about making 15-minute speeches after you have had your chance for 20 minutes in the second reading debate.


I have been listening to this debate quite intently. I have been trying to understand just what it is that the Greens are opposed to in this bill. I am sure Senator Rhiannon does not support the sort of thuggery that we have heard of from union officials or the sort of thuggery, against women in particular, that we have heard of in the royal commission and in various court proceedings around the country. I am sure Senator Rhiannon would not be involved in that. I know Senator Rhiannon was quite openly a member of the Communist Party in days gone by. I sort of understand her political philosophies from that. That is fine. It is a free country. You can support communism if you like. That is one of the glories of being a free country such as this. I am trying to understand why the Greens are opposed. I have listened intently to everything Senator Rhiannon has just spoken about—I was listening on the TV monitor upstairs before I came down—and I cannot find any reason why the Greens would be so opposed to this.


It suddenly occurs to me that perhaps the Greens are getting some political donations, some cash donations, from the CFMEU and others.




Senator Cormann:
  Surely not!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I don't know, and that is why I am exercising my right in this committee stage to ask the minister. Minister, can you assist me. Do you have any information that might answer my query? Do the Greens get money donations from the CFMEU or any other trade union? That can be the only reason why the Greens are so opposed to this.


I know why the Labor Party is opposed. I can understand that. They are all here because the unions put them here. They only stay here for as long as the unions give them the tick to stay here. Senator Cameron, who is in the chamber, will know this well. His good mate George Campbell fell out of favour with the unions, and as a result of that Senator Cameron was able to come in. It was nothing Senator Cameron did; it was the unions that did it. So I understand the Labor Party as clearly as a bell. I am not in any doubt as to what that is all about. But I cannot understand the Greens, unless there is an element of monetary donation to the Greens political party. I know the Greens got the biggest corporate donation in the history of Australian politics—$1.6 million from a single businessman. It was the biggest donation ever. I understand that. That is why there were certain funny arrangements made in Tasmania a few years ago, including an attempt to have tax free status for a certain newspaper that was associated with, perhaps, the donor. But that is all past history. I understand that, but I cannot understand why the Greens are so opposed to this particular bill, unless there is a simple explanation. That might be it; it might not be. I am just wondering whether the minister can help me on that.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:13):  I will turn to Senator Cameron's question first. Senator Cameron asked me about the appointment of the director of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. In response to that question I refer you to clause 4 of the transitional bill, which provides for the continuation of the appointment of the director.


In response to Senator Rhiannon's question in relation to the impact of costs in the housing market, when you have an increase in costs in the commercial construction sector there is an obvious flow on through the whole construction market. What this bill is designed to do is, obviously, increase productivity and decrease costs in the commercial construction sector, which would have obvious flow ons in relation to the housing market, as you so referred.


In relation to the question posed by Senator Macdonald, my understanding is, yes, the Australian Greens are or have been in receipt of moneys from the CFMEU. It might be that Senator Roberts, who articulated this in his very good speech to the Senate last night, is able to refer to it and provide more information to the Senate, unless of course the Australian Greens would like to.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:14):  Far be it from me to raise the issue that Senator Rhiannon has raised but, as I understand it, Senator Rhiannon was talking about not the commercial building industry but the residential building industry, because that is where the Prime Minister and you, Senator Cash, were saying it would cost more to build a house unless this bill goes through. That is an absolute nonsense. The residential building industry is very, very likely unionised, and it is certainly not unions that determine the rates of pay and conditions in the residential building industry.


I want to go to two other matters while I am on my feet. Given that Senator Macdonald has set the standard by speaking for 10 minutes before asking a question—especially when he said he was going to ask the question and not make a speech—I think the rules have now been set by the other side. There are two issues I want to raise. The first issue is: what is the driver of much of the problem in this industry? What is the impediment to productivity? What is the issue that individual contractors, small businesses and employees face? The issue is that they are not getting paid for work that they do. They are not getting paid. I was very pleased to seek the establishment of an inquiry into insolvency in the building and construction industry. There are lots of things that go to productivity that are much wider than whether there is some rough-haired, stupid union official going onto your site and getting into a brawl with a boss. Come on! That is not the issue. The issue is companies not paying their bills and phoenixing. They are coming back without paying their bills and establishing themselves again as a company.


I saw an analysis of this by a company called Sutton Douglass Lawyers. If you are talking about getting some reasonable industrial relations in the industry then you have to deal with the $3 billion of unpaid bills in the industry that see workers going without any money, companies going bust because they are not getting paid and families breaking up because the chief earner in the household has got no money coming in—and you know all the drama that that can cause in a household.


This firm, Sutton Douglass Lawyers, says that there are a range of issues that go to insolvency, that there are a number of issues that come through. One of those, basically, is that if you do not get paid when you are running a small company then workers are underpaid or paid irregularly. It is not the Labor Party and it is not the unions who are saying this; this is a big-end-of-town litigation company that deals with these issues. They say workers are underpaid or paid irregularly. They say suppliers are not paid. They say superannuation payments are not paid. We know this mob opposite do not care about superannuation. They have never supported a superannuation increase for workers ever since they have been in parliament—and ever since superannuation has been around. Sutton Douglass Lawyers also say workers have their employment status changed from permanent to casual. How often have you seen that happening? Again, this is big-end-of-town lawyers saying, 'Here are the implications for the industry of not paying your debts.' The implication is that warranties or guarantees provided for workmanship by the old entity have become unenforceable and worthless. So, if you actually get a block of flats built and there is a warranty on that flat, the company simply goes bust and phoenixes up again—they might be building the block of flats next door. There is no warranty and there is no comeback on that company. Sutton Douglass Lawyers also say that workers are pressured to take leave while the businesses transfer from the old entity to the new and the interest of company owners and directors takes priority at the cost of creditors, who do not get paid.


There is a detrimental effect on the community, there is an erosion of the revenue base and there are increased enforcement costs that stem from the avoidance of regulatory obligations. We had much evidence from the Australian Taxation Office and ASIC about the problems that they have dealing with this issue of phoenixing. Sutton Douglass Lawyers go on to say that, by not paying their taxes and employee entitlements, companies have an unfair competitive advantage. So you have companies that are out there battling to do the right thing—paying the wages of workers week in and week out, paying the proper tax and fixing the warranty issues up—and then you have these phoenix companies that are just going bust and getting an unfair advantage.


This is the type of behaviour that this government is supporting with this bill. Make no mistake about it: this is the type of behaviour that this government is supporting. I will come back to this down the line, because there was a report that had 30-odd recommendations. This government has not responded to a single one of them.




Senator Dastyari:
  Forty-four recommendations.




Senator CAMERON:
  There were 44 recommendations. There has not been one response from this government.


I want to go to the second issue that is a big problem, and that is this code. Imagine giving the worst public servant in the country the decision as to whether unions are bargaining effectively with employers. Mr Nigel Hadgkiss—a guy who is arrogant, out of touch and simply doing the bidding of the government—has now got the right to determine whether a company is bargaining with its employees. It is not the Fair Work Commission or the old industrial commission anymore. Part of the problem is not just the issues in the bill as they stand but also the code and the implications of the code. The code prohibits a number of clauses in these agreements. Remember, Mr Hadgkiss is the guy who is going to determine these issues. Under the code that is developed by this government, you cannot negotiate to have apprentices employed under your agreement. 


I was a union official for 27 years. I negotiated agreement after agreement after agreement that said that a company would employ apprentices, not only for the benefit of the company but for the benefit of young workers trying to get an apprenticeship. Under the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013, if the CFMEU or any union seeks to have a clause in the agreement for the employment of apprentices, of young kids—no, that is illegal. How stupid can this government be to do that? What is the point of trying to deny young workers access to a job when it is the union movement that has been out there pursuing apprenticeships for as long as I have been in this country? It is the union movement that has championed apprenticeships—not this mob over here, who simply complain about them costing too much and who, through Senator Birmingham, gives $2 million to a former senator who sent his own building company broke. They were going to give $2 million to his pet project. This is the sort of behaviour of this government—you cannot negotiate to employ an apprentice; you cannot put local workers ahead of temporary foreign workers.


I thought One Nation were out there being the champion of Australian workers, yet they are going to sign off on this so that foreign workers will get in before an Australian worker. There will be no checks and balances coming from One Nation. All the rhetoric is out there from One Nation about the need to give Australians jobs, but they now have a chance—there is a test for Senator Hanson and her mob now. We will be moving an amendment to give priority to Australian workers. Let us see how big they are then. Let us see how good they are then. All the rhetoric you get from them—we will see whether there is any substance to that. Today is the chance that they have. 


What happens if you encourage the employment of a mature age worker? You might have a rigger or a carpenter or a builder's labourer who has worked in the industry for 30 or 40 years, and then the young buck comes in—the 21-year-old labourer—and, because he is bigger and stronger and faster, he gets the job, and 40 years of hard work in the industry stands for nothing. Well, the CFMEU stands up for their members. The CFMEU stands up for mature age workers and wants to give mature age workers a fair go. Even if the boss agrees to do that, this bill outlaws that in the code—absolute nonsense. 


What about encouraging site employment levels that maintain safe staffing—safety? Senator Rhiannon outlined some of the issues. Two Irish backpackers—backpackers, inexperienced people—were killed under a massive slab of concrete in Perth. A young female German backpacker fell many metres to her death on a construction site in Perth. Do you hear anything said by this lot over here about that? Absolutely nothing. All they want to do is stop the unions being able to negotiate safe working conditions and safe numbers on the job. 


Here is another one for One Nation. This bill makes it illegal to negotiate with a company to use locally manufactured products and building materials on the job. So we will just bring it all in from China, from Korea, from Thailand. Do not give anybody a fair go in Australia. That is what this bill does—stops a fair go for Australian industry. One Nation have already said they are going to sign off on it. So much for the great protectors of workers in this country—One Nation—when you just cave in on these significant issues.


The employment of safety officers on the job is not allowed. How ridiculous is that? And, if you want to discourage casual employment so that a worker gets a decent number of hours on the job, the code makes that illegal. Casualise the workforce, internationalise the workforce, exploit the workforce—that is this mob over there. Even if a property owner wants to invite a union official onto the site of their own property, they have to go through Nigel Hadgkiss, the worst public servant ever to put a foot in this place. No wonder the advisor in the box is smiling—you have seen him in operation. I certainly know that the public servants have been raising big eyebrows about the operation of this guy. Even if you agree that a union official can come onto your property, this bill outlaws that. 


This bill outlaws consultation about the use of subcontractors. This lot want to get the worst subcontractors in the country with the worst wages, the worst conditions, the worst employment ever, to come onto the job and undermine decent wages and decent conditions fought for by the CFMEU and the other unions. That is what this lot are about. They are absolutely hopeless. If the union negotiate with the employer that there will be no cashing out of entitlements, that entitlements will be maintained, that the workers will take their entitlements from one job to another, that is illegal. For Nigel Hadgkiss to be taking over the role of the Fair Work Commission to police this is an absolute outrage. 


There is plenty there for One Nation, plenty there for Senator Xenophon, plenty there for Senator Hinch—and Senator Leyonhjelm: well, who knows? We will see where you stand on these issues today. We will see whether you actually stand for Australian workers. We will see whether you actually stand for safety on the job. We will see whether you actually stand for older workers. We will see whether you actually stand for young workers getting an apprenticeship. We will be watching how you vote on every one of those issues. This code is a disgrace. Minister, do you intend to proceed with the code? (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-29,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:29):  I will of course be joining with my colleagues in the Australian Greens to oppose this terrible, draconian, antiworker and antiunion legislation. But I have been listening, like Senator Macdonald, very carefully to this debate and I have been reflecting on the contribution that Senator Macdonald just made—though I guess it was more of an unstructured rant than a contribution. I have been wondering why Senator Macdonald and his colleagues in the Liberal Party are in fact so supportive of this terrible, draconian legislation. I know Senator Macdonald's history. I know he has been a member of the Liberal Party for a long period of time, and that is fine; it is a free country. But, as I was wondering why they are so supportive of this terrible legislation, it came to me in a blinding flash: political donations from the property development industry, because over the last five years the Liberal and National parties combined have received, at the very least, $10.3 million in direct donations from the property industry. And who stands to gain most from this legislation? It is the property industry.


Minister, the question for you is identical in spirit to the one you responded to Senator Macdonald on when he asked you about donations the Greens had received. I ask you: can you place on the record, Minister, how many millions of dollars the Liberal Party has received in donations from the property development sector in this country over the past five years? If you cannot place that on the record today, could you please come back into the chamber and provide us with that advice in the future, as I believe you committed to doing for Senator Macdonald.


I am not going to stand here and listen to the rubbish and the drivel coming out of Senator Macdonald's mouth without pointing out the rampant hypocrisy behind his words. He might want to get up and cast aspersions at my colleague and friend Senator Rhiannon in this place, and he is entitled to do that, but he is going to cop it back every time. We are going to expose his hypocrisy. We are going to expose the links between political donations to the Liberal Party and the National Party from the property development sector, who stand to profit massively from these pieces of legislation.


Do not even get me started on the donations that the Liberal and National parties receive from the fossil fuel industry in this country. In order to receive those donations, they of course deliver massive public policy outcomes for the fossil fuel sector in this country, including about $24 billion—that is billion with a 'b'—of direct taxpayer subsidies to the fossil fuel sector in Australia in every budget. While on the one hand this week they are trying to claw back some money from backpackers who contribute to the agricultural sector in this country, on the other hand they funnel out the door these massive donations, many billions of dollars a year, to the fossil fuel sector in return for the significant donations they receive from the fossil fuel sector. Of course, it is the same with property developers. Those opposite claw in money in political donations—$10.3 million to the Liberal and National parties combined over the past five years—and they deliver outcomes. Make no mistake; that is what Senator Cash is sitting in here doing today, flanked by Senator Cormann and Senator Fifield, with Senator Paterson up in the back row. They are delivering for their major donors and their mates in the property development sector.


I will say to Senator Macdonald—even though he is not in the chamber at the moment he can always read the Hansard—that if he is going to get up and have unstructured rants at the Greens then he can expect to be called out for being a hypocrite. He can expect to have his party's very close links with the property development industry, including the millions of dollars in donations it receives every year, called out and exposed.


Minister, the question to you is: exactly how many millions of dollars has the Liberal Party received from property developers? Could you take that back through five years and provide a breakdown on an annual basis please.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2016-11-29,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (13:35):  I stand as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia. These bills are about unravelling building industry cartels, and their union cronies are caught in the crossfire. The bills are about protecting and restoring this industry from the grip of the cartels. Above all, these bills support freedom—freedom of choice for union workers, whether or not they want to be in a union; freedom of choice for subbies; freedom of choice for small business; freedom of choice for taxpayers, so that we do not have to keep paying exorbitant rates for buildings that are controlled by a building industry cartel that includes the CFMEU. These bills support small business. These bills support taxpayers. These bills protect honest union members from their union bosses. These bills support the building industry.


I have had the pleasure of talking with Ken Phillips, who has explained to me how small businesses have been crippled by big businesses that want to suppress small business competition. They are pushing the risk down to the small businesses and they are doing the union's bidding. Unpaid bills certainly are rife in the industry—we know about that—and that is due largely to the power and control of a few large companies.


When I listen, in Queensland, to big, burly, well-muscled men running their businesses and they are in tears because of fear for their families and their employees then I know we have got a problem. Yet what did we hear from the Greens and the Labor Party last night? We heard about Fidel Castro, who destroyed his nation. We heard endlessly about Work Choices, ice dealers, diaries, fatalities. Fatalities are sad, but the fact is that safety improved under the previous ABCC provisions.


We heard all about the Chicken Littles—bwok bwok bekerk!—all the scratching and running around in this house last night, all the pecking, pecking, pecking, the Chicken Littles. I do not know which bill Senator Cameron was reading, but I—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Roberts, resume your seat. Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Yes, the point of order is that the Senate is a workplace for a number of people, such as people in Hansard, who listen very carefully to the contributions. I think that deliberately tapping the microphone should be ruled out of order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Thank you, Senator McKim, you have made your point. Please resume your seat.




Senator ROBERTS:
  I have read the ABCC bill from cover to cover, including the building code, and it does nothing that Senator Cameron alleges. The CFMEU is supposedly bargaining for its members, yet it funded GetUp! to the tune of $1.2 million in 2010. And what I am going to discuss next is a very sad thing, and that is black lung. Black lung is a crippling disease in the coal industry, and we thought it was ended thanks to legislation, thanks to modern equipment and thanks to modern high-velocity ventilation. But in Queensland recently we have seen black lung recur. The CFMEU controls four of the levels of responsibility for preventing black lung, including two levels that are paid for by the industry and for which the CFMEU are responsible. That is an indictment of the CFMEU's attitude towards safety.


We see the CFMEU allied with activists and with GetUp!—who are also connected with American billionaires—funding the destruction, and they admit this, of this country's coal industry. And they are closely allied with President Obama and senior people from Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is indeed payback, as Senator Cameron said, for the people in Australia, for the honest union members, against the large building companies and the CFMEU cronies.


Senator Cameron, in my view, is of the old days, when might was right, when safety was seen as a cost. And then it was a constant battle, because the old view was that safety cost money, and that is no longer appropriate. Senator Cameron still sees safety as an alternative to productivity. It is not, and I will get on to the solution in a minute. In the old days, quality was seen as cost. It is not a cost, but that is what it was seen as. So, companies, managers, people throughout the country and people throughout the world thought that higher quality meant higher cost. That has also been tipped away. The environment was seen as a cost, and the Greens still see it as a cost—to the detriment of our civilisation. But times have changed. Safety now is seen to improve productivity. That is why safety makes commercial sense. When people focus properly on safety they improve the work processes, the work environment, and that leads to fewer injuries, fewer near misses and less waste of materials. Safety improves productivity.


This bill is about putting responsibility back on the employers in this industry, and that will improve safety, as it did under the old ABCC. Quality improves productivity. Maybe people in this chamber are not aware of what the Japanese did. The Japanese focused on quality and dramatically improved productivity, and that has given us the modern miracle of modern manufacturing, which reduces costs. The same miracle will start to apply much more rapidly in the construction sector once management is allowed to behave properly and once the senior management of major companies are required to manage properly. We now see that the environment improves productivity, because the environment is despoiled by pollutants. Pollutants are waste, and when we reduce waste we improve the environment, we improve costs. The Greens, though, seem to think that civilisation and the environment are mutually exclusive, whereas they are mutually beneficial.


I have been made aware of some hours of work—or maybe they are hours of recreation—on the Karara worksite under a greenfields agreement. A typical day during a negotiation—which the taxpayers are paying for—is a 6.30 start; from 6.30 to seven o'clock, workers arrive and attend prework meetings with the relevant foremen. Sounds good. From 7.30 to 9.30 there is a union communication meeting. But wait for it: that is the first communication meeting that they are entitled to. From 9.30 to 10.00 is a scheduled smoko break. It must have been a pretty hectic meeting! And then from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock there is 'limited work'. From 11 o'clock to one o'clock is—wait for it—the second union communication meeting. The union is not very good at communication, I guess! From one o'clock to 1.30—of course, after a tiring morning—it is necessary for a lunch break, and then from 1.30 to 2.30 there is another hour of 'limited work', and then from 2.30 to three o'clock, knock-off, with a staggered finishing time between 2.30 and 3 pm. So, two hours of work—sorry: two hours of 'limited work'—in an eight-hour day; amazing.


Who is paying for this? We are—the taxpayers. The taxpayers are paying for this. Senator Cameron does not seem to understand economics. He feigned ignorance that the building construction industry does not affect house prices. When the price of apartments rises, the price of houses rises. It is that simple: supply and demand. Everyone knows that—well, I would have thought everyone knows that. Some building workers, contrary to what Senator Cameron said, actually go out to work every day, but they cannot get work. They cannot get work because they are black banned, and sometimes they are threatened and are under intimidation. And it is not only them but also their families and their work mates. Dyson Heydon and many judges have confirmed that. Around 100 CFMEU officials are before the courts—and Senator Cameron raises accountability. That is the core of this bill. But how can we have accountability when workers, when foremen, when shareholders, when owners of buildings have to go through the court system to get it? It is not right. This bill and the building code in particular pushes accountability back to where it belongs—to the head of the senior companies. This bill is about freedom, accountability, safety and workers' rights, and improving every one of them.


Senator Rhiannon talks about protecting the CFMEU. Why? It is because it is a major source of Greens' funds. Another point I want to address is the use of labels by members of the ALP and members of the Greens in this Senate. When I hear someone being labelled as arrogant, as a liar et cetera then, to me, it means that the person using the label does not have the evidence. That, again, is an old, outdated tactic and displays behaviours that are no longer productive. In fact, the old unions, which Senator Cameron seems to exemplify, stifled workers, disconnected workers and stifled apprentices. When people are not free to use their talents through demarcation, it has a very crippling effect on work pride and work satisfaction. 


I am of the understanding that when Bill Shorten was minister for employment the number of 457 visas increased dramatically. I am also of the understanding that the board members of GetUp! included Bill Shorten, an ally of the CFMEU. I am also of the understanding that under the previous Labor government Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's used 457 visas. I may be wrong about that, but that is what I have heard.




Senator Cormann:
  Would you like lies with that?




Senator ROBERTS:
  Sorry?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Direct your comments through the chair, thank you, Senator Roberts.




Senator ROBERTS:
  Restricting subbies to a CFMEU panel and not being allowed to employ anyone else, apart from those in the CFMEU panel, discriminates heavily against the worker.


I was in a discussion with Senator Pauline Hanson and one of our office staff some months ago and I had the privilege of being with senior members of the ACTU and the CFMEU and I asked them for their opinions on what the big issues are that are facing this country. One of them said, 'The need to increase wages.' None of them said tax. Tax is crippling our industry in this country and crippling payrolls because we are taxing payrolls and we are taxing gross incomes. That means a decent increase to a person's gross income is prohibitive when it comes to employment in many industries. We are taxing people out of work because the tax system is antiquated and designed for another era.


The ACTU does not raise tax. The opposition leader in the lower house does not raise tax. He said he would not raise tax. The Prime Minister has said that the government will not raise tax. And, yet, jobs are supposed to be a big issue. We must address tax so the cost-of-living pressures are removed from everyday builders and their employees. It seems to me that everyday people are cannon fodder for the ALP unions cartel—the machine that tries to control, in cahoots with big builders, this building industry and is holding our country back. We need to protect small businesses and subbies. We need to protect honest workers, and we need to protect the taxpayers from union cartels in collusion with big business.


Then I come to the Greens—again, the Greens. Only the Greens could tell us that depreciation is a subsidy on hydrocarbon fuels. Only the Greens could lack understanding of accounting so that they could classify depreciation as a subsidy and talk about it in isolation as if only the hydrocarbon industry is getting it. I am tired of the rants, I am tired of the labels and I am tired of the old-world tactics. I need to help this country get on with coming back into the 21st century and improving the efficiency, safety and security of this industry. I am very much in favour of this bill.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (13:51):  Minister, that is disappointing. There were 44 recommendations made. It was quite a bipartisan inquiry. I want to give credit to Senator Cameron, who I think initiated the inquiry. Frankly, while I had the role of chairing the committee, it was Senator Cameron and Senator Cameron's office that did the bulk of the work and then I think Senator Ketter finally presented it. The report itself had 44 recommendations that went to the heart of the issues affecting the building industry. They were largely around the issues of phoenixing—how companies are phoenixing and what the impact of phoenixing has been. Minister, how does this bill, as it currently stands unamended, address the issue of phoenixing in the industry?

As you correctly pointed out, this Economics References Committee report was tabled in December 2015. You would be aware that the legislation was drafted, I believe, over three years ago now. Obviously, the legislation is in the same form as it was when introduced, given that it was a double dissolution trigger.


In relation to the question that you asked: my understanding is that there will be amendments moved by some of the crossbenchers which will address in further detail the concerns which you raised.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (13:52):  Minister, the report itself came through with 44 different recommendations. Again, not having seen the amendments that you are foreshadowing I may speak a little broadly to the issues that were raised regarding phoenixing and, I hope, to those who are in the process of looking at this issue.


This has been a very politically-charged debate over the past few years. This report was not a politically-charged one; some of the reports that we deal with in this place are and some are not. This really highlighted this incredible issue of phoenixing. Again, it was Senator Cameron who bought it to my attention. It is the situation whereby people within the industry will set themselves up to fail: they will subcontract work, will not pay those workers, will feign insolvency or become technically insolvent and then recreate a similar company with a similar name and with a similar board of directors—or second cousins, or friends, or next-door neighbours or faux, sham boards—to recreate themselves.


The evidence found in the inquiry was that some of the horrendous, terrible and deplorable behaviour that has gone on in this industry has occurred as the result of people desperately trying to make sure they get paid. People have hired some horrible people. Let me be clear: that is the wrong thing to do. Nobody should condone that and nobody supports that. What I think is unfortunate is the legislative environment that allows phoenixing to happen to the extent to which it is happening. It creates an environment where desperate people have done desperate things. It is horrible behaviour and it should not be supported. But at the same time, we should look at how we frame an environment where it is not necessary—where that type of behaviour is not needed.


With some of these subcontractors, the fact is that they have to price into their own business models the notion that from time to time they are simply not going to get paid—that people are going to come and shut down their businesses. There is frustration in many of these circumstances. To see someone who owes you money for work you have conducted properly reappear a week later with a different company but with a slightly amended company name is actually a huge problem that is affecting so many lives. There were 44 recommendations by the Senate inquiry, largely around bringing the Corporations Act into line with the insolvency act and also about the powers and focus that ASIC is going to have. I think that is a step in the right direction, in so far as we are having a genuine discussion about how we improve the construction industry. The priority should be phoenixing and how some of these companies have behaved.


Minister, again, I think it is disappointing that it is correct when you say that this piece of legislation was produced three years ago. I feel that this is something which could have been incorporated—or should have been incorporated—into any discussion that we were having around this industry. What the Senate economics committee found was that there was no bigger issue than phoenixing. At a practical level it is affecting those who are trying to make a living or to run a business from day to day.


But here we are again, debating this bill one more time. I hope that after we defeat this bill certainly then the government will move on and shift its focus elsewhere. But in the last week of the parliament, six months after an election, here we are debating this bill one more time. Frankly, look at the priorities we should be dealing with—

Senator DASTYARI:
  Through you, Chair, I am not sure if that is an interjection I should be taking or leaving. Against my better judgement, I think I will let that interjection stand.


This is a bad piece of legislation. This is a piece of legislation that has been defeated time and time again because it does not achieve what it sets out to achieve. This is a bill which is nothing more than a relentless attack on the Australian trade union movement by an ideologically-driven government that is out of ideas, that is out of direction and that is only unified by hate. And when they are not hating each other, when they are not splitting amongst each other, they turn around and start attacking others. And I note that the soon-to-be former Leader of the Government in the Senate has walked in to start question time.


I will say this: this is a bad bill. This is not a bill that should be supported. This is not a bill that should be passed by this Senate, and I await the Senate defeating this bill one more time.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (13:59):  I have a question for the minister, but before I ask my question of the minister, and in the spirit of goodwill, I want to offer some thanks to other senators. Let me thank Senator Dastyari for very kindly pointing out that it is not a good idea to hire standover men to collect debts from people. That is a great concession on your part, Senator Dastyari, thank you for that. I hope you sent that memo to the CFMEU, because they have not been following your advice on this. That is perhaps why this legislation is necessary.


I would also like to thank Senator McKim for proving that unconstructed sprays are not the preserve of just government or opposition senators, but of the crossbench as well.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Bell Group litigation.


Something is on the nose. Something is seriously on the nose with this government and the Western Australian Liberal government in terms of who said what and who promised what. I want to go back to the question that I asked. I want to remind the Senate that when I asked the Attorney-General that question I quoted Dr Mike Nahan, the Western Australian Treasurer, when he told the Western Australian parliament:


We had a deal with the commonwealth that it would not oppose the Bell act.


I then went on to ask the Attorney-General: did he believe Dr Nahan was misleading the Western Australian parliament? Obviously, someone is not telling the truth. Dr Nahan may have made that up in his own little mind, but clearly that is not the case.


I am not one to defend the most incompetent state government, in this Barnett Liberal government, that Western Australia has ever seen. Let me just remind the Senate why I say that. Since Mr Barnett and the Liberal government took power in Western Australia nearly eight years ago, we have lost our AAA credit rating. We lost that back in 2013. That is why Dr Nahan is not making this up. That is why I believe it. That is why I believe nothing that happens in Western Australia gets past a number of ministers. Minister Cormann said he knew nothing about it, but you see there is another minister in the other place, Mr Porter. Let us not forget that Mr Porter was the Western Australian Treasurer before he had a change of career and wanted to come over here. The Bell issue is nothing strange or new to Mr Porter. I want to know what is going on between this lot, the Western Australian Treasurer and the Western Australian government.


Let's not forget that the Barnett government have unveiled the state's largest ever forecast budget deficit—I am reading a quote from the ABC—of almost $4 billion. When they took over in 2008 there was a very healthy piggybank. Dr Nahan must be getting a bit worried, because he is the one who is getting a lot of the blame—although that is grossly unfair, because Mr Barnett is the Premier and you have to be surrounded by competent minsters. Sadly, in Western Australia that is lacking. The ABC said:


Treasurer Mike Nahan has handed down his third budget, showing the deficit will surge from a forecast $2.96 billion to $3.9 billion in 2016–17.


We know Dr Nahan has been very vocal, absolutely criticising his federal counterparts and naming none other than Senator Cormann, the member for Curtin, Ms Bishop, and Senator Cash—all cabinet ministers. He named not only them but Mr Porter. He has absolutely criticised them—as you would know, Madam Deputy President—because of the lack of guts within the federal Liberal parliamentary team to stand up for Western Australia, which has been the GST cash cow for our nation.


But let's not blame it all on Dr Nahan's view of the incompetent Liberal ministers from Western Australia in the federal cabinet. Let us not forget that there was a certain minister, back in the Court government, who ushered through the GST—could not wait. I never once heard Mr Colin Barnett oppose the introduction of Prime Minister Howard's and Treasurer Costello's GST. They were all for it. I remember the arguments—as you would, too, Madam Deputy President—so I can understand Dr Nahan's discomfort here. I have read—and if anyone wants to tell me it is not true, you have the opportunity—that there was a blazing row, an absolute blue between the Attorney-General and the state Attorney, Mr Mischin, because someone ratted on a deal that someone in this place or in the place over there had done over the phone or over dinner with the Western Australian Liberal government. They flew to Perth and had some secret meetings: 'She'll be right; we'll sort this out.'


There were a few carrots along the way, too. Remember the $490 million—'Shut your mouth; stop whinging about the GST; we'll give you some money from the federal government'? Now, I say, give us more money; give us back the money you stole off us from the GST. I am running out of time, but I am absolutely gobsmacked, because I can understand the pressure on the Western Australian Liberal government, because they are incompetent, but also they have been made a promise and someone has ratted on the deal, and we need to find out who that is.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-11-29,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:08):  It must be close to Christmas, because there is pantomime being performed by those opposite. And as with all Christmas pantomimes, there are colourful characters—like Senator Sterle—cringe-worthy overacting, finger-pointing, confected outrage and audience attention seeking, and no more so than today. Today the opposition has once again, in a week in which important business of government is actually being done, staged a second-rate sideshow on an issue that is as irrelevant as it is opportunistic. The issue of this imagined arrangement between the Commonwealth and the Western Australian government in the Bell Group liquidation is just that: it is a sideshow, it is a witch-hunt and it is aimed squarely at a senator who clearly gets under the skin of the opposition.


The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, made a comprehensive statement on the Bell Group issue yesterday, and Senator Wong promised that the ALP would carefully consider the Attorney-General's statement. Well, it is painfully apparent that they have not done so. Senator Brandis told this chamber yesterday that there was never an arrangement between the federal government and Western Australia over how to bring the long-running legal dispute to a close or how to carve up $1.8 billion in disputed proceeds. The Bell Group litigation is infamous for its length and its costs. It is the most complex and costly corporate winding up in Australian history. So far it has involved some 30 separate legal proceedings in four countries as well as proceedings in Australia, in the High Court, the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Western Australia.


As he unambiguously explained to this chamber, the Attorney-General accepted the legal advice of former Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson that the Commonwealth should challenge the Western Australian government over its wind-up of the Bell Group. Every decision that the Attorney-General made on the matter did protect the interests of the Commonwealth, by supporting the decision of the ATO to intervene in the matter and deciding to accept Mr Gleeson's advice that the Commonwealth of Australia should also intervene in the matter. There was never an agreement between the Attorney-General and his WA counterpart, Mr Mischin, which was acknowledged.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  How do you know?




Senator HUME:
  I had a look at the correspondence, Senator. That is how I know. The correspondence between former Treasurer Joe Hockey and his WA counterpart, Dr Nahan, clearly does not constitute that an agreement or understanding was arrived at between the Commonwealth and the Western Australian government. Indeed, despite Labor finger-pointing, Dr Nahan has not in fact cited any specific agreement. The Labor Party speak of an arrangement, but where is this arrangement supposed to be recorded? Is there a written agreement between the Commonwealth and Western Australia? No, there is not. Are there perhaps public statements by Mr Hockey or any other Commonwealth minister? No, not that the Labor Party can point to. And what about in the correspondence? No, there is nothing there either. There was no deal. There was no arrangement. There was no understanding.


The Attorney-General said in his statement that he took countercompeting arguments, that he listened to and tested settlement proposals and then approved or instructed the lodgement of the appropriate documents within the deadline and approved the making of submissions completely in accordance with the legal advice he had received. It is clear from the Attorney-General's statement that he acted properly at all times. Everything was done when it needed to be done and in accordance with advice as well as established legal processes. The claim that there was an agreement between the Commonwealth and WA is wrong. The claim that the Attorney-General ignored the Constitution and instructed the Solicitor-General to do so is wrong. In short, just about everything the Labor Party and the Greens have said on this issue is wrong. 


What skulduggery by the opposition. Mark Dreyfus and Bill Shorten have significantly overreached and acted recklessly in their assertions and accusations, and in this chamber Labor have picked up their union issued and approved pitchforks and continued this witch-hunt. Opportunism abounds here. Accuracy is forsaken for headlines. This is an opposition that would rather be quotable than be credible. Protocol is subordinated to steal headlines in a week that is not going your way. This government is delivering. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:13):  Let's take some of the heat out of this and reflect on what we did actually hear today and what we did hear in Senator Brandis's statement. Senator Brandis had notice this morning, in Laura Tingle's article in The Financial Review, of the most critical question that, once again, he has failed to answer. The question was: did the Attorney-General prevent, discourage or inhibit attempts to challenge a Western Australian bill that would have favoured Western Australia over federal taxpayers to the tune of $300 million? Senator Hume asks, 'What evidence do we have of that?' Well, the evidence we have is what the Western Australian government tells us; that is what the evidence is. But more than that, Senator Hume, in trying to support her argument about a pantomime, then goes on to form a very solid opinion herself—although she is talking about what is truth—over and above even what the Attorney-General claims. The Attorney-General told us today that he formed an opinion that there was no deal. This fine legal mind will tell us that he formed that opinion—




Senator Brandis:
  Deputy President, I have a point of order. Because this potentially matters, this is not a pedantic objection. I told the Senate that I was of the opinion that there was no deal. That is my opinion. That is not what Senator Collins just said.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I believe that is a debating point, thank you. Senator Collins, please continue.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  That was, indeed, exactly what I said. Now I am going to address the issue of how he formed that opinion. This, as I said, fine legal mind formed that opinion in ignorance. He did not even bother talking to his own office about what contacts they had in this matter. He did not bother talking to Mr Hockey, who, as he has informed us, was the representative of the Commonwealth upon whom the Western Australian government members relied in forming their opinion. Sure, as he tells us, different people can come out of exchanges with different opinions, but you do not then go on to conclude an opinion of your own in ignorance. 


We have all heard about convenient memories and the 'I do not recall' defence. Senator Sinodinos had it down to fine art. The 'I do not recall' defence was used so many times that the stature of the argument became very questionable. In this case, we do not have a convenient memory; we have convenient ignorance from Senator Brandis on behalf of the Commonwealth. What I took out of yesterday's statement, listening carefully to Senator Brandis as he delivered it, was that he had been sprung by the Solicitor-General in attempting to prevent the Commonwealth becoming involved in the matter and nowhere has he been able to refute that that was the case. 


So we will continue for days on end to get senior commentators and others continuing to ask these questions. Remember how Senator Brandis started this with, 'No comment'. If these issues had not been canvassed in the Senate, we would be still be on the, 'no comment' response. 'The Attorney-General does not respond to questions around matters in which the Commonwealth has been engaged'—that would be his answer. But of course the heat and the temperature rose after his initial response. Pressure came from a number of areas that he did need to at least try to present what he could argue was a comprehensive statement. But we all know, despite its length, despite the grand words and the grand arguments that Senator Brandis sought to put across, there are just so many unanswered questions. The questions that Senator Watt asked today were not answered. There are so many things that Senator Brandis remains ignorant of or refuses to help us understand. Indeed, he refuses to refute the suspicion that he did seek to prevent the Commonwealth's involvement in this matter.


This is no pantomime. Sure, it has attracted humour. I was today sent a reference from the SBS about how Senator Brandis is now ordering more buses because his behaviour here has become a farce. The length of the scandals and the gaffes that reside around this Attorney-General just continue to grow. The SBS humour was that he had to order a fleet of buses so that he could throw more— (Time expired)

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:19):  What a compelling piece of evidence was just presented to the Senate by Senator Collins! SBS Comedy thinks that this is a matter of seriousness and one worthy of attention. Well, there we have it. I think in the legal business this is what you call 'resting your case', Senator Collins, and I am sure that the jury will go away and consider very seriously your compelling arguments!


Here we go again: Labor senators are deciding to finish the year in much the same way that they have conducted themselves throughout it, and that is pursuing an attack of personal smear and innuendo and criticism of Senator Brandis instead of pursuing matters of great weighty policy that are of concern to the Australian people. In every question in question time yesterday, in every question in question time today, in the take note after question time yesterday, in the take note after question time today, in the MPI yesterday and again in the MPI today we were advised that Labor senators want to spend hours and hours of the Senate's time on this issue on which they have no evidence to support their claims. This is not what the Australian people sent us here to do. This is not what they expect we do here on their behalf. They expect us to think about, to discuss, to debate, to even argue about the things that affect their lives and about the things that have a tangible impact on the way they live their lives—the great policy issues of today. They do not expect us to agree and they do not expect us to get along, but they do expect us to focus on the things that actually matter to them. We have heard in other debates that if something does not stop them at a barbecue then it should not be dealt with. Well, I would be very surprised if there is a barbecue anywhere in Australia that has been stopped to discuss this issue. 


I have a prediction to make and that is that this attack will peter out just like the previous attack along these lines has petered out. There will be nothing to show for it after hours of the Senate's time has been wasted. The most famous resident of Higgins, the member for Isaacs, Mr Dreyfus, has gone off half-cocked yet again. He has prematurely called for the resignation of Senator Brandis. Barely waiting for the ink to dry on the newspaper reports in The West Australian, barely waiting for any evidence at all, he has leapt to the most extreme conclusion and the most outrageous option and called for the resignation of Senator Brandis. 


Not coming from Western Australia and also being a young person not intimately familiar with the WA Inc era, I found it very interesting to listen to some of the history of this issue that we have heard on this debate in the chamber. I commend Senator Brandis for his very detailed and lengthy statement. I particularly want to draw the attention of senators to the introduction he made to that statement, because I think the history of this issue is illustrative. He said:


Between 1991 and 1993 – a quarter of a century ago – members of the Bell Group of companies, a diversified conglomerate based in Western Australia, went into liquidation. That liquidation is still ongoing, and nowhere near being completed. It is the most complicated and costly corporate winding-up in Australian history. So far, it has involved some 30 separate legal proceedings, in four countries. In Australia, it has involved complex proceedings in the High Court, the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The hearing of the main case alone, in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, lasted for 404 days and resulted in a judgment by Justice Owen running to 2,643-pages. There is no reliable figure as to the costs so far incurred in the winding-up, in professional fees paid to insolvency practitioners, solicitors, barristers and others. However everybody agrees that the costs so far are in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. And, of course, every dollar spent on professional fees and other costs, is a dollar that the creditors will never see.


There are many other interesting things in Senator Brandis's statement, which I commend to the Senate. But I also want to highlight very briefly in my remaining time the contribution of another Senate colleague of mine, Senator Back, who also went to the history of this issue. He has foreshadowed that, helpfully, he will be returning to this issue, given that it is going to be a topic of the MPI later on today. I look forward to hearing what he has to say, because he lent some very interesting perspective to this issue as someone who lived in Western Australia in that time.


I commend particularly the comments he made about the government that was in charge at the time of the Bell Group liquidation, about the events leading up to that liquidation, about the involvement of Mr Brian Burke and his government in that liquidation and about the very exorbitant costs that the people of Western Australia have had to bear as a result of the handling of it by Mr Burke and by members of his government. I look forward to his contribution later, although I also hope that at some point the Senate will move on from these matters to more weighty ones.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (15:24):  It intrigues me that Senator Brandis, in his comments on Monday, said that this was an area of law that he had specialised in. We know that the history of this Bell affair, if I can refer to it in that way, has dragged on for some 20 or so years—25 years, I think Senator Brandis mentioned today. As a lawyer specialising in this field of insolvency he appeared only to become really interested in how the resolution to the insolvency was going to take place. It was particularly on the visit by now Minister Porter that his interest seemed to have been sparked, not necessarily out of his profession. The question of the Commonwealth potentially losing out on revenue in the order of $300 million seemed not to have sparked his interest.


He also mentioned today—and I am not sure whether this was a matter that was a rearrangement of the facts or not—that his personal involvement first began on 3 March, although his office had been dealing with this matter prior to that time. I think he said today that they had been involved since January 2016, which is some two months earlier than the period he highlighted in his statement. It is curious that as an experienced minister he seems to have been comfortable with the fact that his staff did not pass on to him any information on this major legal and financial issue for months. It just intrigues me, whether this is a genuine case of some kind of Chinese Wall being erected between the minister and the staff so that later on, if the matter had gone the way it appears there was some intent to make it eventuate in the courts, the minister could say clearly that he did not know.


Surely, it seems that it is a clear principle that if your ministerial staff are informed of an issue then you are deemed to know about that issue. I note that the minister said that he would check on the paper trail in answer to questions from Senator Wong today. So maybe that matter could also be taken up, as to the dates.


I listened carefully to his explanation of Dr Nahan's statement, and I can see and understand why we in Western Australia become very frustrated with the way we are treated by the Commonwealth—particularly if the Western Australian ministers who were engaged in the discussion at the time took a different view. They took the view that there had been an agreement, as opposed to the view that we were told here in this chamber—that there was no agreement. Either they were very moronic or stupid, or incapable of understanding what was going on—and I doubt that is the case, given the competencies of the particular ministers involved. It is precisely this kind of attitude towards Western Australia that causes the parties that may normally be— (Time expired)

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:42):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government is supporting the effort to eradicate red imported fire ants in Queensland. In partnership with all states and territories the government has been addressing the inclusion of these ants in South-East Queensland since 2001. The Commonwealth has already provided over $150 million in assistance. In November 2014 the Agriculture Ministers Forum commissioned an independent review of the eradication program for the red imported fire ant inclusion in South-East Queensland. The review found the eradication of red imported fire ants is still in the national interest.

   (iii) this change will mean that the power to conduct public inquiries initiated by the ICAC Commissioner will be severely weakened,


   (iv) former Assistant ICAC Commissioner, Mr Anthony Whealy, stated the changes have a perception of payback, and former ICAC Commissioner Mr David Ipp has described the changes as scandalous, and


   (v) all Australian states and territories have some form of an anti-corruption commission; and

  The government takes a zero tolerance approach to corruption in all its forms. Australia is consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The government has a multifaceted approach to combatting corruption and financial crime, including: a $127 million reform package to strengthen the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and better protect Australian consumers; the Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre housed in the Australian Federal Police, with a $14.7 million investment from proceeds of crime to expand the centre's foreign bribery investigative capability; the release of a public discussion paper on a possible deferred prosecution agreement scheme; and $127.6 million over four years to fund the serious financial crime task force to ensure Commonwealth financial crimes are disrupted and deterred.

  The government opposes this motion. The coalition is committed to budget repair and the ABC, like all government agencies, has been asked to contribute to this effort. The ABC and SBS efficiency study demonstrated that the national broadcasters could realise significant savings without impacting on their programming or services. The ABC has previously confirmed that the decision to close its portfolio of leased stores was in no way related to the government's efficiency savings. The ABC has further advised that there has been no reduction in ABC commissions of children's content. The ABC has also confirmed that its regional services have been quarantined from any efficiencies or savings.

Senator O'NEILL:
  While Labor supports this position, we want to put on the record that Labor believes the ABC is one of Australia's most important public institutions. We believe that the ABC plays a very important role in adding to the diversity of news in our media landscape and providing an opportunity for Australian content to be shown and heard. The ABC also plays a vital role in our regional and remote communities by providing news, public announcements and emergency messages. Labor supports the Greens' motion on the basis that it expresses Labor's sentiment and record on the ABC.


In government, Labor implemented measures to ensure the institutional independence of our public broadcasters and their governing boards. Labor also provided additional funding that helped establish a dedicated digital children's channel and found efficiencies in the ABC that helped fund ABC News 24 and ABC online. This is in stark contrast to Mr Turnbull who, as a former communications minister, savagely cut more than $250 million from the public broadcaster in the horror 2014 budget. Most recently, the 2016 budget, in the hands of Mr Turnbull, has cut $48.6 million. (Time expired).

Nominations come from the community and finalists are selected by state and territory Australia Day Councils. The National Australia Day Council then independently selects the national winner, based on long-established criteria. Given the importance and prominence of their role, it is proper that every Australian of the Year is held to account for their actions and statements during their term.

The uncovering of a secret New South Wales police report—Strike Force Civet, which examined the Jedi Council's sex scandal—has raised serious questions about the competence, honesty and integrity of all senior Australian Defence officers involved in the management and investigation of this crisis, including retired General Morrison. General Morrison's management of the crisis has denied natural justice to many Australian Defence Force members and, in cases like retired Lieutenant Colonel Karel Dubsky's, maliciously ruined the career and life of an innocent man to protect the reputation of the Australian Defence Force. The appointment of General Morrison was a slap in the face for Australians who believe in justice for the innocent, and it should be reversed.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:18):  It gives me, unfortunately, not great pleasure to speak on this, but it has to be said. We cannot be silent. We have to let everyone in Australia know what the heck has been going on. There is something absolutely rotten going on between the Western Australian state government and this Commonwealth government, both from the Liberal family of politics. We heard very, very clearly in question time today the answer when Minister Brandis was asked very clearly about some comments made by the WA Treasurer, Mr Nahan, where he had said words to the effect of, 'We have a deal'—'we' being the state Liberal government—'with the feds to bring the Bell Group resources drama, the 'fair Bell plan', to a head, but we'll circumvent the opportunity for the ATO to collect the money.' These are the words that Mr Nahan said to none other than the Western Australian parliament. He said:


We had a deal with the commonwealth that it would not oppose the Bell act.


As a Western Australian, I think we need every single cent we can get because we, Western Australians, have been ripped off—I say that without any fear of retribution—by the government of GST take. But what makes it even worse than that is the total incompetence of the Barnett Liberal government that oversaw the greatest boom in Australia's history—the mining boom. It was only five years ago that we were standing here—every Western Australian in this place—bragging about Western Australia being the engine room of the economy.


I just want to say that two of the best reporters, I believe, in this nation are based here in this building, and they are Andrew Probyn and Shane Wright, who write for The West Australian. They have written some very, very telling articles about the nonsense going on between someone over here in the Commonwealth government and someone in the Western Australian government. We heard Senator Brandis's explanation yesterday—and I will put it in my words, not his—that, 'It's all former Treasurer Mr Joe Hockey's fault. He is the one who did the deal.' The reason those opposite say that is because back in April last year Mr Hockey wrote to his counterpart, Dr Nahan, in WA, with a nod and a wink or whatever the wording was, saying, 'It'll be all right; we won't oppose it.' I can understand why Dr Nahan is absolutely fuming, because he is the one that has to take all the pain on the jobless figures. He is the one who has to come out, do the budgets and try to defend the incompetence of the Barnett Liberal government.


I just want to share some figures that would explain Dr Nahan's anger after being, in my words, dudded by someone in the federal parliament. I would not for the life of me say it was Senator Cormann. I would not say that, even though Senator Cormann is the Geppetto of the WA Liberal Party. He is the puppetmaster, make no mistake. They might use the term 'powerbroker'. It is him and one of his mates over there, Minister Peter Collier. It is well known that, if you want to be a WA Liberal member of parliament, you go to the powerbroker.


This is why Dr Nahan and co over there are absolutely ropable, I would assume, after being dudded. It could be Mr Porter—I do not know who it is; I would not have a clue—in the other place. He has had some dealings. In fact, Mr Porter is now a senior minister in the Turnbull-Liberal government. Mr Porter was also Treasurer in the Western Australian government, so he knows all about the Bell Group deal, the Bell Group plan and the Bell Group problems. That had been going on for 20-odd years. Make no mistake: my colleagues on the other side, I am convinced—in fact, I will lay a bet. Are you allowed to lay a bet here? I will lay one with you, Mr Acting Deputy President—




Senator Gallacher:
  London to a brick.




Senator STERLE:
  Yes, London to a brick, so no money changes hands—that I am sure Western Australian Liberals will get up and go absolutely berko, scream at the top of their voices about Brian Burke and WA Inc. Do you know what? It was a pretty sad time in WA that it ended up that way. A lot of the people are no longer with us; they have passed away. Anyway, I am sure the intentions were right, but it did not end well. The courts have dealt with it. People went to jail. We needed to fix the mess. 


We need to find out the truth here. Who is lying? That is a pretty strong word to use. I am not accusing anyone of being a liar, but who is not telling the truth? Is it the WA Treasurer, Dr Nahan, or is it the federal parliamentary Liberal Party over here? They cannot both be right. One is saying they got a deal; one is saying they did not. There are some very senior ministers in this government who are Western Australian based, and we all know that the Premier, Colin Barnett, but through Dr Nahan, the Treasurer, has been very critical of the pathetic efforts—or nonefforts—of  Western Australian senior Liberal cabinet ministers: none other than Senator Cormann, none other than Senator Cash, none other than Mr Porter and none other than Ms Bishop, the member for Curtin. It is very disappointing, because they are selling out WA; they are not standing up for it.


Let us talk about some figures that would give anyone heartburn. Yesterday's The West Australian, that fantastic journal on the other side of the rabbit-proof fence, made it very clear in an article titled 'WA jobless level ""in line with recession""'. The Western Australian Liberal government of Mr Colin Barnett had their heads in the clouds while we were going through one of the greatest booms in history. They did not make any plans about what the heck we were going to do when it stopped. Where were all these jobs going to be? I will tell you what—they are not in WA. Shane Wright is a fantastic economics editor for The West Australian, because he is always on the money; he is a visionary. He came out and told it very clearly:


Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said recession was a fair description of the WA jobs market—


the 'R' word, goodness me—


which has shed 64,000 full-time jobs over the past 22 months.


What would I do if I were Dr Nahan, the Treasurer, and I had been made a promise from someone in the federal arena? That is, apart from Mr Hockey—we know where he is; he is Australia's Ambassador to Washington. I think the more we stuff up, the bigger job we get at the end when we leave—and I am not going to pull that one, because it is true. I will give you some other figures where, if I were Dr Nahan, I would be absolutely panicking. WA has lost its AAA credit rating. In 2013 the boom had just finished. This is how incompetent the state government of WA is. An article on the ABC website states that this year alone the Barnett government:


… unveiled the state's largest ever forecast budget deficit of almost $4 billion.  


The article continues:


Treasurer Mike Nahan has handed down his third budget, showing the deficit will surge from a forecast $2.96 billion to $3.9 billion in 2016–17.


Not 'creep' but 'surge'. It was the engine room of the economy a couple of years ago. The article goes on to say:


… state debt will continue to climb, reaching $33 billion next year and growing to $40.19 billion in 2020.


The previous Carpenter government left a pot of money. That mob—their cousins in the West over there—have blown it, and for years Western Australia had the greatest growth and economic opportunities known in this nation. Where the heck has that money gone? I am not even Dr Nahan; I am not the one that has been ratted on, but I am cranky. The article continues:


The Treasurer revised down the budget deficit forecast this year from $3.1 billion to $2 billion, due in part to a $500 million Commonwealth payment for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


Good. Dr Nahan:


… revealed the deficit would jump by $2 billion in 2016–17.


In The West Australian yesterday was an article written by two of the best reporters in this building—Mr Shane Wright and Mr Andrew Probyn. The article, on page 14, is headed 'Cormann backs ""fair"" Bell plan'. Minister Cormann is quoted as saying that they are backing it. We just had a vote in this chamber where they did not back it. They do not want an inquiry. They do not want to know what is going on with the 'fair Bell plan'. There is nothing to see here; move along. Senator Cormann was not in here. He is probably busy now. I thought that if he had been in here he would have backed us, because in The West Australian he is quoted as saying:


We want to ensure—the West Australian Government wanted to ensure, and certainly the Australian Government was aware through the treasurer Joe Hockey, that there was an attempt to bring this issue to a close in a way that was fair to all creditors …


What the heck does that mean? He is in here arguing against it. You heard it yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson. You have seen him in here denying any knowledge of it. As I said when I started—and I will finish with this—someone is not telling the truth. Have the guts, stand up and dob yourself in.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:28):  Senator Gallagher is almost right when she talks about the government's willingness to enter into an arrangement to forgo millions of dollars in tax revenue in order to benefit political mates—but you are out by 29 years, Senator Gallagher, as I will explain in a few moments.


The genesis of the background of this scenario goes back to 1987 and beyond, to the then stock market crash during the time of Mr Brian Burke as the Premier of Western Australia. It was a time when Burke and his mates—Bond, Connell, Holmes a Court and others—ran Western Australia like their own personal fiefdom. We then go to 1988, when Mr Robert Holmes a Court owned the Bell Group. Do you know what the Bell Group was? It was largely involved in heavy transport—a big cash cow. Holmes a Court owns the Bell Group, but of course as a result of the 1987 stock market crash he has gone bad. To whom does he turn? He turns to his mate Burke, now managing probably the most rotten government ever—a Labor government—since this state was developed. I know Senator Sterle will not agree with me. 


What happened? The deal was done. On behalf of the Western Australian community and Bond, the Bond Group bought the assets of the Bell Group. Then, of course, as we know, by 1991 she goes to the wall, and of course it goes into liquidation. Who then was asked to pick up the cost of this whole exercise? None other than the Western Australian community, through a levy on third-party vehicle insurance. Senator Sterle assured me earlier that this was history; it had all finished. It has not finished. It is ongoing to this very day.


Let me explain to Senator Gallagher why it is that she is quite right—that there was a willingness on the part of a government to enter into an arrangement to forego millions of dollars in tax revenue. By 1992-93, the Premier of the state was Ms Carmen Lawrence. Her brother, Bevan Lawrence, made the point publicly that his estimate at that time, in 1990, was that the efforts of the Burke government—the corruption and the rot that was the Burke Labor government—had cost the taxpayers of Western Australia some $600 million. In today's dollars that is $1.2 billion. That was the brother of the Premier of the state who said we had to have a royal commission into the rot that was the Western Australian Burke—followed by Dowding, followed by Lawrence—Labor government. Senator Gallagher could not have known how right she was, because in 1987, in evidence to the royal commission that became known as the WA Inc. royal commission, forced upon Premier Lawrence partially by her own brother but also by academics and even, by then, journalists in Western Australia—




Senator Smith:
  Western Australians marching in the streets.




Senator BACK:
  Absolutely! Senator Smith is right: people by then were marching in the street. The corruption was there for all to see. Mr Connell alleged, under oath, in evidence to the royal commission, that Hawke—being then Labor Prime Minister Hawke—dropped a proposed gold tax after Connell and various Perth high-flyers each donated $250,000 to Labor during an infamous lunch in Brian Burke's office. Senator Gallagher is right: there was an attempt by Labor mates to avoid tax. It was to do with lifting, or not imposing, a tax on gold. There is no question at all here, Mr Acting Deputy President—and, through you, to the gallery—that in the issue that has come before us today Senator Gallagher would have been far wiser to learn the lessons of history to make sure that she did not make a fool of herself.


So here was Connell, in evidence, damning himself and others for the fact that they all got their chequebooks out and gave a quarter of a million dollars to the Labor Party so that then Prime Minister Hawke would not charge a proposed gold tax, which of course would have been revenue for the people of Australia. That was the saddest part of the whole sad litany of Western Australia during that era.


I was asked this morning, because of my interjections at question time, why I had such a keen interest in it. Well, I was in business in Western Australia at that time, and I thought I was the frontrunner for an engineering project for which I had introduced the technology into Western Australia. It was original and it was unique. I engaged the services of experts from the eastern states. I influenced the then minister simply by saying to him, 'Please consider this new, unused, untested technology.' Of course, he then went and got his own consultant engineers in his department to go and check and, indeed, the technology that I had suggested was to become the technology that was used on that project. We went to tender, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I will tell you what I was told behind the scenes. I was told that if I did not use a certain firm of engineers, a certain firm of consultants, a certain firm of electricians, and plumbers, and carpenters, and transport organisations—and, by the way, if there was not going to be a brown paper bag with money in it—I was unlikely to win that tender, despite having been the person who introduced that technology into Western Australia.


We went ahead with our tender and—do you know what?—I was not going to be party to that; I was not going to be party to the corruption and the rot that had become the state Labor government in Western Australia. History records that my company did not win that tender. Another party, which presumably was willing to go down the path of these others, won it. Of course, the wrong technology was put into place and it subsequently failed. So when I speak with some passion about my memory and my recollection, it is not just the $50 per vehicle per annum that we have all had to pay for donkey's years to repay the debt incurred in those circumstances; it is my own personal memory of those times.


The question now becomes: who funded the litigation? The litigation by the liquidator was against the Commonwealth Bank, against Westpac, against NAB—against a consortium of some 20 banks. But who funded that litigation? Did the Commonwealth government fund the litigation? No. The Commonwealth government did not put in a penny. Did other creditors put any money in? No. It fell to the Western Australian community. That court case started in the 1990s. It eventually was dealt with by Justice Owen, over 404 sitting days in 2002-03, and history records that, indeed, he found in favour of the liquidator and the Western Australian insurance commission. That litigation, at the expense solely of Western Australian taxpayers, went on and on.


That brings us to the point raised by Senator Gallagher today, which is the possible involvement of the now Western Australian Liberal-led government and the coalition government here in Canberra. Those of us who know anything about litigation know that in most cases it is a lawyer-led recovery. They will keep going until there is no money left. And that is the situation that was facing the Western Australian government in 2015. If anybody has been listening to this debate, they would have thought that somehow there was a backyard deal being done—




Senator McKim:
  There was.




Senator BACK:
  listen!—between Attorney-General Brandis and Western Australian ministers for some gain. Well, let me go to the correspondence, which all of us have. I go to the letter of 15 April 2015 in which Treasurer Nahan wrote to federal Treasurer Hockey, speaking about proposed legislation to be brought to the Western Australian parliament to try to bring this event to a conclusion. Those in the gallery would be amazed to learn that the legislation had the full support of the Labor opposition in Western Australia and the Greens. You would think this is some Liberal stitch-up.


I will quote a couple of words from Nahan, who said that litigation between the creditors about distribution was 'in full flight' in both Australia and England and was likely to run for another five to 10 years, out to 2026. And now we have the circumstance in which Nahan says to Hockey that the Western Australian government is planning to introduce legislation that will—and here is dot point 1:


… deliver a more rapid financial return to the Commonwealth, the State Government and other creditors;


Who is first in that list? The Commonwealth. What is this nonsense about trying to stitch up a deal to avoid $300 million of tax revenue to the Australian taxpayer after the Labor government in 1987 accepted money from their mates to avoid tax? The second purpose is to eliminate further speculation by professional litigation funders—the very ones who were going to extend this and extend it and extend it, until there was nothing left. And thirdly:


… ensure no 'misdistribution' due to group complexity or leverage through litigation or a scheme;


And:


… only apply to Bell companies that are registered in WA;


Where is the problem with that? Nahan says to the federal Treasurer, 'We want to bring this to a conclusion with the support of our Labor and Greens colleagues and the first creditor to be dealt with is the federal government.' And Hockey writes back to him and says, amongst other things, 'I trust the Western Australian government will therefore continue to engage in good faith in the forthcoming mediation process'.


In the few seconds I have left to me, I will say that the advice I have learnt over time is that I never try to pick a Queen's Counsel lawyer, because they are good. And what I have seen evidenced in the last few days in this place is that Senator Brandis is good all right; he is a jolly sight better than anyone who has tried to come up against him. There is nothing to see here, except— (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-29,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:40):  Well, what an unstructured, irrelevant rant we have just heard from Senator Back. I am just going to calmly explain why nothing Senator Back just said is relevant to the crucial question before this chamber and the crucial question Attorney-General Brandis has consistently failed to answer over two days now in this chamber and two days preceding that in the public conversation in Australia.


What the Bell act did or did not do is irrelevant here. We all know what the Bell Act did. What the Attorney-General said or did not say on behalf of the ATO is irrelevant here. What the Attorney did or did not do in terms of the Commonwealth joining the High Court case in regard to the Bell act is irrelevant here. There are two relevant matters. Firstly, was a deal cooked up between the Commonwealth Liberal government and the Western Australian Liberal government that the Commonwealth would either not challenge the legislation in the High Court—the Bell act—or not join a challenge to the Bell act in the High Court or not run a particular argument against the Bell act in the High Court? That is the first question, and we know the answer to the question, because Dr Nahan confessed it in the Western Australian parliament when he said very clearly that there was an agreement between the Western Australian government and the Commonwealth government for the Commonwealth not to oppose the Bell act.


So, we know the deal was cooked up, because the Liberals in Western Australia have confessed on the record in the Western Australian parliament that a deal was cooked up. So for Senator Brandis to come in here yesterday and say that from his viewpoint there was no deal—it does not stack up. Just to be clear, the Greens do not make an allegation that Senator Brandis was involved in cooking up the deal. That, I have no doubt, was done by former Treasurer Joe Hockey and the Western Australian government. Where Senator Brandis comes in is that he was tapped to give effect to the deal. He was asked, almost certainly, by former Treasurer Hockey to instruct then Solicitor-General Gleeson to not run a particular line of argument in the High Court case relating to the Bell act. That particular line of argument of course was section 109 in the Constitution, ultimately the one that Mr Gleeson did run in the High Court and the one the High Court agreed with to the extent that it voted seven to zero to strike down the Bell act. It was an open and shut case. The Bell act was clearly unconstitutional. Anyone with a modicum of legal knowledge could have seen that. And that is why the deal was stitched up.


Senator Brandis has consistently refused to answer that question. That is the substantive most serious allegation before him. I have asked him on multiple occasions in this place. Senator Watt has asked him on multiple occasions in this place. And he has refused to answer. Either he has talked about something else entirely, as he is wont to do consistently, or he has drawn the veil of legal privilege down and said, 'I'm not going to answer that, because it's legally privileged.' Well, this Attorney-General is the most selective user of legal privilege I have seen in my political career, and that is saying something, because I have dealt with people like Paul Lennon in the Tasmanian parliament, who used to use it all the time, as does the current Liberal government in Tasmania. Senator Brandis is quite happy to waive legal privilege when it suits him politically, but of course when it suits him politically to claim legal privilege, that is exactly what he does.


So, this Senate voted quite comfortably today to send this matter to an inquiry. It is worth pointing out that the motion actually compels the attendance of Senator Brandis and also Senator Cormann, who, of course, was the cigar-smoking mate of Joe Hockey and finance minister at the time that this sordid affair went down. I look forward to this Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry. I believe that we will have the opportunity to, once again, ask these questions. We will find out whether the Attorney-General believes in the rule of law in this country and whether he is a fit and proper person to hold that office. (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2016-11-29,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:45):  I rise to make a contribution this debate. It seems not so long ago that the Attorney-General made a very comprehensive statement in this place, and it was obviously as a result of some very careful consideration over the weekend. When this story came out, I think, on Friday—it certainly came to my attention on Friday—I thought, 'Well, I'm not a lawyer.' That is pretty obvious to most people in this place. I mean, I barely finished high school. But through my working life I did go through a couple of instances where I had to deal with liquidation and the like. In all of those cases it was exceedingly clear that the tax office was the first secured line of credit, then the secured creditors and then the employees. It seemed, to me, like an immovable, immutable law that when someone owed some money the first people who would get paid would be the Commonwealth of Australia, which is all of us. The taxation department would take the first bite of any assets that were left.


Senator Back has given us a great history lesson about some of the shortcomings in Western Australia some 25 years ago, but I do agree with Senator McKim that I am not sure that that is all that relevant to this debate here today. What is relevant to the debate here today is, firstly, how the Attorney-General keeps getting in this position. How does he keep getting front and centre in all manner of arguments? I listed all the attorneys-general since 1972, and there have been some colourful attorneys-general in those 44 years. None of them had the capacity that this Attorney-General has to get right in the middle and be obvious to everybody that he is furiously trying to avoid what has basically hit him in the face. He cannot avoid the fact that his very complex and complete statement avoids the obvious. Why didn't he, as the Attorney-General—the representative of all the people in Australia—step up and say, 'That's rubbish'? It is simple rubbish. You cannot put in legislation which would move the secured creditor, the ATO—the Commonwealth of Australia—down the list.


I think there have been some moves between Western Australia and the federal parliament. Remember they said the grown-ups were in charge—Joe Hockey and the grown-ups were in charge. Senator Cormann was right there with them with a big cigar and a big glass of wine at the 2014 budget. They played the tune 'The Best Day of Our Lives'. In all that bonhomie and goodwill that they had, did they cook up a deal? Did they cook up a deal to fix what had been a pressing domestic issue for the Western Australian federal members of parliament where their own side was saying that they were weak and that they were not advocating for Western Australia in the federal parliament and they were not doing enough to regain funds which Western Australia claimed it had lost under the horizontal fiscal equalisation and in other areas? They were getting internal criticism. Did they actually go across the border and do a deal?


We know that the Hon. Christian Porter, former WA Treasurer and former WA Attorney-General, would have been well placed to argue the case. Senator Brandis basically came out and said that it was all to do with Joe Hockey and that he was not party to a number of things. According to Brandis, the whole Bell litigation mess was the fault of Joe Hockey; the Western Australia Treasurer, Mike Nahan; the Western Australian Attorney-General, Michael Mischin; the Hon. Christian Porter; and the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer. Remarkably, the Hon. George Brandis somehow escaped any blame at all—he was just the poor innocent Attorney-General who it all happened around. Apparently it all happened around him and nothing went through his office. Senator Dodson talked about Chinese walls. Apparently the Attorney-General's staff did not talk to him for two months and, if it was happening, he was not made aware of it.


These things are simply not good enough. The question that Senator Brandis needs to answer is: if he had no objections to the ATO office intervening in the case, why was their submission not made until the last possible day? If Senator Brandis says advising the ATO not to intervene in the case was an option he was considering, how long did he hold that view? What advice did Solicitor General Justin Gleeson give to Senator Brandis on the ATO intervening? Did Senator Brandis contest this advice? Why didn't Senator Brandis seek to correct the view of Western Australian ministers that they had a deal? I am not a lawyer—far from it. I am not the Attorney-General—far from it. I am not a QC—far from it. But I could have told them their deal would not last two minutes, because whenever there is liquidation the Australian Commonwealth through the ATO has the first chop at any liquidated proceeds. Attempting to pass some legislation in the state simply would not succeed unless there was a deal to say nothing, do nothing and hope that the Solicitor-General was a compliant person who would let this all go through to the keeper and no-one would know. But, as is always the case, as soon the deal was struck, other creditors immediately appealed to the High Court. So then the Attorney-General was in the box. He was the one who had to either stay shtum and hope the deal passed some way or other or just leave it to the court to rule it out and say, 'It's rubbish. It should never have been promulgated.'


When you think about it why is Western Australia so important? I do not count numbers in the Liberal Party. I have no idea of those. But I have heard people who are not members of the Labor Party say this. Whoever leads the Liberal Party cannot do so without the support of New South Wales and Western Australia.


Was there a deal? Was there a deal cooked up between two groups of people about achieving an outcome, where the Western Australian contingent were under increasing pressure from their own side? I think that Senator Smith did get up and advocate for a better deal for Western Australia. Not everybody in cabinet could do that though. But did Senator Cormann say, 'Don't you worry about that; I pull the strings in Western Australia. I will fix this'?


And maybe Senator Brandis is right: maybe there were Chinese Walls built around his office and his particular activities in this. He certainly has been very careful to try to demonstrate that he knew nothing about this dodgy deal, which basically looks like a politically expedient arrangement which probably carried through two prime ministers. It was probably done in the Abbott years and passed through to Mr Turnbull. And the one common denominator is Senator Cormann.


Senator Cormann has this amazing capacity to be part of every disaster—the 2014 budget; the cigar and the glass of wine; and the tune played—'Best Day of My Life'. He gets through that and still remains intact. Where is the Hon. Joe Hockey? He has been put out to pasture—very good pasture, in Washington. But that is where he is now; his career is finished. But Senator Cormann is still there, and he has this capacity to move through all of these disasters unscathed.


You can look at some of the things that come out of the Department of Finance which are not really contested in a lot of areas. We had his secretary, Jane Halton, come to the Public Works Committee and apologise because they omitted costings in a huge proposal. It does not stick on Senator Cormann. He is Mr Teflon over there, and you have to wonder why that is. Is it because he wields such incredible factional power?


The Liberal Party and the coalition are always on about factions in the Labor Party, and how there are factions about this and factions about that. Well, they are alive and well in Western Australia. They appear to have been on their way to doing a very good deal for Western Australia, to the detriment of the Australian Commonwealth and with the blind acquiescence of the Attorney-General—or he was too dumb to know what was going on. But the central player in it all, Senator Cormann, is not getting the opprobrium that he should get in this. I believe that he was misusing his position to the advantage of Western Australia.


You could argue that he is a senator for Western Australia and that he can do whatever he likes. But he should realise that the Commonwealth is the first creditor in liquidation, and that the ATO and the Australian people are entitled to get the first bite of any proceeds. To do anything other than that is pure stupidity and a misuse of his factional power.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-11-29,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:55):  This Bell issue all arose from those horrid days, decades ago now, but summarised by the term 'WA Inc.' Let me tell you what Wikipedia says about WA Inc.; I use Wikipedia because it has a fairly succinct description:


WA Inc was a political scandal in Western Australia. In the 1980s, the state government, which was led for much of the period by premier Brian Burke, engaged in business dealings with several prominent businessmen, including Alan Bond, Laurie Connell, Dallas Dempster, John Roberts, and Warren Anderson. These dealings resulted in a loss of public money, estimated at a minimum of $600 million and the insolvency of several large corporations.


Bond and Connell were major contributors to the party in government, the Australian Labor Party and its remarkable fundraising structure, the John Curtin Foundation.


During a royal commission set up to look into this scandal, Connell alleged that Hawke, the then Labor Prime Minister:


… dropped a proposed gold tax after Connell and various Perth high-flyers donated $250,000 each to Labor during an infamous lunch in Brian Burke's office in 1987 …


I could go on, but suffice it to say that Wikipedia also sets out very concisely that the Western Australian, Labor-led government:


… lent large sums of money, offered financial guarantees and acquired assets at inflated prices. Because of the connections between many of the deals and cross-ownership of businesses involved, it is difficult to say precisely where the government's fault started and ended. A minimum loss to the state of $600M has been reported.


And that is what Senator Back was talking about when he said that Western Australians are still paying for that criminal activity by the Labor Party back in the 1980s.


Now, fast forward, because this fixation by the Labor Party and the Greens in trying to attack Senator Brandis is quite comical, frankly. They have had one attempt at doing it; they set up this dodgy committee to inquire into some very administrative matters with the Solicitor-General. Now, the Solicitor-General was appointed by Labor in the dying days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. But Labor and the Greens in this chamber thought that here was a chance to destroy the Attorney-General.


So they had this wonderful inquiry—they had written the report before the inquiry started, that is how dodgy the inquiry was. It was a majority Labor-Greens thing, with four Labor, one Green and two government senators. So they set out to destroy Senator Brandis, the Attorney-General. But who did they end up destroying? Their mate the Solicitor-General, Justin Gleeson, who did the only thing possible—the right thing in the circumstances—and resigned. I am looking forward to this inquiry because I just wonder which Labor mate is going to get it in the neck as a result of this witch-hunt.


Senator Brandis is a very skilful politician. He is a brilliant lawyer and he is a very good Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Labor Party and the Greens hate him because they get nowhere in question time. Senator Brandis just flicks their attacks off as if they were flies landing on his forehead! And the Greens and Labor keep at it and at it to try to destroy the Attorney-General. They will not do it—I am giving them some advice now—but they will persist and they will end up destroying one of their own.


Do you know why I am looking forward to this inquiry? It is because we might just call Mr Bob Hawke, the former Labor Prime Minister. We might see if we can get Brian Burke, the former Labor Premier of Western Australia, who I think is probably out of jail by now. We might call him along. We might call some of the other Labor luminaries to the inquiry. I think Carmen Lawrence was mentioned. Peter Dowding was the Deputy Premier, was he not, and the successor to Brian Burke? And there was another Labor luminary involved in these things. This inquiry could be real fun, if we get all of these crooks, these criminals—some of whom have served time in jail—to come and give evidence to tell us what the Bell Group was all about. It was as a result of these dealings by the Western Australian Labor government, the Labor Party and these corrupt businessmen—some of them were found to be corrupt—that we have this situation where legal proceedings have been instituted for two decades now relating to the Bell Group shares which were purchased by the government from Robert Holmes a Court.


As my colleagues have explained, the Western Australian government tried to stop the professional litigators who bought into this deal from continuing to waste legal funds from the limited resources that were in the Bell Group that, if liquidated, could have been used to pay off some of the creditors, including the Commonwealth, the state government and many other creditors. But nobody was going to get anything, because these professional funders of litigation—how that all works is another story—did not want to settle. They did not want to come to any resolution, because their profit lies in keeping these court cases going and going forever until the money of the bankrupt company runs out. They get their money in legal fees and the creditors get nothing.


So what the Western Australian government tried to do was say: 'Let's stop this rort. Let's pass some legislation that will get the funds in Bell Group and distribute them fairly to those entitled.' In fact, the letter that Senator McKim talked about, dated 13 April 2015, from the Hon. Mike Nahan, the Treasurer of Western Australia at the time, said, 'Accordingly, the Western Australia government is planning to introduce legislation that will'—and this is the first dot point—'deliver a more rapid financial return to the Commonwealth, the state government and other creditors.' So, in the Western Australian Treasurer's letter, the Commonwealth was to be the first one to be paid. The second dot point says, 'Eliminate further speculation by professional litigation funders.' Then it goes on, 'Ensure no redistribution,' et cetera. There is something greatly conspiratorial about this letter, according to Senator McKim, but there it is. It is a public letter; you can see it. The Commonwealth was going to be the first favoured.


That letter was responded to by the then Commonwealth Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey. Where this great conspiracy comes from that Senator McKim and the Labor senators talked about, I do not quite know. Mr Hockey's response simply says, amongst other things: 


I trust the Western Australia government will therefore continue to engage in good faith in the forthcoming mediation processes.


Finally, he says:


Given the significant nature of the proposed course of action, I urge the Western Australia Government to ensure that the utmost probity is evidenced throughout the process so as to ensure that Australia remains and continue to be seen as an attractive destination for foreign investment.


So, regarding this inquiry, those letters are there. I cannot see how Labor and the Greens think they can in any way challenge Senator Brandis. They have asked him questions and wasted question time every day this week so far with ridiculous and repetitive questions, which have got them absolutely nowhere, and will continue to get them absolutely nowhere—because there was no deal. There was no conspiracy.


I have a photo of that lunch with then Labor Premier Brian Burke, then Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke and a few other very senior businessmen at the time of WA Inc. It would be lovely to get some of them before a Senate committee and find out what WA Inc. and the purchase of Bell Group shares were all about. This has been litigated before, as a result of various nefarious activities. Brian Burke, the former Labor Premier of Western Australia, ended up in jail. This inquiry could turn out to be quite fun.


But, as far as the substantive issue has gone, on Monday morning Senator Brandis voluntarily delivered a very, very lengthy statement to this chamber, in which he carefully and precisely went through all the issues concerning his involvement—which was pretty limited and occurred right towards the end. The statement clearly sets out the real facts. In those facts, there is nothing that really requires answering. Because Mr Justin Gleeson—who I mentioned previously in relation to another inquiry—was involved, suddenly the eyes of the Labor Party and the Greens lit up, and they thought: 'We lost that one. We facilitated poor old Justin Gleeson's resignation as the nation's Solicitor-General, but, hang on, he's mentioned in this. Perhaps we can redeem ourselves by having him somehow involved in a further attack on Senator Brandis on this occasion.' It did not work last time; it will not work the next time.


I just wish the Labor Party would use the remaining time of this parliament this year at question time to ask questions about education, about health, about infrastructure, about border security, stopping the boats—but we do not hear any of that. All we hear is this fixation with Senator Brandis, and they will continue with that. Eventually the penny will drop and the Labor Party will again end up with egg on their face. I am looking to seeing which Labor mate is destroyed by this Labor-Greens inquiry into the Bell Group shares issue when this next inquiry comes up. It is an inquiry in which, again, there will be four Labor-Greens senators and only two government senators, but I do not think it really matters because the facts will speak for themselves. It will get nowhere and, as I say, I am looking forward to seeing who is destroyed.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2016-11-29,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:08):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia I ask: what is a measly $300 million among friends? What is $300 million? The subtlety of the language betrays the core belief, and here it is: the government's willingness to enter into an arrangement to forgo $300 million in tax revenue in order to benefit their political allies. Senator Gallacher's stated belief is exposed in the use of the word 'forgo'. It is not the government's money by right, it is not tax revenue by right—that language simply reflects the government's air of entitlement, the Senate's air of entitlement. It reflects the air of entitlement of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. This is a betrayal of the underlying intent behind the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in governing this country for the last seven decades. It also brings to mind the corruption of language around tax. We have so-called savings measures that are really tax increases. This reminds us of Stalin's abuse of language and the marshalling of language as a force to suppress people. 


As I understand it, the government has three roles. They are to protect life, to protect property and to protect freedom. Yet it seems to me that the solution within the Labor and the Greens parties is to increase tax rates, and the solutions in the Liberal and National parties focus on cutting spending. So it is either cut spending or raise revenue. But there is a third alternative—lowering tax rates. That has been repeatedly proven successful, in Reagan's America, Thatcher's Britain and many other places throughout history. In fact, it was also proven successful in John F Kennedy's America, in the 1960s,


It is absurd and reckless spending that now drives government. There is no accountability in this chamber or in the House of Representatives, because we rarely see cost-benefit analyses on major spending items, let alone trivial spending items. Think of the national broadband network, the NBN—worked out on the back of a beer coaster in the middle of a flight by then Prime Minister Rudd and Minister Conroy—$50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion? How much? When will it end? We do not know. What will the service speed be? We do not know. There is no business case, and we see the frittering away of our money.


Then we think about climate policies, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation costing $10 billion—but none of the climate policies have a cost-benefit analysis, and these policies are costing tens of billions of dollars. It is not only the tens of billions of dollars spent, and wasted, but there is also disruption to industry and disruption to productivity, which ultimately costs everyone. We recently have seen the backpackers tax—and apparently someone on the staff of the Treasurer has said there was no cost-benefit analysis done. Now we have farmers being disrupted because of the threat of people not coming to Australia to pick their fruit. No cost-benefit analysis, and suddenly people are wondering why we are $356 million in debt. That is only 1,000 times $300 million—and what is $300 million among friends? Among friends, $300 million leads to a mentality that just wastes money, just fritters it away, with no accountability, and pretty soon that measly $300 million becomes $356 billion. That is our taxpayers' money.


Then we see our tax system based on raising revenue by cutting things like payrolls, things like employment—because we all know that when we tax something we cut its use. Payrolls are taxed—why? Employment is taxed through PAYE tax—why? The request from employees to have more money in take-home pay leads to very high gross income, which puts people out of work. So what is $300 million among friends? It is thousands of jobs and inefficiencies, and instead of people being servants of government we need to get back to governments serving people. Let us make Australia great again for everyone, with comprehensive tax reform. (Time expired)

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (17:13):  Three hundred million dollars of taxpayers' money matters in terms of how the money is spent and what is going on. There are so many unanswered questions—there is too much ducking for cover; too much ducking and weaving. Who is responsible; who is telling the truth and who is not? These are questions that the Australian public need answers to but we are not getting those answers. When we think about Western Australia we remember the almost 300 communities that were set for closure. People's lives in the remote areas of that state were being questioned—where they were going to go; how they were going to live—so, when we see cuts to services in the federal budget of nearly $500 million, of course we have to ask what is happening to $300 million.


It is all very well for ministers and members opposite to say that, in the statement by the Attorney-General, all questions have been answered. In fact, they have not been. The Attorney-General's statement has shown that there are so many more critical questions that need answering. What was the understanding between WA Treasurer Dr Mike Nahan and Mr Hockey over the federal government not intervening to challenge the legislation in the High Court? What has Mr Hockey said in recent days in response to what is going on here in the parliament? What role have other government officeholders played in this? Why did the federal Minister for Social Services go to see Senator Brandis about this matter in early March? What did the former WA Treasurer put to the Attorney-General about the issue? Remember we are still talking about taxpayers' money and the extent to which the Attorney-General was involved in legal proceedings designed to recover this money. These are very valid, critical, important questions not only to the Senate and not only to the parliament of Australia but to the Australian people. 


Why does the Attorney-General say that he only became involved when the former WA Treasurer, now Minister for Social Services, talked to him about it in March? This is despite the Attorney-General being represented in an earlier High Court hearing of the matter on 8 February. Was the Attorney-General somehow unaware of any of the facts in a High Court hearing where he was being represented? It is absolutely murky—totally murky. As the Senate, the house of review, we have to ask these questions. As uncomfortable as these questions may be to members opposite, to ministers in the Australian government and to ministers in the Western Australian government, they are questions that must be asked and must be answered. 


Previous speakers have spoken about the Labor Party's supposed fixation on this issue. Well, clearly we know that it is important. It is not comical to not know what is going on here. It is not comical to see a former Solicitor-General have to resign from his position when he stood for particular values of accountability, transparency and giving competent legal advice that was required in this situation. These are things that do need examination. To hear members opposite speak as though we on this side of the House have an obsession and to hear them belittle the importance of questioning these matters says a lot about the members opposite; it says a lot about the disrespect that they hold for the Australian people's money and the way it should be spent—especially when there are Australians out there who need resources and who need to know they are supported in infrastructure, health, education and housing. There are so many more questions to be asked. We will certainly keep the members opposite on their toes in regard to this issue.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-11-29,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:18):  I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on the indefinite detention of people with cognitive and psychiatric impairment, together with the Hansard record of the proceedings and documents presented to the committee. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is, in effect, a follow-up report to the report that the Community Affairs References Committee did last year that was tabled on 25 November 2015. That was the inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional settings. Out of that inquiry, we identified the issue of indefinite detention. In fact, we thought that the issue was so important that we asked for the issue to be referred to the committee for an inquiry in and of itself. 


The report that I have presented today is in two parts. The first part deals with people held in indefinite detention under forensic orders, which are criminal orders. Then there are those held via a civil route via a scheduled order under mental health, disability or guardianship frameworks. Yes, people can end up in what is basically indefinite detention via these civil routes as well. 


My comments right now are specifically directed at part 1 of the report, which applies to those held in indefinite detention under forensic order. Across our states and territories, people with cognitive and psychiatric impairments are being indefinitely detained in prison due to flawed legislation, lack of support or secure care accommodation, lack of services, and not being properly diagnosed. In some cases they are in fact spending more time in prison than if they had pleaded guilty and served a sentence in full. In some cases, people are being advised to plead guilty instead of unfit to plead, because if they plead guilty they will end up doing less time in prison than if they were found unfit to plead and held in indefinite detention. I might add there that they may plead guilty when they have not in fact committed a crime.


Worryingly, we have no consistent data in this space, and, as you will see in the report, some of the latest data we have for some states is from back in 2013-14 or even earlier. What we do know from the available information is that people who are held in indefinite detention in this manner are predominantly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and we had a number of examples of that.


The report touches on a wide range of issues, including legislative reform, the lack of forensic non-correctional or non-prison accommodation, the lack of supports and the lack of diagnosis. It is clear from this report and our inquiry that there are a range of urgent actions that are needed. We make 32 recommendations and reiterate a number of the recommendations from our previous inquiry, the inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional and residential settings. We reiterate them because, to date, we have had no response from the government to these imperative issues, even though the report was tabled just over a year ago. So we have reiterated a number of those recommendations, but we have also gone further and made a number of other recommendations.


For a start, we need to see legislative reform. At the moment, in some states, the judiciary has no alternative but to either put somebody with a cognitive or psychiatric impairment in prison or let them go into the community. There is no middle ground, as Chief Justice Wayne Martin said at our Perth hearing. I would suggest to anybody who wants a clear understanding very quickly of the issues in Western Australia—my home state, which I am very embarrassed to say has very poor legislation in this space—to read the Hansard of the Chief Justice's evidence to our inquiry. There are very limited options, other than holding people in indefinite detention. 


We received evidence around Mr Marlon Noble, whose case is now well known in Western Australia, who was held in indefinite detention for 10 years without being found guilty of a crime. He has now been released into the community but under very strict conditions, which the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disability have strongly criticised, recommending that the conditions on his release be removed. 


We did hear further evidence about this and in fact visited a number of correctional facilities where people are being held in indefinite detention. In Western Australia, we visited the newly established Bennett Brook Disability Justice Centre, which was very welcome, and we very much appreciated it. This is the first declared place in Western Australia where people can be released from prison into the centre and transitioned into the community. It has had limited use to date; I hope they make more use of it. But, as the Chief Justice in Western Australia explained, they cannot be sent there directly under Western Australian legislation.


We also received evidence and spent time in the Northern Territory and visited a number of facilities there, and I would like to thank the department for organising that for us in both WA and the Northern Territory.


We need to be looking at issues around better supply of accommodation so that there are alternatives to indefinite detention. We make recommendations about the need to implement a disability screening strategy so that all people who come into the criminal justice system are screened and diagnosed—and we need better diagnostic tools. In particular, we need to start using the better diagnostic tools that are coming out for people with FASD. We need to make sure, if people are entering prison but they have got through the system without having been screened or diagnosed, that they are screened as well. 


We particularly need culturally appropriate resources for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who are, as I said, the people who are predominantly subject to indefinite detention. We need to make sure that there are Aboriginal support workers and that Aboriginal-controlled organisations are involved in providing support and care for people under forensic orders.


I also urge people to read the recommendations in part B of our report, which relates to people who are held under involuntary orders. As I said, we received evidence, some very good evidence, that clearly points out that the system allows people to be held under what constitutes indefinite detention, and there are some changes that are needed there.


I take this opportunity to thank all of those who gave us a submission or oral evidence and participated in this inquiry. Without these people we would not have the knowledge that we have. We would not have heard about the lived experiences of people, from guardians and those who are affected to those who have been such strong advocates on behalf of those people caught up in indefinite detention. I know it is hard to believe that, in 2016, people are still being held in indefinite detention. 


I thank the secretariat of the Community Affairs References Committee, who go above and beyond the call of duty. I will be tabling two more reports tomorrow—so, over this time, we have completed three substantial inquiries, and they really have worked extremely hard. I also thank members of the committee, who have also worked extremely hard to get through these three reports, of which this is the first. As I said, I will be tabling two more tomorrow. 


I urge the government to read this report. Read it together with the committee's report on violence, neglect and abuse of people with disability. Implement these recommendations, or we will see no change in the terrible circumstances that Australians are finding themselves in—in indefinite detention and subject to abuse, violence and neglect.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (17:29):  I also rise to speak on the tabling of the committee report into the indefinite detention of people with cognitive and psychiatric impairment in Australia. This is the first major inquiry that has focused solely on the specific question of the indefinite detention of people with cognitive and psychiatric impairment. As Senator Siewert stated in her contribution, it arose out of a community affairs 2015 inquiry into the violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional and residential settings.


At its very core, this report provides us with an opportunity to consider and reflect upon the experiences of some of the most vulnerable people in our community. It has allowed us to look to the legislative environment, in which people with disabilities can be subject to misunderstanding and punitive detention. It has also allowed us to measure how our treatment of people with various and diverse cognitive and psychiatric impairments stacks up against Australia's human rights obligations.


The committee received 78 submissions and held six hearings across the country. Significantly, the committee also undertook a number of site visits to facilities and correctional facilities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The report is structured in two parts to adequately deal with the legislative provisions and processes that govern the pathway to indefinite detention in Australia. The indefinite imprisonment of Australian citizens is, and should always be, a last resort. Even where people have been declared mentally impaired or unfit to plead, it is vital that we have a system that strives to give all people a voice and representation in legal matters, because when we fail to give a voice to the most vulnerable people, we fail to build strong and fair communities.


A number of the committee recommendations reiterate the recommendations of the committee's 2015 inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional and residential settings. The key matters relating to the indefinite detention of people with cognitive and psychiatric impairments identified in that report remain the same and need to be acted on. As evidence put to the committee explained so well and so clearly, access to justice for people with a disability is more than simply providing a wheelchair ramp into a court room—it is so much more than that. It is about fully supporting a person with disability to appropriately engage with all aspects of the criminal justice system.


I am pleased to say that among the committee's recommendations is the call for each state and territory to implement a disability justice plan. It also recommends that COAG develop and implement a disability screening strategy, including hearing assessments for all Australian jurisdictions. This screening strategy would apply to all adults and minors who engage with the criminal justice system. If this recommendation were adopted, it would mean that the strategy would be applied at multiple points through the criminal justice system, such as a person's first contact with police, courts, prisons and related facilities.


In closing, I would also like to indicate that I am very pleased that one of the recommendations from the committee is that the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme look at an inquiry into the issue of eligibility and access to NDIS supports for people in prisons and in the criminal justice system more broadly.


I would also like to add my thanks to the secretariat, who work very hard on these inquires and who assist and support the committee so well. As Senator Siewert indicated, they have worked very, very hard over this last year, and, with their support, the committee has produced some very good reports. I look forward to the government response to this inquiry, and I also look forward, even though it has been a year coming, to the government's response into the committee's 2015 inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional and residential settings. I say to senators that this is an important report and they should all seek to have a look at the report and the recommendations that are before them today. I commend the report to this place, and I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (17:36):  Sorry about that, Senator Brown. Yes, I will make a very brief contribution on this committee report. Senators Brown and Siewert have gone over the content of the committee report in some detail. As a Tasmanian and a relatively new senator my insight and experience into the matters this committee inquired into were very limited. So participating in the work of this particular inquiry on the community affairs committee was eye opening, to say the very least. Getting out to communities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory was incredibly informing.


I concur with Senator Siewert in thanking those who made submissions to the inquiry, which made for some pretty weighty reading, I have to say. There are some pretty disturbing things covered, when you read the impact that this has on individuals and their families and, in many cases, entire communities. What was heartening, though, was the degree of compassion shown by many in the community—those who are genuinely trying to make a difference and who fronted up to our committee hearings and suggested ways forward and things which governments across the country could be doing to make the lot and lives of those who were subject to indefinite detention better. I do want to thank those who provided submissions and those who came and gave us oral evidence. I think there was a general agreement among the committee membership as to what needed to be done. Everyone seemed to be pulling in the same direction in suggesting the need for legislative reform as well as early intervention—trying to head these problems off at the pass, rather than allowing things to get to the point where the easiest thing to do is, sadly and to put it crudely, to lock people up and throw away the key. That is effectively what we saw happening in many instances.


We did tour some excellent facilities, and again I would like to thank the governments of the Northern Territory and Western Australia for opening their doors and giving us a very full and frank insight into how they operate, the problems they face and the support they need. I would also like to acknowledge the committee members, particularly the chair Senator Siewert for heading up this inquiry with such passion, but also Senators Dodson and McCarthy who have particular interests in how this impacts on their communities. I would like to thank them very much and, as others have before me, thank the secretariat for their incredible work in bringing this report to a conclusion and other reports to come. With that, I seek leave to continue my remarks.
