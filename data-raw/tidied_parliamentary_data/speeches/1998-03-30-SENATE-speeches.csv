"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 2, item 23, page 30 (table item 5), omit ""bubble jet"", substitute ""ink-jet"".
This is a very technical amendment. The amendment replaces the term `bubble jet' in the proposed subsection 91C(1) with the term `ink jet' in order to clarify the types of printers which will be considered as part 7A goods. Whilst the term `bubble jet' has become synonymous with the term `ink jet' in describing a type of printer that operates by a stream of ink being shot onto paper, it has been brought to the government's attention that the term `bubble jet' may be associated with one particular manufacturer.
The amendment merely clarifies that all types of printers which operate by a stream of ink will be part 7A goods.

The amendments concerned were foreshadowed in my speech during the second reading debate and they relate to the issues of whether we put a bias towards road or towards rail. The Senate will recall that in my speech I outlined the fact that in the last 15 to 20 years the expenditure by government on road has been of the order of $33 billion and the expenditure by government on rail has been of the order of less than $2 billion. In other words, road has been outspending rail by 18 times.
I also indicated, with quotes from Economist articles and other sources, that, worldwide, governments are becoming concerned that rail has been underspent and road overspent, and that the situation needs to be adjusted and amended. I indicated how productive rail is in that it holds a market share of approximately 40 per cent, despite the problems which I outlined.
Obviously expenditure on rail is occurring. Recently the Brisbane-Cairns line was improved and the consequence was a significant lift in productivity, performance and efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance costs. One of the things we have to be aware of with rail is that, because the lines are so savagely deteriorating, maintenance costs are currently running into several billion dollars—I think there is about $4 billion to $5 billion worth of maintenance costs around the country.
There are lines such as those between Sydney and Brisbane and Adelaide and Melbourne which, if improved, would radically improve the speed, efficiency and productivity of rail and would do a great deal of good to the country as a whole.
Accordingly, we have moved in these amendments to directly challenge the government's decision to apply far more discretion to road. We challenge that approach. We believe that the bias should be far more to rail because that is where the greater need is for Australia as a whole. We did, with regard to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996, successfully move changes to that bill to remove tax concessions for private urban road builders, so we have a long history of approaching these matters in this way. I would remind the committee that the 1995 private infrastructure task force report by EPAC very firmly stated that tax incentives were needed for rail, not road, and the Australian Business Monthly in a July 1994 article described toll roads as a licence to print money. It may be necessary to provide tax subsidies, we believe, to improve the viability of investment in rail, although the EPAC report did find that direct public investment in infrastructure was more cost-effective than public subsidies through tax concessions.
The problem for us is that the problems of rail are not as noted by consumers and by voters as are the problems of road. Road has a far higher political visibility than rail, yet we urge the government to consider the needs of rail ahead of roads. We do believe that the Australian rail industry remains hampered by a lack of infrastructure investment and a 
 playing field markedly cambered in favour of road. The federal government has promised to spend $250 million on the interstate rail network over the next four years. This compares with $4 billion to be spent by the federal and New South Wales governments on the Pacific Highway between Brisbane and Sydney. I should point out that the expenditure by the federal government does not commence until 1 July 1998. The national transport planning task force identified the following needs for rail corridors: Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane, $2 billion; Melbourne-Adelaide, $500 million; Adelaide-Perth, $300 million; and Brisbane-Cairns, which has been attended to somewhat, $400 million.
All over the world, railways are reviving, thanks to technology, deregulation and road congestion. Last year we dealt with the government's bill to change the way in which rail was dealt with in this country—who owned it, who managed it and so on—but that does not mean that government is able to withdraw from a serious consideration of the need for rail. We do know that technology is advancing in rail. New magnetically levitating trains can travel at up to 560 kilometres an hour, which makes them genuine competitors with air transport. Germany, for instance, is investing over $A7 billion on the Hamburg-Berlin route, with trains to travel at 400 kilometres an hour. Japan is likely to commit up to $A60 billion on a maglev track, as it is called—magnetically levitating track—between Tokyo and Osaka. Taiwan is pursuing the issue of high speed trains. Those examples demonstrate that around the world governments are recognising that rail can be appropriate technology and can out-compete road. It is the view of the Australian Democrats that those arguments are even more relevant for such a huge country—with such huge distances—as Australia. We think that rail investment in this country will produce a very favourable economic and social return.
In summary, the point we make is that rail is appropriate for extracted resources transport, intercapital freight and urban public transport. It can carry huge loads very efficiently, and investment in this area has immediate and very considerable productivity 
 improvements. Amendments Nos 1 to 14 have the effect of moving the emphasis from road to rail, and I hope that the committee will support them.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The Labor opposition will not—I might say through gritted teeth and regretfully—be supporting these amendments. I am not without a great deal of sympathy for what is being attempted here by the Australian Democrats. Let me explain that. The problem we have is that this is an omnibus taxation bill, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 . We have got two more such omnibus bills to go, at the very least. This bill is an example of the government amending very many parts of the tax act at once.
Our experience of this is that when we supported a similar amendment, moved by the Australian Democrats to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996, and dropped road from the provisions of that bill the government junked the entire bill at that time and delayed the impact of very many other desirable changes. We do not want to be in a situation where that occurs again, so we balance the support for the case put by the Australian Democrats against the importance in this bill of many other clauses which we think ought to proceed with due haste.
As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, changes are in some places over 18 months overdue. It took the government 18 months to enact changes in this bill which Labor was prepared to support which reflect major areas of tax avoidance and which in some cases have occasioned financial difficulties—if not financial loss—to particular companies in the computer field, particularly small business companies. So it is not that we are out of sympathy; it is that there are competing principles. On balance, the weight of the other competing principles against these amendments causes us not to favour the amendments for fear of losing the bill.
Let me say a few words, in almost a contradictory way, about why I think there is a 
 greater need to pay attention to some of the arguments put by the Australian Democrats. I was in Adelaide on the weekend. The traffic density on the main arterial roads in Adelaide is quite high compared to my home city of Perth and to other capital cities that I have been to in Australia. I think one of the reasons for that is that Adelaide is one of the few cities in Australia that does not have a developed rail network in its suburban areas—and it strives to be the Detroit of the Southern Hemisphere through the development of a car industry. As a consequence of having a fine set of heritage buildings, the chance to put a Los Angeles freeway system through Adelaide is reduced. As a consequence, traffic density is very high and the roads are clogged. This is a case where, sooner or later, there will have to be an underground rail system of some sort introduced into parts of Adelaide to relieve that congestion. This bill will of course help that.
The second comment I make is that in previous Labor legislation approval was provided for the City Link freeway development in Melbourne to go ahead. I was distressed to see at the weekend in, I think, the Melbourne Age or the Sun-Herald—it was one of the two major papers in Melbourne—that it will cost an ordinary Victorian commuter something like $37 a week or more simply to travel on the City Link development. For ordinary working people in Melbourne that is an extra cost, that they do not now have to bear, for a major project designed to create a monopoly in the car transport system because the state government in Victoria has blocked off the minor roads, forcing users onto the major arterial network—City Link—and requiring them to pay tolls on the freeway. Thirty-seven dollars a week is a fair cost imposition, particularly for medium to low income earners.
It is a cost which we know will not be the total end of it. We know it will not be the end of it because this government is committed to a GST, a goods and services tax. On top of the $37 to get on the freeway, you will have to pay whatever is the percentage of this government's goods and services tax. If it is 10 per cent, you will have to pay another 
 $3.70 to the federal government in order to use this service, taking your bill to over $40. If the goods and services tax is 15 per cent, the cost will be even higher. It is another example of slugging medium to low income earners through a goods and services tax even harder than higher income earners, who of course can afford these facilities.
With those remarks, let me come back to the point. While we do see considerable merit in what the Democrats are proposing, balanced against the overall objectives of this bill we think those objectives favour the urgent passage of this legislation without the game playing that we are now used to from the government of referring it back to the House, confronting the Senate with a trigger, and all the rest of the paraphernalia. We will support this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—I will make a couple of brief points before I deal with the specific issues which have been raised by Senator Murray. It was unfortunate that Senator Cook repeated that this bill had been delayed. If the bill has been delayed, it is a result of the delays imposed on it by Senator Cook and his colleagues.
—That is not true.
—Senator Ian Campbell went through in great detail, Senator Cook, the history of this. Senator Campbell said:
The history of this bill is that it was introduced last year.
He went on to say:
This bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. That committee delayed its reporting date twice—once from 25 November to 26 November and then further to 2 December.
So the bill was available a considerable time ago. Senator Campbell expressed in a very eloquent way how Senator Cook and his colleagues deal with bills that come before this chamber. If they wish to take up all the time, and they inevitably do on particular bills, then obviously the chamber does not have time to deal with the type of legislation we now have before us.
We have another example coming up today of a Senator Cook motion to delay another 
 tax bill, despite the fact that some of the key elements of that bill have already been to a Senate committee. Of all people, Senator Cook, you are the very last person who should be standing up and talking about bills being delayed when you have a motion on the Notice Paper today to delay another bill.
Senator Cook then went into a frolic over a variety of issues dealing with the tax system. Senator Cook, as I have said in this place before, is one of the few Australians who believes that we have a first-rate tax system. His colleague Mark Latham, at the weekend I think, blew the whistle on that particular position that Senator Cook adopts. He does not even have the support of at least some of his colleagues when he goes about making great claims about the current tax system.
Then Senator Cook decided to get into a discussion of a broad based indirect tax system. But of course he did not mention another key element which inevitably comes up on this issue: what happens to the personal income tax rates? The Prime Minister has made it very clear that the current taxes on income in this country are too high and the government will be looking at moves in this area, Senator Cook. So it is a pity that you relentlessly seek to play politics all the time. But, if you do, I suggest you do not quote selectively and, particularly, do not raise issues where your role and the roles of your colleagues are so inglorious in the delaying of legislation before this chamber.
Turning now to Senator Murray, he is proposing amendments to the bill which would withdraw the infrastructure rebate from investments in roads. Under the rebate scheme, only road and rail infrastructure may be approved. Because of budgetary constraints, priority was accorded by the government to upgrading road and rail infrastructure. There is some evidence, in our view, of underinvestment and misallocation of investment in road, particularly urban, and rail transport but of overinvestment in some other infrastructure areas, such as electricity supply. There are substantial community benefits associated with land transport infrastructure, 
 an area in which the government has traditionally been more involved.
Senator Murray quoted the EPAC task force on the so-called BOOT—build, own, operate and transfer—structures. EPAC said their view does not imply that BOOT type road projects are undesirable in all circumstances. The so-called BOOT approach may be warranted if, for example, there are short-term budgetary constraints preventing good projects proceeding in a timely fashion under public ownership. It may well be that some of the more recent road projects, such as the eastern distributor in Sydney, which Senator Cook did not refer to, or City Link in Melbourne, may not have proceeded in a timely fashion if they were publicly funded.
Arguments have been put forward that private sector involvement in the provision of roads does increase, it should be noted, efficiency; that it can lead to technological innovations, such as the use of transponders in the City Link project; that it results in better road investment decisions, and that it lowers costs. Ruling out roads from receiving any investment incentive simply adds further constraint in developing efficient roadworks. Senators need to be reminded that, in making a decision about which road project is selected to receive the tax offset, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is to take account of specific selection criteria. One of the criteria is the economic or social benefits or costs associated with the project.
For all these reasons, the government does not support ruling out private sector road projects from consideration under this scheme. All projects should be considered on a case by case basis taking into account the net benefits to the community from such projects receiving the tax offset. Allowing road projects to be evaluated does not rule out applications for rail projects. Each project would be considered on its merits against the relevant selection criteria contained in the bill. It would seem to be in the best interests of the public, or the best net benefit to the community, if such projects received the tax offset, so we will not be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Murray.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I regret that the minister has taken the approach that he has. I indicated in my remarks that I was supporting the government on these amendments, although I have considerable sympathy with the Australian Democrats' position upon them. I did set the record straight about the delay that has been occasioned by the government.
The minister, in his remarks just now, purported to argue there has been no delay on the government's behalf. I wonder, therefore, Minister, if you might confirm this for me: is it true that this legislation was announced in August 1996 as part of the 1996-97 budget? Secondly, given that it was announced then—as I am sure you will confirm; it is a matter of fact—when did the government introduce this legislation for consideration in the House of Representatives? Can you give me the date on which after the announcement you introduced the legislation in the other place?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—I ask senators to just bear with me while I am getting some material. While we are waiting for this interesting material, as I said, I note that Senator Cook does have on the Notice Paper  a motion to further delay the consideration of a tax bill. It seems to me that, if that is the approach Senator Cook is taking—and he is quite entitled to take that approach—it ill-behoves him to stand up and complain about delays in the Senate considering tax bills. Nonetheless, I am seeking some advice on the detail of the questions he has asked.
—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, the minister has just signalled to the chamber that he is waiting for advice on the very basic question of when the government moved a matter. I thought he would have had that information at his fingertips, but it obviously requires considerable consultation with his advisers. I wonder if, before you put the question, you might get from the minister the answer to my question.
—There was an announcement in August 1996 about the computers but I understand not about the other measures—I am receiving some nods from my advisers. I think details of the measures in this were foreshadowed on 14 February 1997. They were announced in the 1997 budget, introduced into the House on 23 October 1997 and then, as I mentioned, they went to a Senate committee, which did not seem to be able to come to grips with it and delays were involved there.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I just want to put the record straight. The government announced the computer fraud elements of this bill in its August budget of 1996-97. Fourteen months later, on 28 October, according to the report, it introduced that legislation in the House of Representatives.
When the government attacks me over delay, I think it ought to be mindful of the fact that the time between announcement and introduction of the computer fraud element of this bill is something that, Minister, if you had read our minority report in the Senate inquiry, you would see is the main concern of the Labor Party here. The government was 14 months late.
This bill was given immediate passage by the opposition in the House of Representatives. It came forthwith to the Senate. There was a Senate Economics Committee inquiry into this legislation. It involved many elements—there is avid interest in these matters. We have heard of an amendment today from the Australian Democrats, and there are other amendments on the list before us.
That report was concluded in quick time and delivered in November. We indicated to you in this chamber that we were prepared to give the bill passage in November last year. It is now March—nearly April. I just want to put those facts on the record, Minister, because you did challenge me about delay, and they are the facts of the circumstances. I think it is well therefore to have them on the record so that people can judge for themselves who is the agent of the delay. In short, it took you 14 months. Then you want to rush it through 
 here without proper opportunity for this chamber to examine the legislation and you accuse us of delay. I think that is frankly an argument you will be struggling to justify outside of this building.
The second matter that you raised concerned a notice on the Notice Paper for another bill—Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7), which is to come before us. Minister, perhaps you can confirm this: is it true that Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7), the bill which you say we are frustrating the passage of, has not yet been introduced into the House of Representatives—sorry, it has been introduced but not yet committed for debate in the House of Representatives? Let me be precise.
—Yes, you have corrected him there!
—Is it true that on Friday some 49 amendments were proposed to this bill but you want this chamber to deal with this bill immediately? Is that a true statement of fact, Minister? Can you confirm that or not?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—I am very glad that you were able to qualify the unqualified statement that you made in relation to the delay of this bill. You are now referring to a particular part of the bill, the computer section, and not to the overall thrust of the bill as it is now before the chamber that deals with the infrastructure issue and other issues. You have confined your broad sweeping comment now to the specific computer issue, which was not—I will check the Hansard —the impression you originally gave.
—It has been the major issue.
—There are a number of major issues in the bill, but certainly the major issue and the one which is taking up the time of the chamber is the infrastructure issue. That was announced and then there was extensive consultation with the industry to ensure that the final bill as drafted reflected those consultations. You did not quarrel with the fact that measures were announced in the budget last year—1997—and of course were introduced in October 1997. Your earlier 
 statement, even on the most generous interpretation, was an extreme exaggeration.
On the second issue, relating to the TLAB (No. 7), we can canvass all that this afternoon. I am glad your advisers corrected you and indicated that the bill has been introduced into the other place. As far as I am aware, it is due for debate this week, so it can be right for the Senate to consider the following week. As you are aware, with taxation bills there often are amendments because the bill has been out for a long time and views have been put forward to the government and to others about various aspects of the bill. The government is always responsive to community consultation. But of course you will be tested this afternoon. We will test your fine words that you have made when complaining about delays. You have raised the issue of delays. We will now test you when this motion comes up this afternoon.
I return to Senator Murray's matter. We have considered this issue carefully. We have listened, as we always do, Senator Murray, to your arguments. We find that we cannot support them. The government will be opposing the amendments that Senator Murray has put forward.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I am pleased that at last the minister has acknowledged that it was 14 months from the announcement in 1996-97 of the computer fraud matter before it was put into legislation and that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) that you are complaining about has not yet been debated in the House and you have 49 amendments to  it which were announced on Friday. You want to debate it this week or the next while this chamber has not had a chance to look at it. These are matters of procedure. I complain about them because in this particular case, the fraud matters did affect the operation of business and, in many cases, small business. I thought that was something the government was concerned about.
While I am on my feet, I should correct the minister. He has made a statement about what my views purport to be both in question time and now. I did not have the opportunity in 
 question time to correct him, but since he has made the statement about what my views are on tax matters in his contribution to this debate, it is an opportunity for me to correct him.
Minister, I do appreciate the way in which you heroically uphold the government, right or wrong, on tax matters. Obviously you are a soldier who does not concern himself with the issues but just with getting on with the job and arguing the case, whether it is a good, bad or indifferent one, and putting it in politically loaded terms. I do appreciate that that is how you see your role.
I do not appreciate, however, Minister—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—that you put words into my mouth that I have not uttered and then, on the basis of putting those words there, you construct a case which attacks the opposition. I do suggest that that is manipulative; that it is a political misuse of your position. It ought to be corrected. I have not said—and I repeat this—that we have a first-rate tax system in Australia.
I have often said that the tax system in Australia needs refurbishing from time to time; that it occasionally needs renovation; that as soon as tax law is made a major industry in Australia, committed to finding ways and loopholes through the tax legislation for tax avoidance, goes to work on what the legislation is, so that from time to time the parliament needs to squash tax avoidance by moving rapidly to cut off loopholes or technicalities it finds through the legislation. So, as far as taxation and the tax system is concerned, one ought to always be concerned to be across where tax leakage is occurring and move rapidly to close that off.
What I have said, for the record, is to reject the Treasurer's assertion that Australia has a second-class tax system. At taxpayers' expense, the Treasurer has published a pamphlet alleging that. You will recall, Minister, that in the Senate estimates hearings I asked a question of the leading tax expert of the Department of the Treasury—the chairman of your secret tax task force examining how to introduce a GST in this country—to name a country in the world that, if Australia had a second-class tax system, would be a first-class 
 tax system. You would recall as well that he declined to name any country at all and said that several countries had features of a first-class system but that no country had a system that he would regard overall as a first-class system.
It is true that the government is trying to create an artificial impression in the community that the Australian tax system is in crisis. It needs to do that in order to justify a GST. The Australian tax system needs improvement. `Crisis' is too dramatic a word. I think it is lamentable that the taxpayers have to foot the bill for this propaganda war that this government is conducting.
That is why I have drawn you up, Minister, on the question of the Treasurer's allegations about our tax system being second class. But it is not the case at all that I have said that it is a first-class system. Labor has many views about how the system could be improved to put it in the first-class category. Labor, after all, was the party of major tax reform in this country. We held a national tax summit in 1987. What flowed from that was major taxation reform in terms of fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and a number of other significant changes to the tax system. It remains a watershed for tax reform in this country—the most recent, far-reaching review of the system.
What we did not do was introduce a goods and services tax. Your criticism of us is that we should have, while we maintain that we should not have. Let the voters decide that matter when you have the courage of your convictions to outline to them what you propose a goods and services tax to be in Australia—something that you have thus far failed to do.
This is all a little aside from the point of the bill that is before the chamber. The reason I rise is that the minister is in the habit in this place of making glib, off-the-cuff arguments which, when one takes them carefully through the facts, do not stand up. This is another occasion of that. We can get on with this legislation if the minister wishes. But if he wants to indulge in this sort of crass soldiering on irrespective of the truth of the matter, then we will have an argument about the truth 
 of the matter and I will take the time of the chamber to carefully set the record straight.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—It would not surprise me at all if you seek to further delay the bill. I note your views that you are unhappy with my use of the expression that `you think we have a first-class system'. Then you vigorously attacked the Treasurer's view that we have a second-class tax system, and then you said that the Labor Party has a variety of views—I'll say!—to be put forward on how to make it a first-class system. If anyone wants to distinguish all of the inconsistencies in that I invite them to read the Hansard . The argument still rests. We will not be supporting Senator Murray's amendments.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—I move:
(15)	 Schedule 3, item 1, page 58 (after line 4), at the end of section 396-70, add:
		 (8)	 In making a decision under paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(b), the Minister for Transport and Regional Development must give preference to suitable rail projects before approving suitable road projects.
Before I move to the arguments that surround that amendment, I would like to draw the minister's attention to the fact that I did advise his office that I would have some questions to ask on small computer equipment vendors and tax-free sales accreditations. I think you have been given those questions. I would appreciate it if the Temporary Chairman was aware that later I will be asking those without relation to any amendment.
I will now move to amendment 15. When we talk about road versus rail, we as the Australian Democrats—and I am quite sure Labor in the sense of Senator Cook's responses—are not by any means talking about not spending any money on road. We are talking about using a limited tax incentive to maximum effect. It is our view that investment in rail delivers a far higher return—in the social, environmental and economic sense—than does investment in road.
If you look at the explanatory memorandum on page 66, it remarks that the cost to rev 
 enue of the rebate will be limited to $37½ million for the 1997-98 year and $75 million per annum thereafter. So, typically, in a three-year cycle of government, you are looking at the order of $220 million to $230 million worth of tax incentive, which is not inconsiderable. But the minister would be aware that that is far lower than the needs of either road or rail in this country. When you consider that the government always does have a limited ability to provide sufficient funds or a limited ability to provide sufficient tax incentives, we think the money should be spent where the return is greatest.
If we could regard items 1 to 14 moved earlier as prescriptive, the amendment 15 moved now is really an instruction or a recommendation to the minister to in all cases give preference to suitable rail projects before approving suitable road projects. In other words, we are saying the need is so great in rail that if the minister were to act under proposed section 396-70, on pages 57 and 58 of the bill—which is the method in which he should consider applications—and if equivalent rail projects and road projects were before him, we would prefer the bias to be towards rail. We think, as we have outlined in the second reading debate, and as I have mentioned earlier, there are very sound economic, social and environmental reasons for doing so and the returns in terms of productivity, efficiency and infrastructure or development would be much higher than if the equivalent expenditure were on road.
Whereas I could understand and react to Labor's rejection of our earlier amendments as being too prescriptive, I would hope that the advisory, recommendatory kind of instruction to the minister would in fact generate the support of the Senate. I do not think government is of the view that rail does not need investment. I do not think government is of the view that rail is not important. I do not think government is of the view that it should not encourage as much infrastructure development and rail as possible. Indeed we know that the Prime Minister specifically allocated $100 million to the proposed Adelaide-Darwin line. We do know that the government has made budgetary commitments in that area 
 although, as I say, the expenditure has not yet gone in the ground. What I would like though, minister, is for the government to recognise that, if it is to indicate a bias or a kind of preference or priority, it should in all cases of equivalent projects put rail before road. That is the nub of my argument to this amendment number 15 and I look forward, hopefully, to the support of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—Senator Murray said initially that he had provided my office with a number of questions which he wishes to raise in relation to computer fraud. I have confirmed that we have those questions and we will be providing responses to you, Senator Murray. We think it is better, to be quite frank, to deal with projects on a case by case basis, according to the economic and social benefits and other criteria.
Preferring rail is likely to eliminate road altogether. I do not know whether that is what you intended, but that would be the effect, I think, given that the revenue cost of this scheme is to be strictly limited. I think in the second reading debate we have canvassed this particular aspect of the scheme. We believe, just to repeat myself, that all projects should be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the net benefits to the community of the projects receiving the tax offset.
It should be stressed, of course, that allowing road projects to be evaluated does not rule out applications for rail projects or vice versa. Each project should be considered on its merits and it would seem to us that the best bottom line is that the project with the greatest net benefit to the community should be receiving the tax offset. So we will not be supporting the amendment that you have moved, Senator Murray.
Amendment not agreed to.
—Senator Murray, if you want to obtain the answers it would be appropriate to deal with your questions now.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—I will lead in with some brief remarks. The Australian Democrats have supported the government's intention to 
 eradicate loopholes which have provided some companies with an unfair advantage in selling computers on the basis of fraudulent quotation of a sales tax registration number or exemption declarations. The Australian Democrats, however, have received a number of representations from small computer operators regarding the implementation of this measure—and we would expect the concerns to be well known to the government. These relate to uncertainties relating to the costing difficulties of gaining accreditation from the Australian Taxation Office as a bona fide vendor of sales tax exempt computer equipment.
Proposed section 91K of the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  allows the Taxation Commissioner discretion to refuse accreditation to a vendor on the following basis:
the Commissioner has reasonable grounds for believing that sales tax will not be, or is unlikely to be, paid . . . by the person.
Accordingly, I have asked the Assistant Treasurer to demonstrate: first, that these measures have been implemented or will be implemented in a way that will not curtail growth of important, legitimate Australian industry, namely that of small computer equipment vendors; secondly, that the new scheme will minimise compliance costs to a level that is a reasonable impost on small business operators; and, thirdly, that the scheme will adequately protect the interests of small operators in relation to assessment of their applications by the Taxation Commissioner.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—Senator, in relation to the earlier matter you raised with me on rail, it is worth recording in the Hansard  that the government has approved $100 million for the Darwin to Alice Springs line, plus $65 million for Brisbane's light rail. I think they are under the Federation Fund. Also, I am advised that some $250 million has been approved for rail track upgrades. Those figures alone show that the government is giving some emphasis to rail issues, which you are concerned about. I am going to your questions now.
—Minister, you will be aware that I quoted those figures for you, so I will not give you the appropriate credit.
—Thank you, Senator Murray. When you give us credit for things, we always greatly appreciate it. Senator Murray raised a number of questions. The first is whether these measures will be implemented in a way that will not curtail growth of small computer equipment vendors provided they are complying with their tax obligations and taking some elementary precautions. Small business argue that they could not absorb the competitive disadvantage resulting from tax evasion and that tax evasion threatened their continued capacity to trade as a business. Therefore, any measures which reduce the extent of tax evasion improve the conditions for small business.
I have received a number of visits from people in the computer area who rigorously comply with their tax obligations and who were outraged at some of the cheating and fraud that other people less scrupulous were conducting in this area. They raised that very important point: it is exceedingly hard for them to compete when others are not complying with taxation laws. These measures have been designed to minimise the impact on complying taxpayers and their customers. The new accreditation system does not generally apply to many small retail businesses. Provided they are careful about the suppliers they deal with and do not knowingly take advantage of evasion, the impact there will be small.
As for wholesalers and importers, small businesses will have to be accredited if they want to buy or import goods tax free. They can take advantage of e-forms and the Internet to streamline the application process. I am advised that Customs will adapt their computer system to incorporate the authorisation requirement.
The second issue was whether the new scheme will minimise compliance costs to a level that is a reasonable impost on small business operators. The general comment stands as I made it in answer to the first question—that is, people who are complying with the law are going to find it exceedingly 
 difficult to compete with those who are not complying. However, as to the second point, the government acknowledges that compliance costs will be increased to a certain extent by the new legislation. But this is unavoidable. I think members of the industry have said that the increase in compliance costs is outweighed by the fact that evasion will be curtailed. 
The third question is whether the scheme will adequately protect the interests of small operators in relation to the assessment of their application for accreditation. A person will be accredited if that person meets the conditions for accreditation set out under the law. The commissioner will be able to exempt certain people from some of the conditions—for example, exempt new businesses from the conditions that certain records have to be maintained for a period of three years. There is a high degree of logic in that position.
If the applicant meets the required conditions, the commissioner is obliged to accredit the applicant unless he exercises his discretion under proposed section 91K. The commissioner may refuse accreditation under proposed section 91K only if the commissioner has reasonable grounds for believing that tax is unlikely to be paid on the goods that the person is dealing with or the application for accreditation is false or misleading and the commissioner believes that to refuse accreditation would advance the anti-evasion purpose of these measures. Those deal with the issues that were raised by Senator Murray.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,—I thank the minister for his response.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—In my remarks I said that the government acknowledges that the compliance costs will be increased to a certain extent by the new legislation.
—Are they significant?
—I do not know whether we have any figures we are able to share with you, but I will check. There will be a one-off 
 start-up cost with regard to accreditation, but recurrent costs are not expected to be high. Administration will rely heavily on modern technology—as you would expect in the computer industry—such as e-forms and the Internet. There will be an extensive public education campaign, a number of ATO publications and a hotline for inquiries to help taxpayers prepare for the introduction of the new scheme.
The accreditation process will not be any more difficult for eligible small businesses than it is for other businesses. In some cases, it will be a lot easier for there is less information to collate. The new reporting requirement should involve only information which taxpayers already collect for their own purposes. This government is very sensitive to those issues of compliance costs. In all areas, we try to have compliance costs minimised.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-30,"—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 4, item 1, page 68 (lines 6 to 8), omit the item, substitute:
1A  Section 51-10 (table item 2.2, column headed "". . . the following amounts are exempt from income tax:"")
Repeal the cell, substitute:
	 payments, other than payments on completion, under the CRAFT Scheme (the Commonwealth, Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training Scheme) or other Commonwealth incentive schemes for employees taking on apprentices
I have outlined the rationale for moving this and the amendment that follows in the second reading debate and will briefly acknowledge the minister's comments. Of course, we will give credit where credit is due, as always, but we are also going to give the government the blame when it does something wrong. The Australian Democrats are quite disappointed with one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 , which is before us, which proposes to eliminate the tax exempt status of payments under the CRAFT scheme—the Commonwealth rebate for apprentices in full-time training. So the amendments that I move seek to stop that happening. 
As members of the chamber would be aware, employers currently receive $2,500 tax free for taking on new full-time apprentices under the particular CRAFT scheme. However, the budget announcements last year meant that this incentive would be made taxable, with a further payment of $1,500 being made available upon completion of the apprenticeship, which would be some three to four years later.
I have outlined in more detail the effects upon small, medium and larger businesses in my speech in the second reading debate. But, just briefly: for an unincorporated small business, the effect of these measures is to reduce the commencement and the progression incentives by about $1,200 after tax; even after receiving the final payment, a small business would be roughly $427 worse off. Incorporated businesses lose $900 after tax on commencement and progression incentives, with the difference only being made up with the final payment when the apprenticeship is completed.
Before the minister suggests that the government is, on the one hand, taking away this tax exempt status and that it is actually giving other incentives in the form of, I think, $52 million worth, I should point out for the record that there is a substantial gap between what is being saved and, according to the budget estimates, this measure—or the abolition of the CRAFT rebate, as such—will save around $135 million. But the extra incentives, the replacements that are being proposed by the government, only amount to around $52 million.
So, clearly, there is quite a sizeable or substantial gap of around $83 million there over the next three years. We are not quite sure what the approximate value is in that particular move by the government. So we hope that we will receive the support of others in the chamber to stop the government from making this change.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I look with considerable interest at this Democrat amendment. The opposition had the view that what was said in tax paper No. 2 was what the government 
 meant and, therefore, are inclined not to support the amendment. But Senator Stott Despoja has raised an issue that has attracted our attention as well in the remarks she has just made.
Through you, Mr Chairman: Mr Assistant Treasurer, I have in front of me Budget Measures 1997-98, budget paper No. 2. This is one of the papers circulated by the Treasurer for the budget. On page 169, under the heading `Conversion of the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice full-time training'—that is CRAFT—`tax expenditure to outlays', there is a table setting out the financial implications in millions of dollars. On that table, it says: for 1998-99, the saving is $35 million; for 1999-2000, $45 million; and the year 2000-2001, $55 million. That is my understanding of what the government said was the saving.
But when I turn to page 41 of budget paper No. 2, there is the heading `Employment, education, training and youth affairs, changes to entry level training employer incentives'—I appreciate that this is not like with like—and it seems that the offsetting payments are rolled in with other payments here. So one cannot get a clear idea from looking at the published statistics what we are talking about, and that creates a problem with interpretation.
But the outlays are nowhere near the savings that you achieve. Let me go to the relevant figures. On the table on page 41, `Financial implications millions of dollars': 1998-99, $6.4 million, and I remind you that the saving was $35 million; 1999-2000, $16.2 million, the saving being $45 million; and the year 2000-2001, $29.5 million, the saving being $55 million.
Mr Minister, I wonder whether you could explain to us what the reason is for this discrepancy; and how is it that there is a neutral result here? My understanding of what the government has said is that they intended a neutral result. What causes me to be anxious about these figures is not only that they do not match with the savings but as well we are talking about other things, it would seem to me, because of the way in which you have described the outlays, and then the CRAFT tax expenditure.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—There are a number of issues which have been put on the table by Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Cook, and let me go through those matters. I think Senator Stott Despoja raised the question: will employers be worse off? I think you were saying that employers would be worse off with the result of the removal of the exemption.
Let me make it clear that this government measure is designed to make taxable employers no worse off. Let me explain: prior to the 1997-98 budget, employers of apprentices received $2,500 in incentives, comprised of a $1,250 commencement payment and a $1,250 progression payment. Under the CRAFT system, these incentives were not taxable; the employer retained the full $2,500.
Changes in last year's budget increased the level of incentives to employers of apprentices to $4,000, comprising $1,250 on commencement, $1,250 for progression, and $1,500 on completion. With the removal of the CRAFT exemption from 1 January 1998, and subjecting the amount to tax at the company rate of 36 per cent, employers will continue to receive, after tax, an amount in the order of $2,500. To put it another way: the additional $1,500 completion payment will almost be entirely recouped through tax payable, which I am advised is $540, on this extra amount, and tax payable, $900, on the previously exempt $2,500 incentive payments.
On the advice that I have, Senator Stott Despoja, on this basis, employers will be marginally better off to the tune of $60 after the removal of the CRAFT exemption. That is the advice I have received. Senator Cook said he was not sure whether he was comparing apples with apples but there are some tables there which he wanted me to look at and to deal with. I think that the answer I have covers that.
Senator Stott Despoja raised an $83 million difference and I understand this is arrived at by comparing the total of the financial implications for the conversion of CRAFT tax expenditure to outlays of $135 million, which is on page 169 of budget paper No. 2, and the total of the financial implications of changes 
 to entry level training employer incentives of $51.2 million, which is on page 41 of budget paper No. 2. However, the change to the entry level training employer incentives is a package of which the conversion of CRAFT to an outlay is only a component. Other components of the changes to entry level training employer incentives include—and I list these: converting the CRAFT incentive into an outlay, retaining the existing payment regime, abolition of the $250 additionality payment, abolition of the AQF 2 progression payment, reinstatement of large employer eligibility for the ELT incentive payments, a $1,500 AQF 3 completion payment and an increase in the AQF 3 recommencement payment.
As the financial impact of these change to the entry level training employer incentives incorporates these other measures, it is not appropriate to compare the financial impact of the conversion of the CRAFT exemption to an outlay. In the government's view, the CRAFT exemption is designed to make employers no worse off. I have been through those figures before so I will not repeat them.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-30,"—I thank the minister for his figures and for his response but there are just a couple of points I would like to clarify. I take on board your suggestion that the approximate value is made up within, presumably, three to four years for, say, a larger business. I am wondering if the government believes that this is providing an incentive to businesses, knowing that they may be potentially worse off or, if they do get that approximate value, that they have to wait three or possibly four years before they get it. Do you honestly think that is an incentive to businesses to take on apprentices?
In relation to the approximate value, specifically in relation to larger businesses, I am prepared to take your argument but I still think there is a significant time delay that would act as a sufficient disincentive to companies to take on apprentices. In relation to small businesses, I would like to clarify the government's stance as to whether or not you honestly believe, and if your figures actually show, that these smaller businesses—and I am 
 not quite sure of your actual words—would be marginally better off.
I am also wondering if your advisers have looked at the statistics I made available in the second reading debate. The estimates that I have are for smaller businesses, the vast number of which are unincorporated. For these businesses the after tax value of early payments would be reduced from $2,500 to $1,288, a drop of more than $1,200. Three to four years later the after tax value of the final payment would be a further $773, but they would still be worse off to the tune of around $427 over the life of the apprenticeship.
I take on board your comments about the various tax incentives being different pieces or components fitting together but I think that would go some way towards explaining the figures and the savings that the government expects to make—an $83 million saving—as  a  consequence  as  a  number  of  smaller businesses being worse off. Do you stand by your comments, Minister, that smaller businesses would be marginally better off under this scheme?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—The measure is not to provide an incentive because essentially it is to leave people in the same position. The measure is designed to get better transparency into what is being done here. The government, in a number of areas, has seen it appropriate to transfer elements to an outlays side and this is what we have done.
The advice I have is that people will be marginally better off—that is, $60 better off—after removal of the CRAFT exemption. I am not sure whether I can provide any further information to you but I see that one of my advisers is writing frantically and we will see what transpires.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—While that is happening and while we have a hiatus, I follow the argument that is being put by Senator Stott Despoja. If I can put it in a slightly different way, it seems to me that if one compares the money values then you can argue the case the government is putting, but if you take into account the time value of money then you can 
 argue the case the Democrats are putting. If you are a business the time value of money is quite a significant factor, so the bottom line outcome of when you actually get paid is quite important if you have to wait until the end of the program to get reimbursed. As a small business you will have carried all your overheads all the way through and the high cost of overheads is what kills small business. If you were reimbursed through the tax system all the way through then you would be able to accommodate the costs of managing an apprentice. My question, which you might care to embrace in your answer, Minister, is: when you assure us that people will be better off or neutral, does that take into account the time value of the money that is the reimbursement as opposed to a tax deduction?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—The advice I have received is that the measure is to be broadly the same over the medium term. It does provide a higher value on the completion aspect, which is a plus for this particular scheme. As I said, the measure is to be broadly the same over the medium term based on certain assumptions. For example, with company tax rates it is not possible to consider the balance between employers on different tax rates and regimes. My advice is that people on lower than company rate will be better off.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-30,"—I wish again to make the point that I do not think that the three- or four-year time delay that it would take larger businesses to achieve the approximate value to which the government has referred in its papers counts as an incentive. Incentive and transparency are not two mutually exclusive concepts. The Democrats are all for transparency but we also recognise that this scheme has been established as an incentive scheme for employers to take on apprentices, so that is why we seek to retain it in its original form.
As I said in the second reading debate, this is not the time to be cutting trainee or apprenticeship numbers. We have had a dramatic decline in the number of apprenticeship starts and, for that reason, I would think that the 
 government would seek to provide more incentives to smaller and larger businesses to take on apprentices and trainees. I do not think that cutting the amount available to them in benefits or even giving them the approximate value after three to four years time is sufficient incentive to ensure that our work force is trained.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The opposition is disposed to vote with the government on this matter, although we are mindful of the arguments being put by the Democrats. Minister, you have assured the chamber that people will not be worse off; in fact, you have argued just now that in some cases people will be better off. If this measure is carried and individuals can come forward and demonstrate that they are in fact worse off, will the government be prepared to look at this again and correct it so that it is at least neutral?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—The government is always prepared to look at measures to further improve the application of legislation. As I said, the advice which I have received and relayed to the chamber is pretty clear but, if people wish to point out other problems, this is a government which consults and listens.
—So that is a yes.

This amendment relates to the definition of independence and dependant people. I acknowledge Senator Cook's comment earlier in the debate that this is an omnibus bill and, for that reason, the Democrats see this as a rare opportunity to counteract some of the policies put forward by this government which we consider to be anti-employment, anti-unemployed people, anti-family and anti-young people.
Senators would be aware of the mooted changes in law, as a consequence of the common youth allowance debate, that define independence in relation to unemployment benefits for a young person at the age of 21 and for a young person engaged in full-time educational training. A student is deemed independent—that is, no longer dependent upon their parents—at the age of 25. The Democrats have put on record a number of times that we believe these concocted ages of independence are a sham and that there are not only very good economic and social reasons behind having fairer and younger ages of independence for the purposes of certain benefits; there is also a legislative imperative, and that is that there are a number of laws that define independence in many different ways. As I have said on record, the child support scheme and the family tax initiative are different from the proposed common youth allowance definitions as to the age at which someone becomes independent.
During the debate on the common youth allowance, there was a lot of discussion about the adverse impact the government's common youth allowance changes would have on young unemployed people and their families, and Senator Harradine was particularly concerned. I think around 46,000—certainly tens of thousands—of Australian families would 
 suffer as a result of the changes to independence and a parental means test that kicks in extremely early, at around $23,400 per annum. In order to secure Senator Harradine's support, he and the government decided that this should be a topic for discussion in the context of taxation reform. The Democrats today, with this amendment, are merely kicking off the taxation reform opportunities for the government—
—Ha, ha!
—Minister, taxation reform is a very serious topic. We are looking at it from the perspective of providing fairer measures for those families who are going to be significantly adversely affected by the changes in the common youth allowance legislation. I mentioned around 46,000 families who would have their benefits cut or, in some cases, cut out, and I mentioned the rather strict parental means test. By no means are these the only problems that we had with that legislation. We seek to standardise the ages of independence and to ensure that those people and their families who will be affected by the increased ages of independence—21 for unemployed and 25 for students—will have the family tax rebate extended to them until they meet the criteria of the common youth allowance.
We think it is a fair measure to ensure that Australian families—particularly young unemployed people and their families—are not hit hard by the recent measures. We look forward to Senator Harradine's support, because at this stage we do not know of any specific guarantees or discussions between the government and Senator Harradine as to how they are going to ensure that your idea of taxation reform will actually assist those families who will be struggling not only as a 
 consequence of the changes through the common youth allowance legislation but as a result of a previous budget measure which, because of the change in the age of independence, denied around 8,000 students and their families access to Austudy.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-30,"—I think it was conceded halfway through Senator Stott Despoja's remarks that she saw this as one way—to quote her phrase—of kicking off the tax reform debate. The obverse of that is that it does not have anything to do with this bill. We understand that Senator Stott Despoja is taking every opportunity to make her point. That is the very nature of politics and we do not complain about that. But I do bring to the chamber's attention that this does not have anything to do with the bill which is before the chamber and is a wider issue which Senator Stott Despoja alluded to. Equally, I make the point that no-one need have any doubt about this government's commitment to families and the strong commitment it has made in difficult budgetary circumstances to increase the funds available to families. So on that general issue, Senator Stott Despoja, you should have no doubt at all about the government's intentions.
I think Senator Stott Despoja is seeking to change the definition of a dependent child for working out the family tax payment under the social security law. As far as this tax law goes, the government is embarking on a major tax reform program, which was alluded to by Senator Stott Despoja. Let me assure you, Senator Stott Despoja, that the way families are treated under tax law will form an important part of the government's considerations in putting together its tax reform proposals.

During the debate on the common youth allowance it was certainly suggested to Senator Harradine that the government would look into these issues in the future. The Greens (WA) do not think that you can 
 entirely replace something like a common youth allowance with a tax deduction. We were dealing with families with such small incomes, who do not necessarily pay huge amounts of tax, having allowances for unemployed young people taken off them. However, we do support this amendment because it helps alleviate the situation for those particular families.
The government said ad nauseam during that debate that there were some winners and that, somehow or other, that made the people who were worse off feel better. I did not actually think they would. Therefore, I indicate that the Greens (WA) will support Senator Stott Despoja's amendment to extend the family tax rebate to families denied common youth allowance and who, as a result of changes, have additional dependent adult children whether they or their children like it or not.
This amendment, of course, is a direct response to the reasons Senator Harradine compromised and allowed the common youth allowance to go through largely in the form that the government was presenting it—that is, on the assurance that those families would receive tax assistance. We would like to be helpful. We would like to be given a model of how this might be done; if you were going to do it. It still does not actually help those people who hardly pay tax, because you start taking money off them from a very low rate. But it is somewhere along the lines of what is required, so we will support it.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—This is an inspired amendment. I think Senator Stott Despoja is dead right in what she has said; and it does fly in the face of all the heroic words that the government has uttered about family friendly tax packages and things of that nature. Senator Stott Despoja's amendment would, if you like, address a social welfare problem through the tax system. There is nothing wrong with doing that; in fact, that is one of the things that you might do with the tax system. She said that this is an opportunity for the government to grasp the nettle and kick off the tax reform debate in Australia.
I have to say to Senator Stott Despoja, that that is the last thing the government wants to happen. It does not want a fair dinkum tax debate in this country. It wants to do as it is doing and keep its proposals for a GST under wraps, chaired by a secret committee hidden in the bowels of Treasury which keeps no minutes, commissions no papers and issues no reports. It wants to do that with a militant desire to ambush the Australian electorate with a GST package that, on the eve of an election, they will say that they have no choice but to swallow. That is what it wants to do, so I doubt that there will be any government enthusiasm to kick off an open, transparent, all-the-facts-on-the-table debate about tax reform in this nation. There is no desire on the government's part for that at all; quite the reverse is the truth.
Those of us who have sat on the Senate estimates committee, on the Economics Legislation Committee, through the hours and hours of examination of the government about what they are doing on tax, whether they will release any papers and whether they will enable people to see what the figures are, and been met with a blank wall, only have bitter memories that the government has no desire whatsoever to get anything like impartial consideration of the issues for electors into the public domain.
That leaves me to say what the opposition's position is. I do take this amendment as a constructive proposal to right a wrong. In this omnibus bill, I have to balance that against our desire to get the bill through forthwith because it does address a major question of tax avoidance. I have knocked back other amendments earlier on the grounds that there is merit in those amendments but the overwhelming principle is to address the avoidance question. I will take that same view now, but say that we will support this matter being referred to a Senate committee so that we can open up that debate to which you refer. Let's get into it. Let's have a proper debate into tax reform in Australia through a Senate structured inquiry.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-30,"—I thank Senator 
 Cook for at least being inspired by the amendment, if not supporting it. I say again to the government that this is an interim measure. It extends the basic family tax rebate to all families deemed to have additional dependent children as a result of the youth allowance. It is a fair measure and it gives the government an opportunity to prove that they really do care about families, as the minister stated. I look forward to the government perhaps showing its support for families by supporting the amendment.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) to questions without notice asked today, relating to the proposed privatisation of Telstra.
In moving this motion, I want to further refresh the minister's memory on the answer he gave today to Senator Lees's question, in relation to signing a declaration in December of last year, when he said:
I do not think I signed anything in relation to Optus and Vodafone. I may well have been consulted by the Treasurer. You may be right. Maybe I signed it. I thought it was the Treasurer—
He went on to say, `But you may be right, maybe I did.' I can assure the minister that he did sign the document on 9 December to allow Optus and Vodafone to go to 100 per cent.
So, again, this minister—who just blithely makes comments off the cuff, off the top of his head on an important issue—could not remember signing a document, a declaration, on 9 December, which significantly was to allow Optus and Vodafone to become fully 100 per cent foreign owned. Again, this is just more testimony to the confused state of this minister in areas of policy dealing with Telstra.
Today we raised questions about what other ministerial colleagues of his were saying. I raised one question about what Mr Fahey said yesterday. I quote Mr Fahey from an interview he had yesterday morning on the Seven Network. He said:
I think it's fair to say the Government isn't happy with that level of service, and we'll be doing something about that with the legislation that will go into Parliament this week.
That is clear; that is unequivocal. The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has said that the government is not happy with the level of service that Telstra is presently providing. Senator Alston gets up here today and says, `I don't know what Mr Fahey is talking about; it's nothing to do with me.' Yet the 
 Minister for Finance, a senior cabinet minister, makes it clear that he is not satisfied with the level of service that Telstra is providing.
What has this minister—the minister who has the power to direct—been doing in the last two years to get the services in the bush up to equal standard with those in the city? Mr Fahey clearly does not agree with the performance of Senator Alston.
Then we have the remarks yesterday of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Senator Alston was completely dismissive of Mr Fischer, who is No. 2 in the Australian government, the Leader of the National Party. Senator Alston just completely ignored Mr Fischer's comments. I again refresh the Senator Alston. Mr Fischer said:
Within 90 days I am determined to see that the technology in the country is not equal, but in some areas better than the suburbs, after all the disadvantage we've had over the years . . . 
I just asked for a simple explanation: can the minister tells us what technology the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia was talking about?
Mr Fischer makes a whole range of comments about services in the bush. He also raises the prospect that we are going to bring in the low earth orbiting satellite system. Has the minister got a policy on that? Has the government got a policy on that? Is that Telstra investing in satellites?
—Have you? Have you got one?
—You are the government, Minister. Your Deputy Prime Minister is saying this. We have no answer from the government, except that Mr Fischer seems to babble on whenever he gets onto television.
We have another quote from Mr Fischer yesterday. He said:
Because we're in a competitive circumstance and there is the authorities which overarch the compliance of an Optus, of a Telstra, to a legal benchmarking. There's also an ombudsman which . . . an ombudsman with teeth. But we'll do something else. We'll actually pay dollars . . . 
The confused statement that Mr Fischer made about regulation does not give confidence that this government really knows what regula 
 tions it has put into place and about how it is going to ensure that ordinary Australians in rural and regional Australia get the same level of service.
Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate and, I have to say, the most consistent critic of this government's privatisation policy on Telstra, out of his loyalty to the coalition does not always say on the public record what he thinks, but he did today. He said in an interview:
And we'll also want the latest technology guarantees for people in the bush, too.
Well, Minister, what we want to put to you is: how will you put the latest technology guarantees for the people in the bush into the legislation? We certainly accept, under the community service obligation, the standard telephoner's guarantee. Are you going to put in the CSO guarantees for on-line services, broadband services, the Internet and the latest technology that Senator Boswell is raising in his interview today? These are questions this minister and this government cannot answer when they are trying to privatise Telstra.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-03-30,"—A tragic attempt to make up for the comprehensive bungling of a question. What Senator Schacht just read out was Mr Fahey saying the government was not happy with Telstra's quality of service. That is a statement with which I would agree and that is why we held a press conference this morning.
—What have you done about it? You've had two years as minister.
—You asked me to agree with a proposition that Mr Fahey had been critical of me. Mr Fahey was critical of Telstra.
—You're the minister in charge of the service.
—No, you cannot use words in the way you would like them to come out. If people use them in a particular way and say that they are not happy with Telstra you do not have the right to get up 
 there and say that they are saying they are unhappy with someone else.
—Slippery Richard again.
—Rabbit on as much as you like. I was not dismissive of Mr Fischer. Indeed, Mr Fischer is doing an absolutely sensational job. Mr Fischer was simply concerned to ensure that the bush does not go backwards as it did for 13 long Labor years. You can understand them wanting to know what would happen if a Labor government ever got re-elected because they have had absolutely no assurances at all.
I am asked what is our policy on LEOS and I say: do you have a policy? The answer is, `You're the government.' What do I take from that—that you do not have a policy? Is that what I read into that?
—What is your policy?
—We are all in favour of them. What about you? Are you in favour of them? He does not even know whether he is in favour of low earth orbiting satellites. What about MEOS—middle earth orbiting satellites; are you in favour of them?
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I accept the fact that you are asking me not to interject but I would want to point out that, throughout the whole of the minister's remarks so far, he has been directing questions to me all the time and I am responding to them. At least I am trying to do that through the chair.
—Senator Schacht, interjections are not parliamentary language. Minister, if you would like to address the chair and not anybody else in the opposition you might find you get fewer interjections, which is the name of the game.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I am sure you were as fascinated as I was to hear Senator Schacht not even being prepared to indicate whether he is in favour of low earth orbiting satellites. It is the most preposterous proposition and when we ask—
—We want to know what your policy is.
—We are in favour of them. You do not even know whether you are in favour of them. The fact is that the bush, for the first time in a long while, is actually getting access to the latest technologies, not just access to digital.
This bloke, in estimates a few weeks ago, was there saying we were only going to get one bidder for the spectrum auction. How many did we get? We got nine.
—I raise a further point of order. I am not trying to make your job more difficult, Madam Deputy President,  but every time the minister points across the table and makes a comment directly to me I am more than happy to respond. I think that that makes your job difficult but if he continues to do it I am going to continue to respond.
—You are making my job difficult if you continue to interject. I would ask you to cease and desist and I would ask the minister to address the chair.
—The fact is that we have done an enormous amount for rural and regional Australia to make up for those 13 long years. We have not only introduced ISDN, which gives them high speed Internet access, but we have introduced a $250 million fund which is of enormous significance to them. We have also facilitated the entry of new satellite services for deregulation. In other words, we are very much going down the track that Labor could have gone down for years and simply chose not to.
I presume Senator Schacht is, one day, going to come in here and tell us what policies they have. He thought that we would be lucky to get a single bidder for PCS services. What did we get? We got nine. So we are now looking at the realistic prospect of CDMA technology being out there to supplement both GSM and AMPS. The bush is going to have the benefit of all these technologies and Senator Schacht seems to have absolutely no comprehension of how the changes in the law are benefiting the bush very significantly.
I do not think I need to say much more. We are not happy with Telstra's quality of ser 
 vice. That is why we are upgrading the customer service guarantee which, again, we introduced. He does not want to acknowledge that. It was a historic first because it ensures that standards are set. We now have to make sure those standards are effective under a penalty of very draconian payments. I would have thought that any fair-minded observer would say that it is only this government that offers the bush any prospects of access to decent telecommunications services. The tragedy is that there is only one major party in this country that is prepared to adopt that approach.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Privatisation</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I also wish to take note of the answer to questions by Senator Alston. The minister, Senator Alston, just said that the government is not happy with the service being provided by Telstra. A lot of Australians are not necessarily too happy about it either. In fact, a lot of rural and regional Australians are most unhappy about it and the minister, who is just walking out of the chamber, does not seem to care too much about that and likewise is not prepared to actually do anything about it. He said, during one of his answers, `What is the alternative?' The alternative is that you keep Telstra in public hands and you make sure that it can provide a service that all Australians deserve.
Senator Harradine asked Senator Alston about message bank services being provided free to all Australians and the fact that they are not available free in Hobart or Launceston. It is quite ridiculous. It seems that he is quite happy for some Australians to be treated less equally than others with regard to some Telstra services, and I am quite sure that that must be cause for concern to a lot of people in regional Australia. After the first partial sale of Telstra, we saw the establishment of a telecommunications infrastructure fund of some $250 million. What has happened to it? It was going to be the panacea for Tasmania, in terms of the $58 million that was supposed to be spent in my state, providing a whole host of things.
—Do you go around Tasmania with your eyes shut?
—I am pleased you are interjecting, Senator Calvert, as a fellow Senator from Tasmania. You ought to get on to your minister and find out what has happened to the $7.6 million worth of commitments that you gave as part of the $250 million infrastructure fund—$58 million of which was supposed to be spent in our state over the next five years. I will tell you what has happened: not much. You have parted with $750,000, to date.
Mr Warwick Smith, the member for Bass, who at the time was calling himself the acting minister for telecommunications and the arts, announced a $1.5 million per year fund which was to go to the setting up of a Tasmanian electronic commerce centre. I am sure that the people of Bass, who elected him back into office, are certainly now asking, `Where's Warwick?' What has happened? He said that they expected that $4.5 million would be spent over a three year period. What has happened? We are two years into the three years and not even $750,000 has been spent. The benefits were supposed to flow to all sorts of industries to introduce them to and provide them with advice on telecommunications services. What has happened? Nothing.
—Come down to Hobart and I'll show you.
—You made all these promises to various state bodies. If you go around the state, what have you done? Nothing. It is no wonder that almost 60 per cent of Australians do not support a sale of any more of Telstra. They know that the government cannot be trusted, and they know that once you have sold such an important piece of public infrastructure there is no capacity in the future to guarantee, and you cannot guarantee. A clear demonstration of that was in the response to Senator Harradine's question about the message bank service not being provided equally around this country free of charge.
The minister said that the finance minister was critical of Telstra's service standard, not critical of him. He is the minister; why doesn't he do something about it? The government has control over Telstra. It ought to get in and do something with Telstra if the 
 service is so bad. It should make sure that Telstra acts, and acts equally, in the interests of the public around this country.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Privatisation</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-03-30,"—I rise to speak in this debate because I know that the full privatisation of Telstra is going to be one of those telling moments in history when many Australians will benefit—particularly those in rural and remote Australia. There are a number of reasons why I say that and why I say it with confidence. The first point I want to make is that the government does not have to own Telstra to deliver community service obligations. That was spelled out very clearly by the minister in the answers which he gave today. If you don't believe me, just have a little trip around America and do a bit of examination.
One cannot emphasise that enough. But we on this side of the chamber want to know whether, having put those community service obligations in place, you on that side of the chamber are going to support and continue to support those community service obligations and make a commitment to the bush, the same as we are. That is the telling question, and it is also the question that the Democrats and the Greens have to answer.
—What does the National Party say?
—The honourable senator mentions the National Party. I raised the issues as well, as did a number of my colleagues, and we got satisfactory answers from our ministers and are proceeding on that basis. The National Party will speak for itself.
There is another aspect about this that is very important in terms of community service obligations. Fortunately, our city cousins understand what is being done. They know that every telephone hookup, every fax machine and every form of communications—and the more efficient the better—is a potential business point. They support the continuation and the enhancing—and I emphasise the word `enhancing'—which we are doing in terms of community service obligations.
You people can talk all you like. You had 13 years in government to do something, if all these community service obligations were so 
 bad. There are a number of examples where Telstra has not done as well as it might have done. But there are also examples of some very good work done by Telstra. For instance, as a result of the Jerdacuttup bushfires in Western Australia this year—this is something you people would not care about—people were burnt out and were not left with even a blade of grass on their properties. Telstra got out there and did a magnificent job in getting phone services back on. So when you talk about Telstra, it ain't all bad; in fact, it is a very successful operation.
Let me make another point about Telstra. We need to overcome another of the problems created by your Labor administration, and that is the legacy of debt you left us after your period in government—Commonwealth debt of $96 billion, at a cost of $8 billion per year in interest. The reduction of interest paid on public sector debt alone will have an enormous impact not only directly but indirectly on people who live in rural and remote Australia—and all Australians.
The worst economic enemies that came out of your government were high interest rates, high inflation and an overvalued dollar through the misuse of monetary policy. We are addressing that by the reduction of that particular debt from this particular sale and keeping in place, as I have already said, the community service obligations. One can run through a number of these points, and I shall do that quickly in the time I have.
The law says that all Australians must have access to standard telephones. Consumer protection laws will remain strong. Untimed local calls will also remain. Phone companies cannot force a residential phone user to pay timed local calls. Australians in regional and remote areas will continue to receive special help with their phone services in recognition of their special problems caused by distance. Madam Deputy President, I put to you and to this chamber that a modernised, competitive Telstra is far and away the most effective way to go into the future to deliver the services that are required—not only for the bush, but for all Australians.
—The most convenient way to shaft the bush.
—When it is convenient, those on the other side can carp all they like. But we remember the Commonwealth Bank and we remember Qantas—we remember the track that you people went down. The fundamental difference between us and you in terms of these sales is that we will retire debt; you spent it.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The key issue here this afternoon is that the credibility of the government is on the line, and I will come to that in a few moments. It is clear from even the Courier-Mail , which is noted for its conservative approach, that this government has not understood what the issue is about. I hope that Senator McGauran will stand up for the National Party in a few moments and defend their rights. It was reported in the Courier-Mail  that Mr Fischer said the following on yesterday's Sunday  program:
""It is true there has been a decline in Telstra service over the years separate from the question of ownership. Some of that reflects technology change,"" . . . 
So, on the admission of Mr Fischer—the Deputy Prime Minister of this country—there has been a decline in Telstra service. The next paragraph is interesting. He says:
""I'm not satisfied, especially in recent flood times in north Queensland, that the service is where it should be and more effort must be made in that regard and it will be.""
That is very fine; that is very nice, but there is a clear recognition that this government needs to do something about the bush where it has failed to do so in the past. But, as I said, this is really an issue about credibility. If one looks at the editorial in the Toowoomba Chronicle  of 18 March, one will see that the editor calls into question the credibility of this government. The editor said:
Is it any wonder that people are mistrusting of politicians! On the page opposite we highlight what then Opposition Leader, now Prime Minister, John Howard said in relation to Telstra in the election campaign of 1996.
It is unequivocal.
They are the words used by the editor. He goes on to say that the then Leader of the Opposition said:
""I'm being honest and up-front. We intend to sell a third and no more, a limit on the foreign ownership, only 12%, and we are going to keep the cross-subsidies.""
The editor goes on to say:
However, Australians were given the clearest indication at the time as to what he thought in relation to selling more of Telstra—""no more"".
I think this really sums up where the government is at on this issue. The editor then goes on to say:
Those assurances aside,—
And there were some assurances that the editor acknowledged—
he did make it crystal clear in 1996 exactly what he wanted in relation to Telstra.
Now that has been muddied by another crystal-clear statement as part of the next election's platform.
What we clearly have with this government is that they once again cannot define the difference between core and non-core; what starts out as a core promise ends up being a non-core promise and being ditched. That is the problem that we have got with this government. That is the thing that the people in the bush fear. The people in the bush are not convinced in any way whatsoever by what your side of politics is saying.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Privatisation</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-03-30,"—It is probably worth noting that there has been a definite change in atmosphere from last week to this week. Members will remember that question time last week was dominated by the so-called `heavyweights' of the Labor Party: Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray. But, when you delete the muck-raking and the personal attacks, as there were against Senator Parer last week and get onto a level one policy issue, the second row comes in and Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner are conspicuous by their absence.
—What are you? Nothing!
—I just make that observation, Senator Hogg, that they are definitely conspicuous by their absence. Nevertheless, it was good to see Senator Schacht have a really good work-out; his first good work-out in question time since he has taken up that ministry. We have looked forward to seeing that very shy minister ask 
 many more questions in question time. I think it is more than he has asked since he has become shadow minister. But I have to tell you that, as a head-to-head combat battle, policy issue for policy issue against the minister, Senator Alston, it was a massacre.
The first thing that has to be said about our government's approach and the opposition's approach to the sale of Telstra is that on each occasion—the one-third sale of Telstra and now the two-thirds sale of Telstra following our announcement—we have sought a mandate from the people of Australia at an election: the ultimate mandate that a party can receive as they go to an election. That is the big difference. Just as we went to the last election with the one-third sale of Telstra—and a great success it was, where the Australian shareholders doubled their money and some 500,000 new shareholders who have never entered the share market before took up shares in the one-third sale of Telstra—and sought the approval of the Australian people there, we will do the same for the two-thirds sale of Telstra.
In contrast, the Labor opposition cannot be trusted. Their record shows that they cannot be trusted when it comes to the matter of privatisation. Of course, that has been endorsed. Senator Crane mentioned the best example of all and that was the Commonwealth Bank. The Labor Party embraced privatisation over their 13 years of government by selling all manner of things like Qantas, the Williamstown dockyards, the Garden Island dockyard, the Moomba-Sydney gas line and so on. But for ever and a day the sale of the Commonwealth Bank will be the best example of not only how the Labor Party embraced privatisation and frittered away the funds of that particular privatisation, but also how they misled the Australian people and worst of all the shareholder of the Commonwealth Bank.
I will run through the history of that particular sale. On two occasions the Labor Party went to the people not telling them that they would sell the Commonwealth Bank. After they had sold a third, the then Treasurer, Senator Willis, wrote to the existing shareholders—the mums and dads—saying, `We 
 will not sell the second third of the Commonwealth Bank', but they did.
—Senator Willis?
—Mr Willis. The point is that you not only fraudulently misled the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank, the mums and dads, but also you misled the electorate at the time. Is it any wonder that your star recruit, the former Senator Kernot from the Democrats, said this about Labor in the Age  on 22 February 1996:
I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I am more worried about Labor in government.
Why wouldn't we be worried about Labor in government with the record you have in regard to the Commonwealth Bank?
There is a misconception being peddled by the other side about the National Party's objection in regard to the sale of Telstra. It has been well and truly confirmed by the minister that the assurances and underwriting within the legislation of services to rural and regional Australia will not only be kept, but will be enhanced. Time does not allow me to read the full list of the services that are legislated for in rural and regional areas, but I just refer the House to a joint press release.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-03-30,"—I wish to take note of the most extraordinary answer that Senator Alston gave to my question today. I quote his answer:
I do not think I signed anything in relation to Optus and Vodafone.
I have before me here and seek leave to retable three documents with the minister's signature on them that sign away all foreign ownership controls on Australia's second and third largest carriers.
If the minister cannot even remember doing this, how can we trust this government to look after all consumers once Telstra is sold, if it is sold? How do we get the guarantees from this government that actually mean anything, if the minister can actually forget signing these documents? If these get through this Senate chamber untouched, our second and third largest carriers will be completely foreign owned.
I do have to ask this government—with all the promises it is making at the moment—how serious it really is. When reading from this document signed by Senator Alston, it says very clearly:
The Honourable Peter Costello announced that the government had decided to remove with immediate effect the foreign ownership restrictions that were specific to Optus and Vodafone. These documents relate to Optus Network, Vodafone Pty Limited and Optus Mobile Pty Limited.
In case the minister has completely forgotten to the point of needing to be reminded, I seek leave to retable these documents.
—Usually people do you the courtesy of letting you have a look over the documents before you do so. We are happy to have a look at them.
—I am not seeking to have them incorporated. I am simply seeking to retable them. They have already been tabled by the minister back in 1997. I cannot read the date.

The background to it is that the bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on Friday of last week for a hearing and that that committee is to report by 2 April—that is Thursday of this week. It is our contention that there is insufficient time for the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to deal with the matters this bill covers properly and report to this chamber the details of the legislation.
Notwithstanding that, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee held a meeting, I understand, at 9.30 this morning for the purpose of taking submissions. It called for submissions on Friday. It took submissions at 9.30 this morning. That meant that no party was able to prepare a formal written submission for the edification of the committee. All the submissions were oral.
—That's not true.
—My advice is that they were oral but, if Senator Ferguson says there were written submissions, I applaud the endeavour of those who were able to make written submissions. That is a point leading to what I think is the most significant issue here—that this is an omnibus bill. It covers several areas amending the tax act. Those areas go to the savings rebate, to changes to dividend streaming and imputation credits, to sections 108 and 109 of the tax act and to the choice of superannuation funds. I acknowledge that the Senate committee has conducted an inquiry into the choice of superan 
 nuation funds. That does not in any way detract from the fact that the other areas of the bill are quite significant and important as well, and that due process ought to be engaged for those matters to be properly canvassed.
The issue is that it is a tall order to expect all affected parties to gather themselves to be present at a hearing on the Monday morning following the Friday it was announced. I do not think anyone in their right mind can say that this Senate committee has had an opportunity to be sure that it has canvassed all of the opinions of those parties affected by this legislation; given them a proper chance to formulate their argument; had the chance to hear them as witnesses, and to come to conclusions and to make a report in writing to the Senate before the closing time. That is the normal problem with this committee. On that ground alone there is sufficient argument, I would submit, for consideration of this matter to be extended to the time set out in this motion.
What complicates it and makes it even worse is that the government has done two things. Firstly, while it has introduced this bill into the House of Representatives, I am now advised it has not yet brought this bill on for debate. So we have not had a bill carried by the House being referred to the Senate, irrespective of the fact that the government has the opportunity to do that. Secondly, the government has now twice amended its bill. It gave notice of amendments earlier and on Friday gave notice, by way of press release from the minister in this chamber, Senator Kemp, of 49 additional amendments.
I ask the Senate to pause and think: here is a bill that covers several complex areas of tax law change; there has been insufficient notice for the parties affected by that to get themselves together to present their argument; and on the eve of their doing so, in any case, the government comes down with 49 new changes to the legislation, which complicates the matter further. If the Senate committee is to have a bone fide inquiry into this legislation, it ought to do so by letting the parties affected by this legislation know the character and 
 nature of those amendments and have an inquiry into what is being proposed.
It is very likely or possible that, if the schedule imposed by the government were adhered to, the respondents to a Senate inquiry would be misdirected and make submissions about matters that the government had already decided it would change and they would not have an opportunity to address the matters that would be in the true nature of the eventual bill that this chamber would be asked to consider. That may, in the complexities of these matters, disadvantage many of those submitters.
It is not as if we want to be obstructionists in relation to this bill. We do not. We want a reasonable chance for the community to react to this legislation. We do want a reasonable opportunity for this chamber to debate it. At the moment we have before the chair in this chamber the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). That bill, hopefully, will be disposed of today and we will then turn our attention to the productivity bill. We will then have Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6), and then we will have the Public Service Bill and the fair trading bill.
We know that before the House of Representatives—we got the message a moment ago—are the Managed Investments Bill and the corporate law reform bill. We propose to expedite these in a reasonable and appropriate way. That is not to say they go through without consideration. They do not. They would go through with proper and appropriate consideration as expeditiously as this chamber can manage, given the reasonable workload that it has to face and is expected to produce, and in a way in which we balance that demand against the rights of proper inquiry and scrutiny of legislation.
I understand—I conclude on this point—that those who did appear before the inquiry this morning did so on the basis of the bill that was presented and they did not include in their submissions any discussion of the new amendments that have been lodged.
—That's not true.
—I am advised that that is the case. I acknowledge Senator Ferguson is 
 the chair of the committee, so his interjection does carry weight. But my advice, equally, is from an extremely informed source. I do not know what the truth of the matter is.
Senator Ferguson interjecting—
—No; I respect your interjection and I am not going to argue the point. I am just saying this is my advice as you are interjecting that my advice is wrong.
Irrespective of that fact, some people who had prior knowledge of the amendments may know their content. I must admit I have not had a chance to come to grips with them. If justice is at all seen to be done, there ought to be at least a process by which those reasonably affected by this legislation know what the amendments are and have a chance to put submissions forward.

Leave granted.
—This is an important motion because Senator Cook's motion, if carried, would delay the implementation of a very important aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) and cause serious problems in the implementation of other aspects of this bill. People are wanting certainty. Senator Cook gave us a very strong lecture this morning on the problems of delaying tax bills but, within hours, he stands up and seeks to move a motion which would delay this very important bill further.
The government's position on this is quite clear. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has had plenty of opportunity to refer this bill to a legislation committee, and on at least two occasions this matter was deferred. Just as this bill is coming up for debate in this chamber, suddenly the Labor Party decides that it has to be referred and debate on this bill has to be delayed until 13 May.
This is a classic filibuster. It is a misuse of this committee, in my view. If the Labor Party felt that this bill was so important—we believe it is a very important bill—and was 
 concerned about this bill, it had plenty of time to refer this bill to a legislation committee. Twice, as my colleague Senator Campbell reminds me, it chose not to do it. Now that this bill is coming forward for debate, the Labor Party decides that the moment is nigh and it has to be referred to a committee.
This bill contains major budget initiatives, including the savings rebate and choice of fund measures. If the Senate committees are going to be used in this manner to filibuster, delay and hold up, we are seeing a serious misuse of the Senate committee system. I am surprised that Senator Cook and Senator Conroy would allow the committees to be used in this manner.
We will be opposing Senator Cook's motion and the date referred to by Senator Cook of 13 May. We believe that that would be a most unnecessary delay. However, we have listened to other concerns in the chamber. I will be moving an amendment to the motion proposed by Senator Cook to leave out `13 May 1998' and insert `6 April 1998'. The reason for that is that, to the extent that there is any merit in the argument that Senator Cook has raised—and I believe there is no merit—if people now wish to come forward and present evidence to the committee, there will be time for that to occur and time for the committee to report and it would allow this bill to be debated the following week. I move:

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—by leave—I wish to take issue with the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). I think it was entirely proper for the Labor Party to refer the bill. I have not seen any filibuster yet—I think you used that term in the broader sense—because the matter has not been before the Senate, so it has not been debated in that sense.
The Australian Democrats thought that it was foolish for the committee to have originally been given an unreasonable time to report. I think it was referred on a Thursday to report on a Monday, and that was plainly impossible. That certainly got our hackles up. We thought it was marginally less foolish that it should report this Thursday.
However, it is frequent that bills should be reviewed and discussed and a report brought down within a week. That is quite common in my experience of the Senate Economics Committee's operation and, indeed, other committees on which I sit. There is great merit in Senator Cook's argument because of the scope of the bill. However, a substantial slab of the bill—namely, the superannuation slab—has already been referred to a committee and has been reported on. That leaves two areas—the savings rebates area and the other provisions in the bill on dividend distributions and capital gains tax based changes.
To use some of Senator Cook's own language, I am sympathetic to your intention, but what concerns me is the fear of an early election and the 1 July deadline on some of this tax legislation. I think that the Labor Party will be able to address many of the substantive issues in the debate. I personally am not convinced that the government will be able to bring on the matter next week if it tries to deal with all the 35 bills that are before us this week.
Having said those things, Senator Cook, on the balance of the issues before me, I think I am obliged to support the government in its intention to report early next week and therefore to bring the debate on for next week. That indicates our position. We will be extremely irritable if, having made this fuss, the government does not bring on the legislation next week. I think there will then be grounds to raise the matter again.

Division 2—Competitive neutrality complaints
21  Complaints to the Commission
	 (1)	 A person may complain to the Commission that:
		 (a)	 a particular Commonwealth Government business or business activity, or a business or business activity competing with a Commonwealth Government business or business activity, is not conducted in accordance with competitive neutrality arrangements that apply to it; or
		 (b)	 a particular Commonwealth government or business activity, or a business or business activity competing with a Commonwealth government business or business activity, should be required to be conducted in accordance with competitive neutrality arrangements.
	 (2)	 The complaint must be in writing.
	 (3)	 The Commission is to give particular regard to ensuring the interests of users of the service are considered in relation to the complaint and may invite submissions from interested parties.
	 (4)	 In addition to the obligations imposed on the functions of the Commission in section 8, the Commission must give particular consideration to the public interest requirements in clause 1 of the Competition Principles Agreement signed by the Commonwealth Government on April 11 1995.
	 (5)	 Competitive neutrality arrangements are the arrangements referred to by that name 
 in the Commonwealth Government Competitive Neutrality Statement  of June 1996  (the aim of which is to ensure that significant business activities do not enjoy net competitive advantages or disadvantages in comparison with their competitors by virtue of their public sector ownership).
22  Discretion not to investigate complaints
	 (1)	 The Commission may decide not to investigate a complaint, if in the opinion of the Commission:
		 (a)	 the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith; or
		 (b)	 the complainant does not have sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint; or
		 (c)	 an investigation is not warranted having regard to all the relevant circumstances.
	 (2)	 If the Commission decides not to investigate a complaint it must inform the complainant of the decision.
This important amendment refers to competitive neutrality complaints. It seeks to broaden and to clarify the role of the commission in dealing with competitive neutrality complaints. Proposed section 21 will not just allow private sector competitors with government businesses to complain about the operation of competitive neutrality arrangements; rather, it will also allow government enterprises to complain that they are suffering a disadvantage because of the operation of the policy. This adds a symmetry to the provision which we think is important.
Subclause 21(3) says:
The Commission is to give particular regard to ensuring the interests of users of the service are considered in relation to the complaint and may invite submissions from interested parties.
That makes it clear that the users of this service should be the paramount consideration. This obviously needs to be read in conjunction with public interest requirements, referred to in subclause 21(4), found in the competition principles agreement. These include policies on ecologically sustainable development, social welfare consideration, occupational health and safety, access and equity, regional development, interests of consumers and the efficient allocation of resources. That makes it clear that the public 
 benefit and public policy considerations are particularly relevant in considering competitive neutrality complaints. Clause 22 concerns the discretion not to investigate complaints. It replicates clause 26 of the original bill and gives the commission power not to deal with some categories of complaints.
The Democrats decided to bring these compromise amendments forward because we believe it is necessary that parliament give some clear direction about what is the public interest in dealing with competitive neutrality complaints. We previously have clearly outlined our fears concerning competitive neutrality, but competitive neutrality is a fact. It has been established by the previous government with the support of the coalition, and they are continuing it.
The bill, as originally presented, was unsatisfactory. The function of competitive neutrality complaints was maintained but there was no other guidance as to how this should occur. It was also pointed out that a complaints mechanism could even be built into the Industry Commission Act by ministerial reference. So, while we are not happy with the general approach of both the coalition and Labor to competitive neutrality issues and policy, the Democrats decided that, if there must be a complaints mechanism, we should have a clear statement of what is the public interest in respect of such complaints. That is what we have sought to do with this amendment.

This amendment was drawn up after discussion with the government following its acceptance of Senate amendments to include commissioners experienced in environmental, industry or social service matters. You will recall clearly that the Senate was pleased that the government was prepared to accept those amendments, believing that it properly broad 
 ened the ability and skills that the commissioners would bring to their task. This amendment seeks to ensure that the commission can continue to function during short periods while these positions might be unfulfilled.

I begin by remarking that, with the absence of Senator Kemp, this debate is going along quite quickly. I am beginning to wonder whether we can sheet home the blame for the delays to him. I note, Senator Cook, that you have been taking a bit of a pounding from him for delaying things.
—I am not sure whether that is a matter of relevance. 
—No, it is not; it was just an aside. Democrats amendments 6 and 7 seek to delete an earlier amendment which was pointed out to us to be unnecessary, given the prescription of the mandatory commission memberships, which we modified again in amendment 7, which is a technical amendment that cleans up the appointment issue.

The fact of the matter is that here, in a way, the government has brought this on itself.

We support the amendments.

Amendments 8 to 10 amend the previously agreed Senate amendment dealing with engagement of consultants. These amendments have followed on from advice we have taken from both the commission and the government. The only real change is that the chair will be required to follow the Commonwealth's best practice standards on engagement of consultants. The amendments retain, in addition, the former Senate approved amendment of seeking an open tendering process for consultancies above the required amount. As such, the amendment goes a little further than the previous Senate amendment, depending of course on how tough the government's best practice standards prove to be.

(11)	 Clause 49, page 30 (line 16), omit ""The Chair"", substitute ""Subject to any commitments under any award or employment agreement, the Chair"".
This amendment seeks to ensure that the chair, in engaging any staff or consultants, abides by the relevant award or employment agreement. I think that is pretty self-explanatory.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I move:
(1)	 Clause 3, page 3 (lines 2 to 5), omit the definition of  industry , substitute:
 industry  means industry of any kind (including any business or activity relating to goods or services), and a reference to industry is a refer 
 ence to a particular industry or part of an industry or a group or groups of particular interests.
This amendment proposes to adjust the definition of `industry' in clause 3 of the bill, consistent with the ALP preferred model of making the Productivity Commission a specific reference body rather than a more general reference body. The amendment contracts the definition of `industry' from one which includes Australian industry in general to particular industries or parts of industries.
This will allow the commission to focus on specific issues within industries which should allow greater emphasis on practical considerations, as opposed to an overtly theoretical approach which could arise from a more generalist reference. Therefore, this is an outstanding amendment. I commend it to the committee.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—This amendment seeks to confine the reference to industry to only refer to a particular industry rather than industry in general—which I find might be a bit semantic. I know that industry spokesperson Simon Crean, who is very capable in the area, regularly talks about industry in a generic rather than a specific sense. We will not be supporting this amendment.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-30,"—by leave—I move:
Omit paragraphs 8(1)(f) and (g), substitute:
		 (f)	 to increase employment, with particular emphasis on regional areas; and
		 (g)	 to promote regional development, particularly in those regions affected by geographic isolation, transport barriers (such as Bass Strait) or other special factors; and
(2)	 Clause 10, page 6 (after line 20), after subclause (2), insert:
	 (2A)	 In the report, the Commission must also report on the productivity performance of regional economies.
These amendments are self-explanatory. I suppose this argument has taken place over a period of time. I think it is generally agreed around the place that we should really recognise the impact of economic factors affecting employment in regional areas; that the com 
 mission should recognise those impacts; and that we should provide the states and territories with some involvement in the inquiry process. I foreshadow that that is the basis for all my amendments.
But so far as amendments 1 and 2 are concerned, it is clear that this is an attempt, and it is one that I hope will be supported around the chamber, to include reference to special factors affecting isolated regional economies—such as Tasmania, for example, with the Bass Strait—in general policy guidelines. That is why I am proposing that there be a new paragraph 8(1)(f), that the commission should have regard to the need:
to increase employment, with particular emphasis on regional areas . . . 
and a new paragraph 8(1)(g):
to promote regional development, particularly in those regions affected by geographic isolation, transport barriers (such as Bass Strait) or other special factors . . . 
Then I am proposing amendment No. 2 to clause 10, page 6, after line 20, after subclause (3), to insert:
(2A)	 In the report, the Commission must also report on the productivity performance of regional economies.
I think that is very, very important since both the government and the opposition are—indeed, the parliament as a whole is—very well aware of the existence of regional economies. This debate will be going to and fro, I guess, in the next month or two particularly. I would just like to commend to the committee my amendments; I hope that they may be successful.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I note the running sheet says, `NB Harradine (1) conflicts with opp (2) below'. I do not think it does. We would want to support the Harradine amendments but, assuming those amendments are carried—and I have a sort of prescient sense that they may be—we would like to add them to the list of—
—You may still move your amendment afterwards.
—We will support the Harradine amendments.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—I would like to make a couple of comments. I do not think Senator Harradine's amendments in any way conflict with the general policy guidelines that are already in the government's bill as amended. They do, as Senator Harradine has made clear, in parts (g), (f) and other parts, refer to employment and to regional economies. We believe that, in some respects, Senator Harradine's amendments may even limit what the commission could do.
We think that the way the bill is termed at the moment encompasses everything that Senator Harradine has in his mind and certainly everything he has in his amendments. But we think the use of the words `such as Bass Strait' in respect of paragraph (g) of clause 8(1) is getting far too specific. I guess as Western Australians Senator Cook and I would probably, along that line, support an amendment that said `and the Nullarbor Plain'. If you were a Queenslander perhaps you would talk about the great distances in Queensland. The government's bill, as it is drafted, looks at regional development and looks at employment, including in regional areas. It encompasses all of these things without getting so specific. Therefore the government will not be accepting the amendment, although I do not think there is any difference between Senator Harradine and the government in terms of the emphasis.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I move:
(2)	 Clause 8, omit the clause, substitute:
8  General policy guidelines for Commission
	 (1)	 In the performance of its functions, the Commission must give priority to:
		 (a)	 encouraging the development and growth of Australian industries that are efficient in their use of resources, enterprising, innovative and internationally competitive; and
		 (b)	 facilitating adjustment to structural changes in the economy and avoidance 
 of social and economic hardships arising from those changes; and
		 (c)	 recognition of the interests of industries, employees, consumers and the community, likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission; and
		 (d)	 growth in employment, including in regional areas; and
		 (e)	 promotion of regional development; and
		 (f)	 Australia's international obligations; and
		 (g)	 progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers.
	 (2)	 In the performance of its functions, the Commission must also have regard to any other matters notified to it in writing by the Minister.
	 (3)	 Where a matter is referred to the Commission for inquiry and report, the Commission must:
		 (a)	 report on the basis of methodologies, assessments and recommendations adopted by the Commission; and
		 (b)	 inquire into and report on social, economic and environmental consequences of any recommendations it makes, including the consequences for the distribution of employment, income, resources and services between individuals and groups in the community.
This amendment seeks to rewrite clause 8 of the bill, which involves the general policy guidelines to be followed by the commission. It is one of the great weaknesses of the bill, I think, that this is not spelt out more fully. The government has completely neglected some very significant policy guidelines, which this amendment will insert. For example, the amendment will ensure that the commission must give priority to, among other things, encouraging the development and growth of Australian industry; the avoidance of social and economic hardships arising from structural adjustment; recognising the interests of industries, employees and consumers; the promotion of regional development—the point that Senator Harradine was referring to; the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers; and Australia's international obligations.
The amendment will assist in ensuring that the material factors actually facing Australia will be taken into account by the commission when undertaking its analysis. That must be central to any advice provided and it should not be an afterthought. This amendment is also a further attempt to ensure that the advice from the commission is practical in its outlook and not overly theoretically based. If the National Party senators do not support this amendment they will be voting against their own interests and against regional development, especially regional employment.
Being well aware of the significance of these particular points in encouraging the development of Australian industry seems open-ended enough but, nonetheless, with the experience that we have had over the years of the Industry Commission, which is the prime mover in this three-way amalgamation, that ought to be spelt out. The other things about tariff and non-tariff barriers, and Australia's international obligations should also be spelt out.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—The amendment moved by the Labor Party broadens out some of the considerations that should be followed by the Industry Commission. It is no secret that the Greens (WA) do not support the establishment of the Productivity Commission and that we are fundamentally opposed to the existence of such bodies as the Productivity Commission, which is a publicly funded, rationalist think-tank used to pump out the same old recommendations on those things like accelerating your regulation; cutting tariffs, concessions and subsidies; lowering labour costs; and promoting user pays. It is a finely honed vehicle to further entrench a single, narrow economic fundamentalist perspective. It ensures that narrow dollar sign concepts such as productivity are entrenched benchmarks according to which everything is judged. Genuine concerns of unemployment, poverty, including the increasing number of poor, social justice, distribution of wealth, sustainable development and standard of living are becoming increasingly marginalised and only token consideration is given, if any. We will nevertheless support the ALP amendment to 
 slightly broaden the policy guidelines. We are hoping that it can improve during the course of this reconsideration.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—Before I make my remarks on this amendment I should indicate to Senator Harradine that I did not give him the courtesy of a response to his previous amendment because I was consulting with my adviser. We do believe that the commission, under the amended act, now has to have regard to the need to increase employment and to promote regional development. We thought that Senator Harradine's amendment, focusing on types of regions rather than regional development generally, did not advance matters particularly.
With regard to Senator Cook's amendment, we had an extensive debate on clause 8 and the general policy guidelines of the commission the first time this bill was considered. As I recall, the government accepted pretty much all of the amendments sought then. The second part of the amendment seeks to require the social, economic and environmental consequences of any recommendations to be included in their report. This is unnecessary, given the changes we have made to the guidelines and to the commission's membership, which will take effect when a report is to be approved. In other words, they must report on social, economic and environmental consequences. Consequently, whilst we have great sympathy with the amendment, we regret that we will not be able to support it.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I do not propose to proceed with this amendment, Mr Chairman.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-30,"—I am hesitant to move these amendments and therefore I will not speak long on them; I just wanted to get a feel from the 
 committee. They are self-explanatory. I think it is very important to take the states and territories along with us, and perhaps the minister would be able to indicate to me whether or not the government is prepared to support amendment No. 3, which is to require the minister not to refer a matter to the commission for inquiry unless the minister has consulted the relevant state or territory governments. It is not a veto power that I am suggesting. If the government and other members of the committee are not overanxious about this particular amendment, I will not move it.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—On the face of it, it looks reasonable, but there are matters which this commission would look into that have no relevance to state or territory governments. I think Senator Harradine would concede that. There are matters which are purely for the Commonwealth, particularly if it is a matter of Commonwealth administration of a Commonwealth head of power where the states had no involvement. I know that this government would consult with state and territory governments wherever that was necessary but, in practice, referring to state or territory governments any matter that was going to be inquired into adds a whole new raft of unnecessary paperwork and it does slow processes up. Even where states have to be consulted as a matter of courtesy, it requires work, discussion, responses, advice, transfer of letters and so forth, so I think you would have to say that it is unnecessary, from the government's point of view.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—We are often painted as the great centrists, but I do see some merit in this amendment. The first point is that this body is essentially going to look at fundamental questions of competitiveness, economic efficiency, industry adjustment and things that affect the regions. If it is to have any moral authority and approval to look at these areas, one would have thought that, as a first step, the regions, that is, the state and territory governments, should be consulted in some 
 way about what the government intends to refer to them. Whether or not it is the practice, we have no objection to having such a practice enshrined in the legislation.
The second point is that there are things which the Commonwealth would want to see happen—one hopes—that would improve the productivity, competitiveness and industry adjustment regional focus of Australia which conceivably would not necessarily be things supported automatically by the states or territories. I have in mind the recent report that Senator Kemp and I fell out over; that is, the report into competitive bidding between the states. This report showed that the states, in order to attract industry to their area, simply bid up the types of subsidies they offer a particular company, without any real benefit to the nation, and then put the lock on the Commonwealth at premiers conferences to pay more money to meet their inflated bids. That is a matter of national efficiency and it is also a matter of behaviour by the states which needs to be brought under rein. I think the states often find a degree of discomfort in having the spotlight of clarity and transparency fixed on.
I do not think the Commonwealth should not proceed in that area. I have in mind—don't quote me on this figure; I think it is indicative rather than accurate—that something like $5 billion worth of useless expenditure was, to use an expression I have heard in question time, `thrown up against the wall' because of states which, like in an auction, bid up the amount of subsidies, grants or tax breaks that they were offering particular companies to locate in their area, without any real benefit to the nation at all. If you were going to embark on a course to rein in this practice, I think you would start by talking to them, trying to involve them and trying to get a basic commitment to looking fairly at this produce and putting an end to it, following upon a report by a commission such as this. That is one matter that comes to mind. There are other matters.
I do not think this is a die in the ditch argument. It is just a sensible, reasonable proposition and not one which will necessari 
 ly excite great emotion, but I would support it.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—I want to ask the minister a question in relation to some of the issues that have just been brought onto the agenda by Senator Cook. As we are dealing with the level of consultation with state and territory governments, I was wondering what the current situation is with respect to the states providing deals such as infrastructure, tax holidays or other things that are encompassed in such things as state agreement acts. Are they going to be reviewed as part of the competition process?",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—Senator Margetts, although that matter, as much as Senator Cook has raised it as an example of what the Commonwealth should be required to consult on with the states, comes within discussion of this bill in committee it is not really related to it, but I am happy to get the minister to give you a more specific answer. I think, as Senator Cook said, it is up to the states to make these sorts of decisions. The Commonwealth can look at it and I guess the Productivity Commission could look at it. Clearly, the commission will have to speak to the states in relation to any matter that involves the states and, if it involves the sorts of things that Senator Cook has in mind, then it will do that. But to require the commission and the minister to do so prior to making an inquiry would considerably constrain the minister in making references to the commission where the states and the territories have no interest whatsoever. That would certainly create unnecessary bureaucracy, and the government remains opposed to this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—I want to clarify that situation. The minister said that it was up to the states, but surely it is not. Once we have the Productivity Commission legislation and the competition policy legislation, then it will not be up to the states whether those types of practices are reviewed, will it?",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—In the part of the competition legislation to which I think you are referring, the ACCC is the responsible body and, indeed, it will look into those things. There is an interesting example of that in the state of Western Australia, as Senator Margetts would know, where the ACCC came in and actually stopped an agreement to supply gas to a steel mill in Western Australia. Senator Margetts, it is interesting that that agreement could not have been knocked over by the ACCC without the competition legislation that you actually opposed.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—I wish to add briefly to the debate. As Senator Margetts pointed out, we have no affection whatsoever for Labor's Industry Commission, and I suspect we will not feel much warmer towards the coalition's Productivity Commission. However, with the amendments the government has accepted on its nature, management and objectives, we believe it is a considerable advancement on the previous Industry Commission. What concerns me about Senator Harradine's amendment is that, if we are concerned about the Commonwealth's policy direction, I can assure you that we would not like to see that multiplied eight times by being concerned about the states' and territories' prescriptive requirement. We do believe that consultation should be carried out but, in some instances, it may be advisable for the Commonwealth to have a free hand, so we will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I do not want to delay this but I understand, now that the signals have been exchanged, that this is going to be defeated, and it is a pity because we are confusing process with objective. This is a federation after all. There is no doubt that 
 governing the nation has to be done in concert with the states and the territories. These are matters of national competitiveness, productivity, et cetera. To consult with the states is a matter of how you work towards the objective of reform. If we simply argue it on the basis of, `That's a process that is unnecessary,' we are looking at it in mechanistic terms, not in terms of the goal of making a more competitive Australia. I understand the signals that have been exchanged, but I just want to put on the record that I do not think this is a big deal; it is just what you would do as a responsible government to bring the community behind some kind of reform making process, and I think it will be a terrible pity if it is defeated.

Penalty units are defined in section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 .
Amendments 4 to 9 cover the penalty provisions contained in clauses 52 to 54. Clause 52, notice to a person to provide information and documents; clause 53, summons to persons to attend a hearing; clause 54, refusal to answer questions or produce documents; and any breach of these provisions provides for a maximum penalty of six months in gaol. The provisions are the same as appear in the Industry Commission Act.
The Productivity Commission is a new body, however, with enormously enhanced functions and a much wider and varied scope and reach than the Industry Commission had. 
 It takes in the Bureau of Industry Economics and EPAC, and the Productivity Commission has the power in one organisation that previously existed in three separate organisations.
The powers that I have referred to—the notice to a person to provide information and documents, the summons to attend a hearing and the penalties that can be imposed on the refusal to answer questions or produce documents—are very draconian powers for a body that is tasked with the responsibility of recommending on micro-economic reform issues. As such, the Productivity Commission is an information and reporting body and not a judicial and investigative body.
The amendments that I am proposing should be supported. I want to emphasise the point that here we have a body which is an inquirer into the nature of competition in the economy—what can be done to make the economy more effective, what efficiency gains are possible, and so forth—and you load it with policing powers reminiscent of what a totalitarian state might provide in its social law.
Let me give you an example of why I think this is draconian. At present we have contretemps on the waterfront. We know that the NFF is setting up a rival company. We know that persons unknown—but we suspect who they are—engaged in a military type operation in Dubai. If the Productivity Commission were inquiring into waterfront efficiency under this legislation it could require the Maritime Workers Union to come forward and explain what their particular objectives were and, on pain of their not doing so, gaol them for six months.
This amendment proposes a fine of $50, which we think is a more appropriate level of compulsion. For a commission that is basically out to analyse and inquire to have policing and imprisonment powers of this order is well and truly off the planet. I know the Industry Commission did have that, but I would have some reservations about whether even that was appropriate. Even if you hold the view that it was appropriate for the Industry Commission to have those powers, I cannot see why you would hold the view that is appropriate for the Productivity Commis 
 sion, on a much wider scope, with a much broader canvas, to have those powers. I support the amendments.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—I want to ask a question of Senator Cook to find out whether or not this amendment deals just with individuals or also with individuals involved as companies. You know that the Greens would always support removing prison penalties from bills, but it is also good to make sure that it does not mean that the little person is going to make sure they come along to avoid a $50 fine, but other people, who have a great deal of resources and should potentially be explaining themselves in front of the Productivity Commission, feel quite happy to get their company accountant to send off a $50 fine. I am wondering whether or not we are dealing with corporations potentially being able to thumb their noses, whereas the little person might not be able to do that.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—My amendments deal with a person. You would have to look at what is defined as `a person' for the purposes of the bill. I have not turned up the definitions to check that point. My normal understanding is that of course a company has a personality in the sense of the persons who lead it. I am not sure if that is the reference in this bill. I imagine it would be so—that a corporation is represented by a person who is ultimately responsible, and that person can be dealt with for the purposes of law. I assume—unless someone can enlighten me that I am wrong—that that is what is covered here and, indeed, that is what our intention would be.
I see the purpose of Senator Margetts' concern in the articulation of her question and the core of that concern. Maybe laws of this nature would encourage powerful corporations that would otherwise resist being forced to comply. If that is the proposition, I am not sure that it indeed holds.
This is a trivial way of explaining it, but even in the most recent movie now playing on the flight to Perth, Rainmaker, it did not stop the powerful corporations employing batteries of high-priced lawyers in order to 
 evade or avoid their obligation at law. That is what you would find and this whole thing would get into a tortuous, long-running legal battle which would not necessarily have the `they lived happily ever after' outcome of the movie.
—You have spoilt it for me, Peter. It was a happy ending, was it?
—I thought the big faceless corporations got done over and the small individuals who stood up against the system won in that movie, but art does not necessarily imitate life. My worry is that that can happen in filmic fantasy, but whether it happens in real life is another matter. We are moving a long way from the point.
—I was planning to watch that movie on the way home on Friday and you just ruined it for me. I know the ending now. I will have to change flights.
—I am sorry. I thought if you had read any review of it you would have caught the outcome. But we are diverting from the point.
In short, it would be used against unions, against individual workers and against people in a position unable to defend themselves so easily at law more likely and more successfully than it would be used against big corporations, and it is for that reason that we oppose it. If big corporations want to thumb their noses at a Productivity Commission then they call into jeopardy all of their arguments about micro-economic reform, their commitment to higher productivity, their commitment to greater competitiveness of the nation, and their arguments about international trade barriers and things of that nature. I think morally that then they do not have a leg to stand on, and that is the best way to deal with them.
I have just got an ordinary Aussie's resistance to loading up legislation with penalties and fines and imprisonments where they are not necessary. This is not a criminal matter; this is a matter of civil interest, of social interest. These are inquiries. So, if you are conducting an inquiry, why would you gaol somebody if they said, `Look, I am not 
 prepared to come along'? There are many ways in which you can find out the information. We run away with ourselves a bit from time to time about how many times you can put people in gaol. As I say, this is not criminal matters at all; it is a matter of the nature of the economy. The ultimate farce that these penalties suggest is the old joke about economists: you could put all the economists in the world end on end and you still would not arrive at a conclusion. How many economists can you find that necessarily agree with one another? So compelling them to give evidence is not necessarily something that is necessarily going to enlighten us a lot.
—The difficulty is that they do not lie down.
—Let us not have open season on economists, because some of my best friends are economists. I think the amendment should go through so we get rid of this draconian, let's stick them in gaol whenever they lift up their head type of mentality.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—I actually think that one of the great outcomes of the debate on the Productivity Commission will be in attention to these matters of appropriate penalties. It was Labor that put these penalties originally in the Industry Commission Act—exactly the same ones—in sections 15 to 21. I do not blame them for that, because what we have discovered is that governments have been saying, `What is the appropriate penalty?' and the bureaucrats have been saying, `The previous bill was like this, so we will add it in.' I recall that in the very first debate we had on this bill, which was a long time ago, we asked the minister concerned, `What made you put these penalties in?' He looked around helplessly and he looked at the bureaucrats and said, `Was it you?' They looked behind them and said, `No.' What it meant is that they were merely carrying on a precedent.
As the Senate might recall but not all senators might recall, as a result of that we pushed for a reference to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, under the very able Senator Cooney, is now reviewing the matter of a consistency in 
 penalties and fines and gaol sentences and everything else across all Commonwealth legislation. We think that, firstly, the relative rules are not clear in that matter and, secondly, as Senator Margetts and Senator Cook have clearly indicated, at times they are very inappropriate. As the Senate knows, matters under consideration by a committee are privileged until tabled, so I cannot really reveal where the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is going to. As you know, I sit on it. But I can indicate that I think its report will advance considerably a better rationale for this kind of area. I am aware that the Senate regards that cross-party, independent and objective committee with a fair deal of regard. Very little politics and much principle come out of that committee, in my view.
Accordingly, Senator Cook, I have great regard for what you are trying to do, but I suspect you are jumping the gun and that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee will come back to the Senate and the government will be asked to reconsider a range of penalties and impositions on the community through bills such as this. I am personally uncomfortable, and was at the time, with the penalties within this bill. I understand that under its predecessor—and the advisers can probably advise the parliamentary secretary whether it is so—no-one was previously taken to task for breaching these rules.
I respect Senator Cook's fears, but those fears were not previously warranted under the independent Industry Commission and I am not sure that they are justified under what would be an independent Productivity Commission. I cannot see any reason why they would want to exercise these rules if they have not in the past. So my view is that I want to see what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee comes back with. I want to see some kind of standard rule applied in these matters that is available for us as senators to judge. I am not able to judge this in isolation, and accordingly I cannot support these amendments at this time.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I will be very brief. The signals have been exchanged. The Democrats 
 are going to support the government. We will lose the amendment. I just want to go down fighting.
—No other way.
—That is right. There is an issue here. If the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is going to look at it, why load the penalties in before it does so?
—Because they are your penalties. It just carries on.
—Let me come to that point in a second. Why load the penalties in before the Scrutiny of Bills has reported? You will commit the person to a death sentence, then you will decide whether hanging is a suitable way of dealing with those sorts of penalties and commute the sentence afterwards. Why don't we just knock it off now, see what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee says and consider what the right measure might be in the light of that report? That is the first point.
The second point relates to the interjection you made that we did it before, which disarms me and leaves me vulnerable to some extent. We did it before for the Industry Commission, but this is the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Committee all rolled into one, and has had added to it wider and more sweeping powers. This ain't the animal that used to have those provisions; this is an entirely different beast. If it were appropriate for that animal—maybe it was; I have some reservations about that, even though we may have done it in government—it does not automatically follow that for an entirely different beast it is, ergo, appropriate. I put those arguments on the record.
We have to get out of this mind-set in this country that people ought to go to gaol at every turn. This is a heartfelt sob story from me. Before I came into this place, I spent many years as an industrial advocate appearing before the Arbitration Commission. This is an analogous situation.
—We were worried you were about to say, `Many years in gaol.'
—No. I was there on an occasion when someone called an arbitration 
 commissioner a name which he did not like and this person was charged with contempt of court. This was a matter not of criminality; this was an argument over what is right and what is wrong, with people holding passionate but subjective views about right and wrong, and matters of degree. When you put someone on the bench that has those powers, they exercise them. An issue that could have been settled in the public interest, because it was about arbitrating on a matter of salary and working conditions, got entirely diverted into an argument about whether the individual was right to express this view or whether the bench was appropriate in its response. You got out a great big steam driven hammer to squash a gnat—not a Nat in the sense of those who sit over there.
The point about this is that you invite yourself into a very alien territory once you start on matters of social policy threatening to put people in gaol. This does smack of those places in the world where, if you have a different view from the status quo and get up and say it, you risk being in contempt or committing an offence. Then they can say, `But the rule of law requires.' It seems to me that we ought not to have this clause and that my amendment should be carried. I hope that last contribution to this debate has persuaded you. I suspect, reluctantly, given your rather fixed and firm view on this, that it has not. It is a pity for Australia if it has not.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—I will make a quick retort to that. When we had the detailed discussion of this point in the previous committee stage some months ago—I do recall standing here with the same people in the advisers box—it was my suggestion that we send this matter off and have it looked at in some detail. I will not fight over whose idea it was, because I am sure it is on the historic record, the Hansard . I am glad that Senator Cooney's committee is doing it. It is a committee that is respected.
There are a number of things that the government does that seeks information from people, from corporations and from entities where there are fines involved. I am sure 
 Senator Murray knows more about that now, if he is involved in that inquiry, than I do. I do know that things such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has given me some authority to assist him in administering, do have a lot of penalties. I have not checked as to whether they have gaol as one of those penalties. I suspect they do.
—Six months?
—I am not sure about that. Again, one might say, `If you fail to give some information about how many bed nights you had in your hotel at Margaret River or whatever and you do not send the form back to the ABS within so many months, you go to gaol.' As Senator Cook says, the Aussie with the concept of a fair go would think that is not very fair. I know, as the parliamentary secretary with responsibility for the ABS, that a lot of the people who write me letters do not think that the powers the ABS has got are in tune with the sort of information the government is seeking. I think you could make out a case that, with this commission, that may be so as well. There is a case on the other side. The Australian Bureau of Statistics could say that we would never have good information to make government policy if we did not have all of that information collected broadly. I think the Industry Commission does have a similar case in relation to the sorts of penalties that apply here.
As I said in a previous debate, the penalty of gaol for not complying, as far as we can see, has never been applied. The point has already been made by Senator Cook that it was in the Industry Commission Act, which was reviewed as recently as 1990. Senator Cook voted for these penalties then. I am glad to see that he shares my view that it is time to review them. The government believes, as the Democrats do, that we will leave the existing regime in place and have a thorough review of these sorts of penalties so they are in line with what the community would expect in 1998.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendments (Senator Cook's ) be agreed to. 
",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The reason I seek to 
 oppose clause 62, page 37, lines 17 to 20, is that this empowers the Productivity Commission to impose fees for services. I think this is going a bit too far. This body exists to provide public information and to encourage reform in Australia, and this body conducts inquiries for the public good.
I know `fees for service' and `users pays' are in vogue phrases, but this body, to have any real force and stature—let alone prestige—in the community, has to disseminate what it does. People need to understand what the strength of its findings are and what the processes are. They are all matters of important public interest. For those reasons, I do not think the provisions should stand. The fee for services provision should be defeated. 
I conclude by quoting from page 4, part 2, of the Productivity Commission Bill—Establishment and functions of Productivity Commission. Part 2, clause 6, sets out several functions of the commission. Function (f) of the commission is:
to promote public understanding of matters relating to industry and productivity.
It will, but you have to pay for it. Function (g) is:
to perform any other function conferred on it by this Act.
So the government refers a matter of public importance, the commission inquires and brings down a report. You can find that out if you are prepared to pay for it. Function (h) is:
to do anything incidental to any of the preceding functions—
as long as you can pay for it.
My basic intention is that the commission sits there as a taxpayer funded body for the purpose of improving the economy. It relies on analysis, study and submissions by industry partners and governments. What its deliberations are and what its conclusions come to be are matters of public importance and should be available to the community on that basis. The analogy that comes into my mind—and since the participants in this debate until now have all been Western Australian senators, albeit from various parties— 
—Very productive.
—Yes, we get work done a bit quicker, I think. But the analogy that comes to my mind is with the Western Australian government's transport minister, who has a plan for the redevelopment, as I understand it, of the transport arrangements in the Kwinana area. He has it open for public comment, but you have to pay $637 to see it.
—I think it was reported to be $20,000.
—It was $20,000, was it? The public can comment on it as long as they are prepared to pay an exorbitant amount of money in order to see what it is that the government is proposing. That is a ridiculous situation. It flies in the face of the ability of people to participate democratically in the planning process. And that situation is analogous with the proposal of this new body to charge for matters in the public interest. I conclude by saying that it is a taxpayer funded body and its findings should be available to all, not just those who can afford to pay for it.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—The Greens (WA) are certainly prepared to support this amendment. The issue of public understanding often means that the issue of public knowledge is what we are dealing with. The example  that Senator Cook gave involved several hundred dollars. We have worse examples of that where people are being asked to pay $1,000, or sometimes even up to $20,000, for information that is available to industry or to government participants within a consultation process. But community groups who are really voluntary—holding raffles and cake stalls to continue operating—are shut out of the process by virtue of the amount of money they have to pay on a user pays basis. That certainly is not conducive to good decision making and is not conducive to any participative democracy process.
I would also like to say that, in relation to the vote we have just taken, I was very pleased to see that the Labor Party is prepared to support, on occasions, votes on principle, unlike ways they have acted in relation to same sex couples. Let us hope that in the future the Labor Party will act like that in 
 relation to same sex couples and not just in relation to reducing penalties and prison sentences.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—We are debating the Labor amendment that would delete the Productivity Commission's charging regime. This provision puts into the legislation a practice that was carried out for most of the past 13 years under the previous Labor government. The Industry Commission, for example, undertook a range of studies that had been commissioned by parties that were outside the Industry Commission's work that had been referred by the government or from other places. Examples of this were the studies undertaken by both the New South Wales and South Australian governments into their electricity industries. Clearly, in relation to the New South Wales electricity industry, the recommendations have been accepted by the Premier, if not by his caucus.
In those sorts of cases where the previous Industry Commission undertook work, it did so on a fee for service basis, which I do not think anyone could object to. The fact that it is a taxpayer funded body should reinforce the fact that if it does do work for bodies on request—special project type work, which is what is envisaged by this—there should be a fee for service. Otherwise, the Commonwealth taxpayer would be subsidising the benefit that potentially the New South Wales or South Australian governments in these cases would receive from that work. So it gives legislative enablement to a practice that was carried out, as I am informed, for many years under the previous government, and a practice that to the government makes sense. That is why we recommend the bill as it stands.
—The question is that clause 62 stand as printed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill, as amended, agreed to.
PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION (REPEALS, TRANSITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1996
Bill agreed to.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-30,"—Let me say at the outset that if any bill or any process exposes the government's inadequacies, it is this particular one. We on the non-government side of the parliament are extremely disappointed at the manner in which this bill is back before us today. Let us get it clear: this is a non-contentious bill in many respects. In many ways, it is identical to the bill that the Labor government introduced in the previous parliament. Its enactment has been and continues to be a common goal of all in this place.
In terms of a brief history, let us go back to the last time we debated this bill in the Senate. If we do, we see that in that debate opposition and other non-government senators made a number of suggestions and a number of constructive amendments were put for 
 ward—all designed to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of the process of making legislative instruments.
What we are talking about here, and I think it goes without saying, is the exercise of the legislative power of the Commonwealth. It follows that it must be the parliament, not the executive, that has the ultimate say and control in the making of these instruments. However, what we have here is the government refusing to accept the Senate's amendments on the basis that it—the executive—claims to have the right to determine these matters. Not only does it refuse the Senate's amendments, but it has also refused to involve itself in any constructive process to try to get some compromise in this process.
When this government claims the mandate—the right—for itself to determine these matters, let us look at it in the context of this government's operation. This is a government which has reduced accountability of the executive through reductions in legal aid, through its intentions in admin review and through what it has done to offices like the Environmental Defender's Office. It has reduced public scrutiny of government by reductions to public broadcasters like the ABC. This is a government that has form when it comes to making itself immune from the scrutiny of the public and the parliament. I would have thought—given that this bill, as amended, reflected concerns in this place on the excesses of the executive—that it should have involved itself in a constructive process.
There is a way through this. We on the non-government side have sought to take a constructive approach to this bill. My office and, I am sure, the offices of many others in the Senate, have been involved in discussions with government officials, and we have raised with them our genuine concerns about the operation of various aspects of the bill. It must also be placed on the record that the government's advisers have, to a greater or lesser extent, recognised that, in respect of a number of factors, advances could have been made over the intervening period. For instance, those advisers regard at least some of the Senate's concerns as being legitimate. They recognise that in some cases, particular 
 ly in relation to the proposal for the sunsetting of legislative instruments, there can be a regime designed which is consistent with the government's policy as well as the concerns of the Senate.
But we come here today and, once again, we see that the government has failed to pick up one single amendment moved and agreed upon by the Senate in the last debate. Not one. It is unbelievable that we come here on a bill which, important though it might be for the parliamentary process, is not one that has triggered much excitement in the electorate. But we have here a situation where the government, if this bill were to be amended again, would have a double dissolution trigger. Little Johnnie with the little triggers.
—Order! Senator Bolkus, that is an inappropriate way to refer to the Prime Minister.
—It depends on whom I was referring to.
—I think the intention of your comments was clear.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, if you take it as a reference to the Prime Minister, then I withdraw it. But may I say it is a completely ridiculous situation that we have a possible double dissolution hinging on how we handle this particular bill.
The other concern we have on this side is that the Attorney-General seems to be at the core of the problem. He says that he does not understand the concerns that the Senate has about the bill in the current form, but we had hours of debate on this legislation last time. There have been numerous meetings to try to achieve a compromise. You would have thought he would have been listening. My concern is that either he was not listening, or he does not understand what is going on, or that this Attorney-General, as in many other circumstances, is afraid to tackle this issue; he is afraid to go back into cabinet, he is afraid to confront the Costellos and the Howards of the world and he is afraid to say to them, `Let's make some compromises' on what could very well be some minor issues.
We are now confronted in the Senate with the question: what do we do? Do we give the government a double dissolution trigger on a bill that the public does not know about? Do we defer this legislation? Do we try to amend it again? My suggestion is—and this will be worked through later in the debate—that we should encourage the government to think about the amendments we put up last time. The best way to encourage them to think constructively about those amendments is to give them a bit more time to do so. In terms of doing that, I will be moving, later in this debate, an adjournment of this bill to next week to give the Attorney-General some time to think about ways through, compromises and outcomes that can be acceptable to all involved in this debate.
 The Leader of the Government in the Senate approached me just a little while ago and suggested that it might be opportune to defer the vote until tomorrow to give him some time to see if a way through can be developed, to see whether amendments can be put on the table. I suggest to senators that that may be a better way to go: that at the end of the second reading debate we defer consideration of the second reading vote and that I defer until tomorrow my amendment to consider the bill next week, to give the Leader of the Government some time to try to fix up the mess that the Attorney-General seems to be incapable of fixing.
As I said, all we need here is a small amount of goodwill from the government. We say to them: if you are interested in talking, we are. I know other non-government senators have been as well. In the absence of any constructive discussions, let me say that we are intending to move again the amendments that we moved last time—I am sure others will also be moving the amendments they moved last time.
For instance, the amendment in respect of the use of non-sexist language seems to have attracted a bit of publicity. It is interesting to go through the government's response on that to get an indication of where they are coming from in respect of the bill. When amendments 1320 and 1322 were originally moved by the Australian Democrats—and they still simply 
 require that non-sexist language should be used in the drafting of a legislative instrument unless there is a specific intent to distinguish between people on the basis of their gender—the government indicated that it had no objection to these amendments in principle and noted also that this was a current practice. In particular, the Attorney-General stated:
Since the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Clearer Commonwealth Law drafters have been ensuring that gender neutral language is used in all new provisions and any amendments of existing legislation.
So we are told it is happening. Then the government goes on to say that, because this is already in practice, an amendment is unnecessary. If amendments of this nature were being complied with in practice, then I can see no reasonable basis for the government refusing to accept them. Rather, these amendments serve as an important reminder of the principle that people should not be unnecessarily discriminated against on the basis of their gender. Language is one of the most powerful means of communicating power relationships within a society. So there are good reasons that this amendment should be maintained.
We need to seriously question the government's alleged commitment to obtaining an outcome of gender equity. The failure of the government to accept this amendment can be put down either to their stubborn desire to build up the double dissolution armoury or to the Attorney-General, once again, being set upon by the Prime Minister who does not like the use of gender neutral language, as he does not like the use of the term `multiculturalism'.
We will proceed to ensure that the Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate to the effect that an instrument is not legislative in character is subjected to the amendments we moved last time. We will also move amendments to ensure that environmental matters are listed as a matter of concern in the legislative instruments proposal—that is one that I am sure we will be debating in the second reading and committee stages. There are a number of amendments we moved regarding exemption from consultation which 
 we will be proceeding with again this time, as we will in respect of a number of procedural matters, partial disallowances, inter-governmental schemes and sunset clauses. I indicate, at this stage, that we will not be proceeding with the amendment that we moved last time in respect of the Quarantine Act.
In a number of these areas, including sunset clauses and inter-governmental schemes, we made it very clear last time in the debate that we were prepared to talk to the government to see if we can achieve a compromise outcome—given the fact that in both of those matters in particular, we, though concerned, did not have the same degree of concern as other non-government senators in this place. But we have not had any response at all to indicate that the government is serious and, as a consequence, as I said earlier, I will be moving a deferral later on in the debate. I could go on and discuss the specifics of all of these amendments, but I think it is probably best to do so in the committee stage of the bill.
I must also mention the government's attempt, through amendments here, to try to pre-empt the debate on the Public Service Bill 1997 [No. 2] . The government, as part of its proposals in respect of public sector reform, is also seeking to exclude various legislative instruments relating to public sector terms and conditions from amongst those instruments which are disallowable. Those instruments are currently disallowable; the government wants to make them not so. The government knows that its reforms are not acceptable to the Senate. The Public Service Bill [No. 2] will continue to be debated as a possible dissolution trigger. But, let me say, we are not going to let the government try to do through this bill, in part, what they are seeking to do through the Public Service Bill [No. 2] 1997.
We will renew our concern about the provisions the government is putting up. I do say, once again, this is symbolic of the government's lack of capacity to think on its feet. We have put up a number of constructive amendments, a number of proposals. We have been awaiting a government response, which does not seem to be coming. Hopeful 
 ly, this debate will trigger some movement from the government side.
In closing, I move:
At the end of the motion, add "", and that consideration of the bill in committee of the whole be an order of the day for Tuesday 7 April 1998"".
I indicate, given the Leader of the Government's request, that I may later in the debate seek to have consideration of the amendment deferred until tomorrow morning.
Sitting suspended from 6.29 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-30,"—I rise for the second or third time to address the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2] , which has been sent back to us from the House of Representatives. It is with some concern that I see this bill put before us again because the amendments that the Senate came to have a view on were at the end of an exceptionally informed and exceptionally carefully argued debate. I recall Senator Harradine at the time saying that it was one of the better debates of the year. It concerned a bill which all the parties of the Senate were in agreement with; that the bill was a valuable addition to the legislative range that the government had before us.
The bill represented a significant improvement in the law making processes of this country, and a number of speakers commended the government for its introduction. It did indeed have a long cross-party history in its development, and the coalition government was regarded well for bringing in the bill. However, there were some critical areas with which the Senate was concerned, and it passed a series of amendments to which the House of Representatives disagreed. But the House of Representatives did not disagree with them on a considered basis; it was a holistic rejection of the views in the Senate.
The House of Representatives is sometimes described as the House of the executive. In both houses the government of the day has a minority of votes in the sense that the coalition were elected with 47 per cent of the vote in the House of Representatives and have 65 per cent of the seats. Because they have 65 per cent of the seats, they are able to domi 
 nate by numbers and to determine what goes through that House. In the Senate it is not the same. They have 44 per cent of the vote and 50 per cent of the seats. Here they are forced by the circumstance of near proportional representation to deal with the 56 per cent who did not vote for them.
That outcome is nevertheless always twisted in favour of the government. This Senate to date has passed nearly 340 bills since the coalition came to office. Many of those bills have gone through unamended and a number of them have gone through amended. Now and again there is a bit of arm-wrestling with the House of Representatives. It is very rare—indeed, only six or seven bills have been under consideration in recent times on that basis—for the House to reject completely the Senate's considered view.
When you are dealing with a bill which goes to the very heart of regulation and government in this country, when you have a bill which deals with legislative instruments in their broadest sense in terms of all the regulations, all the rules, all the machinery of government which governs our lives—in many respects far more precisely and in a far more detailed fashion than do the laws which govern this country—you would expect the House of Representatives to view the consideration of the Senate with some discretion, with some judgment and with some maturity. But, no, this is a bill where the schedule of the amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives disagreed runs to 11 tightly typed pages.
It is quite an extraordinary act of executive arrogance. I often think that is affected by the character of the personalities involved, because not everyone in the government exhibits executive arrogance or an inability to maturely contemplate the Senate's approach. But the House of Representatives undoubtedly has this top-down approach whereby people within the cabinet campaign for their bill, the cabinet then agrees to it and imposes their will on the party which, in turn, imposes their will on the House of Representatives as a whole.
When it comes to a situation such as we are faced with today, where this bill has been 
 presented to us yet again as a double dissolution trigger, you have to wonder at the motives and intent of the government in the way in which they have dealt with this bill. In the most extraordinary act of inconsistency, they have even rejected amendments made to this bill about, for instance, gender equality which they have accepted in the Acts Interpretation Act. It is a most extraordinary situation.
So even in minor and relatively uncontentious areas, they have disagreed with matters which were agreed on other bills by the House of Representatives. What this represents is a style and an arrogance of approach which does not give credit to the very careful way in which these amendments were debated, considered and passed by the Senate. We would hope that none of us would expect the government to accept all the amendments that we put, but to accept none, to reject 11 pages: are they the fount of all wisdom? Are they absolutely impervious to someone else's argument, to a view presented and agreed to by a substantial number of people with an alternative viewpoint? Is there such a black and white issue that all of this should have been rejected?
The original debate was on 24 September, six months ago. I clearly heard and I accord with the view of Senator Bolkus, who said, `We said at the time to government that we would be prepared to negotiate over this bill, because at its heart it is a good and welcome bill.' I am paraphrasing what he said. The Australian Democrats have the same view. Yet six months later here we are being pressured to accept this bill. For us all in this place, this is not now a double dissolution trigger; it is irrelevant. The double dissolution trigger was provided earlier by the unfair dismissals legislation. This bill we will consider entirely in terms of principle and in terms of the contribution an amended bill can make to better government in this country.
A key component of the rule of law is accessibility to those rules and the consistency in their application, transparency and control. This Legislative Instruments Bill, at its heart and in its detail, promises just such a thing. In September I quoted Senator O'Chee, the National Party Whip, who is a recognised 
 parliamentary authority in the Senate on matters of regulation. I quoted him as saying in his report:
The executive can then make laws it likes under that particular provision without parliament even knowing, far less having the opportunity to disallow the instrument.
He went on to say:
This instrument represents a serious diminution of the rights of parliament.
It is for that reason that the Labor Party originated this process of reviewing the way in which regulations were conducted, and the coalition carried it forward. It was for that reason that all parties complimented the government for bringing forward legislation which would represent a significant improvement in the law making processes of the country.
But there were areas which provided us with serious concern. One of those areas was the sunsetting provision. On the face of it, it was an awfully attractive provision to wipe out sets of regulations which have accumulated and may have had their use-by date; but in the process were threatened regulations on social justice, human rights, environmental matters, social matters, economic matters, health and safety matters—the list is endless—which contribute to the fact that our society is so highly regarded internationally. We sometimes forget as Australians, but those of us who have not always been Australians do not forget, what a wonderful country this is. The standards, the nature of the way in which things are run, the very essence of the civilised rules and methods that we use to govern our society may be far from perfect but they are far, far better than many other societies have. That is contributed to by the laws and the regulations under which we live.
You merely have to travel to other countries, and they do not have to be Third World countries, to see the difference between our society and other societies. That is contributed to by the laws and regulations which Australians have put together in the House of Representatives and the Senate over many years and to which we in this chamber play our small part. Any legislative instruments bill which threatened that in any way would obviously 
 raise alarm bells. So we and the other non-government parties in this place were extremely concerned about such provisions as automatic sunsetting provisions, because they had the downside as well as the upside. They sought to take away things we value.
The bill does seek to reform the procedures for making, scrutinising, publishing, amending and repealing subordinate legislation. It subjects such regulations more clearly and comprehensively to parliamentary review and disallowance. It establishes a single register of delegated legislation. It introduces public notice and consultation procedures for changes to delegated legislation affecting business but not wider regulations, and we were concerned about that. It provides for the back-capture of existing subordinate legislation and placement on the register. It provides parliamentary scrutiny of all forms of delegated legislation, with each instrument to be tabled in each house of parliament. There are many credible aspects and many welcome aspects to this bill.
As a Senate, speaking for my party, under no circumstances do we wish to attack the heart and intent of this bill. But it is not perfect and there are areas which cause us great concern. Because this is as important to regulations and rules as the Acts Interpretation Act is to our laws, it is an absolutely vital bill to get right. The Senate as a whole, we think, did that job. Nine closely typed pages of amendments were rejected. The last few of the 11 pages contain those which the House of Representatives has further passed. We urge the government to take up the offer made by the Labor Party and by us to further negotiate on those areas of the bill which cause the Senate concern.
Senator Colston is another expert in this area of regulation. I think he is a former chair of that committee. He, too, put forward some critical amendments. The Australian Democrats did and the Labor Party did. I think the Greens (WA) did. A number of those amendments Senator Harradine moved were accepted. We think that in the interest of good government, seeing that this bill at its heart is a good bill, a number of those amendments are worthy of acceptance either in the form 
 the Senate put them or in a negotiated form which is acceptable to the parties that put them originally.
I find difficulty in understanding quite why there was such a wholesale rejection of the Senate's amendments, quite why there was such obduracy. I do not know whether it goes to the character of those who are dealing with this issue or whether it goes to the character of government. I do not think it goes to the character of the cabinet, because on some bills the cabinet argues forcefully and persuasively for negotiation and compromise and on other bills it is absolutely, arrogantly, aggressively recalcitrant. If that is not the style of the cabinet as a whole, it has to be influenced by those who have passage. I would have thought that in the last six months it should have been possible for those who have passage to reconsider their position and to perhaps approach this matter in a spirit of greater compromise.
I conclude by saying that the Australian Democrats believe that this bill in its intent and at its heart will contribute to better government in Australia. We recognise, in a way which other senators from all sides recognise but which probably is not appreciated in the community, that this is one of the most important bills that have been put before the Senate for many a long year because of its stretch, because of its impact, because of its reach into the heart of all that concerns our society. Regulations range from covering the safety features of the wheel nuts on your car, to how smokestacks are scrubbed, to how things are designed, to how our society is run and managed in its minutiae. We are of the opinion that, if the fatal flaws within this bill could be resolved, it would be a great monument to the coalition government's term of office.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—Much of the concern about the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2]  has already been expressed. If I recall correctly from my last offering in the second reading debate when this bill was presented to the Senate, I, like a number of other people in the Senate, actually quoted the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances 
 and the concerns expressed by that committee. We would have thought that in the interim the government would have taken those aside, looked at the opinions expressed by the Senate, representing the community in their electorates, looked at the opinions represented by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, taken them to heart and worked a way through.
As has been mentioned, this is a very important bill. We have statistics that show that much more legislation now is of the designated legislative type. The opinion of the Greens (WA) is that that means we need to have better systems and better scrutiny, not less. It is easy, if you have only a few a year, to keep an eye on things. But it is not so easy, if you have many hundreds coming out in various forms, to make sure that these are doing what the legislation was supposed to do, that they are abiding by promises of government or that they are not harming people the government said they were not going to harm.
We are given more and more legislation that really means the Senate is being asked to take a pig in a poke, basically. We are being told to accept the brief outline of something, whether it is native title or some other really important legislation. We find out later that the real impact on the ground is occurring in the form of regulations rather than being written into legislation in a form where it can be debated by the parliament.
To me, it seems that we are getting more and more three-year elected dictatorships. It is very sad that this early into a new government—it is still earlyish—it has already developed a sense of arrogance and takes a sort of `born to rule' approach. That should be corrected and nipped in the bud. This is an opportunity to do so, to tell the community that the government is interested and listening not only to them but also to their representatives in the Senate in terms of the necessity to protect the interests of the wider community, obviously the interests of the environment, the interests of those people who do not normally get the ears of ministers and so on.
This is what the parliamentary and democratic process is meant to give, but at the 
 moment we see the potential for that slipping away. This is not a small thing. Please, government, go back and reconsider. Please take the time to make sure that you have listened to the good advice that has been given by this wide range of people in the community and the parliamentary committee that was set up to look at this. One can only wonder whom the government is listening to if it is not listening to that wide range of concerns.
Like most people, I will be recommitting amendments to the bill and hoping for Senate support and hoping that we do not get a tantrum from the government in reply. We want mature government. We want sensible consideration of such an important issue.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2]  clearly is an important bill, as has been said. It goes very much to the issue of process. Process is what keeping a democracy going is all about. There is a balance to be struck between the three arms of government, and this bill is to be considered in that context.
It is clear that parliament, as has been said, can become dictatorial, and a balance must be struck between parliament and the executive. I quote Blackstone, who wrote in 1765:
It is highly necessary for preserving the balance of the constitution, that the executive power be a branch, though not the whole of the legislative. The total union of them, we have seen, would be productive of tyranny; the total disjunction of them, for the present, would in the end produce the same effects, by causing that union against which it seems to provide. The legislative would soon become tyrannical, by making continual encroachments, and gradually assuming to itself the rights of the executive power.
There is no doubt there is always the potential for that, but the reality is that, since the time that was written by Blackstone over 200 years ago, things have moved very much in favour of the executive, mainly through the party system, which, Mr Acting Deputy President, you, I and most people in this chamber have much to be thankful for. May it long continue, but it has been a vehicle for encroachments by the executive on the legislature.
This trend is very well captured by the present Chief Justice of the High Court—one 
 of the greatest chief justices of the High Court—Sir Gerard Brennan. He said in a Blackburn lecture to the Law Society of the ACT on 7 August 1990:
Apart from legislative debates, Parliament's continuing contribution to democracy is its holding of the Executive to public accountability. Moreover, it scrutinises proposed appropriations and delegations of power and reviews subordinate legislation . . .
That is one of the central roles of parliament: to look at the delegated legislation that is made by or through the executive. The greater control parliament has of instruments whereby that scrutiny can be carried out, the more parliament is able to do that. The less power it has, the less it can do the job it has to do.
I use one illustration of that which seems to me to be one of the problems in the Legislative Instruments Bill, which is currently before us, and that is provision 61(7). This was commented upon by that excellent body the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its Alert Digest No. 2 1998, which, I take it, everybody reads as soon as it is produced on Wednesday. I hope it goes straight down to the Attorney-General's Department and goes around the desks down there. I am sure you read it avidly, Senator Gibbs.
—Absolutely!
—I hope Senator Heffernan does, too, because it is an excellent publication. It comments upon 61(7), which deals with subordinate legislation which is common to a number of governments. It is very difficult to go through the process of getting agreement between a couple of governments, or more than a couple of governments, and then, having got that agreement, have it frustrated, as it would be seen, by parliament.
I do think that the trend to oust parliamentary jurisdiction in the area of national legislative agreements is a dangerous thing. In my view, 61(7) ought not be allowed to stand. Otherwise, how does parliament carry out its duty? If we are to trust parliament and if parliament is at the top of the system, we really cannot have a situation where it is unable to look at what the executive does. 
 After all, this parliament is the only federal body that is elected. There is no other body that is elected by the people at the federal level. The government is chosen from people who are elected here, and the judiciary is appointed.
When we are looking at a piece of legislation such as the Legislative Instruments Bill, we ought to come at it from that point of view. There will be a committee stage on this bill, and I hope some interesting discussion comes out of that. As has been said, the thrust of the Legislative Instruments Bill is the proper thrust. It is the result of a lot of work. I notice people here from the Attorney-General's Department. They deserve a lot of congratulations not only for getting the bill together but for having the patience to turn up here again and again, hear speeches, listen to criticism and then go away and try to get it into some sort of shape. They certainly deserve credit for that. They have done that over the life of governments of different colours.
This is not a party political bill. It is a bill that tries to wrestle with this relationship between the legislature and the executive, and it tries to do that in a very responsible way. Quite clearly, it has not quite got there. Hopefully, it will do that in the committee stage.
The Legislative Instruments Bill will ultimately become a bill of great significance, as all the speakers before me have said. We ought to debate during the committee stage the issues that have been raised. I am looking forward to that because, hopefully, we will be able to do something. As I said, I do not think it is a bill that needs to be approached on a party political basis. It is a bill that needs to be debated on the basis of what is the proper balance between the legislature and the executive. If the legislature loses much more of its scrutineering effectiveness, the courts will pick it up more and more as they have in the past.
This debate is of very significant moment. The issue of process always seems to be boring but it is always the most important. People often say, `What do you mean by process?' It means giving every issue that 
 comes up the proper consideration and the same consideration you give to any other issue. As I said, I now hope to participate in a very interesting committee debate.
Debate (on motion by Senator Heffernan) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The opposition is disappointed that the government has seen fit to reject all 52 amendments which the Senate made to these bills on 19 November last year. We are disappointed, too, that the government seems intent on turning this important legislation into a double dissolution trigger. The government, as the Senate would be aware, disagreed with the Senate's amendments on 5 December last year and laid the bills aside.
The bills that are now before us were introduced into the House of Representatives on 5 March, they were passed on 11 March and they were introduced into the Senate on 12 March. As Bob McMullan, the shadow minister for industrial relations, indicated in the debate in the House of Representatives, the opposition has already placed on the public record its position on these bills.
We regard the government's proposals as going far beyond simplification of a cumbersome 76-year-old piece of legislation. We see these bills as imposing radical changes on the Public Service—changes which will be to its detriment and to the detriment of the services it provides to governments and the public. We believe the bills go too far in enhancing the powers of departmental secretaries and turning 
 public service agencies into independent entities but not far enough in protecting the independence and the professionalism of the Public Service and the conditions of service of public servants.
We sought to redress this imbalance by moving a large number of amendments to the bills during the Senate debate in November last year. Many of these were successful. We did not seek to, as Dr Kemp has suggested, `dismantle the bill', nor were we guilty of `short-sighted obstruction'. We made a genuine attempt to preserve and protect those features of the Australian Public Service which have contributed to the high regard in which it is held at home and abroad. With the success of a large number of our amendments, we believe that we succeeded. Consequently, we supported the bill in the form in which it was amended by the Senate.
At the conclusion of the Senate debate, we publicly urged the government to resist the predictable knee-jerk reaction of outright rejection and to accept the Senate amendments in the same constructive spirit in which they were made. Of course, we need not have bothered—the knee-jerk reaction won out. As Dr Kemp proudly proclaimed in his second reading speech:
The government rejects outright those amendments . . . 
It really defies belief that the government could find unacceptable every single one of the Senate's 52 amendments. Are we to believe that the government does not see merit in a single amendment that was proposed in the Senate? Of course, that is not the case. The fact is that the government is not interested in considering these amendments.
They do not want negotiation or compromise on these bills. They want confrontation. They want a double dissolution. They want to add these bills to their stockpile of triggers. They are putting money on getting the bills in their original form via a joint sitting of parliament following a double dissolution election. They have taken the view that there is no need to settle for a compromised package when there is a chance that they will get the whole package by these means.
We have reason to believe that the government, in fact, could actually have lived with all but two of the Senate's amendments. The first is the amendment to clause 33 to retain the existing system of tripartite review committees to determine appeals relating to promotion, redeployment, inefficiency or misconduct. The government has claimed that we are attempting to take appeal rights in the Public Service back to where they were prior to 1988. We are not. It was not and is not our intention to expand the powers of those committees or the scope of current appeal rights. We have made it clear that we will support regulations to preserve the status quo.
The second amendment prescribes workplace agreements in the APS. The government appears to have overlooked the fact that this amendment also provides for regulations which may prescribe exemptions in relation to particular categories of APS employees, for example, SES employees. It specifically contemplates AWAs for the SES. The government also appears to have overlooked its original position on AWAs in the Australian Public Service, which was set out by the then minister responsible for the Public Service, Mr Reith, in his November 1996 discussion paper `Towards a Best Practice Australian Public Service'. He said:
AWAs are likely to be a particularly favourable option for discrete categories of employment . . . for example . . . Senior Executives.
But certified agreements `are likely to continue to be the most prevalent form of agreement for APS agencies'. The Senate's amendment would simply give effect to that intention. The government, in our view, is to be strongly condemned for its confrontationist approach on this legislation, and, of course, it ought to be condemned for using a bill on a matter such as Public Service reform as a double dissolution trigger.
The Public Service in Australia serves governments of either political colour. Its structure and administration is as much the concern of the opposition, the alternative government, as it should be of the government. If reforms are to be enduring, they must be acceptable to the opposition. If ever there were a case for a government to negotiate a 
 reform package with an opposition, instead of seeking to impose it, we have it in this legislation.
The government will, of course, claim that it was open to compromise and demonstrated that by accepting the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This ignores the fact that the government controls the numbers on that particular committee and that the committee chose not to take up some of the more contentious issues that were raised during the course of its public hearings. Dr Kemp was similarly disingenuous in informing us in his second reading speech that the government amendments—the ones that were reflecting the JCPA's recommendations—were accepted without dissent by the House of Representatives.
The opposition made it clear in joining the JCPA consensus on its report and recommendations that we did not believe that those recommendations went far enough in remedying the defects in the government's proposals. We indicated at that time that we would go further in seeking to amend the bills in the Senate—and, go further, we did. While we did not achieve all the changes we sought, in the event we were able to support the bills in the form in which they were amended by the Senate.
The government's absolute unwillingness to take account of the views of the Senate, or to accommodate the views of the alternative government, is made crystal clear in the changes that it has introduced by administrative means. These are set out in Dr Kemp's press release of 25 February this year which was entitled `Government to bypass Senate on Public Service Reform'. If that is indeed the case, you really wonder why they are now wasting the Senate's time by bringing the original bill back.
One of the changes the government has made by administrative means is the introduction of Public Service values. That is, I accept, an important element of the government's legislative package and one, I think it is important to add, that the opposition has always consistently supported. The values underpin the operation of the Public Service. But when those values—which are set out in 
 clause 10 of the bill—were debated in the Senate in November, the Senate made changes to one of them and included four additional values. Did the government take any account of those changes? Of course they didn't. They went ahead and introduced their original set unchanged. That is very indicative and symptomatic of the approach that they have taken on this bill.
The opposition simply does not support the government's view, which is expressed in this legislation and in Dr Kemp's public statements, that the government's IR prescriptions for the private sector are equally appropriate in the public sector. We do not accept it and we do not believe that is the case. In his second reading speech, Dr Kemp appealed to the community to support this contention. He asserted, on what basis we have absolutely no idea:
The community also expects that its public service will be subject to the same workplace arrangements as apply to the rest of the workforce.
The opposition takes the view, which we believe is probably shared by very many in the community—the same community of course that Dr Kemp cites—that this is a very grossly simplistic notion from Dr Kemp.
There are some very basic differences between the private sector and the public sector, which this legislation does not adequately recognise. Put simply, the private sector is motivated by profit and, as a result, has a very ready-made indicator of productivity. The public sector is not motivated by profit, nor does it generally generate profit. Productivity therefore can be extremely difficult to measure in the public sector. That particularly applies to Public Service departments. They cannot and should not be treated like private sector enterprises.
If Dr Kemp actually believes that this bill—to quote his words in the second reading speech—`is all about making the Public Service more efficient and effective and delivering better service to both the government and to the public', perhaps he would do well to ponder the words of Dr Michael Keating in his article in the November-December edition of the Australian Quarterly. Dr Keating is very critical of the govern 
 ment's policy that pay for all agencies funded by the budget should be linked to achieved improvements in the productive performance of each agency and of its refusal to supplement any pay increases in the public sector by increased budget funding. He maintains this policy is flawed because of its failure to recognise the fundamental differences between the private and the public sectors.
Dr Keating says that the introduction of productivity bargaining in a large part of the public sector risks damaging morale, and consequently performance, rather than enhancing it. He maintains that the policy of refusing to supplement budget funded agencies for pay increases will destroy over time the public sector and will greatly reduce the value of the services they produce. Regrettably, this is where we believe the government is heading with these bills—not towards greater efficiency and better services but towards inefficiency and poorer service. We will not be accomplices in that particular process.
We will again be moving those of our amendments which were accepted by the Senate in November last year. If they are moved, we will be supporting the two successful Democrats amendments. We will accept the judgment of the Senate in relation to those amendments which were not successful when we previously debated these bills. If we are again successful with the amendments we put forward, we will accept the bills as amended. If the government again chooses to reject these amendments outright, so be it. It is the government that will have lost an historic opportunity to achieve enduring reforms which preserve the best of our Public Service. I commend the opposition's approach to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-03-30,"—The Public Service bills we are considering were passed by the Senate some four months ago now with a large number of amendments. They were returned to the House of Representatives, where the bill was laid aside. The bill, unamended, was passed again by the House of Representatives earlier this month and is presented to us again for approval. If the Senate again amends the bill, the government 
 has made it clear that it will be added to its stock of possible double dissolution triggers.
I first want to again restate the reasons why the Democrats regard the  Public Service Bill 1997 [No. 2]  as fundamentally flawed. Then I will return to the government's attempt to use this as a possible election trigger. The Public Service reform bills undermine the integrity and the independence of the Australian Public Service. They attempt to turn the Public Service into a creature of the government under the direct political control of the relevant minister. In our view, such an approach to running the Public Service is not in the national interest. We need a Public Service capable of providing free and frank advice to the government of the day, which assumes and upholds the highest possible ethical and professional standards and which does not become a party to grubby political point scoring.
As Professor Peter Hennessy of the University of London put it, the cornerstone of a successful Public Service was the giving of `fearless advice resting on top-class analysis'. He said that in this world of globalisation, `the prizes go to the flexible and the intelligent, and governments can be neither of those things if the outcome of policy making is the precooked, the palatable and the convenient'.
The Public Service must uphold and implement decisions of the government of the day—we recognise that—but it must do so in a way which is professional, service orientated and fully accountable to the public it services. This set of bills does not achieve this. Rather, these bills are about bringing all aspects of the Public Service, through its management system, under the direct control of the government. Service wide standards and protections are to be swept away while departments become the personal fiefdoms of the chief executive officer, appointed, dismissed and directed at the whim of the Prime Minister. This is not the sort of direction that Public Service reform ought to be moving in. Tightening political control through a tighter pay related management system will not increase individual commitment or professional services. Indeed, the exact opposite is likely to be the case.
The public servants whom I spoke to, as part of the focus work group with the then minister, Peter Reith, made it very clear that they wanted to see the Public Service change to become a better workplace where service quality was paramount. But that is not what the government has delivered. This bill will add to the frustration levels felt by public servants, add to the heavy weight of falling morale and add to the continuing brain drain of well qualified and gifted administrators and policy makers out of the Public Service.
In my speech in the second reading debate on 17 November 1997, when we first considered this bill, I outlined the main concerns of the Democrats, and I propose only very briefly to go through those again. We believe that it is inappropriate for Prime Ministers to hire and fire chief executive officers of departments and to fix their remuneration without public scrutiny. We do not believe that the bill adequately protects whistleblowers. We remain concerned that the bill is silent on the question of maintaining standards, accountability and quality in the APS services which are contracted out.
We do not support the removal of the right of public servants to appeal to an independent body on a wide range of matters. We do not support the breaking down of service wide employment standards, particularly by use of individual Australian workplace agreements.
I foreshadow that, in the committee stage, I will again be moving the amendments I successfully moved on the last occasion to prevent chief executive officers offering AWAs to employees. My amendments do allow disallowable regulations to determine that certain categories of employees are appropriate to become the subject of AWAs, but they ensure that such determinations are reviewable by the parliament.
The Democrats want to see public sector reform that focuses on quality of services provided and improving accountability to the public. But this bill does not achieve that. This bill does not enhance accountability to the public—only accountability to the minister and, of course, the politicians. Indeed, this bill is not about quality services but about control. It is a grasp for power and an attempt to free 
 up ministers from the important accountability mechanisms which have been designed to protect the independence of the Public Service and the principle that those appointments should be the most meritorious and not the most politically correct.
Since the House has refused to accept the bill as amended by the Senate last year, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, has moved to put large parts of the reform in place by administrative means. This he has largely achieved by use of delegations under the existing Public Service Act, the Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Workplace Relations Act. But the great cumbersome mass of the Public Service Act stays in place. So, what Dr Kemp has actually achieved is the worst of both worlds: all the detailed regulation of the current act and the negative delegations of authorities of the new bill, without any compensating changes to the accountability regime.
However, it does raise questions as to why the government is proceeding to establish this bill as a double dissolution trigger. As Mike Taylor noted in Sunday's Canberra Times, commenting on a speech by Dr Kemp just last week:
In other words, the Government can achieve virtually everything it wants, including giving agency heads greater flexibility and autonomy in financial management, without having to accept the Opposition and Australian Democrat amendments to the Public Service Bill . . . The Howard Government may choose to use the Public Service Bill as a double dissolution trigger, but the outcome is irrelevant.
There is, anyway, a very real doubt about whether this bill can form a double dissolution trigger at this point. The Clerk of the Senate, in two pieces of advice, has argued that the government's decision to lay this bill aside in the House rather than to send it back with its amendments insisted upon did not properly constitute the first limb of a double dissolution trigger.
Indeed, the clerk has some pretty good backing for his opinion. The only time the High Court considered the issue of what constitutes a double dissolution trigger was in 1975, and the lead judgment by Chief Justice 
 Sir Garfield Barwick lent very strong support to the clerk's argument. Sir Garfield's judgment suggests that the determination of when a conflict between the two houses occurs will be determined by reference to the actions of the two houses, having regard to their usual parliamentary procedures and practices. Indeed, the trigger was not formed in his view until `the processes which parliamentary procedure provides have been explored'. He noted that, when the House disagrees with amendments, it is usual practice for those to be returned to the Senate with a message, and he suggests that that is when the conflict commences.
The government did not follow the usual practice when it declined to send the bill back with a message in September. So, as a double dissolution trigger, this bill remains under a cloud. If we proceeded to a double dissolution, and then to a joint sitting and passed the bill, there is very considerable doubt about whether this bill would survive constitutional challenge in the High Court. This must be very cold comfort to the five or six coalition senators, including Senators Bill O'Chee and Sandy Macdonald, who would be guaranteed to lose their seats in a double dissolution election.
For our part, the Democrats are quite happy to fight an election on this bill, amongst other issues. The government has comprehensively broken all of its election promises in respect of the Public Service. It promised that there would be no slashing of jobs beyond the 2,500 needed to pay election promises; instead, we have seen 27,000 Public Service jobs gone. It promised public servants that their superannuation entitlements were safe; instead, it now proposes to close down that scheme. It promised that the Public Service would remain a source of non-partisan, loyal and objective professional advice to the government; that promise also certainly has not been fulfilled by this bill. Also, it promised to retain a Public Service and Merit Protection Commission; again, that promise has not been delivered. This is hardly a record to go to election on, and this is why the Democrats do not fear an election based on public service issues.
In conclusion, the Democrats have not changed their mind on this bill; we still think the bill is unsupportable. We will support the same set of amendments passed by the Senate on the last occasion. And, as we did at the third reading on the last occasion, we will vote against the bill at the final stage—because, even amended, this bill fails to meet what we regard as a minimum standard for fair and proper public service reform.",SENATE,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-30,"—We are dealing again with the Public Service Bill and its associated bills. They are the legislative outcome of the government's agenda to gut the public sector of this country. When you peel away the layers of government rhetoric it is obvious that, basically, when the government says international best practice or international competitiveness it equates these with lower wages and conditions for workers and lower standards in areas such as environment protection, occupational health and safety, and food hygiene.
I will not go through all the arguments that I used last time because they still apply. But what we are seeing are more examples of very high wages paid to people at the top in order to achieve fewer jobs and lower conditions for those people who are actually doing the jobs or providing the services. We are seeing particularly bad treatment of those people who have had years of experience in meeting the special needs of the public sector. We have ridiculous situations where, in order to follow along the mantra of privatisation, we have those people who have left the public sector with particular expertise being hired back for many times their previous salary. A great saving that is: we have one person who used to work there before now being employed at the expense of several others who could perhaps have done the legwork to go with that consultative advice.
The last time the Senate considered this bill I moved two sets of amendments. These were not supported and I can see the numbers in this chamber are against me. Those amendments were in relation to the tenure of the clerks and to clause 57; that is, the appoint 
 ment of the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
We heard, in the recent Senate estimates hearings, the Clerk of the Senate stating the following in response to a question from Senator Cooney about the impact of the 10-year non-renewable terms for the clerks:
That is part of the long-term potential problem that I see. The problem that I identified with the 10-year non-renewable term for the clerks of the houses is that the independence of those positions may be compromised by that provision. To put it bluntly, a person appointed to that position at a young age, at the end of a 10-year term, apart from the fact that they will have developed a great deal of expertise that will then be done away with—that is another issue, and you can argue that it facilitates other people coming along and developing their expertise and so on—is going to be looking for a job. If they accept a government position at the end of that 10-year term, that will lead people to wonder how independent that person has been when in the position of clerk of either house: has their advice over that period been influenced by the prospect of a government job at the end of their 10-year term? That is the problem which I see with the 10-year non-renewable term. That problem would be greatly exacerbated by some of the other proposals that were talked about such as a five-year renewable term or a two-year renewable term, something like that.
This is a concern shared by the Greens. It may only be about perceptions but that is, unfortunately, what politics is all about. If we are to have clerks who are truly independent and able to provide frank and fearless advice to all senators without any real or perceived influences we must have them on the same basis at least as a magistrate or similar judicial position—that is, until retirement. Unfortunately the Senate did not support us in this effort the last time.
The second amendment related to the transitional provisions for current heads of parliamentary departments. My amendment added a new subclause which limited the type of person who could simultaneously hold the position of secretary of two parliamentary departments for 90 days, after which the position would be declared vacant. That did not get the support of the Senate either. The ALP are only moving those amendments which were supported last time.
There are a lot of people in this country who depend on the outcome and the output of the public sector. There are many people who get upset when the accountability is removed from the public sector by the very vast rates of privatisation. This bill gives the government a greater ability to gut that sector. I think the community in general would be very concerned to know the details of this bill. There is no reason why the Greens should change their position, which was to oppose the bill when it was put to us on the previous occasion.",SENATE,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The words that have been said so far in this debate are all true. The attitude taken by the government in this matter is that the Public Service ought to be more competitive; that, unless you have the feeling that your job is not going to be there, you are not going to be as efficient as you might otherwise be. That approach appears from the second reading speech, and I want to go into that later on. The opposite proposition is that people need security, particularly in a profession such as public servant, to be able to give that independent advice and to be able to be conscientious about the task that they must carry out.
The selling of services and the selling of goods in the open market should, of course, be subject to competition. If somebody wants to produce a better lawn mowing service than another, so be it. If someone wants to sell cars at a cheaper price, so be it. If someone wants to do a cheaper job painting, fair enough. But that is not the nature of the Public Service. It is not a situation where competition ought to flourish; it is more akin to judging. Two great principles that we bring into our constitutional thinking are that judges should, firstly, have tenure and should not be able to be removed except in extraordinary circumstances and, secondly, that they should obtain a pension—not a superannuation payment but a pension—to be assured that they do not have to look to their future because the state will provide for them. Similarly, in this situation we have people who have to, in many ways, do the same thing as the judiciary—give fearless and 
 competent decisions. Therefore the whole thinking behind this particular bill is wrong.
None of this material is supported by evidence. Clause 10 of the bill deals with APS values—all of which are very admirable. For example, according to clause 10(g):
the APS delivers services fairly, effectively, impartially and courteously to the Australian public;
How that would be produced by competition, I am not sure. In any event, who is the Public Service in competition with? I notice that in the second reading speech, Senator Ellison said:
We acted quickly to develop new legislation in three areas crucial to the competitiveness of the APS:
Who is the APS going to compete with? Perhaps one indication of that is what has happened with the Australian Government Solicitor. The Australian Government Solicitor is now in competition with firms outside the government, which sounds good except that the only work they are able to compete for is the government's own work. They are not allowed to compete against the big firms that operate in Canberra and throughout Australia for the work that BHP, the banks or any private organisation might want to offer them.
When we talk about competitiveness, what is meant by this? We are to make a very significant change; in fact, as somebody said before, we are about to gut the Public Service. We are doing it on a basis that has no support in evidence and is supported simply by allegations. The second reading speech bears that out very clearly, because it consists of a lot of populist rhetoric, polemic and oratory. If you want an illustration of that, just look at it. For example, it says:
The opposition amendments do not recognise the increasing need for APS agencies to be freed from central controls and to adopt employment arrangements which meet their particular needs. This bill provides that flexibility.
What evidence is there that the Public Service, once it is freed from these central controls, is going to be better under the regime that is to be introduced by this bill if 
 it becomes law? On the first page of his second reading speech, Senator Ellison said:
The government will not be deterred—
It sounds as if the government will not be moved—
from completing its reform of the APS by the short-sighted obstructions of the opposition and minor parties. The effect of this obstruction is simply to frustrate the very many people in the Public Service who are keen to press ahead with a reform agenda in the development of which they have had an important role and which they see clearly is essential for building morale and opportunities for the future.
There is no evidence that any of that statement is true and correct, and yet it is on that sort of material that we are asked to change the Public Service.
Since I have been in the Senate, which has been for some years now, I have found that the Public Service does work well, it does give the advice that ought to be given and it is solicitous about the work it does. The evidence, from my point of view, is that the Public Service works very well indeed. There is nothing that I have heard in the debates—last year or in the second reading speech on this bill—to show anything to the contrary. What we have is a series of allegations without any indication of the basis on which they are made, and it is left as that.
Alan Kohler is quoted as supporting the proposition, but what does Alan Kohler know about the Public Service? What does he know, as distinct from some of the great public servants we have had in the past? In the second reading speech Alan Kohler, writing in the Age last year, is quoted as saying of the bill:
. . . the most uncompromising deregulation of the Public Service anywhere in the world. The bill lays down standards for ethical behaviour and impartiality, establishes the first code of conduct for public servants, sets up a process for accountability and scrutiny, and then lets the departmental heads run things as if they were corporate chief executives.
We do not want corporate chief executives running the Public Service; we want the mandarins. That is a term that was used, perhaps in a derogatory sense, but it does bear out what we are looking for: learned people 
 who are dedicated to serving the public and serving it well, people who have learning, people who have had experience and have sat at the feet of great public servants before them.
We do not want a corporate chief executive who, as Senator Faulkner said, is out there to make a profit and to drive his work force to the point where more and more money is made at the expense of a true service. A corporate chief executive produced the result in Auckland. A corporate chief executive produced the breakdown of electricity in Queensland. A corporate chief executive produced the problem with the sewerage works in South Australia. A corporate chief executive is someone who does not go that little extra to make sure that service is given no matter what the cost. A corporate chief executive is someone who will only give the service in so far as the cost enables him or her or it to make a profit.
The whole philosophy behind this bill is a bad philosophy. This is a bill that could be improved. It was improved last year by a lengthy debate. As I remember, the debate went for hours and I thought it was a very good debate. Yet there has been absolutely no sign from the government that there was anything of merit for them in that particular debate. As has been pointed out, what they have done is to produce a trigger for a double dissolution. That produces uncertainty and it is a great illustration of why uncertainty is bad, because the country, the parliament and the government itself does not run well when there is uncertainty as to how long it will have a life for, when the trigger is going to be pulled, what is going to happen or who is going to be in government a year from now.
Somehow, uncertainty is seen as being good for competition—that if people are uncertain they will strive more. I think that is a proposition that just defies experience. People function better when they are assured that their efforts will be respected and that they will be able to keep their job on the grounds of merit and not on the say-so of a chief executive officer or someone who has the power under the Australian workplace bill or otherwise, 
 whether in private enterprise or in the Public Service.
This bill is a real worry in terms of the basis it is put upon. If you look at the second reading speech, the second dot point at the bottom of page 3 says:
Australia needs a public service that can:
.	 benchmark itself against all sectors to determine what it does best, what it can improve, and what is more effectively delivered by the market;
What do you mean by that? Are you going to have judges put aside because the market can better deliver a decision? How is the market going to better deliver a reasoned and fearless piece of advice than is the present system?
I notice, too, that the rights of the public servants are going to be diminished. On the same page as I have just read from it says that this act is going to remove complex appeals arrangements. The idea of the appeals arrangements was to assure public servants that, if they did not get a job or they lost a job, there was a proper process by which their position could be protected, so that they could go about their job with a lot more confidence than they presently can. If you do not have an appeals process and you are simply hired and fired at the whim of a chief executive officer, then that certainty that you are entitled to—that certainty which is best for the public—disappears.
This is a worrying piece of legislation and a very worrying second reading speech. It is a second reading speech that relies in no way on evidence. It relies on a series of oratorical statements and a series of rhetoric which at times becomes quite popularist. There is much to be examined as we move into the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-30,"—Firstly, in concluding the second reading stage of this debate, I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions. I have been given the responsibility of taking this bill through the Senate in the absence of my friend and colleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Senator Chris Ellison, who is attending a conference in Melbourne today and again on Wednesday.
There had been some discussion before dinner that we would conclude the debate at the conclusion of my second reading summing-up and the vote on this, which was, I understand, at the request of the opposition. I have been told in the last few minutes that the opposition are prepared to go to the committee stage, so I will act on the latest bit of information to move along to the committee stage.
The main point that struck me in listening to the contributions of honourable senators opposite was the point that was made about the perception of some sort of intransigence by the government in not accepting any amendment. It sticks in my mind that Senator Murray, for example, said that there were something like 11 pages of tightly typed amendments and Senator Faulkner added the point that he was a bit amazed that the government could not find one amendment that improved the bill.
The government did look closely at what the Senate did to the bill. If you want to find the answer as to why the government did not accept the Senate amendments which were, for the most part, Labor Party amendments and some Democrat amendments, I think you need to look at Senator Cooney's comments in the penultimate speech in this second reading debate. His comments were about the philosophical divide between the Senate parties on this bill.
When you look at the flavour and the texture of the amendments that were moved, it was not as though it was a smorgasbord from which you could pick and choose. The amendments all had a very similar theme. It was very hard for the government to see how it could seek to further compromise in picking up further Senate amendments. Indeed, if you had listened to the second reading contributions tonight, you would think that the government had sought no compromise, no discussion and no consultation on this bill. That is far from the truth. The government did hold consultations with the relevant trade unions. I think it looked at the report of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and accepted all of the amendments proposed by that committee. Senator Faulkner seeks to 
 reduce the importance of that by saying that it is a government controlled committee. However, it is fair to say that there was input, as I am sure Senator Faulkner would recognise, from all parties on that committee.
The government put in place something like 30 changes to the legislation as a result of consultations with trade unions. The government has not been intransigent on this issue. Quite the contrary, we have made a lot of changes to the legislation over the time it was introduced to the parliament. There is, though, as Senator Cooney has said, a fundamental philosophical divide. Senator Cooney likes to say that the government wants the public sector to look like the private sector. Perhaps that is the way he perceives it. I am sure that he would not say that unless he did perceive it that way. Again, the reality is far from that.
The government—and this bill reflects that fact—sees that there are significant differences, and will continue to be and should be, between the way the private sector operates and the way the Public Service operates and should operate. Where the divide is quite fundamental is that the coalition government believes it is time for reform in the Australian public sector, that through reform we can achieve better performance. That better performance is not through some sort of vague guidelines; it is for performance for the benefit of the nation, for the benefit of all of our citizens and for the improvement in the way in which Australia is governed.
We believe this bill, if it is passed, will deliver on those objectives and will do so in a number of ways. I do not seek to go over the ground that has been covered in some detail by Senator Ellison's opening remarks in this debate or by Minister Kemp's his remarks in the other place. We seek to do this: we want to give more power to agency heads through devolution, but we want to put in place a legislative constraint on that through a number of acts, including the Workplace Relations Act, the Public Service Act, the Public Service regulations and directions from the commissioner, as well as the constraints provided by policy decisions and other parameters set by the government. We also match this devolution with increased 
 accountability arrangements which we believe are suited to the environment that we now operate within.
The government is committed to this reform. We believe that moving Australia into the next millennium, making Australia more competitive in our region and globally is vital to the chances of Australians, particularly young Australians, gaining employment. It is vital to have reform if we want to improve the living standards of Australia. You cannot just tell the private sector to get its act together, get more competitive, have better workplace relations, have a more efficient waterfront, have better transport systems, have a more efficient financial sector, have more competition between the banks, have more competitive Corporations Law—a whole range of reforms—and then say that the Public Service is quite okay and that the act under which it operates is as good as the day it was written.
We believe that reform to the Australian Public Service is as vital as reforms in the private sector economy. The two rely on each other. I do not think Senator Margetts was seeking to make the point for me, but she made a very good point: the Public Service does provide a lot of essential services not only in terms of the service it delivers to people who rely on the Commonwealth government for welfare or other payments but also a whole range of other services, and the policy advice from the central government agencies is all important.
It is vital that this still significant sector of the Australian economy is run very efficiently, that it is managed well and that managers can manage that sector of the economy. If you have an inefficient, badly organised and badly managed Australian Public Service, it drags down the rest of the community, it does not serve the citizens properly, it does not serve the citizens of the nation as effectively as it could do. Although there is a fundamental divide between the parties sitting opposite in the Senate on how you achieve that improvement in service, I am sure there is little doubt amongst any senators in this place that we want to maximise the benefits from the 
 Australian public sector to the citizens of Australia.
We seek to do it in this way. There is a fundamental divide. We believe the amendments passed by the Senate last time are detrimental to the achievement of the objective. That is why the government is standing firm. It is not because we have not looked very closely at what other parties are seeking to achieve. We have done that. We have rejected the approach that the majority in the Senate decided last time. There is a conflict, there is a stand-off, and that is why we are here some four months after the Senate looked at this matter before. 
With those closing remarks, I genuinely thank senators who have taken a very close interest in the process of this legislation. As Senator Cooney and many other senators have said, a lot of it is to do with matters that do not—as Senator Amanda Vanstone says from time to time—stop people in supermarkets to listen to the discussion about the structure of the public sector and how it is managed, but it is very important to Australia. I thank the senators who have taken a special interest in this debate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I rise to speak on the adjournment on a serious matter, something on which the government has shown very great and gross hypocrisy; that is, the use by the Howard government in a very partisan way of taxpayers' funds for party political purposes. This is the taxpayer funded propaganda service courtesy of the Department of Finance and Administration, the government members secretariat. I want to focus on some promotional material that has been provided tonight to the opposition from the government members secretariat. This material is presented first in a format with a cover sheet that is headed `Promotional Material'. I will quote quickly from it as follows:
Please find the following additional promotional material that has been prepared by the Government Members Secretariat for use in your electorate—
This is going to government senators and members. It continues:
Please note that your authorisation already appears on each flyer.
Its says:
The A4 size flyer could be used in newsletters or as handouts at street stalls. The DL size flyer could 
 be inserted in all your correspondence and could also be used in street stalls and these should be photocopied on bright coloured paper.
This is under the signature of Mr Reg Chamberlain, the communications officer of the government members' secretariat.
This memo from Mr Chamberlain basically instructs members to authorise the material that is attached when members and senators distribute it in their electorates. To make it easier for government members and senators, so they do not breach the Electoral Act, the bromides that members and senators have been provided with actually are supplied with a ready-made authorisation. We have removed the authorisations from the documentation that we have. It is a pretty sensible thing to do when you want to protect your sources in this business, as you would understand.
Let me remind the Senate of section 328 of the Electoral Act, which states:
(1)  A person shall not print, publish or distribute or cause, permit or authorize to be printed, published or distributed, an electoral advertisement, handbill, pamphlet or notice unless:
(a)  the name and address (not being a post-office box) of the person who authorized the advertisement, handbill, pamphlet or notice appears at the end thereof . . . 
The issue here is this: the very nature of the material requiring authorisation is that it is an electoral advertisement; it is party political campaign material.
Let us have a look at the Liberal propaganda that has been provided by this taxpayer funded unit here in Parliament House. It has an A4 bromide attacking the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. Mr Chamberlain suggests that this particular document could be used in newsletters or as handouts in street stalls. There are also two DL sized flyers—the ones where an A4 sheet divides into three. Again one attacks Kim Beazley, and the other promotes the coalition's plan to sell Telstra in regional Australia.
Mr Chamberlain is a little more direct in the use of these. He says that these should be inserted in all correspondence and that they could also be used in street stalls. Where is the material being produced? It is not by the Liberal Party secretariat, of course. It is not 
 funded from Liberal Party campaign funds—it is what you might expect, but that is not the case. This is being produced by the government members' secretariat here in Parliament House from funds of the Department of Finance and Administration. This technically means that the production of this campaign bromide is, under the Electoral Act, a gift to the Liberal Party because others have paid for them.
So, under the act, it would have to be disclosed. I wonder what the cost would be for the commercial production of these bromides, individualised for each of the 130 government members and senators, all to attack the Australian Labor Party and Mr Beazley in particular in the most politically partisan way possible.
What did the Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, who was in charge of this unit, say about the government members' secretariat? He said:
The government members' secretariat is there to service and support government members in the performance of their duties. It is the responsibility of all government members to be out there selling government policy and to be supported appropriately in so doing.
Mr Martin Bonsey, from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, on page 137 of the Hansard  of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee of Wednesday 18 December 1996, outlined in some detail what the government secretariat is supposed to be doing. It certainly never mentioned the production of this sort of material. This material is a bucket job on Kim Beazley. It has nothing to do with government policy whatsoever. It clearly is party political campaign material and should be produced by the Liberal and National parties at their own expense.
Senator Minchin now is so embarrassed about the activities of the government members' secretariat that he said in question time today that, while the government members' secretariat staff are allocated to his own staff, the secretariat is the responsibility of the Chief Government Whip; it is under his operational direction. That is not only untrue 
 but also blatant political buck-passing on the part of Senator Minchin.
It is worth looking at how this Liberal Party campaign unit abuses taxpayer funds. The coalition government has a 10-member secretariat, paid for by the taxpayer, to train backbenchers in media techniques, plus produce a raft of newsletters and material that are necessarily campaign based. Eight of the staff are based in Canberra—two of them live interstate—and the cost in salaries is in excess of half a million dollars.
There are the costs of computer gear and software—including advanced desk top programs such as CORAL, Draw 7, Microsoft Front Page 95 and Alders Pagemaker. That is about $18,000. This whole area at suite MG3 in Parliament House has been refitted at a cost of $39,000, for a change in the offices from open plan to separate offices. The cost of travel for members of that secretariat in 1997-98 was $150,000. The total administration cost was $66,132. It is a total cost of in excess of three quarters of a million dollars for a unit that should, by its nature, be based in, and paid for by, Menzies House.
We say that, if any material produced at the member's secretariat needs authorisation—and that is what Mr Chamberlain's memo says—it should be produced with Liberal Party money because it is electoral material, not through that enormous amount in excess of $¾ million of taxpayers' dollars. We say that it is gross hypocrisy on the part of Mr Howard to let a unit like this operate here in Parliament House, funded by the Department of Finance and Administration—and, of course, it was Mr Howard who promised to rein in costs before the election.
We have this material. We know what this is about. It is nothing other than a taxpayer funded propaganda unit for the use of the government. The unit should be shut down, if it is going to do this sort of thing. I seek leave to table the documentation.
—Madam President, on a point of order: we have not seen the stolen documentation.
—You have; it was sent to you. It was not stolen.
—Senator Faulkner admits that it is a stolen document. If he would be kind enough to provide us with a copy, we will consider giving leave.
—Leave is not granted at the present time.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Promotional Material</title>,Adjournment,26,1
