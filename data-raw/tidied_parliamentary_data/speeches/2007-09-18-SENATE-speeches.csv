"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-18,"—I do not want to take up a long period of the Senate’s time but I do think this does need some explanation. The government proposes an extension of hours on Tuesday night till 10 pm, with a dinner break, plus an extension of hours on Thursday night. This seems to suggest that Thursday night will be open-ended until we finish the legislative program as outlined, which consists of a considerable number of bills. It is assumed—and the government may want to expand on this—that at a particular late point on Thursday night we may adjourn and resume on Friday. We need a clear indication from the government about Friday. People do have matters for which they need to arrange travel and appointments that they need to keep or abandon, as the case may be. If, so early in the legislative program, we are sitting extended hours to deal with the legislation, the question that has to be asked, and answered by the government, is whether, and why, all of these legislative items are of an urgent nature and are required to be completed in this week or whether they can reasonably be held over till the next sitting fortnight—that is, unless the government says that this is the last week we are going to sit and that it is an end of session period. Up till now, the government, it seems, has been treating each week as a last week of sitting.
—Business as usual.
—It did that in the past sitting fortnight, and the government has not been able to say that it is business as usual. We now have a case where the government has a significant number of bills that it is requesting be put through, presumably by Thursday night, the early hours of Friday morning or later on Friday, and the government does need to make a case as to whether those bills are in fact urgent for this week and whether they have a start-up date that requires them to be addressed. There is one, the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007, which we have received a briefing on, and it could be said that the Quarantine Amendment (Commission of Inquiry) Bill 2007 is one such bill; but, in respect of the remainder of the bills, the government does need to make a case. When you look at the legislative package, you see that even a conservative estimate would put the hours of government business time required to deal with that legislation at somewhere between 21 and 30-odd hours, providing that there are no hiccups. In a less than ordinary week of the Senate, government business takes up about 51 per cent of the time, which means that you are looking at 15-odd hours of government time to be able to deal with legislation. This suggests that there is a huge gap between what the government expects and wants in the legislative program and the hours that are available to do it.
The Senate should not be treated as a rubber stamp. Each bill needs to be considered carefully, debated and put, and amendments need to be argued for and either carried or lost, as the case may be. If the government is going to maintain its position that it requires all of these bills to be passed by Friday without providing a justification as to their urgency and without a full explanation then the government has, whether or not it wants to admit it, treated the Senate as a rubber stamp and it has not ensured that proper debate has been undertaken.
To look at the particular issues, the government has indicated—if not in actual words then in substance—that it has a program that would otherwise be an end of session program. Therefore, the government needs to make clear whether it is in fact saying that this is the end of the session and that it does not expect that the sittings will resume in October. The government should also undertake to prioritise the legislation, because the other question that arises is: if, through the ordinary course of work on Friday, the passage of the bills has not been completed, does the government intend to continue to sit through Friday night or to abandon the remaining bills, and, if so, which ones? In other words, is it going to prioritise the legislation or simply work through the list ad seriatim?
The opposition has always taken the view, and continues to take the view, that we will work diligently with those pieces of legislation to ensure that they are properly scrutinised and dealt with. We will not, as others might argue we will do, filibuster the legislative program. But, when I look at the bills that need to be dealt with, it does seem to me that the government in this instance has bitten off more than it can chew—and, may I say, without a clear justification for every one of those bills. The government does seem to be in a less than desirable position. Either it is not managing the program very well or it is treating it like an end of session. That is the position the government needs to explain to the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-09-18,"—This is the government clearing the decks for the election but being rude and noncommunicative in the process. There ought to have been an explanation from Senator Abetz at the start of this debate, not at the end. Senator Ludwig is very right: we should know what the program is for Friday if that is the intention, and if it is not the intention, the Senate ought to have been given the courtesy of being told that. One would expect that from the government, but we do not get that. If ever you needed a further example of why the government deserves to lose its majority and its ability to treat this Senate with contempt, here it is again. So clearing the decks for the election is written into this motion.
When we come back, I expect the government will be on this side of the chamber and in smaller numbers, and we will get back to discussing properly the programming of Senate sittings so that the public gets the best out of them and, at the same time, senators are able to plan the way in which we are able to deal with legislation. Might I add that there are 33 pieces of legislation on this slate, and one or two have already been dealt with.
The role of the Senate as house of review is to be able to go to the electorate and talk about legislation and to come back better informed, with amendments and with a government that is able to take them into account. None of that is happening here. This is just a directive from the Prime Minister’s office which says, ‘Clear the slate on Thursday night or Friday and get us out of here so that we can get ready for an election.’ There is a list of bills. The ministers are competing; they all want the legislation to go through. This is the way in which the government rides roughshod across this very important part of the democratic system—this Senate, this house of review. This motion says nothing about review. The public is locked out. The input that we should have is not going to be available. There is no excuse for this. We have sitting days in October, November and December if the government is of a mind to wait that long, but of course it is not.
—And when might the election be?
—Senator Abetz asks me when the election is going to be. It shows you how much out of the Prime Minister’s circuit he may be. Maybe that is because he mucked up the pulp mill motion so much yesterday.
—Bob, really!
—He protests about that, but we all know how badly he went yesterday. The point here is that this is a failure of the government to treat this Senate with the respect it deserves and to give the public the consultation they deserve. It is a pretty poor show for the last sittings in this three-year period of government, which began with the Prime Minister saying he would not treat the majority he had so unexpectedly gained in the Senate with hubris. We have seen hubris, contempt and a dismissiveness about the ability of this Senate to adequately deal with the legislation it has. We will be dealing with it. We are ready. We have got no concerns about that. The government can bring on whatever schedule it likes.
—So what’s the complaint?
—Senator Abetz asks, ‘What’s the complaint?’ He has got a very, very short attention span—but there you go. We might have begun with a little bit of common sense and decency here, with an explanation from Senator Abetz about whether there is any intention to sit on Friday. We are not going to get that. We will get a bit of bombast in a moment. Here in this motion, for everybody to see, is the contempt with which the Howard government has treated this Senate. That is another reason why it should lose its majority in here and why it will do so in the coming months.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-18,"—The Democrats also wish to speak to the motion before us. As has been explained, it extends the hours of sitting this week so that we sit late tonight as well as have an open-ended adjournment on Thursday night and it requires the Senate to consider 30 bills, only one of which I think has already been passed. As mentioned by previous speakers, we have pretty much had this treatment of the Senate since we came back in August. Every week has been treated almost like a de facto final sitting week just in case the government wants to call an election. So, even back in that first fortnight in August, we had extended sitting hours to assist the government to push things through. Last week we had extended sitting hours and this week we have even more extended sitting hours. After a three-week break, the Senate is scheduled to sit on 15 October. We could sit that week and indeed the next one and still have an election before the end of the year on 1 December or 8 December—and some people speculate that that may happen. I am one of those who have the view that it will not, but it does not really matter: it is not my decision, and it is not Senator Abetz’s decision or anybody else’s; it will be the Prime Minister’s decision.
That brings up a key point that really should be made far more often: if we had fixed terms, like a number of Australian states and many other democracies around the world have, we would not continually be faced with, ‘Maybe we will; maybe we won’t,’ with how we manage our business, with whether we need to rush through all this stuff now and with whether we have got more time. If we all knew the election date well in advance then we would not have this continual abuse of process, using the possibility of an election down the line as a reason for having to push things through or extend sitting hours or do all those other things. It is a cut and dried example of why it is in the public interest and in the interest of good governance, let alone the Senate’s interest, to have a fixed term so that we know when we are going to have an election, when parliament will be prorogued and how much longer we have got to deal with the business before it.
To some extent, I do not blame the Manager of Government Business in the Senate for wanting to get through all of these pieces of legislation before the end of the week, because it is quite possible that it will be the final sitting week. The Manager of Government Business does not know. Nobody knows in the government, I am sure of that, except possibly Mr Howard—and even he may well not have made up his mind yet. So, in that very narrow construct within which the Manager of Government Business has to operate, it is good practice for him to push us all through, and I am sure that is what he is being directed to do, in any case.
But the key question is of good practice for the public. We are, with these 30 pieces of legislation that are listed here, making laws. We are not just passing through some point-scoring opportunities or some things that the government can tick on their resume, saying, ‘We did this’ to help them with the election, or things for each of the rest of us here on the other side of the chamber to use as positioning opportunities to say: ‘We supported this’, ‘We opposed this’ or ‘We tried to amend this.’ The key thing we are doing is passing and considering laws that affect people’s lives directly, and it is simply bad process and bad governance to be pushing through 30 pieces of legislation in three days. On the Thursday night, under this motion, some of them will be pushed through probably well into the early hours of Friday. That is simply bad practice, and I do not believe that any credible argument can be put to say that that is a good way to make laws.
It is worth noting that putting through 30 bills in the space of a few days is not just a one-off for this week. I draw the public’s attention—if not the Senate’s—to the very useful information and statistics provided by the Department of the Senate on the number of sitting days and pieces of legislation passed each sitting week in each year. According to the most recent edition, going up to the end of last week, 13 September, we had had just 37 sitting days this year so far, not counting this week, and in that time the Senate had passed 154 pieces of legislation. I have not done the maths precisely, but I think that is about four pieces of legislation per day. Of course, not all day every day is spent considering legislation. According to the statistics, 85 hours and 53 minutes was the total amount spent on government business up until the end of last week for 154 pieces of legislation. On top of that, this week we will add another four days to those 37 sitting days—so that will be 41 sitting days—and we will add another 30 pieces of legislation, so the statistics will go up to 184 pieces of legislation in 41 sitting days. That, most probably, will be it for the year. There is an outside chance that we might come back again after the election, if it is held early, or an outside chance that we may come back again in three weeks time if the election is not held until December. We will potentially go through this again. Quite what legislation we will have left to deal with, if we do come back in three weeks time, I am not so sure about, which is why I am not terribly convinced that we will be coming back—but, as I said, that is a bit of an academic debate.
The Democrats’ core objection is not to any specific piece of legislation on the list. We can outline our objections in the debates on the pieces of legislation, and we can move our amendments, as we will do. Our core objection is that it compounds what is already a very poor record in terms of proper governance, due process and good public administration. We will now have 184 pieces of legislation put through this chamber in 41 sitting days, and that is not adequate. Of course, Senate committee inquiries have looked at some of them as well. It is a matter of public record that some of those inquiries have been grotesquely inadequate and, frankly, contemptuous. The simple, core matter of this Senate as a legislature and as a house of review is that its role is being debauched by the politicisation, the political motivation and the abuse of the Senate majority that the coalition now have. It should not be any surprise that they are doing that. It was predicted that they would do it, and it is not a particular slur on the nature of politics for people who follow the conservative parties. It is a natural commentary on human nature and the nature of politics.
Anytime you give a government control of both houses of parliament, they will use it to suit their own interests rather than look at the interests of the community. That is human nature. It is something that history shows us has happened many times before. It will continue to happen again if the government maintain control of the Senate after the election, or if any government down the track, of any political persuasion, do not have a house of parliament such as the Senate that is able to provide some check and balance and some form of review over what they are doing, however imperfect that may be. I certainly do not suggest that it has operated perfectly in that regard in the past, but it has certainly provided some mechanism for improving legislation. I think ‘improving’ is the key word, not just reviewing and holding up and examining it for an intellectual exercise, but improving the laws that we pass, laws that, I once again remind the Senate and the community, affect them directly—and sometimes quite enormously and comprehensively—often for the good, which is why we do it. I hope, in an ideal world, it would always be for the good, but we would improve the positive impacts of the laws we pass if we actually did our job properly and allowed proper time for scrutiny. You do not get that when you pass 184 pieces of legislation in 41 sitting days. You do not get it when you are passing 30 pieces of legislation in a week. And you do not get it when you are doing it at two o’clock in the morning, basically just shovelling through all of the leftovers so that everybody can get the hell out of here and get back to campaigning again.
It is not adequate. It is a compelling argument for restoring the Senate to being independent of the government of the day. Once again, it is also a compelling argument for why we need fixed terms, something the Democrats have called for many years and certainly will continue to do so.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-09-18,"—I want to briefly indicate that, as far as the opposition is concerned, we do not believe the government has made a case for this proposed resolution or for these extended sitting hours this week. It has not demonstrated why there is urgency in respect of many of these bills. One has to assume that the only reason that we will be sitting late tonight, late on Thursday night and till Friday afternoon is that there is an intent to call an election sometime between Friday and when the Senate is due to sit again in the middle of October. Otherwise, why is there the necessity to push through these bills, many of which do not have an urgency tag on them?
The government have said, too, that they want to finish by Friday afternoon. We know it is not possible, on the basis of the hours allocated, for these bills to be completed by Friday afternoon, yet they have not identified to us which are the priority bills that they want to have dealt with. They are simply saying that all of them are in the net and their intent is to finish all of them. What that will mean, if that is pursued, is that there will not be sufficient time to give these bills proper consideration by the Senate.
We have indicated that we are not going to be steamrolled into passing legislation; we will deal with each bill on its merits and we will deal with it in a considered way. We are not going to be steamrolled just to ensure that the government meets its objective of getting these 30 bills through by Friday afternoon.
As I have indicated, I do not believe that the government has made a case for having these additional sitting hours, nor has it attempted to make a case for these additional sitting hours. It is simply putting forward this motion because it knows ultimately that it has got the numbers to force it through and the forces to deal with these bills in that way. I want to make it clear on behalf of the opposition that we will be opposing the motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-18,"—Anybody listening to this debate could be forgiven for thinking that the Howard government has steamrolled legislation through this Senate. I remind senators, and all those who have contributed to this debate have made this allegation, that this is in fact a motion to extend the hours of sitting of the Senate. It will allow the Senate extra time above and beyond that which is usual. If the Howard government is supposedly so determined to use the Senate as a rubber stamp and to not listen to debate, why on earth is it moving a motion, and using its numbers against the opposition, to give the opposition extra hours of sitting? This is the sort of humbug that, unfortunately, continually gets reported to the Australian people: that we are treating the Senate as a rubber stamp, when we are the ones agitating to give the Senate more time to consider legislation.
Indeed, the Howard government’s record is very instructive. Since 1901, in the 106 years since Federation, there have only been 30 packages of bills that have taken more than 20 hours in the Senate—thirty packages of bills or programs that have taken more than 20 hours of debate. Do you know how many of those packages have been under the Howard government, in the past 10 years? Fifteen of them; half of them. So you see, on objective evidence, that the coalition as a government have been more than willing to allow the Senate time to consider matters which are of concern to it and to the Australian people. Half of the measures, out of 30, that have taken more than 20 hours to debate in this chamber have been debated during the past 10 years of the Howard government. The other 15 took place between 1901 and 1996—that is, over 95 years. That is how we as a coalition government have treated this Senate: with the respect that it constitutionally deserves and of course democratically deserves as well.
So it is a very bizarre argument when those on the other side assert, ‘We want more time; we need more time,’ but then come in here and say, ‘We will vote down the government’s motion giving us more time.’ That is what they need to explain to the Australian people.
In relation to the quite bizarre contribution by Senator Bob Brown—I emphasise ‘Bob’; I notice Senator Carol Brown in the chamber, so I hasten to make that very important distinction—we have become used to such contributions.
—Senator Bob Brown has left already.
—Yes, indeed; you are right, Senator Birmingham. Having given his spray, he now has left the chamber and that is what we have come to expect from him. He has made some quite bizarre commentaries in relation to this about the ‘rude’ and ‘non-communicative’ nature of the government on these measures. He knows as well as anybody in this chamber that the unsuspecting public listening in would not be aware that we have a very regular meeting of leaders and whips that includes the Greens, the Democrats, Family First, Labor and the coalition, and we seek to go through the measures and the management of the Senate. We had such a meeting, and the Greens were represented. They were given a list of the bills, and we discussed why the government wanted these measures put through. So to mischievously suggest to the Australian people that we have just dumped this motion in without explanation is, unfortunately, misleading. I am not allowed to say ‘deliberately misleading’, but I know that Senator Bob Brown knows the procedures and that he hopes the Australian people listening in do not.
The bills, which we gave notice of some days ago now, that are referred to in the motion contain a lot of budget measures, and most senators from both sides would agree that it is important to get budget measures through. There is a substantial amount of non-controversial legislation as well. It was instructive—and Senator Bartlett did aver this fact; it was a weakly made point, but I accept that he at least had the integrity to mention this—that nobody in the debate averred to a single piece of legislation, in the list that we provided, that required urgent or detailed consideration, or provided objection to the legislation.
We as a government are not treating the Senate as a rubber stamp; we are, in fact, proactively moving to give the Senate more time to consider the legislation. On the one hand, the Labor Party say we are a government that has run out of puff; on the other hand, they say we are putting too much legislation forward. Make up your mind: which is it? We are still legislating for the benefit of the Australian people. All the arguments we heard this afternoon were exactly the same arguments we heard about a fortnight ago, when exactly the same considerations were being put forward. I encourage all senators to vote for this motion, which will give the Senate more time—I stress ‘more time’—to consider the legislation that is before us.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Abetz’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-18,"—I want to speak briefly to this motion, particularly part (b). I am obviously not objecting to the Manager of Government Business introducing a bill; he can introduce whatever bill he likes, but part (b) is to exempt the legislation from the cut-off order so that it can be considered during this period of sittings, which, as we have just been debating, means considering it during this week. It is amongst the list of 30 bills that was covered by the previous motion. I want to speak to it as a single motion just to reinforce the point that I was making previously.
I am not passing comment on whether the legislation is a good bill or a bad bill, not least because I have not seen it yet; it has not been introduced. I have just been given a 30-second run-down by my colleague Senator Stott Despoja about what may or may not be in the legislation and some of the issues that may or may not be raised. Obviously, being the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007, it deals with criminal law. Some important issues of due process could be involved. However completely sure the government are that they are doing the right thing—that it is fabulous stuff and that it is completely necessary to introduce a bill and exempt it from the cut-off forthwith so that it has to be debated in the space of a couple of days—this legislation contains issues that could well require some degree of more careful consideration, if only to ensure that the stated policy intent is actually what will occur and that there are no unintended consequences.
That is the aspect of pushing things through this chamber that is often not given the focus it deserves. It is not just about those of us in the opposition parties saying, ‘We don’t like this bill being rushed through because we don’t like this bill or the policy behind it.’ Sure, that happens from time to time. Often we fully agree with the stated intent, but we are not sure whether what is being put forward will achieve those ends. Even more frequently, we are concerned that, alongside achieving those ends, there may be some other unintended consequences because it has not been thought through enough, we have not had enough time to examine it and we particularly have not had enough time to hear from people in the community with expertise. All knowledge and wisdom does not reside in this Senate chamber, although we all may talk like it does from time to time. There are many people in the community who have expertise in a range of areas, including those covered by this legislation. To not allow ourselves the opportunity to properly hear from those people in order to ensure that the public—the people who we are meant to be doing all this for—are not inadvertently negatively affected by what we are putting through is a dangerous process to follow for good public policy. I raise that concern on behalf of the Democrats.
The cut-off itself is a creation of the Democrats and of my predecessor from Queensland, Senator Michael Macklin, back in the 1980s. It was agreed to back then by the Liberal opposition as a good idea and as a bit of a safeguard against this sort of thing happening unless good enough reasons are put forward as to why it is desirable. Oftentimes good enough reasons are put forward. Maybe there are good reasons on this occasion and the minister thought they were so overpoweringly obvious that he did not need to outline them, but I think it would be beneficial for those reasons to be outlined before the Senate gives that open-ended tick, even though I accept that, in effect, we already have with the previous motion being passed.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-09-18,"—I rise also to endorse the comments of the Democrats Whip, Senator Bartlett, in relation to this debate. There are a couple of key issues here. It is not only the alacrity with which we are dealing with this important, arguably urgent—certainly from the government’s perspective—legislation. This morning the office of the Attorney-General kindly organised and offered my office a briefing. That is still relatively short notice, because we are dealing with a piece of legislation that is being introduced and exempted from the cut-off and that will probably be debated today. The first that my office was aware of this legislation was this morning. The office of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Allison, was aware at around eight o’clock last night. I believe that a statement of reasons was tabled in this place yesterday, and I acknowledge that, but, regardless of this timeframe, I think the chamber can agree that this is a very fast process.
Now, that would be okay on perhaps two grounds: (1) if urgency is put forward and accepted or (2) if the complex or other nature of a piece of legislation is considered. With the benefit only now of a briefing, a cursory look suggests that this bill is quite controversial and has huge legal implications—and not just for cases that may or may not be underway. It also deals with a fundamentally controversial and debatable principle in this place, certainly from the perspective of the Australian Democrats: the issue of retrospectivity generally and retrospectivity specifically in relation to criminal law. We have put on record many times in this place our concerns with and, in fact, our down-right objection to retrospectivity in legislation. We have often considered it also a fundamental human right to not be subject to retrospective criminal sanctions. That is what, on my understanding, this legislation is about.
When we are talking about these broad ranging, fundamental and complex concepts, there is a very strong argument that the parliament take some time to analyse and scrutinise this legislation. For me, that means not being informed yesterday, or indeed this morning, and then only now having a debate about exempting a bill from the cut-off provision—I say ‘debate’, but so far there have been two speakers in this debate concerning the exemption, and they are myself and Senator Bartlett. I am not sure what the official position is of the opposition but I think, like us, they are still getting their heads around what is quite a controversial piece of legislation. But when I look on the Notice Paper it is the third bill. Essentially, we will be debating this legislation today. I know that it has been put forward in the debate that that has occurred previously through the minister—certainly through Senator Abetz—and more generally and publicly by the government, that there is the principle of the Senate mandate, the dominance of this place, that the numbers are being used wisely and that it is about putting forward a policy agenda. This is not putting forward a policy agenda. This is ramming through legislation. We are back in sausage factory mode and it is unacceptable. It may be that we are all wrapping up because we have an election that is about to take place—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—I will take any interjection from Minister Abetz because I do not know if he has read the bill. It may be a seven-page bill but it has huge ramifications. It removes safeguards which are not only procedural but also form a substantial part of the process for an examiner to be satisfied that a summons or notice to produce ought to be issued. They are fundamental legal concepts, people. Mutter, mutter, mutter! The minister may mock and belittle me if he likes, but I care passionately about the role of this place.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Then stop interjecting.
—I was not! The first conversation was with the government whip—
 (Senator Watson)—What is your point of order?
—and the other one was with one of the advisers. What is happening is that, unfortunately, the record is going to be misleading.
—There is no point of order.
—I am happy to accept that and indeed withdraw the allegation against the minister if, as he said, he was indeed in deep conversation with the whip. But maybe he could stop interjecting or talking while other members of the Senate are speaking. There are some learned legal minds on that front bench—I can see one standing up right now, and that is meant as a compliment. I notice that he took it, too! There are minds on that front bench, as indeed there are on the other side, who will recognise that we are dealing with some complex issues that have wide-ranging obligations.
I understand that the government will put forward a case of urgency in relation to this bill. Then let us have some time to debate it—not just on the floor of this chamber during this cut-off debate and not just in the committee stage of the bill. Give us some time to consult with the legal brains out there, which my office has been doing hurriedly and specifically in dealing with the case that has brought about this so-called ‘necessary’ and ‘urgent’ change of law. I would like to know what other organisations, like the Law Council, and other learned and community minds think about this legislation. Anyone in this place who has dealt with Crime Commission law or the act that precedes it or who has been on committees like the NCA committee—I was for a period—will understand that even the basis of those acts have some fairly vexed and controversial principles in them, and this deals with one of those very sections, which is quite concerning. I appeal to the Senate, and I am happy to move an amendment to have the bill considered later this week:
At the end of the motion, add:
; and (c)   the bill not be further considered until Thursday, 20 September 2007.
I am happy to move that on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We are not seeking to delay this process unnecessarily. We are not seeking to prevent the legislation being debated. I understand that we need to deal with the cut-off provision motion, but I appeal to senators on all sides, in the interests of scrutiny and fair debate and to ensure that this legislation is looked at properly, that we be given the opportunity to consult with relevant authorities, community groups and legal avenues. Will you consider that this legislation be delayed to a later hour of not this day but another day, because it is third on the Notice Paper for today, third on the red. That is unacceptable given that we have just had briefings and were informed less than 24 hours ago of this piece of legislation? I appeal to my colleagues and I am happy to take your advice.
—Neither the chair nor the whips have a copy of your amendment and that is necessary for us to proceed.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-18,"—I want to speak on the exemption from the cut-off. Labor has been dealing with the legislative program as ordinary pieces of legislation. It is not unusual for the government to ask for an exemption to the cut-off in relation to a bill that they can justify as urgent. I understand that the government has been able to make a case that this is an urgent bill that should be put on the legislative program for this week. I am not going to cavil with that. The exemption from the cut-off is to ensure that the program is not unduly loaded up at the end of the session and it allows, in this instance, bills to be dealt with in the ordinary way. If I take that broad view, then what the government is asking for is that this bill be exempt from the cut-off so that it can be dealt with in that way—therefore, it is not an unusual process.
The more unusual process is that of the motion that we just lost a little while ago, but I will  not go there in any substantial way other than to remind the Senate that this adds one more bill to the program which the government sees a need to finalise this week, it appears. Labor has indicated that it will continue to deal with the bills in the usual way and address them on their merits as they arise. I will not go to the merits of the ACC bill itself. That is a matter that will come up in due course and we can then address the substantive issues that are associated with the bill. There is no need in this debate to raise those matters. It is broadly a bill that deals with, as I understand it, an amendment to ensure that that the Australian Crime Commission can deal with their usual summons processes. The EM explains that adequately, it appears, and the government will obviously support their position and demonstrate the need for the urgency of this bill. On that basis, Labor will not oppose exemption from the cut-off.

3F  Subsections 51AC(9) and (10)
Repeal the subsections.
Just to explain briefly: as I said, it arose from recommendation 7 of the Senate Economic References Committee report of March 2004. I will not recap all the arguments in its favour, but it dealt with unconscionable conduct. The ACCC agreed with the view that the present limit of $3 million was too low. I quote from the report:
The ACCC agreed with this view, saying that subsection 51AC(3)(a) already stated that the courts may have regard to the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the companies, so no threshold is necessary.
The Committee noted these arguments and further noted that subsections 51AC(1) and (2) exclude publicly listed companies from the protection of the section. The Committee agrees that the removal of the thresholds will not reduce the current protection for small businesses, and will enhance protection for businesses involved in transactions over $3 Million, who are nevertheless subject to unconscionable conduct within the terms of s.51AC.
Government senators rejected that view but accepted the view that the threshold was too low. I cite government senators’ remarks:
Government Senators are not persuaded of the need to lift the ceilings so as to extend the protections in the section to all firms, irrespective of size. On the other hand, we are concerned that the current statutory ceiling may be unrealistically low, given the size of transactions which some small businesses undertake. Accordingly, we recommend that the government consider prescribing $10 million as the relevant amount for the purposes of the section.
We accept that that is a good advance. The government itself has accepted the recommendation of the government senators but we still hold to the view of the original committee recommendation.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-18,"—The government does not support the amendment because it loses sight of the fact that the particular purpose of part IVA of the Trade Practices Act is to provide a code of protection for small businesses. If there is no ceiling on the value of transactions to which the unconscionable conduct provisions of the act apply, it entirely loses its character as a set of provisions which are particularly concerned with the problems of small business and dealing with issues like inequality of bargaining power and so on. As Senator Murray has rightly pointed out, the government senators did recommend, and the government has adopted the recommendation, that the ceiling be lifted very substantially, to $10 million. You can always have a debate about how high a ceiling should be, but this is not that debate. This debate is about the proposition that the provisions of part IVA of the act ought to be of general application, whether it is to the biggest multinational company in the world, trading in Australia, or the local garage. We think that loses sight of the purpose of the provision; therefore we do not support it.

81B   Divestiture for abuses of market power
(1)The Court may, on the application of the Commission, if it finds that a corporation has contravened section 46, by order, give directions for the purpose of securing the reorganisation or division of the corporation into separate and distinct entities including directions for the disposal or divestiture of all or any of the shares in or assets of the corporation to facilitate the reorganisation or division of the corporation.
This amendment relates to divestiture provisions for the abuse of market power. It has been drafted to deal with section 46 because that is the direction taken by the majority Senate report which I referred to earlier. The chamber is well aware, because it has heard me on the matter before, that I do in fact admire the general intent of the American antitrust and divestiture provisions. As a reserve power, they have been extremely effective and act to allow for circumstances where great power, used for anticompetitive or monopolistic purposes, can be reduced. I think that is an appropriate tool for the ACCC to have. The Senate committee report stated:
Divestiture powers are powers which enable a Court to order that a dominant corporation be broken up into several smaller corporations in order to prevent the anticompetitive domination of a market by one player.
Such powers are currently available under s.81 of the Act, but cannot be applied to creeping acquisitions, nor to offences under s.46.
I remind the chamber that my amendment deals with section 46. The report continues:
The Committee considers that the application of s.81 should be expanded, so that divestiture becomes a remedy for other breaches of the Act, including section 46 (Misuse of market power) and any new section introduced in line with the Committee’s recommendation 12 (relating to the regulation of creeping acquisitions).
As divestiture is a quite severe remedy, it is appropriate to provide “warning mechanisms” to ensure that a corporation which is expanding its business is able to comply with its obligations under the Act. A suitable warning mechanism could be based around a “trigger” market concentration.
This trigger should not operate as a de facto cap on market share. Rather it would require companies proposing acquisitions in concentrated industries to notify the ACCC. The Commission would then assess whether the acquisition would result in a substantial lessening of competition. The Committee notes that this already occurs in the retail grocery industry.
The recommendation of the committee was as follows:
The Committee recommends that s.81(1) of the Act be amended so that s.81 can be applied where a corporation is found to have contravened section 46, section 46A, or any new section introduced to regulate creeping acquisitions.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-09-18,"—Labor does not support this amendment. Labor believes that the current penalties for breach of the anticompetitive provisions of the Trade Practices Act are adequate, other than the lack of criminal penalties for serious cartel conduct, which were promised by the government back in February 2005. These penalties include fines of $10 million for corporations or half a million dollars for individuals for each breach. In addition, sanctions against company directors and officers of a company—for example, disqualification and a prohibition on indemnity for financial liability and legal costs—may also be imposed by the court.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-18,"—The government does not support this amendment. The issue was considered by the Dawson report, and Mr Dawson recommended against it. I should point out, though, to the committee that the act does contain divestiture powers, in section 81, but those divestiture powers apply expressly to section 50. The logic of having divestiture powers for section 50, which deals with anticompetitive acquisitions, but not having divestiture powers for section 46, which deals with misuse of market power, is that by committing a breach of section 50 what the corporation does is, ex hypothesi, acquire an anti-competitive market share; therefore there is a logic in having a power to require it to divest of that additional acquisition, because the acquisition itself is the very conduct which the act in the relevant circumstances stipulates against. But in section 46, what one is looking at is not the anticompetitive acquisition of market power but the anticompetitive use of market power, which is not the product of an acquisition but the product of conduct in a given market.
It is the government’s view—as it was Mr Dawson’s view—that the existing sanctions regime, which, you will remember, Senator Murray, was very significantly tightened by the so-called Dawson amendments, is a sufficient deterrent and corrective for misuse of market power which section 46 would render unlawful. May I remind you that the penalty that can be imposed upon a corporation for a section 46 breach includes a fine of up to $10 million per breach, five per cent of the corporation’s turnover or three times the economic value of the transaction which is attacked in the section 46 proceedings per breach. That is in addition to the remedies under section 80 for injunctive relief and the various other ancillary remedies in part VI of the act. So, for all of those reasons, the government’s view is that the armoury of sanctions in relation to section 46 is sufficient and, indeed, very strong and, for the other reason I gave earlier in these remarks, there is a certain illogic in applying, beyond a breach of section 50, the divestiture powers.

         (5)    The Commission will:

                    (i)    the national market for the goods or services; or

Public inspection
         (8)    The Commission must also make copies of the report required under subsection (5) available for public inspection as soon as practicable after the report has been tabled.
This amendment too relates to a theme of mine which I have pursued over time in this place, and it relates to some competition law which I admire in other jurisdictions. I am, of course, referring to the device used in the Fair Trading Act of the United Kingdom whereby they use trigger concentrations of market power to institute a process which could be colloquially described as ‘market watch’. They are alert to the fact that great commercial power, when accumulated, may not be illegal—it may not, in fact, be contrary to the interests of the society or the economy—but it deserves to be watched in a manner which allows for the competition authorities to be fully informed in greater detail than is available through the normal market processes of market disclosure, particularly for publicly listed companies.
The amendment as I have attempted to design it—as usual, with legal assistance—only applies to state, territory and national markets. That is an important consideration because, of course, the market definition was quite properly changed in our competition law following a joint house inquiry in, I think, 1997 which recommended that markets, in Australian competition law, no longer be defined as national but as applicable in a regional as well as a larger market sense. In practical terms I would anticipate that the companies involved would provide disclosure of relevant information to the ACCC and the ACCC would assess that information to identify trends which may suggest areas where greater care should be taken with respect to competitive activity. If such trends were identified then a more detailed scrutiny may occur—much in the same way as ASIC monitors particular trends under its jurisdiction.
It is essentially an ACCC watching brief over highly concentrated markets that I am recommending. I think that would be to the advantage, not the disadvantage, of our economy. It would obviously need the ACCC to take note of how other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom operate. It does seem to be a practical, effective and responsible market measure, as used in the United Kingdom. I am suggesting it could be useful in our own legal context.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-18,"—Before I begin, can I mention that I think I misspoke in my last contribution when I said that one of the pecuniary penalties for a section 46 breach was five per cent of turnover. It is, of course, 10 per cent of turnover—so allow me to correct myself. The government does not support this amendment for much the same reasons as indicated by Senator Sherry. I might point out that the amendment is not limited as to jurisdiction, so that any market, no matter how small by value or turnover, would appear to be caught by it so long as any corporation operating within that market attained a market share of 25 per cent in the markets to which the amendment is directed, down to state and territory markets. So, theoretically, you might have the market in Alice Springs for snack bars, in which one snack bar had more than 25 per cent of the market share, and, under the terms of this amendment, the ACCC would be required to monitor it. In fact, it would be required to monitor any market in which there was any reason to believe that any corporation trading in it would pass the threshold or trigger point of 25 per cent. It would so vastly expand the obligations of the ACCC as to be—with respect—nonsensical. We regard it, as does Senator Sherry, as not a workable proposition, and we do consider that the powers of the minister to direct price monitoring under section 95ZF work well.

The $3 million threshold for section 51AC on unconscionable conduct is abolished, and the bill proposes to increase this to $10 million. The 2004 Senate Economics References Committee majority report into the Trade Practices Act recommended that the $3 million limit be abolished. Labor agree with this recommendation, as a threshold is arbitrary and unconscionable conduct should be illegal regardless of the size of the transaction or the businesses involved. Labor’s amendments ensure that all small business transactions will be covered, as there are circumstances in which the transaction may be more than $10 million; hence our amendments to remove it.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

After “any matter arising under”, insert “section 46,”.
2  After subsection 155(1)
Insert:
      (1A)    The power under subsection (1) can be exercised at any time prior to the commencement of substantive proceedings in a matter before the courts.
Labor’s amendment does two things. Firstly, it allows section 155 powers to remain following the commencement of an action seeking an injunction and only cease when the substantive case commences. Labor’s amendment will allow the ACCC’s information-gathering powers under section 155 to remain following the commencement of an action seeking an injunction and only cease when the substantive case commences. This is vital to ensuring that the ACCC has the information-gathering powers for as long as possible to ensure it can act to protect small business and consumers from anticompetitive conduct.
Secondly, it provides the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction over section 46 and section 83 cases. The amendment will provide the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction over section 46 and section 83 cases. Currently, the Federal Magistrates Court can hear certain matters under the TPA, most notably section 51 cases. However, the Magistrates Court cannot hear section 46 matters. This means that small business wishing to bring an action under section 46 must commence in the Federal Court. The Federal Court is more expensive than the Magistrates Court. The Magistrates Court also provides a conciliation process that would be of particular use to small business.
In addition, under section 83 of the act, a company can bring an action for damages based on findings of fact in another case. For example, if the ACCC brings a successful action against a company under section 46, small business can bring an action for damages based on the findings of fact in the case. However, this section 83 action must be brought in the Federal Court. This amendment would provide small business with better access to compensation and justice when they suffer from anticompetitive conduct.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-18,"—This amendment complies with the thrust of recommendations in the March 2004 Senate Economics References Committee report. Recently there was an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into another trade practices bill, which is on its way, to address the issues of small business in respect of the secondary boycott provisions and representative action. Evidence provided to that committee indicated that small business continues to support the view that the Federal Magistrates Court should be available for trade practices actions to be taken on two counts: lower cost and speedier access to justice.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-18,"—The government does not support opposition amendment (7), although I find myself a little embarrassed because the government senators in the 2004 report were rather persuaded to that view. Nevertheless, it does involve a very narrow point. You do not define substantive proceedings, Senator Sherry, through you, Madam Temporary Chair. What I take that you mean by substantive proceedings is the proceedings from the time after which an action has commenced by the filing of an application. As you would be aware, Senator, the Federal Court held as long ago as 1980, in Brambles Holdings and the Trade Practices Commission, that once an action had been commenced under part IV then that was the end of the section 155 powers. There is a reason for that, and that is that under the Federal Court rules there are a suite of interlocutory proceedings including discovery, interrogation, the exchange of witness statements and so on which deal with the matter.
The only occasion on which your amendment might operate is in the very narrow and limited circumstances contemplated by the ACCC in its submission at paragraph 5.27 of the 2004 report, where the ACCC was seeking in a very urgent case an interim injunction—that is, an injunction sought before the substantive application had been filed—and it sought to augment that with section 155 powers as well. That very seldom happens, and one would imagine that the only case in which one would seek an interim injunction, as opposed to an interlocutory injunction after the filing of an application, would be in circumstances of such extreme urgency that there would not be time for there to be a section 155 examination usefully conducted in any event. So I think, theoretically, you may be right, Senator Sherry, but it is the government’s view that, given the almost theoretical narrowness of the circumstances in which the amendment would have any operation, it is scarcely worth doing.
I will now reply to Senator Sherry’s final amendment, the amendment to include matters arising under section 46 within the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. The reason you advance—that this would make proceedings under section 46 much less expensive for small business—is illusory. Section 46 proceedings are extremely complicated. Not only do they involve a large amount of factual evidence but they also invariably involve a large amount of expert economic evidence. There have only been a few dozen section 46 cases in the 33-odd years since the Trade Practices Act has been in operation, and you do not get more complicated litigation than a section 46 case, frankly. You would need the same evidence, the same witnesses and the same experts to prove a section 46 case in the Magistrates Court as you would in the Federal Court, so you would not save any money at all. But what you would have is this extremely complicated sort of litigation being adjudicated, with all due respect to the Federal Magistrates Court, by less senior judicial officers. And that is also why the government is of the view that section 46 cases should only be dealt with by the senior federal judicial officers—that is, in the Federal Court of Australia in its sitting as a trial court.
The point that you make about recovery of damages under section 83, Senator Sherry, is a fair point. However, I do not think your amendment would achieve that either. You say in your amendment that it has to be a matter arising under section 46, but there is a great deal of rather arcane law about whether a proceeding to recover damages based on findings of fact under section 83 are proceedings under section 46 or fresh proceedings under section 83. So for those several reasons I do not think amendment (7) meets the mischief that you identify.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-18,"—My point to the minister is this: I think one of the weaknesses of section 46 has been that it has been so difficult to access and so few cases have been concluded. Without going to the fact that I and the opposition believe that section 46 could be strengthened even more, my belief is that the amendments in the government’s own bill actually improve the opportunity for section 46 cases to be successfully prosecuted and would therefore make it less difficult than it has been in the past.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-18,"—I do not want to prolong things, but I thank Senator Murray for that sentiment. It is the intention of the government with this bill to breathe life into section 46, which has been moribund since the Boral case. However, that does not mean that the issues of proof are going to be any easier. The problem with the Boral case is not that it changed the mode of proof but that it changed the threshold legal tests in one particularly important respect—and that is what is addressed by this legislation. The complexity of the trial process is not going to change, but it is the government’s intention that the thresholds that an applicant has to meet should be less onerous than they have been since section 46 has been construed by the High Court in the Boral case.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I refer in particular to the answers given by Senator Minchin regarding government advertising. Today, we were told by Senator Minchin that he has no shame when it comes to the wanton waste of public moneys with regard to government advertising. In the run-up to this election, $500 million will be spent by this government in a desperate attempt to secure a life raft in the face of increasing levels of public dissatisfaction.
Some $2 billion has been spent on public advertising since this government came to office. This is a desperate attempt by this government to avoid public accountability. This government is seeking to pump out hundreds of millions of dollars in propaganda to hide from the public, in a period when it should have called an election. We all understand this is one of the longest running parliaments in the history of this Commonwealth. This government is desperately running from the Australian people. This government has sought to abuse public advertising in a manner which goes to the heart of the nature of the deceit of and the contempt for the Australian people shown by this government.
In last year’s annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, they avoided reporting on government advertising. They neglected to report a whole series of sums, including $209 million for 2005-06. Of course, this year’s figures will not be reported until well after the election—this figure of $500 million that the government is spending in the run-up to the election. This government’s deceit and dishonesty have now been visited upon its own ranks. We know about this because the situation arose some years ago, when Shane Stone pointed out to us that this government has a reputation for being mean and tricky. There has been a period of total turmoil while the government has visited upon its own ranks this deceit and deception.
We are now told that Mr Costello will take over from this Prime Minister at some point in the future—on the condition, of course, that the Liberal Party agrees. This is about the fifth time that promises have been issued to Mr Costello by Mr Howard. Going back to 1994, Mr Costello was told that the Prime Minister would serve only two terms and then hand over. Mr Ian McDonald, of course, was a witness to those discussions and kept a note in his wallet for 13 years. He kept the faith for 13 years—the poor hapless fool! He should be able to provide advice about this Prime Minister’s capacity to tell the truth. We had a situation back in 2003—
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: I have been misrepresented. I did not keep a note of anything. Senator Carr seems to have confused me with someone else.
—There is no point of order.
—In 2003 we had the Athens declaration, where the Prime Minister yet again reneged on a promise to Mr Costello. He said that he would hand over when he was 64. We now discover what a deception that was. We are now being told there were further promises made and that Mr Costello would be the first to be consulted about the Prime Minister’s plans. We discovered in just the last fortnight that he was the last to be consulted about the Prime Minister’s plans. Of course, we all understand who was first to be consulted. It was Mrs Howard. We all understand who made the decision. It was not the Liberal Party; it was Mrs Howard. We all now understand that the deputy leader of the Liberal Party was deceived yet again. We are now told that, sometime in the future, at some indeterminate date, if the Liberal Party agrees and if the Prime Minister has not already organised another candidate, then maybe Mr Costello will get an opportunity to serve.
This follows a pattern of deceit by this government. We saw it with foreign debt. The Prime Minister said in 1995, ‘I promise you we will follow policies which will bring down foreign debt.’ What has been produced? The exact opposite. We were told in January 2006 that no worker would be worse off—and how ridiculous that proposition now looks! The Prime Minister said in 2004, ‘Who do you trust to keep interest rates low?’ We were told a lie on Iraq. We went to war on a lie. This is a government that has been founded on one lie after another. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-09-18,"—It is interesting to hear Senator Carr talk about deceit and deception and things that happened in the past. One could draw attention to what has happened in the past in Queensland. On 5 March 1990, documents pertaining to a rape at a correctional centre were shredded with other matters. It is the ultimate deceit and deception when people decide to make themselves party to actions like that. However, moving on to other things, this government has shown an incredible record of good management on interest rates. This government has one of the greatest records of being close to other benchmarks in the world, especially the US benchmark. It is interesting to note that today our official interest rate is at 6.5 per cent. The interest rate in the United States is at 5.25 per cent. There is only 1¼ per cent between them. That is a management figure; that is the capacity of the government to manage. What we can note, however, is that when the Labor Party was in power the differential between our interest rate and the US interest rate was around 8.3 per cent. That also is a management figure. It shows that Labor had in excess of seven times the differential we have now. That comes straight down to their capacity to manage a domestic economy.
One of the fundamental aspects of a domestic economy is having people with the expertise to manage that economy. As I have said before, we are on a political 747 and its capacity to fly is determined by the people in the cockpit. We have left the Labor Party’s cockpit door open and we are having a look inside. The question has to be asked: has any of them ever flown a political 747? The answer, obviously, is no. In fact, none of them have ever flown before. I do not think there is one person on the Labor front bench who has ever managed a business—not one! They have not sourced one person with the capacity to run the economy; they have not even gone close. If you want deceit and deception, it is about being completely errant in getting onto your front bench those with management expertise in business. It is quite obvious that you are not going to be able to have any credentials in running a trillion-dollar economy when there is no-one who has run so much as a corner store. What are they relying on to find these people—divine providence? Do they think the skills to manage the economy will descend upon them?
To see Labor’s management expertise, you need only look at the states. The states are the best reflection of what Labor Party management is like—and my state, Queensland, is probably one of the best examples. At the moment, I think the Queensland government are about $16.4 billion in debt. That is what they have chalked up on the state credit card. They are moving towards being between $40 million and $50 billion in debt. What have they done for the person who was responsible for that, the former Treasurer of Queensland? What prize have they presented to someone who has been completed devoid of management expertise? She is now the Premier of Queensland.
I would counsel Senator Carr very strongly, when he talks about deceit and deception and all the things that are involved in it—all the things that have happened in the past—that there are things that should be addressed and the truth should be tabled. There are some truths that have never been tabled. I hope that some day they might be tabled in here, because there are a lot of answers required. Maybe this government has only another four or five days to go, but it would be another travesty of justice if those people who have been suffering for so long from so many acts have to once again put aside any hope of those acts ever being dealt with.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-09-18,"—Before I speak on the motion, I note that I detect—as maybe you do yourself, Mr Deputy President—in the comments that are being made about the backgrounds of Labor Party shadow ministers and members of parliament that there is some sort of inverted snobbery about what our backgrounds might be. It almost appears, from what Senator Joyce just said, that we should be born to rule, that they are born to rule, that they are better at it and that we should just get on with it and go back to serfdom where our forebears came from. I remind you, Mr Deputy President, that even the House of Lords has now been reformed. Even the House of Lords, Senator Joyce, is elected.
Senator Minchin today gave a pretty hysterical response to questions in relation to government advertising. I suppose that reflects the degree of desperation that the government is experiencing at the moment, particularly with its senior levels of management. I have always—and I have expressed this before—had a lot of time for the integrity of Senator Minchin. But today I thought he was quite shameless in his hysterical, unfounded attack on the state Labor governments in trying to defend a position that is clearly indefensible.
I am assuming that Senator Minchin was a member of the shadow cabinet before 1996. I was going to play the ‘who said this’ game that Senator Abetz plays, but unfortunately Senator McEwen mentioned it in her question to the minister. Let me just quote from a press release of 5 September, 12 years ago, by the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. Of course, Senator McEwen has already mentioned this first bit, but I will go with it again and start with the following:
In a desperate attempt to find an election life raft, the Prime Minister is beginning an unprecedented propaganda blitz using taxpayers’ money.
I have already alluded to you, Mr Deputy President, that it was in fact John Howard who said that. He went on further to say:
They—
that is, taxpayers—
don’t want their money wasted on glossy advertising designed to make the Prime Minister feel good.
He went on further to say:
There is clearly a massive difference between necessary government information for the community and blatant government electoral propaganda.
Finally, he said:
The problem for the government is not communication. The problem is that it is tired, it has broken too many promises, it has hurt too many people. This propaganda blitz will make the electorate feel even more angry.
Are they not prophetic words, Mr Deputy President? They could well be the dying words of the government that is presiding over Canberra at this moment.
We could well mention, as has been highlighted by Senator Carr, that since this government has been in power nearly $1½ billion has been spent on an advertising blitz. It appears that in the next period up to $500 million is going to spent on advertising. Let me make this point, Mr Deputy President, because I know my time is going to expire shortly: if we had applied the money that has been used for blatant propaganda by the government, we could have paid for 28,000 secondary school teachers. We could have paid for 32,000 nurses. We could have taken steps to fix the skills shortage. Yet all we have seen—to give just two examples—has been that shameless ‘unchain my heart’ advertising on the GST and, even now, a planned climate change advertising blitz for a group of people who do not believe in it.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2007-09-18,"—There is something very phoney about the Labor Party this week—and even previously, but especially this week, as we have what is most likely the last week of parliamentary sittings before an election. It came out through the last two speakers. Two days into this week, they have feigned a concern for—they say it is a connection with—the households of Australia with regard to housing affordability and the pressures households are feeling with increased prices of groceries et cetera. They have not, on a Tuesday afternoon, in what is a most valuable on-air debating period, been able to sustain that debate. They have gone right off the economics and back to what they know best—that is, personal abuse towards and personal attacks on the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Prime Minister, no less, led by Senator Carr.
If you are going to allow Senator Carr to lead the motion to take note of answers then you are not serious about the economic debate. If there was one message given to the Labor Party at the last election, in 2004, which they ought to carry into this coming election, it was: establish your economic credentials. They are so phoney that they cannot even sustain the economic debate—a debate we will always welcome—for two days. They are so phoney in now calling themselves economic conservatives when we know that throughout the past decade of this government there was not a reform that brought the economy to the sound state it is in today that the Labor Party did not reject.
Now, they want the Australian people to accept them as economic conservatives. It was not so long ago that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, declared himself a democratic socialist and said that there ought to be a red line through every policy of government. There is something phoney about a leader who said that no fewer than eight months ago and now wants to be called an economic conservative. There is something phoney about an opposition here in the Senate that cannot sustain an economic debate for two days and feigns a concern for mortgage-paying households but will not get up in this chamber and debate it on air.
There is something very phoney about an opposition who will not recognise that the fundamentals of this economy and this government’s policies, which they say they would support, are in good, sound order. The Leader of the Government in the Senate quoted the International Monetary Fund’s declaration that Australia’s economy is sound and one of the best in the world because of the hard decisions made to bring about those reforms. There is something very phoney about a Labor Party who, when in government, presided over 17 per cent interest rates on housing mortgages, 24 per cent interest rates for small businesses, one million workers unemployed, $96 billion in debt and so on—you know the story. They instituted those policies and now want to be called economic conservatives.
As I said, that is what they did in government. If you want to know what they did in opposition, they voted against every single reform this government introduced so as to bring about the sound economy that is now being praised by the International Monetary Fund. As I said, there is something phoney about the Labor Party, whose leader told us he was a socialist democrat eight months ago and now wants us to believe he is an economic conservative. And there is something even phonier when the shadow minister for industry is Senator Kim Carr, who runs on trust—that was the nature of his comments today: trust in the Prime Minister. His own side do not trust him, and you know it. To think that he is the potential minister for industry must send a shiver up industry’s spine. I cannot believe that, if by chance you are elected, you will ever make him minister for anything. It is a disgrace that you have him on the front line. There is something phoney about Senator Carr being the minister for industry, and you know it yourself. It is as laughable as Rasputin’s credibility in the Tsar’s court. There is something very phoney about the other side when they say they are not run by the unions yet 70 per cent of their frontbench is made up of unionists. (Time expired)

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-09-18,"—The Howard government has wasted almost $2 billion on government advertising since it came to power in 1996. Since the last election it has spent more than $800 million on government advertising. In fact, $126.3 million was spent on advertising in the last financial year. We have heard today from other speakers that the estimated cost of this government’s propaganda blitz using taxpayers’ money in this election year, 2007, is estimated to be more than $500 million—that is, half a billion dollars. Meanwhile, Australian working families continue to struggle, not only with interest rate hikes but also with the increasing price of food and petrol. This demonstrates just how completely out of touch the Howard government has become with the plight of Australian working families. It also shows the arrogance of the government, which appears to view taxpayers’ money as its own to spend however it sees fit.
In the short time I have available, I would like to take the Senate through a few examples of the government’s expenditure on advertising campaigns in key policy areas. I will begin with the government’s extreme industrial relations laws. This government has spent $93 million advertising its extreme IR laws. The Howard government’s changes to Work Choices have been a further extravagant excuse to spend more taxpayers’ money on advertising these unfair laws in the lead-up to the election later this year. These laws, as we know, have shown themselves to be exactly what the Labor Party said they would be—that is, unpopular, extreme and unfair—and they have hit working families very hard. No amount of taxpayer funded advertising will change the substance of these laws, yet this does not stop the Howard government trying to fool the Australian public with its taxpayer funded advertising. Mr Deputy President, $20.5 million alone was spent on the campaign to promote the Office of Workplace Services and the Employment Advocate. A further $40 million was spent on promoting the employee advisory program, a program designed to encourage employers to promote Work Choices. When Australians see these ads on TV they should shudder at the expense, because every tax dollar that the government spends on advertising is one dollar fewer that can be spent by Australian families on clothing, children’s education, groceries and other essentials of life.
I want to move on to climate change. The government has recently launched a $52 million campaign on climate change, including $23 million in advertising. The campaign includes an expensive series of television advertisements and a booklet to be mailed to every household in this nation. As we know, the government has consistently over-promised and under-delivered when it comes to climate change. Since 1996, the Howard government has failed to deliver on almost $460 million of funding it promised to climate change initiatives. As a consequence, less that 0.05 per cent of the $245 billion federal budget is being spent on climate change initiatives. Mr Deputy President, 0.05 is a blood alcohol limit, not a climate change strategy.
I could go on to talk about money that has been spent on superannuation advertising—$69 million—and private health insurance. The government has spent $27 million on advertising private health insurance. It has spent $6 million on advertising regional telecommunications and $20 million has been spent on advertising government internet policies. A Rudd Labor government will end the abuse of taxpayer funded government advertising. A Rudd Labor government will cut spending on government advertising and ensure that all advertising campaigns costing more than $250,000 would be authorised—(Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-18,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the former Premier of Queensland that has just been tabled.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This response from the now former Premier of Queensland Mr Beattie responds to the Senate resolution of 13 August, which was supported by the Democrats and the coalition. It was actually originally moved by Senator Boswell, The Nationals senator for Queensland. It criticised the Beattie government for its forced amalgamations of Queensland local government; expressed concern at the decision to impose fines on councillors who put the amalgamation policy to local citizens by referendum; and noted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that every citizen should have the right and opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs. The Democrats supported that resolution, which was opposed by the ALP. I was particularly pleased to see the government and indeed Senator Boswell draw on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the importance of people having the right and opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs, particularly affairs that affect them directly.
The response from the Queensland government is redundant partly because the Senate has now passed legislation addressing the issue of the potential for people to have fines imposed on them for putting a question about the amalgamations to referendum and also because the state government subsequently reversed its position and will no longer take action against local governments which wish to hold a plebiscite. That aspect of the resolution has basically been made redundant by the actions of the Senate and the actions of the Queensland government. The response itself from Mr Beattie says that the state government in Queensland has reconsidered its position and is no longer going to take such action. It does still leave the issue of forced amalgamations unresolved. The Queensland government is still pressing ahead with these—I believe without any change in its stance at all—despite a new Premier, Ms Anna Bligh, coming into the position.
There are a couple of aspects of the Premier’s response therefore that do merit comment. Firstly, the response says that the so-called ‘reform’ of Queensland local government amalgamations occurred in light of reviews conducted by the Queensland Treasury Corporation which ‘demonstrated that a significant number of local governments are in a financially precarious position’. I note, firstly, that that assessment, at least in part, is seriously disputed by some councils and by the Local Government Association of Queensland and, secondly, that I think it is less than the full story, if not misleading, for the former Premier to state that the decision to implement reform came about solely because of these reviews conducted by the Queensland Treasury Corporation. There was already an ongoing and comprehensive reform process that was about a lot more than just amalgamations and that covered a wide range of issues going specifically to improving efficiency and increasing the opportunities for financial stability through a range of measures beyond just amalgamations. That process was already underway, and that has not been mentioned.
The response from the former Premier also states that the Queensland state government had to act immediately to strengthen the local government system because elections were due in March next year. It was widely acknowledged and floated that, to ensure sufficient time to bed down any amalgamations, it would be feasible to postpone those elections until later in 2008. The Local Government Act could have been quite readily amended by the state government to allow that to happen in the same way that it amended the Local Government Act to allow amalgamations to be forced through without a referendum—a requirement that previously existed under the law. Indeed, that requirement under the law was used to reassure people at the local government level around Queensland that there would not be forced amalgamations. That requirement was removed precipitously by the Queensland parliament, which only has a single chamber. It does not have an upper house and is controlled by the government of the day. This shows what happens when a government controls a parliament completely, whether it is a single house or two houses—whatever is in the law one day can be removed the next day when there is a political opportunity or political points to be scored. That is what happened in Queensland. I think the response from the former Premier is less than complete and somewhat misleading. It still leaves open the fact that there is significant community concern in Queensland about these forced amalgamations and there is a real question mark about how adequately they will operate.
Another point I want to emphasise is the noting of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Queensland National Party senators drawing upon it, which of course the Democrats support. I have not noticed National Party senators in Queensland drawing on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights terribly often in the past, but it is always good to see them moving in that direction. It is worth noting, with disappointment, two aspects. One is that, although commentary was made in the resolution and by many in the coalition about the need for referenda and the importance and benefit of them, the National Party in Queensland did not take the opportunity to fulfil its pledge to hold a referendum in Queensland when it was last in government. A key pre-election pledge of the then Borbage opposition was to hold a referendum to reinstitute an upper house in Queensland. That key pre-election pledge was broken, despite the fact that it was a not insignificant reason various preferences flowed to the coalition and made the National Party the senior party of government in Queensland, probably for the last time ever. They did not fulfil that pledge, they did not hold that referendum and they did not ask the people of Queensland their views. Therefore, the Queensland parliament is still without an upper house. It is no small irony that if there had been an upper house after that referendum had been held, the local government amalgamations would probably not have gone through.
The other point I want to emphasise is that another key right in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also dovetails with the resolution passed by the Senate, is the right to self-determination. Part 1 of article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that all peoples have the right to self-determination. Again, whilst the Democrats supported the resolution put forward by the coalition and by Senator Boswell and have expressed our dissatisfaction with the inadequate response from former Premier Peter Beattie, it is hard not to see the double standards because just last week the federal government refused to support the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They gave as a key reason their concern about the article which recognises the rights of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, floating the completely false and misleading suggestion that that might lead to some form of separatism even though there is a clear indication in the declaration that that is not how it should be interpreted.
It seems that demanding and celebrating the right of people to have the opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs and decisions directly affecting them is okay when it comes to local councils in Queensland but is not okay when it comes to Indigenous Australians. This is about not only the refusal to support plebiscites for Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, an amendment which again the coalition voted against with regard to this issue when the legislation was being debated last night, but also the refusal to support some of the basic components of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—when it comes to other parts that old position of refusing once again resurfaces.
It is unfortunate when you get that double standard because it does undermine the strength of the argument that is put forward. Nonetheless, the Democrats will maintain our consistent position. We will continue to express our strong concern at the Queensland state government’s ongoing insistence on forced amalgamations. I think the key issue from here on is maintaining the focus on what does actually happen and trying to maintain the pressure so that, whatever happens from here, there is maximum opportunity for people to have more potential to genuinely take part in the conduct of public affairs as noted in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and celebrated and supported by the Senate and the coalition via Senator Boswell’s resolution.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-09-18,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Bill 2007 and associated bills and the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007 have been listed together for debate. I intend to limit my contribution to only some of the schedules due to the combination of the two tax bills and the time constraints in dealing with what are two relatively large tax measures.
Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Bill 2007 repeals existing foreign loss and foreign tax credit quarantining rules and replaces them with new simplified foreign income tax offset rules. The main measure is the abolition of foreign loss and foreign tax credit quarantining and the rewriting of the remaining complex foreign tax credit rules as part of the 1977 tax act. The rewritten tax offset rules also reduce compliance and administration costs through the removal of the foreign tax credit as a remedy for the double taxation for transferring pricing adjustment in another country, the inclusion of a $1,000 de minimus cap and the removal of attributed tax accounts. The amendment means that taxpayers will no longer be required to quarantine assessable foreign income accounts into four separate classes. Excess foreign income deductions or foreign losses will no longer be quarantined for domestic assessable income. Therefore, in utilising deductions, no distinction is made in respect of the source of the assessable foreign or domestic income, which will reduce compliance costs.
The bill also allows taxpayers with a minority interest in foreign companies to choose to calculate attributable income using the CFC branch-equivalent rules rather than the foreign investment fund—FIF—rules. This should reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and financial institutions that have to deal with the notoriously complex FIF rules and will allow Australian investors to take advantage of the existing exemptions and concessions of the CFC measures.
These amendments go some way to making Australia’s international tax rules more competitive. However, there is so much more that this tired, out-of-touch, stale government could do. They have been sitting on their hands when it comes to ensuring Australia’s financial services sector can grow and become a financial hub within Asia. Labor will reform division 6C and replace it with a specified specific tax regime for managed funds and listed property trusts. This announcement is in addition to Labor leader Kevin Rudd’s announcement in the May budget reply to reduce the withholding tax rate that applies to non-resident investors to a flat and final rate of 15 per cent. These measures, proposals and policies of Labor demonstrate our commitment to Australia’s economic future. They are sensible tax changes that value-add and are welcomed by the financial services sector.
I also note that these changes in schedule 1 were announced in the 2005 budget. It has taken far too long—over two years—to legislate this, which I think again leads to a question mark being put over the government’s general translation of budget announcements into legislation in a timely manner.
Schedule 3 of this bill contains amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, commonly known as the SI(S) Act, to provide an exemption from the borrowing prohibition to allow superannuation funds to invest in instalment warrants so long as certain borrowing criteria are met. The in-house asset rules contained in the SI(S) Act are also amended to allow for the purchase of an interest in a related trust forming part of the instalment warrant, if certain conditions are met. This measure overcomes the tax office’s and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority’s view that instalment warrant arrangements constituted a form of borrowing and that an investment by a self-managed superannuation fund in an instalment warrant is an in-house asset and therefore breaches the borrowing provisions and in-house asset rules of the SI(S) Act. Labor believes that this proposal assists superannuation funds to grow their assets to support Australians in their retirement, and as a result supports the measure.
Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that the trustees of closely held trusts are no longer required to report to the Commissioner of Taxation details of the trust’s ultimate beneficiaries. Instead, trustees of closely held trusts are now only required to report details of the trust’s trustee beneficiaries. The ultimate beneficiary rules were introduced by this government in 1999 as an anti-avoidance measure aimed at preventing complex chains of trusts being used to avoid or indefinitely defer tax. The measure in this bill goes back on the government’s own closely held unit trust integrity measures of 1999. The amendments will reduce the costs of complying with the ultimate beneficiary rules but may be at the cost of the integrity of the tax system. Labor support this proposal to reduce the compliance burden and the compliance costs but will monitor the operation of this to ensure it does not open up possibilities of tax avoidance.
Schedule 5 amends various acts to assist in the smooth transition to the—I was going to say ‘simplified superannuation’ regime, but I have noticed of late that the government is no longer describing it as ‘simplified superannuation’. It seems to have morphed into what is called ‘better superannuation’. I wonder what focus group polling has been driving that quite significant change in title description. I have to say that everyone I have met has not particularly seen the ‘better super’ package, as it is now being dubbed by the government, as an exercise in simplification. Schedule 5 makes the following minor amendments to the superannuation rules: it limits strategies which could circumvent the minimum drawdown requirements for accounts based pensions; facilitates the provision of tax file numbers to superannuation retirement savings accounts; changes the treatment of a non-TFN contributions income under the pay-as-you-go—PAYG—regime; and revises the application of the small business capital gains tax relief amendments.
On the issue of tax file numbers, what I do not think is generally known in terms of the Better Superannuation package is that a penalty tax will be payable by the member on their contribution of 42.5 per cent rather than 15 per cent. I do not think most Australians are aware that they will be subject to a higher tax on contributions when their employer fails to provide their TFN.
In questioning the tax office closely during estimates about this, I must say that the tax office were more forthcoming with information than Treasury were. We are looking at perhaps five to eight per cent of the just over 10 million contributors to the system being penalised by this higher tax. These people will be in for a rude shock when they get their fund statement—conveniently after the election, of course. From 1 July next year, hundreds of thousands of people will suddenly discover they have been subject to higher tax, not lower tax. If Labor are in government, I indicate this is an area where we will be keeping a very close eye on the outcomes. Frankly, if we are in government, and if I am privileged to be a minister, I do not want to be sitting next to Treasury and Tax officials and having to defend the position whereby hundreds of thousands of Australians have had an increase in their contributions tax.
—I think you’re pretty safe!
—We will see. For the hundreds of thousands of people facing the prospect of higher tax, it is not particularly safe—as they will discover—no matter who is in government. I certainly believe the tax office, on all the evidence to date, are doing their very best to minimise this problem, but it is going to be a significant issue. That is my prediction.
The amendments also improve the readability of provisions rewritten as part of the simplified superannuation reforms and clarify the intended operations of the reforms. These are important changes around the edges of the new regime. The current superannuation regime is built on Labor’s superannuation policy of compulsion, which we introduced back in 1987, starting at three per cent and rising to nine per cent through the SG. The measures that we are presented with are sensible, and Labor support them.
Schedule 8 claims to provide more flexibility to family trusts by allowing family trust election to be varied or revoked in a broad range of circumstances, and expands the definition of a family to include lineal descendants. Also, distributions to former spouses, widows, widowers and former stepchildren will be exempt from family distribution tax. These measures come at a cost to revenue of $8 million per annum.
Schedule 8 reflects an out-of-touch government with a strange idea of priorities in tax reform. The measures simply make the family trust rules more generous. It is hard to see how it benefits the average taxpayer or the economy as a whole. I find it particularly hard to see how the lineal descendants of nieces and nephews can be appropriately described as family members for taxation purposes. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Bowen, moved an amendment in the House of Representatives which sought to remove schedule 8 from the bill. I will not be moving such an amendment in the Senate this afternoon. Time does not permit this to happen; we are under enormous time constraints. But Labor believes that the $8 million per annum that this schedule will cost taxpayers could be better spent on other projects.
Labor supports the measures contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill. I will turn first to schedule 1 of the bill, which reforms sections 51AD and division 16D of the 1936 tax act. It is reform which is vital in facilitating private sector investment in infrastructure, and it is long overdue. It has been a long wait—seven years, in fact—since reforms to these provisions to encourage infrastructure investment were first recommended by the Ralph review. We have seen three different Assistant Treasurers in that time. Gosh, doesn’t time fly when you’re having fun in opposition—three different Assistant Treasurers! And each of them successively has promised to introduce this legislation.
—You should try being on the crossbenches, mate!
—Yes. But seven years on, we have finally got the measures. I am not having a shot at the tax office or the tax advice from Treasury; it is a shot at the incompetence of this government. We well know the burden and overload on Treasury and the tax office in terms of implementation. I think this extraordinary seven-year waiting period is a product of the churn of Assistant Treasurers and of the government taking its eye off the ball. It is out of touch and a bit stale, and just has not given it the priority it should have been given.
Section 51AD and division 16D in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are replaced with a new division 250 in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. If division 250 applies to an arrangement, capital allowance deductions will be denied and the arrangement will be treated as a deemed loan that is taxed as a financial arrangement on a compounding accrual basis. The changes could do with some finetuning. However, Labor will not be opposing these changes. Generally, the sooner they are implemented, the better.
The history of this measure demonstrates a level of failure on the part of this government. The review of business tax, the Ralph review, recommended in 1999 that section 51AD be abolished. In response, the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, stated on 14 May 2002:
Further consultation on these issues will be undertaken through the course of 2002-03 and it is expected that legislation would be introduced in the Autumn 2003 sittings.
I repeat: ‘Autumn 2003 sittings.’ And here we are, in spring 2007. With respect to the 2003 draft exposure legislation that was released for comment by interested stakeholders, on 26 June 2003 Senator Coonan stated:
These provisions are in urgent need of reform ... The Government ... is committed to its early introduction into Parliament in the spring sittings, 2003.
Now, here we are, in spring 2007, with the legislation before the parliament. It is anyone’s guess as to how much investment in infrastructure has been lost because of the delay that has been caused and as a result of the four years it has taken to get what was described by the then minister, Senator Coonan, as urgent legislation.
It is simply not good enough that, at a time of capacity constraints—we all know the pressures on infrastructure in the economy—this government has delayed the reform of tax rules to encourage investment in infrastructure. This is yet another example of this government’s stale, short-sighted, out-of-touch approach and its lack of vision. However, better late than never—and Labor will support the proposal.
Schedule 6 of the bill removes the $100 million total income cap on the same business test. The schedule is particularly pleasing as it implements Labor policy and amendments from 2005. It represents another backflip by a government which would benefit from listening to business and Labor in developing tax policy. The same business test, the $100 million cap, was introduced by the government in 2005. I can recall Senator Murray’s contribution to the debate at that time—both Senator Murray and I have long memories! Both Labor and Senator Murray, on behalf of the Democrats, opposed it in the Senate in 2005. Labor consistently called for the removal of the cap, which had stood in the way of major investments in infrastructure projects, mining and venture capital. How right Senator Murray was and how right the Labor opposition was. Here we are in 2007 and the government is reversing a measure it introduced in 2005.
This approach by the government sends very bad investment signals to industry. The government is dragging its feet on key reforms which will build and assist productivity growth in this country. The measure removes the cap and it was strongly supported by submissions to the inquiry. This cap should never have been introduced in the first place. The Minerals Council, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, stated:
This arbitrary cap was denying legitimate capital allowance business deductions—which ultimately were factored into rate of return assessments, and potentially, discouraging expansion. This at a time when there is a significant need for investment in infrastructure projects in Australia.
The government claims to be pro-business and it introduced this cap, but here we are, two years later, removing it. I am glad the government has recognised the error of its ways and has adopted Labor policy—and, for that matter, Democrats policy.
Schedule 8 provides a CGT rollover for investors in a stapled group where there has been an interposition of a unit trust between the investors in the stapled group and the stapled entities. This will allow certain stapled entities such as Australian listed property trusts to restructure with an interposed head trust without any CGT consequences. There will also be a consequential amendment to division 6C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that the restructures do not result in the interposed trust being taxed as if it were a company. The measures will reduce the barriers for Australian listed property trusts to expand overseas, particularly in the US. However, the amendments only go a small part of the way to ensuring that Australian listed property trusts remain world leaders. The Property Council, in its submission, stated:
The Property Council views these reforms as the first stage of a now widely recognised need to comprehensively reform Division 6 …
Labor could not agree more. As I have already said, Labor has announced that it is committed to reforming division 6C and reducing the withholding tax rate to 15 per cent. Labor is strongly committed to making Australia the managed funds hub within the Asian region by increasing the competitiveness of what is a truly massive and world-class financial sector not just in terms of funds under management—it is the fourth largest, by volume, in the world—but also in terms of the quality and the skill of the employees. I think there are over 300,000 staff working in the financial services sector. It is world class in terms of the provision of the platforms and IT. It is a world-class industry which needs further encouragement to enhance its export potential. Labor supports this schedule; it makes a small step in the right direction. Labor also supports the government’s minor amendment to the schedule, which deals with the technical point raised in the Property Council submission.
Schedule 10 of the bill reforms the taxation concessions for Australian films. It introduces a new producer offset, which provides an offset of 40 per cent for film and 20 per cent for other media and increases the location offset from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent. There are some other changes that are useful for the industry. The offsets are designed to support and develop the Australian screen media industry. They replace the current package of tax incentives, which have not been particularly effective in recent times. The independent producer sector has expressed concerns about the new producer offset, because commercial broadcasters will be able to access the 20 per cent producer offset for the television series, documentaries and other programs they produce. Labor notes these concerns. Labor will monitor the effect and the impact on the independent film industry.
The remainder of the schedules to this bill enjoy the Labor Party’s support.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-18,"—We are dealing with four bills cognately. I think that is wise, given the pressure we are under to complete our consideration of a large number of bills this week—although I would have preferred that TLAB 5 be dealt with separately, it is appropriate that it is dealt with cognately here. Dealing first with the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Bill 2007, it is an omnibus bill containing eight schedules. It is accompanied by the Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-disclosure Tax) Bill (No. 1) 2007 and the Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-disclosure Tax) Bill (No. 2) 2007, which introduce amendments to complement the proposed changes in schedule 4 of what I will describe as TLAB 4 by providing mechanisms to introduce a 46½ per cent nondisclosure tax on certain income.
Schedule 1 of TLAB 4 introduces new income tax offset rules. The income tax law will be amended to abolish foreign loss and foreign tax credit quarantining and to streamline the remaining foreign tax credit rules. This is achieved by repealing the existing foreign loss and foreign tax credit quarantining rules and replacing them with new simplified foreign income tax offset rules. These rules also allow taxpayers to claim relief for foreign income taxes paid on an amount included in their assessable income. Transitional rules for the treatment of existing quarantined foreign losses and credits are also included. Such an amendment provides a mechanism to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to give effect to Australia’s tax treaty obligations to provide relief from economic double taxation arising from transfer pricing adjustments. These changes will commence on 1 July 2008, following royal assent. The cost to revenue of this measure is expected to be $40 million per annum over the forward estimates period.
Changes to the foreign income tax offset rules in schedule 1 of this bill are reflective of systemic changes to the taxation system that have removed the original stimulus for the present foreign income tax provisions. The ultimate purpose of these changes is to prevent double taxation for Australian income tax payers, both individuals and corporations, who may earn foreign income. Thus, the changes are equitable and to be supported. I also agree with the government’s view that these changes will reduce compliance and administration costs and increase Australia’s attractiveness as a source of capital investment and as a viable home base for international and regional organisations with both Australian and foreign income streams.
It should be noted that the nature of the offset only enables Australian taxpayers to reduce their income tax liability to zero. There is no mechanism to enable tax rebates through this system. If that had happened, it would have been a concern. In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into this bill, the Australian Bankers Association highlighted a number of inconsistencies with the way double taxation is relieved in respect of offshore banking and non-offshore banking income, a view supported by the Australian Financial Markets Association. In the committee’s view, the bill adequately deals with the ABA’s concerns related to the schedule. I support the committee’s view that trusts with such potential inconsistencies shall be monitored by Treasury with a view to correction should any matters of significance arise.
Schedule 2 proposes capital gains tax rollover relief for medical defence organisations, or MDOs, with proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The rollover will generally be available when a membership interest in an MDO is replaced with a similar membership interest in another MDO and both MDOs have companies limited by guarantee. These amendments apply to capital gains tax events that happen on or after 14 February 2007. There are no forecast costs associated with these changes. This rollover aims to provide a better allocation of the nation’s capital resources by removing capital gains tax as an impediment to mergers and takeovers in MDOs to help facilitate consolidation in the industry where required and/or desired. Those who have followed my career as the tax portfolio spokesperson for the Democrats know that I have tried to assist mergers and acquisitions improvements at every opportunity, because I think a highly flexible market is in the interests of Australia.
Schedule 3 enables investment in instalment warrants by superannuation funds. The amendment as proposed removes a borrowing restriction contained in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to allow superannuation funds to invest in instalment warrants of a limited recourse nature over any asset the fund would be permitted to invest in directly. The in-house asset rules contained in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 are also amended to provide that an investment and related trust forming part of an eligible instalment warrant arrangement will only be an in-house asset where the underlying asset itself would be an in-house asset of the fund if it were held directly. These amendments will apply from the day the bill receives royal assent and are forecast to be a considerable cost to revenue of $350 million over the forecast estimates period, with these costs expected to escalate each year after that. Notwithstanding the cost, the Democrats support them.
Strict rules naturally apply to the operation of superannuation funds to minimise the financial risks such funds are able to undertake. Superannuation has historically been viewed and regulated as a lower risk investment because of the importance of protecting individuals’ life savings and retirement funds. One such risk that has been consistently and justly prohibited is any form of leverage—that is, superannuation funds are prohibited or restricted from borrowing money to invest. This schedule proposes widening a form of asset superannuation funds are able to invest in by including limited recourse warrants within the basket of available assets. Warrants are a form of derivative security which derives its value from an exercisable option on an underlying asset. Some instalment warrants incorporate a borrowing and thus have not been allowed under current restrictions. The AFMA, which I mentioned earlier, welcome the change, and in the aforementioned committee report, they assert that regulatory standards are not eroded by the proposed changes. But I note that they said:
It seems strange that instalment arrangements that feature a borrowing enjoy a broader exception than those which do not. Accordingly we recommend the subsection 10(1) definition be expanded.
Such a proposal seems common sense to me, and the amendments suggested by the AFMA, despite Treasury comments to the contrary, are worthy of future consideration.
Schedule 4 introduces new trustee beneficiary reporting rules by proposing amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that trustees of closely held trusts are not required to report to the Commissioner of Taxation the details of the ultimate beneficiaries of trust income. Instead, trustees of closely held trusts may be required to report the details of trustee beneficiaries that are presently entitled to certain income of the trust and tax preferred amounts. These amendments will apply to the first income year starting on or after the day in which this bill receives royal assent and in later income years. The financial costs are unknown. Schedule 4, in effect, substitutes the reporting requirements for closely held trusts from the requirement to report ultimate beneficiaries to a trustee beneficiary statement. This clarifies and simplifies the reporting requirements for applicable trusts by ensuring that all trustees entitled to a share of the trust net income and tax preferred amounts are reported. I am always wary of anything that conceals the identity of ultimate beneficiaries where there are just a few key persons. That always means that there is a desire to be hidden from scrutiny, and the question is: why? What is there to be hidden? Obviously, that is not the case when trustees represent a great number of people or represent minors. Then it is appropriate that the ultimate beneficiaries are not exposed. Notwithstanding the clarification in legislation, such trust vehicles still represent a significant tax avoidance tool, which the Democrats have consistently opposed. I remain wary of this area of tax law.
Schedule 5 introduces a number of legislative updates to the new simplified superannuation system. The bill amends various acts to assist in the smooth transition to the simplified superannuation regime. This schedule limits strategies which could circumvent the minimum draw-down requirements for account based pensions, facilitates the provision of tax file numbers to superannuation and retirement savings account providers, and revises the application provision for small business capital gains tax relief under the regime. ‘Well done’ is what I say. The readability of provisions rewritten as part of the reforms has also further improved to ensure the policy intent underpinning the provisions is clear. The simplified superannuation regime commenced on 1 July 2007. However, an individual’s tax file number is taken to have been quoted by the individual for notices given to superannuation and RSA providers by the Commissioner of Taxation from 1 June 2007. The amendments to prevent individuals circumventing the minimum draw-down requirements for account based pensions will result in a revenue gain of $20 million over the forward estimates. These amendments clarify the operation of draw-down limits to ensure that the concessional nature of the new simplified superannuation system tax-free status only applies to income stream assets and not assets quarantined for investment purposes. This is a desirable clarification that closes a potential loophole in superannuation law.
The retrospective application of capital gains tax exemptions for small business sale profits invested into super is likewise an equitable and worthwhile amendment. My remarks now are directed to the government advisers so that they can take note of this. I have discovered that people writing to superannuation funds giving their tax file number and signing the letter with their proper signature have not had that advice accepted until such time as they fill in a form which is designated by the superannuation company. I think that is a dangerous practice because if people have taken the trouble to write in with their TFN and their signature, that is prima facie compliance with the law and I would ask you to be aware of that.
Schedule 6 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the list of deductible gift recipients to include the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project incorporated from 30 April 2007 until 31 December 2008 and Social Ventures Australia Ltd from 4 May 2007 with a forecast cost to revenue of $9.82 million over the forecast estimates period.
Schedule 7 makes technical corrections and other minor amendments to the taxation laws. Schedule 8 increases flexibility for family trusts by amending the trust loss regime in schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow family trust elections and interposed entity elections to be revoked or varied in certain limited circumstances. These amendments also broaden the definition of ‘family’ in section 272-90(5) in schedule 2F to the ITAA 1936 to include lineal descendants of family members. In addition, spouses, former widows, widowers and former stepchildren are exempted from the family trust distribution tax by including them in the definition of family group in section 272-90 in schedule 2F to the ITAA 1936. Changes take effect from the start of the income year in which the bill receives royal assent and is forecast to cost $24 million over the estimates period. While these changes to improve the legislation governing such provisions have the Democrats’ support, the Democrats remain opposed to the use of family trusts to avoid or unjustly minimise tax obligations.
I want to turn to my committee stage amendments and to discuss them briefly in my speech to the second reading motion. My amendments, circulated to the chamber, aim to implement the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission’s report Same-sex: same entitlements recommendations. My amendments are drafted in the absence of government initiatives to address those recommendations. This is the first tax bill that I could amend following the HREOC report. I say to the government that I would be delighted were the government to substitute their own amendments for mine, but there is no sign of that moral courage as yet. I move these today because this issue is urgent and this unwarranted discrimination is overdue for correction. Fifty-eight federal laws were identified by HREOC as needing similar amendments. Specifically, I propose to implement the HREOC de facto relationship definition. Those amendments are in line with HREOC’s preferred approach, wherein a dual system of acknowledgement is able to operate—in this case in tax law—one which recognises heterosexual and marital relationships as one set and one which recognises homosexual non-marital relationships as a parallel set.
HREOC has identified 58 acts as needing amendment to end this unjust discrimination. The Democrats agree with this and have followed HREOC’s suggested form as closely as we can. My amendment proposes to remove this discrimination. If the government decides not to support the Democrats amendments, it will be because it does not support the removal of clauses in taxation legislation that discriminate on the basis of sexual preference. That will mean the coalition will be continuing to uphold homophobic laws. Given the strong cross-party support for ending unjust discrimination, including from a great many members of the cabinet and the coalition, I remain optimistic that the government will recognise the strength of these arguments. At this moment I see no cause for delay whatsoever.
The tax portfolio holder we are dealing with here is the Treasurer. I do not know where the Treasurer stands on these matters. I do not know whether he supports official homophobic policy or not. I do know that if he really insisted that this unjust taxation discrimination should end, it would end. He is, after all, the most senior minister in the government and the deputy leader of the Liberal Party.
I am told by insiders that most Liberal ministers favour ending this unjust discrimination, so the buck stops with the Prime Minister. And the finger will be pointed at him if the coalition policy of homophobia continues after that damning HREOC report, because that HREOC report has said there is no justification for the discrimination that occurs in tax superannuation and other laws. The flip side of tolerance is hatred. Extremists of many religions and many religious and political sects hate homosexuals. Such extremists undoubtedly support the present coalition policy of inequity in tax matters like these. The coalition and the Treasurer will be keeping terrible company if they keep homophobic tax laws on their books, and I do hope they will have the courage to accept my amendment or to offer amendments of their own.
I now turn to the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007. It has 12 schedules. Schedule 1 covers asset financing for public-private partnerships. Schedules 2 and 3 deal with thin capitalisation. Schedules 4, 7 and 8 are capital gains tax rollover changes. Schedule 5 deals with income tax and the Prime Minister’s prize. Schedule 6 is the same business test cap removal. Schedule 9 covers gift recipients clauses. Schedule 10 covers film production offsets, schedule 11 covers the 175 per cent R&D tax deduction extension and schedule 12 covers Innovation Australia.
I must compliment the government on its reaction to the report of the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into this legislation. I note that there are a number of amendments which directly address matters which were raised in that inquiry. I think the government is very wise to have moved rapidly to address issues which were of concern to a number of the witnesses. Obviously, the government has recognised that it was legitimate concern. So another ‘well done’ for you.
The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007 has a big price tag—in excess of $640 million over the forward estimates. The two big-ticket items are a comprehensive rewrite of the current tax subsidies and incentives for Australian film production and the removal of the same business test cap. Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to modify the taxation treatment of leasing and similar arrangements between taxpayers and tax preferred end users, such as tax-exempt entities and nonresidents, for the financing and provision of infrastructure and other assets.
The principal application of the law is intended for what are known as PPPs—the public-private partnerships. These changes to tax laws, which are aimed at encouraging investment in Australian infrastructure, must be considered in the context of some high-profile failures in public-private partnership infrastructure investments. In some ways I think it is hard to criticise governments on public-private partnership arrangements because they have had to learn on the job. But what they have had to learn, I think, is to be extremely careful of some of the actions and activities of some private operators who have had somewhat of a lend of the public sector. Whether or not such past failures affect the future of these schemes I do not know, but I am convinced that there is still a place for purely public sector activity and for public-private sector cooperation and activity.
Schedules 2 and 3 relate to the thin capitalisation rules and their anti-avoidance mechanism, which continues to be of importance. This amending legislation corrects this discrepancy and upholds the original intention of the law. It is supported by the Democrats. I notice my time is up. I wish I could talk much more about tax, Madam Acting Deputy President, but I will have to leave it there.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-09-18,"—I am pleased, as Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, to follow my friend and committee colleague Senator Murray in talking to the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Bill 2007 and related bills. I would like to follow on from some of his comments in relation to schedule 10 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007, which I will refer to as TLAB5.
Schedule 10, which deals with film production offsets, follows on from a 2007 budget announcement by this government which, quite rightly, received enormous praise from those in the industry. I would like to briefly quote some of the commentary following the budget. I quote from the Australian on 10 May:
Talk to people in the film industry and the Australian Screen Production Incentives, announced as part of a $282.9 million film package, seem poised to pave a yellow brick road back to Oz, luring home creative talent that has drifted off-shore.
“I would like to think that within two or three years the amount of production will lead to an increase of 25 per cent [in] television drama feature films,” says Brian Rosen, chief executive of the Film Finance Corporation.
“The industry got everything it wanted: it’s the biggest change since 10BA was introduced by the Fraser government 25 years ago, which created the strong talent base. Now it’s about creating the businesses to drive the industry. Successful Australian international directors will come back and make more films here.”
In the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 May this year, in the arts section, John Garnaut wrote:
The Arts Minister, George Brandis, gave the film industry almost everything it wanted last night, with a $280 million funding injection over four years.
He continued:
The changes are considered the most important for the industry in more than a decade.
Minister Brandis, I do congratulate you on this extraordinary initiative which will make a huge difference to the arts in this country. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 May, in the arts and entertainment section, in an article headed ‘Luhrmann hails budget boost for film “stunning”‘, Gary Maddox wrote:
From the set of his epic film Australia, director Baz Luhrmann described the boost for the film industry in the budget as extraordinary.
Driving back from meetings with film-makers, the Village Roadshow managing director Graham Burke said it was “much bigger” than the Division 10BA tax incentives that fuelled an Australian film-making boom in the 1980s.
All round the industry there was marvelling at the scale of the Federal Government’s support—
that is, at the meeting he was at. The article quotes Mr Luhrmann as saying:
“It’s an extraordinary result really and probably a very historical moment,” he said. “The one big idea that they responded to and have completely embraced is that around the globe, we’re in an extraordinary and unique situation when it comes to the cinematic arts ...”
The article continues:
Graham Burke, who is involved in production both through Village Roadshow and the Warner-Roadshow joint venture, said it was “a wonderful moment” in the history of the Australian film industry”.
“Australia has a natural skill in this area and for the Government to be encouraging that in a way that is commercial, because it will cause private investment to sit beside the government money, is just stunning.”
There were many more quotes following on from that marvellous initiative.
My colleagues and I on the committee met in relation to all these matters. We took a lot of evidence. I would like to thank colleagues from the government and from the Labor Party, and Senator Murray, for their assistance. We heard some initial issues in relation to the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007. Basically they revolved around the following matters. I quote from paragraph 11.9 of the report:
the potential effect of the bill on the allocation of resources between in-house and independent producers in the television production sector;
the accessibility of the production offset to animators;
the depreciation of low value capital assets used in film production …
In relation to the first of those, the allocation of resources between in-house and independent producers, there were two quite separate schools of thought. The Screen Producers Association of Australia raised concerns ‘over the possibility of Australian commercial television networks exploiting the 20 per cent producer rebate at the expense of the independent television production sector’. Free TV—and I refer now to 11.16 in the report—representing the free-to-air commercial networks, rejected the notion that the legislation should discriminate against in-house producers by limiting their access to the rebate. Free TV also repudiated the claim that commercial networks’ access to the rebate would shift production from the independent sector in-house. It argued that generating quality television content will always take precedence over maximising available tax rebates.
The committee listened very carefully to the Screen Producers Association of Australia, and particularly to the presentation from Mr Geoffrey Brown. Recommendation 3 of the report reads:
The committee recommends that the Govern-ment review the implementation of the producer offset scheme in twelve months to ensure it is not being misused to mitigate the intention of facili-tating a sustainable Australian film production sector, including a vibrant independent sector.
I am very pleased that the government has actually gone further than that. The amendment that will be moved will make it quite clear that the minister must indeed, before the end of 12 months after the commencement of the division, initiate a review of the effect of the division in relation to levels of production by the Australian independent production sector compared to levels of production by Australian television broadcasters. What this means is that in 12 months time we will know exactly what the situation is in relation to any potential swing between outsourced, independent production and in-house production.
We have evidence from Free TV and their representatives that there will not be such a move back to in-house production. There are the legitimate concerns of the independent sector that this will occur. It was the committee’s view that it was a matter that was better dealt with in 12 months time by way of review than, if you like, by the committee picking winners on information that quite frankly we could not judge until it had been put—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I will take the interjections, because I was actually referring to the committee—and the committee believed that it was appropriate to do so.
—Another review!
—We could have 500 reviews and we still would not get within a bull’s roar of what the Australian Labor Party has nominated. But this is a debate about the film production sector and I will not be drawn in by these inappropriate interjections. I will turn back to this very important report.
 (Senator Moore)—That is very wise, Senator.
—I am sure the other members of the committee would very much agree with the government’s amendment in relation to strengthening our recommendations.
—It was unanimous.
—Yes, indeed; it was unanimous. And you agreed wholeheartedly; thank you, Senator Murray. The other matter is the accessibility of the production offset to animators. The committee was very concerned about this matter. We believed the evidence that was given to us was quite legitimate. There were legitimate concerns and we made recommendations in relation to them in recommendation 4. I am very pleased, and I am sure my colleagues on the committee will be equally pleased, that the government has addressed those matters with a further amendment. On behalf of the committee, I thank the government for doing that so rapidly.
The third matter is the depreciation of low-value capital assets used in film production. This is a more difficult issue. We received evidence from Louise Houston, Tax Manager of Warner Bros Entertainment Australia, in relation to this matter. I will not take up the time of the chamber in relation to all the matters detailed by Ms Houston, but I will briefly quote from a letter.
The proposal to include the balancing adjustment of the capital asset in the calculation of qualifying production expenditure for the film production offsets is welcome.
It then goes on to talk about the EM, in paragraph 10.72:
However, it appears that subsection 376-125(7) may not apply to a balancing adjustment for a depreciating asset required to be allocated to a low value pool. This would unfairly disadvantage a production company which for example is a member of a tax consolidated group which has previously elected to allocate assets to a low value pool. This is because such an election is irrevocable and applies to all companies within the tax consolidated group, irrespective of whether they were even in existence at the time the original election was made.
The government believes that work is required to properly investigate their concerns; that, if an amendment were warranted, there would not be sufficient time for it to be drafted; and that it would not be appropriate, in the government’s view, to delay passage of the bill to accommodate that investigation. I can say, however, to those with a concern in this area that the government will look further at the matter and give it appropriate consideration after the passage of the bill—which, in normal circumstances, is entirely appropriate.
I will not take up any further time. This is a very important initiative. The committee—I am sure I can speak on behalf of the committee—thanks the government for moving very quickly in relation to these two matters of great importance to the sector.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-09-18,"—I would like to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007 and, in particular, to schedules 11 and 12—that is, those matters that amend the research and development taxation arrangements, and the establishment of an entity known as Innovation Australia. Senator Sherry drew to my attention a moment ago that this is yet another government body. We have heard already more reviews—
—How many is that?
—I do not think these people know how to open their mouths without initiating yet another review or establishing another government body. I would like to take the issue of the schedules in order. I will start with schedule 11, which implements the changes to the 175 per cent premium tax concession to give access to international firms that hold their intellectual property offshore. I have argued for some time that there is merit in opening up the R&D tax concession to international firms, on the basis that most of the spillover benefits from the R&D conducted in Australia still flow if the IP is held by a multinational’s head office overseas. That is why Labor welcomed the Howard government’s decision, in its May industry statement, to expand eligibility for the premium concession and to remove the beneficial ownership test. We had campaigned on this issue for some time.
It should be noted, however, that that measure alone accounted for some $500 million of the government’s so-called $1.4 billion industry statement—except that this figure of $500 million is made up of a remarkable calculation, which is that a figure of $50 million was flatlined across 10 years. We have a measure here which has had an arbitrary figure of $50 million put in, flatlined for 10 years. So I will be very interested to see just how the actual costings come out over time, given the Howard government’s absolutely appalling record when it comes to the question of costing changes to the tax concession. I do not think there has been a year in which the costings have been accurate—not one year.
I give the officials due notice here that I would like to ask some questions during the committee stage of this bill about how this figure was settled upon. How was it that a figure of $50 million was calculated? And how was it that it was calculated on the basis that it would be the same figure for 10 years—irrespective of the behavioural changes that might occur in the take-up rates for this particular measure? So, given the absolutely appalling answers that I received on these issues in the budget estimates, I think it is appropriate, given that we have officers here today, that they enlighten us. I think they should be able to enlighten us as to how it was that Treasury came up with these particular costings.
I repeat that Labor welcomed the belated initiative by the Howard government as an attempt, albeit in a limited way, to internationalise Australia’s innovation system. However, this bill makes it clear that the government is simply introducing an even higher level of complexity into the R&D concession scheme. At the time of the announcement, Labor pointed out that the 175 scheme is a bureaucratic nightmare. Yet this bill actually introduces further complexities and red tape.
For a start, the definition of research and development for the purposes of the new regime is different from the rules that apply to companies holding their IP offshore. This was not announced. While it may be done for the benefit of administrative practice, nonetheless it results in companies that are eligible for both types of tax concession having to categorise their R&D spending in two different ways. The bottom line is that this legislation has been described by stakeholders as complex, confusing and bureaucratic.
This creates a second problem, and that is the risk that the policy intent will be undermined by a perception that the new scheme is difficult to access. Not only will international firms have to look at the rate of support they will receive for the R&D; they will also have to take into account the complexity of the system. And it would be hard to imagine a system more complex than that which has been created by this government.
Labor will continue to seek feedback from business about the effectiveness of the premium concession and of this measure in particular. But the fact is that this policy, like the whole industry statement, reflects a half-hearted approach from this government. The last time I had occasion to speak on a bill relating to the R&D tax concession, I made the point that even the Productivity Commission realises that the eligibility criteria for the R&D tax offset provides perverse incentives for small, high-tech businesses to actually limit their R&D spending. But the government has made no attempt to amend the threshold arrangements. One can only assume that, since they have not done it in the industry statement, they had no intention of fixing this particular problem. Beyond that, of course, there is serious potential to improve the R&D concession arrangements overall. However, broadly speaking, there is a serious need to improve Australia’s business R&D performance, and this was yet another missed opportunity to do just that.
With regard to our performance, some disturbing facts about Australia’s R&D have increasingly come to light. The ABS noted in its release of its 2005-06 figures that, at 1.04 per cent of GDP, Australia’s rate of business R&D expenditure ‘remains below the OECD average of 1.53 per cent’. The fact is that Australia’s businesses are still recovering from the savaging of the R&D concession by the Howard government in 1996. In 1996, Mr Howard said that his government would ‘improve Australia’s international ranking in terms of expenditure on business R&D, as a share of GDP’. Instead, he slashed the tax concession in half and sat on his hands while business R&D growth stayed in negative territory for four years—yet another example of a broken promise under this government.
One of the most obvious characteristics of this government is its capacity to fail to implement promises. Of course, this was not a position that we were ever exposed to in the election through which this government came to office. They now have the opportunity to come before the Australian people again, and I look forward to this government coming clean on these issues in this forthcoming election. I look forward to this government changing its course, going out to Yarralumla and declaring that it is time for the election. Given that this is the longest parliamentary term we have had for some years in the Commonwealth, it is appropriate that the Prime Minister acknowledges that this government is way out of time and that this is the sort of issue that ought to be discussed in the forthcoming election. This is an issue on which the government ought to acknowledge that it has failed.
Four years after that initial savaging of the system in 2000, the government commissioned a report confirming there had been both an absolute and a relative decline in Australia’s business research and development performance since the mid-1990s. Over that same period, 20 of the 28 other OECD countries for which there is data experienced a notable increase in their business R&D to GDP ratio. Over the full 11 years of the Howard government, the overall result is that the real average annual growth rate in business research and development has been a woeful 5.7 per cent, compared to 14.5 per cent for the period when Labor was in office. It is not a bad achievement to cut it by a third, is it? If Australia had maintained the same growth rate in business R&D under the Howard government that it achieved under Labor, investment would now be double today’s figures. Instead of seeing strong growth over the last couple of years, we are only now starting to catch up to the record of achievement in business R&D back in the nineties.
I contrast this with our competitors. You can see quite clearly what is happening. China, for instance, is committed to lifting its overall research and development spending as a percentage of GDP to 2.5 per cent by 2050, up from 0.6 per cent in 1995 and 1.2 per cent in 2002. China is doubling its R&D effort every seven years. The Chinese have in fact overtaken Japan as the second biggest spender on research and development behind the United States, with spending growth of over 20 per cent during the previous year. The Howard government ministers who would like to tell us about selling minerals to China and buying back cheap, low-tech goods do not seem to understand just how far and how fast the Chinese are transforming their economy. They do not seem to get the fundamental principle: China is moving up the value chain at a rapid rate. The only way we can stay ahead of the game is to play much smarter than we are now.
The last schedule of this bill, schedule 12, moves to combine the Industry Research and Development Board with the Venture Capital Registration Board to form a new entity known as Innovation Australia. Labor supports this amalgamation. It makes sense. It is a very small step towards streamlining a national innovation scheme that is now characterised by massive gaps, duplication and red tape. This proposal, though, sends two clear messages about what this government is seeking to do when it comes to innovation. The first message is very clear: the government is half-hearted. When the system needs a fundamental overhaul, we get Minister Macfarlane combining two administrative boards. Where better coordination is needed between the government and the states, the Howard government actually refuses to participate. While we are sorely in need of measures to bridge the cultural divide between the research sector and business, the Howard government has nothing to offer. The second message is that in Innovation Australia we have a clear case of mutton dressed up as lamb. Anyone hearing that name would expect a genuinely new body to drive the revitalisation of a national innovation system. If they think that, they will be sorely disappointed by this government’s inaction. While it is easy to support the amalgamation of two bodies, we need a much more fundamental policy response if we are to convince anyone that we are actually serious about innovation in this country.
This bill gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the importance of innovation to the future of the Australian economy. It gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the pretty ordinary performance of this government when it comes to innovation. It also gives us an opportunity to look again at what the world’s experts are saying: innovation will drive productivity and prosperity in the 21st century. It makes it crystal clear yet again that the current government is ill prepared to secure Australia’s prosperity for the future because it simply does not understand the fundamental importance of innovation in meeting the challenges ahead.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-18,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Bill 2007, the associated imposition bills and the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007.
Turning first to TLAB4, schedule 1 will abolish foreign loss and foreign tax credit quarantining and streamline the remaining foreign tax credit rules. It also contains transitional rules for the treatment of existing foreign losses and credits. By reducing compliance costs and complexity in the law, these changes will assist businesses operating or seeking to grow internationally. Schedule 2 provides a capital gains tax rollover for membership interests in companies limited by guarantee that are also medical defence organisations. Schedule 3 will allow superannuation funds to continue to invest in instalment warrants, consistent with longstanding practice. Such warrants must be of a limited recourse nature and can be held over any asset a fund is permitted to invest in directly.
Schedule 4 introduces simplified trustee beneficiary reporting rules. These rules will target arrangements where complex chains of trusts are used to obscure the ultimate beneficiary of the assessable trust income. These changes demonstrate the government’s ongoing commitment to reducing red tape and regulatory burdens. Schedule 5 will assist in the smooth transition to the simplified superannuation regime known as Better Super and clarify the policy intent. Schedule 6 amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their worthy activities. Schedule 7 implements various minor technical amendments and makes general improvements to the law that will improve the quality of the tax laws and reduce complexity. Finally, schedule 8 amends the trust loss rules which apply to family trusts. The amendments allow family trust elections to be varied or revoked in a broader range of circumstances and also expand the definition of ‘family’.
I now turn to the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 5) Bill 2007. Schedule 1 to this bill significantly improves the tax treatment of leasing and similar arrangements between taxable entities and tax exempt entities, including foreign residents, for the financing and provision of infrastructure and other assets. These changes streamline the existing harsh rules and reduce the compliance costs of Australian businesses. Schedule 2 amends the thin capitalisation rules to ensure that they operate as intended by changing the definition of excluded equity interest. Schedule 3 will allow groups that consolidate for tax purposes to apply the thin capitalisation rules as if the group did not contain an authorised deposit-taking institution where the only authorised deposit-taking institutions in the group are specialist credit card institutions. Schedule 4 will provide a capital gains tax rollover upon marriage breakdown to ensure that capital gains tax need not be an impediment to separating spouses wanting to achieve a clean break from each other in terms of superannuation.
Schedule 5 to the bill exempts from income tax the Prime Minister’s prizes for Australian history and science to the extent that the prizes would otherwise be assessable income. Schedule 6 removes the $100 million total income cap on the same business test in the company loss recoupment rules. When determining of prior year losses can be deducted against future income, all companies will have access to the same test. Schedule 7 extends capital gains tax rollover relief for statutory licences. The rollover will apply where a statutory licence ends and is replaced by one or more new licences that authorise substantially similar activity to the activity authorised by the original licence or licences. The measure also provides a partial rollover where a statutory licence ends and is replaced by a new licence or licences and other capital proceeds are also received.
Schedule 8 allows a stapled group of entities to restructure with an interposed head trust without triggering certain tax consequences. Under the measure, a restructure that involves interposing a head trust over a public unit trust that is stapled to a company will not result in the interposed head trust being taxed as a company under division 6C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These amendments will particularly enhance the international competitiveness of Australian listed property trusts. Schedule 9 updates the list of deductible gift recipients and extends the period for which deductions are allowed for gifts to a fund that has time limited status.
Schedule 10 introduces a package of incentives that will reform and strengthen the Australian film industry, which was announced in the 2007-08 budget. I will return to schedule 10 and make some additional remarks in a moment. Schedule 11 extends the premium 175 per cent research and development—R&D—tax concession to Australian research and development activities undertaken on behalf of multinational companies. Finally, schedule 12 establishes a new board called Innovation Australia to administer and oversee the industry portfolios innovation and venture capital programs.
I would like to say a few additional words about schedule 10 of TLAB5, which implements the film package. As Senator Ronaldson pointed out in his contribution, that has been rapturously received by the film industry.
—Rapturously!
—Yes, it has been received rapturously, Senator Carr. It is the greatest set of innovations of support to the Australian film industry since the Fraser government introduced sections 10B and 10BA in the 1970s.
I want to take the opportunity to place on record the debt of gratitude which we owe my predecessor in the portfolio, Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp. Although I followed Senator Kemp into the portfolio on 30 January, by the time I became the responsible minister most of the work in relation to the film industry package had been done by him and by officials under his instruction. I particularly thank James Cameron and Peter Young from the department for the extremely high standard of work that they undertook both in the preparation and, currently, in the implementation phase of the film package.
As I said before, this is a package that has been very well received. However, when it was reviewed by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in its hearings on TLAB5, there were a small number of outstanding issues raised which the government, as Senator Ronaldson foreshadowed, will address. Probably the most vexed of the issues concerned the question of access to the producer rebate. A concern was raised on behalf of the bodies representing independent producers that the accessibility of the rebate to broadcasters that might produce products in-house could have a deleterious effect upon independent producers. In the end, the committee recommended, as Senator Ronaldson foreshadowed, in recommendation 3 that there be a review of the operation of the producer offset scheme in 12 months to ensure that it is not being misused to mitigate the facilitation of a sustainable Australian film production sector, including a vibrant independent sector. In the government amendments that will be moved in committee there will be an amendment moved to mandate that review on a statutory basis.
I take this opportunity to affirm on the part of the government its intention that the independent sector should be beneficiaries of the producer rebate. It has not been the view of the government that eligibility for the rebate should be quarantined only to the independent sector, but it is certainly the view of the government that independent producers should be beneficiaries of the producer rebate. Were it to be the case that in the early months of the operation of the scheme independent producers were missing out, it would be the intention of the government to re-look at the matter. In that regard, might I adopt the language of paragraph 11.47 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which says:
It would be the committee’s expectation that were the availability of the scheme for in-house production to have a detrimental effect on the independent sector then the Government on the basis of that evidence should legislate to restrict the producer offset scheme to independent producers.
That is the intention of the government, and if the empirical evidence suggested that that was the effect then that would be our intention; however, we are not persuaded that the scheme, as devised, will have that effect.
Secondly, the Senate Standing Committee on Economics recommended that there be some amendments to change the definition of a qualifying series for the purpose of animated features, and the government has adopted that recommendation and an amendment to that effect will be moved in the committee stage. Finally, the committee recommended that the current restriction on the Film Finance Corporation co-investing in projects produced in-house continue to apply to funding provided by the new body, the Australian Screen Authority—or, as it will be called after 1 July 2008, Screen Australia. I also indicate that that would be my intention.
With those remarks, I once again thank honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate. In particular, I thank those who have been the prime movers in this revolutionary, once-in-a-generation reform of the Australian film industry. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-18,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007. Can I say at the outset that this bill has been rushed in, which is particularly evident in the preparation—perhaps you could call it that—that has gone into the bill to date.
I will go to the purpose first. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002:
... to clarify that an Australian Crime Commission (ACC) examiner can record their reasons for issuing a summons or notice to produce before, at the same times as, or as soon as practicable after, the summons or notice has been issued.
It also seeks to protect those summonses already issued from being challenged—that is, these summonses are not invalid merely because the reasons were not recorded prior to their issue. This has arisen, as we are informed by the government, from a court case with the Australian Crime Commission against Brereton in 2007. The judgement was handed down on 23 August 2007, as I understand it.
Smith J said basically that, for a summons to be valid, reasons for issuing the summons must have been issued prior to the time the summons was actually issued. That case dealt with the issue of two subpoenas, and I will come to those shortly, but it does seem to demonstrate a couple of things. One thing is that the government has taken a view that this matter needs to now be progressed urgently, and it has introduced the bill at very short notice. The bill has not had the opportunity of going to a Senate committee, as many of these bills might otherwise. The opposition was given notice of this bill only last night.
I will give some background. The Australian Crime Commission is a Commonwealth statutory body working nationally with other federal, state and territory agencies to counter serious and organised crime. It aims to bring together all arms of intelligence gathering and law enforcement to fight against serious and organised criminal activity. The powers of the ACC are large. The ACC, through an examiner, may summon a person to appear before them at an examination to give evidence and to produce such documents or other things as are referred to in the summons. And, of course, an examiner has a special role under the legislation. An examiner has the power, under the ACC Act, to conduct an examination for the purposes of a special intelligence operation or special investigation. Examiners are independent statutory officers appointed by the Governor-General, and the purpose of an examination is to inform an examiner on matters that may relate to the subject matter of the special intelligence operation or investigation.
The government, as I have said, has rushed this bill to the parliament in response to the Australian Crime Commission v Magistrates’ Court of Victoria (at Melbourne) & Brereton [2007]. Briefly, perhaps it is worthwhile going to the circumstances of that case. Mr Brereton attended but refused to be sworn or make an affirmation of the truthfulness of the evidence. This was a matter that examiners had requested he attend. Brereton was then subsequently charged, as I understand it, under section 30 of the ACC Act regarding that refusal. Section 30 relates to a failure to answer questions. A person who contravenes section 30 subsections (1), (2) or (3):
... is guilty of an indictable offence that, subject to this section, is punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding 200 penalty units or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years.
It is, in fact, a serious offence. The counsel for Mr Brereton sought to subpoena two lots of documents from the ACC. The first lot was any documents pursuant to section 28(1A) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 which record evidence that the examiner was satisfied that it was reasonable to issue an examination summons. The second lot was any document pursuant to section 28(1A) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 which records the reasoning for the issue of the examination summons on Mr Michael Brereton. The ACC sought to have both subpoenas struck out as an abuse of process on the grounds that they served no legitimate forensic purpose and constituted, in fact, a mere fishing expedition.
To cut to the chase, the magistrate rejected the application to have the subpoenas struck out, but it also transpired during those proceedings that to demand the person to take out an oath or affirmation, say, in the context of the proceedings there must first be a summons properly issued in compliance with the powers pursuant to section 28 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. It is legitimate for a concern to be raised in relation to the exercise of that power, particularly when there is no record within the material as to whether or not the examiner has put his reasons in writing. When that occurs, it may affect the legality of the summons itself. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Victoria, where the Supreme Court upheld the magistrate’s decision. The substance of the bill is to address those circumstances that were raised in the Supreme Court.
The first point is that the bill allows an examiner to execute a summons or notice to produce documents who may not be the same examiner who issued the summons or notice to produce. That in itself does not arise directly from the proceedings, but it is something that I will come back to. The second point is in respect of the matter that is at least on point with the decision. Labor understand that situations in respect of that first point may arise—for example, when there is leave for urgent duties—and where you can imagine that is a requirement that can be sought, and we do not cavil with that provision.
The issue is that the bill allows an examiner to record the reasons for issuing a summons or notice to produce after the summons or notice has actually been issued. It is important to note in that context that the report released in November 2005 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission into the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002 recommended at recommendation No. 14—and it is worth going to—that:
... the bill be amended to explicitly provide that examiners must satisfy themselves in each case that before they exercise special powers under the Act that it is appropriate and reasonable to do so and that that they indicate in writing the grounds for having such an opinion.
The PJC also noted in the report that the independence of the examiners can be made more evident if the bill is amended to make specific provisions for examiners to assure themselves, before exercising their coercive powers, that it is appropriate and reasonable to do so and that they indicate the grounds for forming such an opinion. Some members of the PJC believed that the reasons should be recorded in writing. Although there was no formal government response to the PJC’s report, the government’s response, if you look, seems to be found in Senator Ian Campbell’s second reading speech on 15 November 2002, which also specifically addresses recommendation 14. He said:
The government agrees to this recommendation. The bill—
that is, the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002—
has been amended to provide that examiners must satisfy themselves that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to exercise powers to issue a summons or a notice to produce and will be required to reduce to writing the reasons for taking the decision.
These amendments are outlined in items 9 and 10 of the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002 supplementary explanatory memorandum. They do require an examiner to be satisfied that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to issue a summons or notice to produce. The provisions also require the examiner to record in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons. It does seem, though, even at that point that neither Senator Ian Campbell’s second reading speech nor the amendments in the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the 2002 bill unambiguously stated when the reasons in writing to issue a summons or notice to produce should be provided by an examiner.
Clauses 2 and 7 of the bill before us amend sections 28(1A) and 29(1A) of the ACC Act to expressly provide that an examiner may record their reasons for issuing a summons or notice to produce before, at the time or as soon as practicable after the summons or notice has actually been issued. It is concerning to Labor, as it would be to the wider community, that the government does not appear to have had an understanding of how the practice of providing a record of reasons subsequent to the issuing of a summons or notice to produce actually operates within the ACC. In working through this, there are a range of matters that we will take the opportunity in the committee stage to examine, but hopefully it will not take too long this evening. They relate to the issue of how many summonses have been issued; how they have been audited; how they have been checked against the process of ensuring whether the summons was issued with written reasons at, prior or subsequent to the issue of the summons; and how the government has managed that process to date.
Labor understands that there are a significant number of cases that are currently before the courts and that information would also be helpful to understand how many cases can be affected by this decision. It does provide a situation where it appears a legal technicality surrounding the recording of reasons rather than the actual existence of a substantive reason would of itself allow those guilty of serious organised crime to, in fact, escape. That is of concern, especially where these are significant cases or could be potentially significant cases where significant time and effort has been employed. Labor understands why the amendment has been sought.
Clause 5 of schedule 1 ensures that the failure of an examiner to comply with the technical requirements of recording reasons for the issuing of a summons or notice to produce does not affect the validity of such an action. It is important to note, though, that the bill also provides for retrospective operation. Clauses 10 and 12 validate summons and notices to produce retrospectively since the commencement of the ACC Act. Those matters do require a clear demonstration by the government. They can take that opportunity in the closing debate to demonstrate the reasons for retrospectivity, because it is a fundamental rule of law that generally in Westminster systems retrospectivity is not permitted and that most people should be aware of what the law is at the time that they are charged or that it is sought to have the law exercised.
But in this instance, weighing the matter itself, Labor will support the legislation. It does that with the knowledge that the government does have a heavy and clear onus upon it to be able to demonstrate, through these proceedings this evening, that for those matters that have been raised there are clear and unequivocal answers. Labor recognises that in addition, in certain circumstances, urgent action is necessary due to operational requirements that the practice of issuing a summons and then subsequently reasons to be written down can occur. It should really be standard practice that in all circumstances you can form reasons, write those reasons down, issue the summons and at least ensure that you then have a proper audited process.
Given that this is the last week in which parliament is likely to be sitting before a federal election, Labor will agree to facilitate passage, but we will continue to have a look at the operation of this provision. We are not going to provide unqualified support for it. We need to ensure that it does operate as fairly as it is able—that it is in fact a technical hitch that has occurred and that it can be remedied without causing grave injustice to individuals—and that the law itself works properly and appropriately. From a broader perspective, when you examine the issues in detail you can see that the matters raised in the Victorian case do provide some substantive reasoning for the government to have now sought to provide this amendment.
There are a range of issues that go to the matter itself. This matter was ventilated in the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court. The matters I have adverted to were provided with some reasoning within the decision. It does not appear to be—although I am open to correction on this—the substantive point that was made by Justice Smith on the issue, but it does appear to be a subsidiary point or a collateral point that was made. Having said that, what is important to understand is that there are matters that do need to be carefully considered. Page 9 of the decision reads:
… the clear purpose of s 28 (1A) is both to focus and enhance decision making and to provide an accountability mechanism by requiring the creation of an ‘audit trail’. Under s 59 of the ACC Act that record is potentially available on request to the portfolio Minister and to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, constituted under Part III of the ACC Act: ... as is not uncommon with investigative agencies, the Parliament has counter-balanced the secrecy regime it has erected to ensure the effectiveness of the ACC’s investigations with a measure of public accountability through a dedicated parliamentary oversight committee ...
It may also be a matter that should be returned to the ACC parliamentary committee for further monitoring, oversight and examination. It would be encouraging for the minister to advise on that. Justice Smith’s comments seem to have been made in the context of this issue. It is not raised as the primary point, but it is still an important point that the government cannot ignore.
They are not the only stakeholders in this. The Law Council has raised with me legitimate concerns about the impact of the bill. The Law Council suggests and believes that the government intends to pass in haste a bill which is specifically designed to perpetrate an injustice. The government does need to explain how their concerns will be allayed.
Of course, we know that Michael Brereton is currently being prosecuted in Victoria for refusing to be sworn or take an affirmation after he answered a summons to appear before the Australian Crime Commission and we wait to see how his rights will be affected. But we also cannot put aside the issue that these sorts of matters should not be attacked on mere technical grounds. It is important, in the interests of justice, that justice is not only done but seen to be done.
I will take an opportunity during the committee stage to raise some of the more specific matters. I suspect the minister will be able to take it on notice to provide answers if he is not able to do so this evening, but fundamentally Labor has indicated that it will support the legislation.
I remind the minister, in closing, that he does have a statement of expectation from the Australian Crime Commission where he, as the Minister for Justice and Customs, has indicated his expectation of the Australian Crime Commission—and he goes through a range of eight points.
I encourage the minister to also include the issue of ensuring that there is oversight and audit of these types of work, because without a clear audit trail, without clear oversight, without the figures being provided and collated, areas like this can unfortunately creep in. You can see how easily they can be perpetrated over a significant amount of time. The legislation was first introduced in 2002 and was again reviewed in 2006 and the issue has only really come to light as a collateral matter in a Victorian case. That occasionally does happen. In this instance it has happened and it does have serious implications for the ACC’s current procedures. I encourage the minister to advise how he will resolve—(Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-09-18,"—The government and the chamber will not be surprised to hear that the Democrats are at best a little peeved at the process before us. Certainly I attempted to convey that in my remarks this afternoon when we debated the idea that this bill should be exempt from the cut-off provision. That had little to do with, although it was related to, the complex or controversial nature of this legislation—legislation that the government refers to as dealing with a technical matter. It was partly, and primarily at that stage, because of the process. It is not acceptable in this house as a house of review for senators to receive legislation of a controversial, even urgent, nature—we received it this morning and we received a briefing, for which we are thankful—and then have it exempt from the cut-off provision and debated the same day.
I understood from the debate earlier that Senator Abetz, who was on duty in the chamber, was to endeavour to not delay unnecessarily this process for the benefit of the chamber—not just for the crossbenches, not just for the Democrats, but so that there could be some pretence of consultation and debate within the broader community, namely the legal community. My understanding was that there was going to be some attempt to delay this process. The government may suggest that there may have been a couple of hours—for which we are pathetically grateful and thank you because it did enable us to make some phone calls and consult with relevant authorities and groups—but to deal with this legislation on the same day that it is sighted is not acceptable. I know it is par for the course these days, and I hope that will change regardless of who is in power. This is an unacceptable use of the Senate’s powers, and the government could at least have waited until tomorrow morning.
Having put on record my concerns with the process, I am happy to turn to the substantive nature of the legislation before us. In the time the Democrats have had to be briefed on, analyse and scrutinise this bill—and of course consult with relevant groups in the community—we believe this bill amounts to a government patching up its mistakes; and doing so at the expense of fundamental legal principles and showing absolute contempt for the law-making procedures in this place. The bill, as we have heard, amends the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. It is clearly a direct response to the decision of Justice Smith in the Victorian Supreme Court in ACC v Brereton [2007]. Its intent is to rectify a perceived deficiency in division 2 of the act, exposed by the court’s decision. As we know, division 2 deals with the coercive powers of the ACC—and these powers are by no means uncontroversial. So, before we even get to the point of debating the legislation and the change before us, we already start with the recognition and from the premise that the current powers and the relevant division are indeed controversial.
Division 2 allows an ACC examiner to compel witnesses to give evidence, including in circumstances where that evidence may be self-incriminating. Of course, various peak legal bodies have consistently opposed the extensive, widely used and wide-ranging coercive powers of the ACC examiners on the basis that they do represent an unjustified abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination. I am aware of some of the debates that have taken place on this matter, whether through the National Crime Authority committee days or the ACC committee and the relatively new legislation, but these powers are controversial—and they are questioned at best and condemned at worst by a number of groups in the community.
In ACC v Brereton the court ruled that section 28(1A) of the act required an ACC examiner to record in writing the reasons for the issue of a summons or notice to produce, issued under section 2 of the act, prior to the issue of a summons. Indeed, counsel acting for the ACC in that case was up-front to the court. He conceded that the existence of a document regarding the examiner’s reasons for issuing a summons was a condition precedent to the issue of the summons—in other words, a summons could not be issued unless the ACC had first justified its reasons for doing so. At this point, it is interesting to reflect on what the judge hearing the matter said. His Honour Justice Smith said:
The preconditions are no doubt specified because of the significant in-roads made to the right to silence and the need to ensure that the power is properly exercised.
The bill proposes to amend the act such that the reasons for the issue of the summons, required to be recorded under section 28(1A), will now be able to be provided as soon as practicable after the issue of the notice. The government is telling us that this amendment is justified and necessary because the situation as it stands is problematic where a summons has to be issued urgently or where a large number of summonses may be issued at one time. The government says, therefore, that this is a technical amendment. We have heard this as a justification and we have seen this as a justification, and I am sure it will be put forward again. But a lot of groups do not agree that this is merely technical—and, I tell you what, the Australian Democrats beg to differ on that point. I consider that the explanatory memorandum is another in a long line of explanatory memoranda which are arguably misleading in a similar manner.
It is clear from Justice Smith’s reasoning that he did not view as a perfunctory exercise the requirement for an ACC examiner to issue reasons. On the contrary, Justice Smith considered that reasons are a necessary and substantive requirement of the decision-making process undertaken by the examiner. I am sure that when Justice Smith made this finding he did not envisage a legislative fix to the problem that simply removed the protective element.
I have discussed the extraordinary nature of the ACC’s coercive powers to compel a person to produce documents, to attend an examination and to answer questions even when the information sought may be self-incriminating; but, in addition to this, the ACC’s extraordinary powers are exercised, as we know, behind a veil of secrecy. We should expect in these circumstances that the power is exercised according to the letter of the law. As the Law Council puts it:
Strict compliance with the law is the least we can expect from enforcement agencies exercising extraordinary powers. Parliament would send a very dangerous message if it rewarded agencies which ignore the requirements of the law by passing retrospective legislation which not only shields the offending agency from the consequences of their past noncompliance but reduces the safeguards they must comply with in the future.
That is from the Law Council, the peak representative body for the legal profession in this country. They have put out a statement today with the same—or arguably much shorter—level of notice as the rest of us. They are not impressed by this legislation.
Section 28(1A) of the act contains dual requirements which are inherently linked: (a) that an examiner only issue a summons if they are satisfied that it is necessary to do so and (b) that they record their reasons in writing. The second item is not a mere technicality as the government suggests—far from it. The requirements operate together as a safeguard against the misuse of the coercive powers and to deliver a degree of tangible accountability each time the powers are exercised. After the Brereton decision, the government was caught between a rock and a hard place. It is apparent that for some reason the ACC decided that it did not need to record its reasons—at least prior to any summonses or notices to produce being issued. This was despite the wording of section 28(1A) as it stands, which I think pretty clearly states that written reasons should be recorded.

Senator Johnston interjecting—

—I am not sure what the minister’s interjection was, but maybe he will respond on that process. If people, especially the government, are frustrated by this debate, they have absolutely nothing on the rest of us. We have had less than 24 hours to look at, scrutinise, analyse, debate, potentially amend and pass this legislation—and then it is going to committee. If we are going to embrace retrospectivity, we may as well embrace it for all things and have retrospective committee references for retrospective legislation. It is extraordinary.
The result, the government says, is that a raft of evidence obtained under the ACC’s coercive powers is now subject to legal challenge. We are not dismissing that; we are not disputing that. We are not suggesting that that is not an important thing, but it would have been nice if the government had ensured that people had time to digest that and to look at the myriad of potential solutions available to the government or at least to look at the myriad of fundamental implications as a consequence of going down this particular legislative path. But what does the government do? It attempts to legislate retrospectively to remedy the ACC’s problems and incompetence. That is a big deal in this place, and I am sure that most senators, in dealing with a range of legislation—let alone legislation that deals with issues of criminality—find that legislation dealing with retrospectivity is controversial generally. And, specifically in this case, you bet it is controversial. The effect will be that any summonses or notices issued prior to the bill being enacted and prior to the decision in ACC v Brereton will be valid. We understand that there are up to 30 prosecutions currently on foot. I am sure that the government will outline the issues for us in those prosecutions involving evidence obtained in accordance with division 2 and those that will be affected by the bill.
Again, the Democrats do not underestimate some of the issues at stake here. There is not just the issue of those prosecutions or other cases that may be pending but also issues relating to fundamental legal principles that are potentially breached as a consequence of this legislation. As the Law Council has stated, this will have the effect of suddenly making valid summonses which were previously invalid. As a consequence, people who had previously committed no offence in that they had failed to comply with an invalid summons will suddenly be retrospectively liable to criminal sanction. That is what the Law Council is saying. So I ask the government to respond to those particular accusations, because the situation is quite dire. The right to certainty before the law and to not be subject to retrospective criminal sanction is a fundamental legal right. It is actually a basic human right. Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that no-one shall be held guilty of a penal offence made so retrospectively. Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides:
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.
My opposition to this legislation is obviously evident, but I am not alone. I am not alone in having concerns about the process and the policy that we are debating today. I think it was summed up well today by the Law Council when they commented:
The Law Council believes that the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill, which the government intends to pass in haste, is specifically designed to perpetuate an injustice. The government is inviting the parliament to be complicit in this act. The parliament should reject the proposals.
The Democrats agree with this sentiment. The bill will abrogate a fundamental human right—that is, to not be subject to retrospective criminal sanction. If that is acceptable, if that is the new mode or the new acceptable form in this place, then we need to know about it. Is this standard across the board or is this just in relation to the particular powers—and the arguably coercive powers, at that—of the ACC?
Clearly for some it is not that serious. The bill deals with very controversial provisions which abrogate the right to remain silent, yet we have been given a day to consider it. Moreover, the bill removes safeguards which are not only procedural but form part of the substantive process in an examiner being satisfied that a summons or notice to produce ought to be issued, thus invoking the jurisdiction of the ACC, to use its coercive powers. I do acknowledge that the government, including the minister’s office, and the ACC have made attempts to explain their understanding of the purported urgency of the legislation before us. And, my goodness, of course we acknowledge that the Crime Commission has an incredibly tough time in combating organised crime and without doubt, in some cases, the powers that it has have been and are justified. This is not about the Democrats going soft on crime or wanting people to get away with things. This is us doing our job as legislators in terms of debating legislation in a way that ensures proper time for scrutiny and reflection.
I acknowledge that the government, and certainly the minister’s office today, were very happy to provide briefings. Thank you for that; it was very helpful. But in terms of the government’s role—the government of the day doing this in such a hasty manner—we need more justification. I believe there has been a pattern in this place of government members on occasion paying lip service to the scrutinising role of this particular chamber. There are times when it is more evident than others. Having less than 24 hours to deal with legislation that has wide-ranging impacts, is such a highly contentious piece of law and is arguably offensive to principled sections of law means that on a day like today the Senate is not doing its job.
I realise this debate has obviously been brought on quickly. There are not many speakers on the list—I think there are three of us from non-government parties. I am assuming the intention is to move into the committee stage immediately after this, so there will be minimal time. I note that, in his comments, Senator Ludwig indicated that on behalf the opposition he would be asking the government some questions, some of which he expected they would take on notice. I am assuming Senator Ludwig is confident of getting answers tonight, because, given the bill will go through tonight, when he says ‘take questions on notice’ I am not quite sure of the time frame he is allowing.
In conclusion, I do not doubt the importance of this bill. I do not doubt the government believes that there is urgency and that there is a matter which needs to be resolved. I do doubt that this is merely technical. I do believe this has broad-ranging implications and I really think the government could have acceded to our request not to give us a token hour or two in relation to this legislation. It pretty much stayed in the same place on the Notice Paper, let’s face it—it has not moved up. They could have given us another night. I wonder what consultations have taken place between the government, relevant authorities and the affected communities—and by that I mean the legal sector. I wonder what discussions and negotiations have taken place, because my reading of the Law Council’s attitude is that they have nothing but contempt for this process and the legislation before us. On those grounds, the Democrats will not be supporting the legislation.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to correct the record. There is not a ‘token hour or two’; it is totally dependent on how many speakers there are on the bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-18,"—I want to echo Senator Stott Despoja’s comments in relation to the process by which we are dealing with this legislation. The Australian Crime Commission’s role is to address serious and organised crime in Australia. Over time it has acquired extremely draconian coercive powers that have eroded fundamental legal principles such as the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. The Australian Crime Commission’s special coercive powers include the ability to summons a person to an examination to give evidence under oath or affirmation and the power to obtain documents. Penalties for failing to comply with the Australian Crime Commission’s coercive powers include fines and imprisonment. It is this power to issue summonses, requiring people to answer questions with a limited right to silence and no privilege against self-incrimination, that this bill seeks to expand.
The Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007, which the government is seeking to rush through parliament, will remove one of the few mechanisms of accountability over the use of the Australian Crime Commission’s coercive powers. The bill will operate respectively to validate any and all summonses that have been issued unlawfully by the Australian Crime Commission. It will also mean that any future summons issued by Crime Commission examiners will not have to conform to the existing accountability for the issuing of summonses. The impetus for this extraordinary legislation was the recent case before the Victorian Supreme Court that others have referred to. The case was part of an ongoing legal proceeding that arose from Operation Wickenby, which is part of a very large investigation and prosecution of alleged tax evasion associated with various participants in the media, entertainment and sporting industries.
Before I canvass the issues that arose in that case and that arise in this bill, I want to make clear that the Australian Greens are very supportive of the work of the tax office and others to detect, to prevent and to punish tax evasion. Integrity of the tax system is crucial to ensuring the government’s capacity to provide services and programs for all Australians. However, that is not the issue before the Senate today. We are considering what powers and what limitations on those powers are proper for the Australian Crime Commission. I make that point because the government have sought to justify this bill primarily by reference to the particular high-profile tax evasion case, which they say may be hampered because of the failure to follow the existing forms of accountability set out in the Australian Crime Commission Act. It is not and should not be the role of this parliament to rush through special legislation to make up for the shortcomings or failings of investigators in particular tax evasion cases.
The government says that the bill will provide that a summons on notice will not be invalid merely because it fails to comply with technical requirements of the act. These so-called technical requirements are the need for a Crime Commission examiner to record reasons before issuing a summons. The recording of reasons is not, as the government says, merely technical but one of the few mechanisms of accountability that there is over the Crime Commission’s coercive powers. The Victorian Supreme Court pointed this out in its judgement in the Brereton case, quoting the decision of the magistrate in the original hearing, in which His Honour said that the requirement to record reasons:
... is both to focus and enhance decision making and to provide an accountability mechanism by requiring the creation of an ‘audit trail’.
Under section 59 of the Australian Crime Commission Act, that record is potentially available on request to the portfolio minister and to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, constituted under part III of the Australian Crime Commission Act.
As is not uncommon with investigative agencies, the parliament has counterbalanced the secrecy regime it has erected to ensure the effectiveness of the Australian Crime Commission’s investigations with a measure of public accountability through a dedicated parliamentary oversight committee. The court then went on to say that the production of such records is also important because the question of access to a record of reasons might occur:
... in the context of a criminal trial where an issue is raised as to satisfaction of a precondition to a valid examination summons and the document recording the reasons is sought using a subpoena.
That is the present context and is very different. There is every reason to allow the usual trial procedures to operate. There would be little comfort to an accused person, sitting in jail after sentence, to find out subsequently, through the actions of a parliamentary committee, that the conviction is invalid.
The government also seeks to justify this bill by claiming that the existing act does not require the record of reasons for the issuing of the summons to be made prior to the issuing of the summons. This is a tortured argument given that, if the government thought that was the case, why is the bill being brought forward? In any event, this is clearly not the view of the Victorian Supreme Court or, indeed, counsel for the Australian Crime Commission in the Brereton case. His Honour found:
There was, as Counsel for the plaintiff properly conceded in this proceeding, a condition precedent to the validity of the issuing of the examination summons—namely, the existence of a document recording the examiner’s reasons for issuing the examination summons, such document to be in existence before the examination summons was issued.
His Honour then went on to say:
The pre-conditions—
that is, the production of a record of reasons—
are no doubt specified because of the significant in-roads made to the right to silence and the need to ensure that the power is properly exercised.
Contrary to what the government is saying in this place today, the courts clearly believe that the present act requires a record of reasons to be produced before a summons is issued. Let us then be clear about why the government is bringing forward this bill. It is doing so because it wants to override the views of the Victorian Supreme Court and the existing accountability under the act and further loosen the limits on the coercive powers of the Australian Crime Commission. It is doing so retrospectively because it seems clear that at least some of the warrants issued by the Australian Crime Commission have not been issued in the manner that was required by law, which, as the court has said, requires a record of reasons to be made prior to the issuing of the summons.
The Australian Greens do not support this bill. We do not think this important mechanism of accountability should be removed and we do not believe that it should be removed retrospectively. It is not the first time in recent history that the government has brought forward ad hoc amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act to reduce accountability. Most recently, for example, it used the pretext of the intervention in the Northern Territory to lengthen the tenure of Australian Crime Commission examiners. This bill should not be rushed through the parliament at the end of this sitting, on the eve of an election. It is a further example of the cavalier attitude of the government to fundamental rights and liberties in this country, and it is further evidence of why we need a bill of rights in this country. The Greens will not support this bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-09-18,"—I thank members for their contributions to this debate. The Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007 clarifies that the Australian Crime Commission examiner can record their reasons for issuing a summons or notice to produce before, at the same time or as soon as practicable after the summons or notice has been issued. I say that to clarify very clearly that section 28(1A) of the act has a provision which says:
Before issuing a summons under subsection (1), the examiner must be satisfied that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to do so.
The section goes on to say:
The examiner must also record in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons.
The technical issue at stake here in this amendment is when—that is, when the examiner should record in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons. We have recently had His Honour Mr Smith in the Victorian Court of Appeal stating that he should do that before the issue of the summons. Nowhere in the section is that made clear.
It is not practicable to await a parliamentary committee inquiry into the Australian Crime Commission Bill before proceeding to debate and passage. As I have said, as a result of the findings of Justice Smith in the Brereton matter, there is a pressing risk of collateral challenge to the validity of quite a large number of summonses and notices issued by the Australian Crime Commission examiners. Significant prosecutions could be derailed or delayed, based on challenges to the validity of summonses and notices if we do not make these amendments now.
The government does support, as I support, having the maximum degree of parliamentary review of amendments of this kind that is possible. I will therefore write to the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission to invite the committee to review these amendments, albeit after the event. If deficiency is found or the degree of protection, safeguards, checks and balances is not found to be sufficient, the government will then consider those findings and seek to address those points raised, whilst seeking to preserve the integrity of the intent of the legislation.
I also briefly mention an issue that I feel strongly about and that, of course, is retrospectivity. I note that some provisions of this bill apply retrospectively to provide that the summonses or notices to produce issued after the commencement of the ACC Act but prior to the commencement of the bill are not invalid where reasons were recorded subsequent to their issue. I understand that the retrospective application of these provisions could be detrimental to persons who might otherwise have had scope to challenge the validity of the summonses or notice to produce. Those persons would, no doubt, in the practical reality of defending their position, instruct their counsel to take proceedings in line with the precedents set out in Brereton. They would incur considerable cost. They would incur expense and time, and, indeed, court time would be taken in the pursuit of this recently elicited precedent. We seek to stop them doing that whilst also providing for the integrity, as I say, of the intent behind these provisions.
The government considers, however, that through amending this act at this time this is a just and appropriate outcome. It does not consider that a failure to record reasons for issuing a summons or notice prior to the issue of the summons or notice should give a person who would otherwise have been convicted of an offence the technical grounds to challenge the admissibility of evidence and thereby escape conviction. Prosecutions need to turn on facts and evidence, and I for one, in the scope of these provisions, do not believe that they should turn on matters of a technical nature. We seek to clarify an apparently equivocal provision because it has now been construed and I am respectful of His Honour’s decision.
We seek to clarify that so that the Crime Commission can move forward with confidence and, indeed, so that those people who may come under the purview of this legislation as citizens will know precisely where they stand. Need I say that the government will always be vigilant. Where there is a technical issue that seeks to allow for a defence issue to be raised on the basis of a misinterpretation, vagueness or an uncertainty within the legislation, the government in these circumstances will be ready to act.
Question agreed to.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-18,"—I was going to speak on the third reading of the last bill, the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007, but I did not. But I will speak on the Quarantine Amendment (Commission of Inquiry) Bill 2007. This is a matter that does have a devastating effect on Queensland. The breakdown or what appears to be a breakdown of quarantine such as has been articulated in the press and at large affects not only the racing industry per se but also broader interest groups and stakeholders in this area. It affects not only those who go to the races themselves—and who might place a bet every now and then—but also those who attend riding schools, the strappers, the trainers and those who have stud farms. All of those people are adversely affected. Of course when you go back and look at the issues to do with AQIS you see that a lot of them were raised in the Nairn report. The issues around the breakdown of our border security were ventilated at that time. It is important to make sure that we do have integrity of our borders. It is important to maintain our borders to ensure that these breaches do not occur.
It is particularly encouraging to see that the government have moved to provide an inquiry. That inquiry should be wide ranging enough to ensure that all the matters that are brought forward by people can be clearly articulated and properly examined during the inquiry. This area of course has many stakeholders, and it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that those stakeholders have the ability to put forward their submissions and the ability to articulate their concerns. It is important that the system has integrity to ensure that the outcomes are also respected. What the government should also take on board is that any findings or recommendations made by the inquiry be provided with sufficient support and encouragement so that the industry can examine those. What this industry does seem to have been characterised by—which you see especially when you look at the Nairn report itself—is a series of breaches of quarantine over the last couple of years. Issues such as whether or not the department keeps statistics on these things or a frequency graph to ensure that it manages its border protection should also be ventilated to ensure that the industry does gain a valuable insight into the operation of AQIS and how it maintains our borders. Having said that, I will end my contribution at this point. I see that the shadow minister has turned up to provide a contribution to this debate.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-18,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Macdonald. I know that you have a strong interest—indeed, a vested interest—in equine issues, as a keen rider. At least you were in the past; I am not sure of the current status of your equestrian pursuits. I think the reality is that this is an issue which pertains to anyone with an interest in the various breeds of horse within the equine population of Australia, as well as some other animals that are affected by this disease. So far as the opposition are concerned, we have long been of the view that Australia needed a rigorous and secure quarantine system and that our island status effectively equipped us to resist the introduction of a great many diseases, including the equine influenza disease. This is a disease that exists in horse populations in every significant country around the world where such populations exist—until recently with the exception of Australia and New Zealand. This is a disease which has caused havoc in the countries in which outbreaks have occurred—closing down racing industries; significantly affecting breeding industries; limiting the movement of horses; and occasioning significant expense because of the need, where the disease widely penetrates the equine population of a country, for the introduction of vaccines. These vaccines have a high cost, mask the presence of the disease and make it more difficult to ultimately detect and therefore control in terms of its spread.
We were free for quite some time of this disease that has caused significant problems for racing industries in South Africa, Hong Kong, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and France. The situation that we found ourselves in from about 24 August this year was one that shocked Australia’s racing and breeding industries. Thoroughbreds and standardbreds in the racing industry have been affected, and there has also been a significant impact on the breeding industry.
We have seen the introduction of a disease. Whilst it has not been absolutely proven, there have been a variety of comments which I think allow me to say that the overwhelming probability is that the disease was introduced by stallions flown into Australia on 8 August this year that had spent some time in Japan. Japan experienced an outbreak of equine influenza that was first noticed around 14 August, which means that it was present before that time. The horses that came from Japan arrived on 8 August, so there was a significant overlap.
One would have thought that, with horses coming from a country where there had been an outbreak of disease, we would have had barrier arrangements and quarantine arrangements in place to prevent the disease from escaping. As I understand it, those horses arrived from Japan in a box or crate, were lifted off the aircraft and walked from the crate into a float and were moved from Mascot airport. Some horses were moved to Eastern Creek in Western Sydney and some to Spotswood in Victoria. It turned out that it was the Eastern Creek horses which were carrying the disease, apparently. There is a possibility that the disease found its way onto the truck which carried the horses from the airport and that it was not properly cleaned when the horses were disembarked at Eastern Creek and that the disease was spread that way, but it is much more likely, given other material that is in the public domain, that the disease spread from Eastern Creek. I will come to my reasons for saying that shortly.
This would have to be the worst instance of a breakdown of Australia’s quarantine in living memory. This disease has an impact upon equine industries which can only be measured in millions of dollars, in thousands of jobs and in lost opportunities. Let me extrapolate from a couple of those propositions. The disease has now moved extensively into the Hunter Valley. The Hunter Valley is the home of a number of thoroughbred studs. Those thoroughbred studs house stallions with the most expensive service fees in this country. Within that region are the young horses from the previous crop and mares that are expecting to foal down and conceive during the current season. The disease may mean that the Hunter Valley is isolated for a period of months and, depending on how long that lasts, that might mean that the yearlings in the Hunter Valley will not be able to be sent to the yearling sales coming up early next year. The impact of that will be enormous, let alone the impact of the disease on racing carnivals and on the stallions that are detained at the Eastern Creek quarantine centre. One of those stallions has a stud fee of $225,000 a service. I am told that he would be expected to cover 50 or more mares a month whilst in service from the beginning of September. It does not take much to work out that there will be millions of dollars lost to the owners of that animal, let alone any others.
How did this come to pass? We are not sure. The Labor Party was first in calling for a judicial inquiry into this matter. When the outbreak in Japan was known, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said on 19 August in relation to this matter that:
Australia will not take any risks with horses being imported from countries where EI is present.
On 24 August, he said:
It is likely that the infection has originated from another horse in quarantine that has contracted the disease but has not shown any clinical signs of it.
While it’s too early to be certain, we suspect this to be one of the horses from Japan, given there has been an outbreak of EI in that country.
On 27 August, because there had been an outbreak at Maitland, the minister said that the Maitland event might have been the source of the domestic outbreak. On 28 August, the minister said:
We still cannot track the actual source of the infection and therefore blame or liability cannot be assigned …
We just don’t know - there has been no breach of the impenetrable quarantine barriers at Eastern Creek, our focus has shifted to Maitland where a couple of hundred horses passed through and have passed it to other horses.
On 28 August, when talking about whether the disease had come from overseas, the minister then said:
You would assume that because we’ve never had it in Australia before ... but it might have been dormant and come to the surface.
That is a remarkable contribution! On 31 August, he said:
We want to identify what went wrong so it can never happen again and so we can repair the breach.
He also said:
It’s going to be human error, there’s no question, but were the quarantine procedures adequate?
The minister bounced around all over the place between 19 August and 31 August in relation to whether the disease came from overseas, whether it got into Eastern Creek or whether it originated magically out of nowhere in Maitland. That is a remarkable set of contributions, all in the context of an industry facing a dramatic circumstance, millions of dollars in losses and the inevitable discussion about the possibility of a massive legal case being taken against the Commonwealth because of a breakdown in the Commonwealth’s quarantine arrangements in this country.
Something that has been little noted in public commentary about this was published by AAP on 30 August. It is not sourced to an individual; it is sourced to an unnamed person. It is very interesting to read, and I propose to put it into Hansard. The story reads:
Quarantine procedures at the federal government’s Eastern Creek facility in Sydney have been regularly breached, according to a stallion groom formerly employed by a leading US stud.
The groom, who declined to be named, told AAP today he and other grooms of overseas shuttle stallions were allowed to come and go from Eastern Creek without using strict biosecurity and quarantine measures while caring for their horses at the facility in 2001 and 2003.
The groom was employed by a leading Kentucky stud and was in charge of seven stallions during his first trip in 2001 and four stallions in 2003.
The groom revealed he and other stallion grooms were allowed to leave Eastern Creek on numerous occasions, without changing clothes or “scrubbing down”, to attend race meetings, play golf and to eat and drink at local hotels and restaurants.
The Eastern Creek centre is one of the possible sources of Australia’s first equine influenza (EI) outbreak which has shut down racing in Queensland and New South Wales.
Later on the article goes on to say:
The groom was required to stay at Eastern Creek by his employers, but conditions for the stallions and their handlers at the time were so bad he and others frequently left the quarantine centre.
“I unloaded the horses from a national transport truck into the facility and was supposed to stay there with the horses all the time,” the groom said.
“But the conditions for the horses were only just acceptable. If they were my stallions I wouldn’t be taking them there.
“They didn’t wash out trucks after horses were unloaded and drivers used to help unload horses and then drove off after they were in contact with horses.
“There was no scrubbing down. Not once.
“I was there for two weeks each time and I never saw a foot-bath—which you are supposed to use all the time.”
The groom said walking out of Eastern Creek was easy and he did it often to eat at a local pub.
“We had to let them know when we were going out but no one enforced any of the quarantine protocols,” he said.
“They knew what was happening but we were free to do what we liked.
“I even went to the races at Randwick with five other grooms and played golf on a few occasions without scrubbing down.
“A well-known breeding stud had a big marquee at Randwick one day and I was invited and went along ...”
It is remarkable that a person who was in a quarantine facility with horses coming from a country that might carry diseases can come and go without any quarantine procedures. Not only that, he can go to the local pub, go to the races and attend the marquees of people running studs in other parts of the country. The potential for disease spread was enormous.
That is one of the reasons we need a thorough and rigorous examination of this matter. Who was in charge of quarantine facilities, if these were the circumstances that existed? The minister last week was asked a question in the House of Representatives. It was to the effect that, in the last two weeks, procedures were tightened at Eastern Creek, and, to go to the local pub for lunch, grooms and handlers were required to change and shower both coming in and going out. That was a new procedure that had not previously applied, although there had been regular visits by those handlers from the quarantine facility to the local pub. There has not yet been an answer to that question. I think we are entitled to draw the conclusion that, if the minister cannot rule it out, that is exactly what has happened—that the arrangements, rules, regulations and requirements of contractors, probably, at Eastern Creek have not been appropriate for a quarantine facility.
If horses were introduced from another country and a disease as infectious as equine influenza came into the facility, and if the arrangements that were described by the unnamed person in that AAP story are an accurate reflection of what has been going on, the only thing that is remarkable is that we have not had a disease outbreak in horses from that facility earlier. There may be other issues with the operation of that facility and with other animals or plants there that have not been securely kept, and we may have other problems which we do not yet know about or which have not been sourced to that environment. But, as I said earlier, we now have a situation where it is almost certain that a disease has been introduced into this country, in all likelihood by procedures which have not been appropriate or rigorous enough to meet the requirements of a modern, world’s best practice quarantine facility.
We called for a judicial inquiry very early in the piece—I think on 24 August, shortly after it was known that the outbreak occurred. It was very clear to me and to other members of the opposition that the consequences of this outbreak, if it spread, would be enormous. Unfortunately, that has been the case, and we do not wish that upon the industry. We now need to conduct a rigorous inquiry which examines all of the matters relevant to the protocols, procedures and rules which applied to the importation of horses and to any decisions which have been taken from a ministerial level to a managerial level and down and to assess the impact of those decisions on the practices, procedures and protocols that apply to facilities such as this and determine their impact on the circumstances which we, and these industries, find ourselves in now.
We support the concept of a judicial inquiry with all of the powers of a royal commission because that is what we are told this legislation creates—that is, the taking of the royal commission powers from royal commission legislation and introducing them to the quarantine legislation with one exception, which we understand is to do with the powers of search, because those powers already exist in the quarantine legislation. We support those measures. We believe there should be a rigorous, thorough, open, transparent public inquiry. There should be the opportunity for interested parties to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. We believe that the relevant ministers should give evidence at such an inquiry and be available for cross-examination. Certainly, so far as we are aware, the two relevant ministers are Minister Truss, who was the relevant minister going back to 2003-04, when correspondence from the Australian Racing Board suggested that there were problems with the quarantine arrangements and those problems could well lead to the introduction of equine influenza—quite prophetic predictions by the Australian Racing Board—and the current minister, Minister McGauran, who was presiding over the regime when the outbreak actually occurred. We need to understand the role that the minister played and whether there were any deficiencies in the role the minister played in relation to the disease.
We do say that the terms of reference contained in the legislation are not adequate and we will be dealing with that proposition in the committee stage of this legislation. We think that it is appropriate for those terms of reference to be binding and not optional to the minister, as the current legislation provides, because although the legislation lays down three so-called terms of reference it allows the minister to allocate all or any of those terms to the commissioner, Mr Callinan, to deal with the matter. We do not think that is appropriate. The other matter we will be addressing in the committee stage is the issue of the publication of Mr Callinan’s report. We do not accept that that should only be the province of the minister. We think that the legislation is deficient in that respect. It should require the tabling in the parliament of that report, and we will be moving an amendment to that effect as well. I intend to have more to say in the committee stage of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-09-18,"—I too rise this evening to support the Quarantine Amendment (Commission of Inquiry) Bill 2007 in order that there be an appropriate investigation into this outbreak of equine influenza in Australia. I was interested when this was first reported, having spent the last few years in this place on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport looking at issues of quarantine. I was immediately conscious of the fact that, if this had come from a quarantine centre, it was a major breach of Australian quarantine protocols and regulations. It is just another reminder of how vulnerable Australia is to the outbreak of disease and how important it is for us to maintain disease-free status in as many areas as we possibly can.
I welcome the fact that the government has decided to have an inquiry which is effectively a royal commission inasmuch as it has all the powers of a royal commission but is set up under Quarantine Act because it will allow for the additional powers that the act also affords investigating authorities. I am hopeful that this inquiry under Justice Callinan will get to the bottom of how equine influenza got to Australia and how it got from the quarantine centre into the broader population.
I certainly concur with remarks to date on the massive impact equine influenza has had in the Australian community and the rural community in particular. Not only has it had an economic impact but you only have to listen to the stories of people involved in eventing, for example, people involved in getting their horses ready for the Olympics, to hear of the heartbreak suffered by people who innocently have been caught up in the disaster that has been equine influenza. That, of course, is not to mention those people who have huge investments in the racing industry. Whilst the government has moved to offer some income compensation, you can never compensate people adequately for the loss of opportunity. Of course, racing is a gaming industry as well and you can never compensate people for the fact that they may have had their animals in preparation for a certain race at a certain time and that opportunity will not come again. It will present in different ways but not under the same sorts of circumstances. There are a lot of people around Australia whom I would classify as being in the amateur field around horses and who have been devastated by this in the same way as those who are involved in a professional capacity. Of course, in rural communities it has had a significant impact as well.
My initial response to this was to be quite mystified as to how horses that had arrived in Australia on 8 August could have been carrying the disease when the protocol, as it is set down, means that those horses had to have been in quarantine in Japan for four weeks before they started their journey to Australia. Assuming that their journey to Australia took a maximum of 24 to 48 hours, they had already been in Japanese quarantine for four weeks. So I am glad to see that this inquiry is also going to enable an investigation into the appropriateness of protocols at the Japanese end. With the way that the horseracing and breeding industries are these days, you have horses in Eastern Creek and probably in Japan which have come from, for example, the United States and Ireland. They are going to be servicing the breeding industry in Japan and then moving on to Australia and back and so on. It is very indicative of how difficult it is to try to contain a disease of this kind once it begins.
At the Japanese end, I am particularly keen that there be an investigation of the appropriateness of the time response. Certainly, when I looked on the internet to see when this was first reported in Japan, I found that the Japanese racing authority had had a press conference on 16 August to say that 20 thoroughbreds in Japan were infected with equine flu. At the press conference they admitted that the day before, 15 August, 200 vets had been despatched across Japan to look at various racing facilities, and presumably quarantine facilities as well.
Yet the Japanese government did not officially report the disease until 24 or 25 August, some considerable time—at least 10 days—after vets had been dispatched in Japan because there was a suspicion of the disease. We have got to ask ourselves: ‘Do Australian authorities wait to be officially informed when the internet will tell you that the racing authorities in the home country have had a press conference and told the whole country that they have this disease and that there is a lockdown and cancellation of races?’ The Kanazawa racetrack did not hold its races the weekend after that because of the symptoms of disease in horses in Japan. All international trade depends on countries being timely in their notification of globally notifiable infectious diseases. Countries also rely on timely, authoritative and accurate certification when they give export or import permits. Australia relies on that system globally, and every other country does as well.
In this case, the Australian embassy would be reporting back, one would hope, to the Australian government on a daily basis on anything that is reported in the Japanese press—and any other press around the world where we have an embassy—on issues that may well affect Australian trade or interests. There would have been an awareness, you would have thought, once that press conference was held, that that was the situation in Japan. If those horses had been in quarantine for four weeks before that in Japan, we should have been able to make some calls to the Japanese government fairly quickly to establish where those quarantine horses had come from and whether any of the horses stabled there had in fact already come down with the disease.
This is not to excuse the fact that this disease has escaped from Eastern Creek. We all know that is the case and there has been a breakdown of quarantine at the Australian end. We also have to look at the protocols under which we agree to import and export permits of live animals around the world to make sure that we have immediate notification the minute there is a suspicion of a notifiable disease—and not just at the point at which finally it is officially confirmed some 10 days after a domestic announcement. That is not good enough and it is not fair to the international community.
One would wonder whether there will be another move now in the breeding industry to have artificial insemination in the thoroughbred industry. I know it is a very contentious thing to say, but realistically we are dealing with very valuable animals moving around the world. When people assess the losses to the breeding industry because of this outbreak and the likelihood of this continuing they may have to reconsider the definition of what constitutes a thoroughbred horse. That will be a debate for another day. I am aware of the smiles in the chamber about opening a Pandora’s box, and I know that is the case. But if you own a valuable stallion, like those that are being transferred around the world, you would have to be asking yourself at the moment about the risks associated with the international movement of animals in this way.
I do not wish to delay the Senate further, except to say that I support the establishment of the inquiry. I am hopeful that it will be as comprehensive as is required to get to the bottom of how the disease was spread, looking at the existing protocols and the rules which govern the movement and control of the quarantine facilities in Australia. But, as with the comments made by Senator O’Brien, I do not believe it is appropriate that the report, when it is finally completed, simply goes to the minister. I think it is essential that it be tabled in each house of parliament so that the community can read the report in full and therefore be in a better position to both assess the government’s reaction and, I would suggest, assist the government in coming up with improvements to the protocols to make sure that this does not happen again and that we have a better process in place. It is in the government’s interest as well to engage in an open and transparent partnership with the community, particularly the horseracing and breeding community, which will need to be involved in such a response once we get a full investigation and analysis of what has occurred. I too have an amendment asking that once the report goes to the minister it be tabled in the parliament within 14 days of receipt of the report. I look forward to hearing what Justice Callinan finds out during this inquiry and hopefully to seeing some amendments over time to improve the protocols internationally and domestically to try to maintain Australia’s disease-free status.

"Fisher, Mary Jo",LP,2007-09-18,"—I rise tonight to talk about an issue of vital importance to Australians at large and to people from my home state of South Australia in particular—water security. It is vital to city people and to country people. Efficient water collection, storage and use are economically and environmentally sensible, but the South Australian Labor government’s current nonsense is neither efficient nor sensible. South Australia is the driest state on the driest continent; yet we have the Rann Labor government dithering in critical planning for our future water supplies whilst letting the country’s driest state dehydrate. It is a state government which has sat on its hands and prayed for rain and done little else to prepare for either the shorter or longer term.
In recent weeks my fellow South Australians and I have had to endure the state government’s attempts to deflect to the Howard-Costello government the blame for water woes, when we know that the state government is in charge of our water supplies. We have had to put up with condescending messages from the South Australian government about saving water, from a state government progressively forcing South Australians to abandon their gardens whilst it abandons the watering of our state. Without rain, water restrictions alone mean little. We know that water restrictions will not solve our state’s water crisis and that water restrictions are like trying to solve the crisis from the end of a hose. But we have had stern messages about how state taxpayers must fund water cops on the beat and about how it is good to dob in your neighbour.
Whilst the state government tries to tell us it cares, it says we do not care enough to be responsible. In March this year, the South Australian government was lauding the success of water restrictions in South Australia. The state minister was daily telling South Australians they had saved thousands of megalitres of water with drippers and hoses with a nozzle. Then suddenly something must have changed, because the state government slammed the people of South Australia, accusing us of using sprinklers for the maximum period allowed whether our gardens needed it or not. The state government said that householders had been given a chance to prove they could responsibly use drip irrigation during level 3 restrictions last summer—and had failed.
What had changed in a matter of months? We were told it had not rained but we were told little more. For that, the Rann government told us we were to have buckets, and buckets only. What is the empirical evidence for buckets? None, bar that buckets are burdensome. In short, they are pretty hard work. So we got buckets and saved even more water, as the state government quietly continued to pocket increasing amounts by way of a property charge assessed independently of the amount of water used. People living in suburbs like Kilburn, Burnside, Dulwich, Unley and Ashford were burdened with carrying buckets of water to keep their gardens alive. Senior citizens and pensioners staggering about their gardens at night watering plants with buckets of water they have saved would be ludicrous if it were not so tragically real.
According to the state minister, forcing people to bucket water was apparently the result of South Australia’s superb negotiations with the eastern states to release more water from the Murray to South Australia. When people started to question the quality of negotiating skills shown by the South Australian government, it supposedly became the fault of the Prime Minister and Minister Turnbull. On 29 August this year, in the face of the Rann government’s ongoing failure to secure South Australia’s water supplies, the state opposition released their comprehensive 19-point plan to secure and waterproof South Australia. Opposition leader Martin Hamilton-Smith outlined initiatives to end water restrictions, to reduce South Australia’s reliance on the River Murray and to secure South Australia’s water supplies for generations.
But a backlash against buckets continued to fuel public anger at state government dithering. We were told we had best be grateful for buckets, because the state government could ban buckets too. Responsible South Australians were offended.
—Hear, hear!
—The community expressed its indignation—indeed, colleagues—to Liberals, including the Liberal candidate for Adelaide, Tracy Marsh, as well as the member for Sturt, the Hon. Christopher Pyne, whose petition calling on the state government to develop a comprehensive water infrastructure plan has since gathered more than 10,000 signatures. On 31 August this year, two days after the state opposition’s outlining of its 19-point plan to waterproof the state, the state government still stood steadfast and strident. South Australia’s water minister announced that only rain would change the state government’s policy.
—Shame.
—Ah! Less than a fortnight later Labor Premier Mike Rann announced the breathtaking backflip: drippers would again be allowed and, following the state Liberal lead, a desalination plant would be built to supply water to Adelaide.
As commentator Mike Smithson noted in the Sunday Mail on 16 September, rattled Rann ‘was forced’ into an early announcement:

The timing and delivery of this week’s news that Adelaide will receive a desalination plant was bewildering, but one thing is certain – it’s the right decision ... Despite the Government claiming that desalination has always been its idea, the simple fact is that the Liberals have led the charge for many months ...

Where are the state Labor government’s details? Where are the plans? Where will the desalination plant be sited? Premier Rann says the desalination plant will supply 25 per cent of Adelaide’s fresh water, will cost more than $1.4 billion and take up to five years to build. It took Western Australia two years, and New South Wales says it will take 26 months to be up and running. So why five years? Where are the costings?
—They’re hopeless.
—You may well suggest, colleagues. Scant details suggest that Adelaide will pay three times as much as Perth for its desalination plant, and water rates are tipped to rise by $300 annually—some six times Perth’s annual rise of $43 per year.
We can all see that water prices should and will go up. But the South Australian government must justify why about one-third of everybody’s water bill currently goes into general revenue and explain why the numbers add up about as well as the cost estimates on the North Terrace tram extension and the opening bridge at Port Adelaide. The Rann Labor government are not really committed to the idea. They are probably still hoping they will not have to build it.
Of course, a desal plant is part of the solution. Indeed, farmers and those who live along the Murray, through the Riverland, the Murraylands and the Lower Lakes, must be happy to see that, in future, Adelaide may not have to take 90 per cent of its water supply from the Murray, like it currently does during very dry periods.
Most amazing was that the Premier did not need the Prime Minister’s permission to change his policy. The state government’s botched attempt to blame the Prime Minister for South Australia’s water woes is ill-concealed by the state government’s subsequent attempt to claim credit for a long-overdue backflip under community and Liberal Party pressure. But where are the Rann government’s short-term plans to secure the state’s water supplies—the short-term plans in advance of long-term plans being completed?
—You’d have to ask Don Farrell about that.
—We may well. Where are their realistic plans for more storm and waste water recycling infrastructure?
That brings us to the federal election. To see the hallmarks of what a Rudd administration would be, look no further than the Rann administration and its withering and dithering dehydration of South Australia. Labor administrations lack the experience to govern responsibly. They lack the vision to plan for the future and the ability to generate resources to afford to build for the future. Where they do attempt the right initiatives, they echo Liberal initiatives. Labor administrations play politics with issues like water because winning elections is more important than governing. And, if they get to govern, they flounder, because they do not know how to do it. Australians recognise that the job will not get done unless Liberals do it.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Water</title>,Adjournment,22,1
