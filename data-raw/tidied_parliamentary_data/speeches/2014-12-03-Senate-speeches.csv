Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (09:31):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement of no longer than five minutes relating to the death of Phillip Hughes.


Leave granted.




Senator ABETZ:
  Australia was shaken last week when one of our fine young sportsmen was injured in tragic circumstances on the field and later succumbed to his injuries. He would have turned 26 last Sunday. Today, in Macksville, his family and friends are gathering to farewell Phillip Joel Hughes. His death in such a public manner, pursuing our national game, has affected many, many Australians and many others abroad.


Phillip Hughes showed his talent on the pitch at a very young age. He played at club and state level and then, aged just 20, received his Australian baggy green. He played for two states, New South Wales and South Australia; he played in the Indian Premier league; and he played for three English county sides, Middlesex, Hampshire and Worcestershire. Phillip Hughes was the youngest player to score twin centuries in a test, before his 21st birthday. He scored a century on his county debut at Lord's.


The reaction to his death has been spontaneous and heartfelt. Phillip Hughes was not only a remarkable cricketer but, by all reports, a modest and engaging young man. The regard in which he was held has been echoed by his team mates and those he played against both in Australia and across the globe. The circumstances of the injury which led to his death are simply tragically unfortunate. No blame or fault can be laid at the feet of the bowler. Indeed, our thoughts and prayers reach out to the bowler, who was doing nothing other than his professional best. Expert medical commentators have stated how the chance of an injury of this nature having this devastating effect was so remote as to be unforeseeable.


As has been said, in the midst of life we are in death. We express our deepest sympathy to his family on the death of their beloved son. We think of his teammates, who are grappling with the removal from their midst of a gentle, kind young Australian man who loved the country and who had prodigious natural talent. Of all the heart-rending tributes we have seen over the last few days, for me the most moving was from a lady who lives in Macksville and saw him grow up. She said, with poignant simplicity, 'He was a lovely young man.' On behalf of the government, I extend sympathy to the family of Phillip Joel Hughes. May he rest in peace.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (09:34):  Mr President, I seek leave to speak on behalf of the opposition about the death of Phillip Hughes.


Leave granted.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I thank the Senate and I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to speak on their behalf. Phillip Joel Hughes was a cricketer from humble origins with an unorthodox batting technique but a prodigious talent. He reminded us of a time when sport was less professional, less formulaic than it is today. It is perhaps why his career was so exhilarating. It is perhaps why his death is so sobering.


Phillip Hughes grew up on a banana plantation in the tiny town of Macksville on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Country New South Wales has produced and nurtured many fine cricketers, like Charlie Turner of Bathurst, Don Bradman of Bowral, Stan McCabe of Grenfell, Bill O'Reilly of Wingello, and Arthur Morris and Dougie Walters, both from Dungog; from another generation, the products of Wagga Wagga, Geoff Lawson, Mark Taylor and Michael Slater; and, more recently again, another North Coast of New South Wales lad, Adam Gilchrist.


It was in Macksville that Phillip Hughes developed his unorthodox approach to batting, playing against his brother in the backyard. Then, and until last Thursday, perhaps to the purist he never quite looked the part. Where most batsmen step across the crease, weight forward, Phillip Hughes would step towards square leg and look to play through the offside. It is said that his onside shots were blocked by the side of the family home, perhaps the reason he was so renowned for his offside play. Maybe the purists were right—his batting was not from the textbook—but he could play. He could really play. You might question the method, but never the result.


Phillip Hughes was playing adult cricket by the age of 12, and aged just 17 he moved to Sydney to play grade for Western Suburbs. He scored 141 on debut, and so word spread about a country boy with a unique style, scoring big in grade cricket, and that word was heard. Selectors took a look for themselves. A year later, aged just 18, Phillip Hughes was selected to play for New South Wales, where, once more, the talent and temperament overcame tradition and technique. He scored 559 runs at an average of 62.11 for New South Wales in his debut season. He became the second fastest player in New South Wales to score 1,500 in first-class cricket—the fastest was Donald Bradman, a boy from Bowral. At 19, he was the youngest player to make a century in a Sheffield Shield final. A place in the national side beckoned.


In 2009, Phillip Hughes got his break. He was selected to tour South Africa. Against the fierce pace bowling of Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn, he initially faltered, out for a duck in the first innings of the first test, playing an outrageous shot to a short-pitched delivery. He recovered with a steady knock of 75 runs in the second innings. But, in the second test of that tour, in Durban, he emphatically answered those who wondered whether test cricket was beyond him, by scoring a century into each innings, the youngest man ever to do so. There was a refreshing audacity and vitality to a player barely out of his teens against what was then the best bowling attack in the world, boldly hitting successive sixes to bring up a maiden test century. He scored 115 in the first innings and 160 in the second, helping Australia to an unlikely series victory. In the afterglow of those sparkling innings, Peter Roebuck wrote: 


He can defend and he can lash. He is going to score buckets. He has figured out the odds, knows the angles, trusts his eye and likes batting. His technique may be homespun but that does not mean it does not work. He has fast eyes, feet and wits.


These were thrilling innings, full of promise, but a less successful Ashes campaign was to follow, where, in the dim light of a northern summer, the English bowlers targeted Phillip Hughes with short-pitched bowling. He spent the next five years in and out of the test side. There were brief hints of brilliance, portents of what many thought would be a long career: a dazzling debut century in a one-day match, a patient hundred against Sri Lanka away from home, a dogged and mature last-wicket stand in Trent Bridge—an epic that turned the match on its head. But he was inconsistent, and at each missed step he was asked to return to Shield cricket to work on his technique and make runs, and each time he did so, patiently and graciously, never envious of the success of others. After all, he was a young man; there was plenty of time. Many thought that Phillip Hughes's patience, grace and talent would be rewarded this very week with a recall to the test side. His death last week reminds us all of our own mortality—how uncertain and tenuous our grip on life can be.


I cannot pretend to have known Phillip Hughes well, having only had one substantial conversation with him, when he came to Reg Bartley Oval in Rushcutters Bay to give of his time and his support to the cricket charity the LBW Trust. I know many who did know him well, and they all say that he was modest, courteous, with no airs and graces—still very much the kid who made the big time and could not quite believe it. Phillip Hughes was a cricketer of immense talent, but, perhaps of greater importance, he was a fine young man. He denied no youngster his advice or his time.


As a family, as friends, as teammates, as the cricket community and as the nation mourn the loss of Phillip Hughes, our thoughts also turn to Sean Abbott and the terrible aberration and impact of just another of the countless balls he would have bowled over many years of practice and play. Of course there was no ill motivation but sheer, sheer, awful bad luck. My hope is that Sean—with the support of friends, family and the cricket community—will continue to play and prosper in cricket at the highest levels.


It is, at best, a bitter consolation that Phillip Hughes died doing what he loved, but it is some consolation. He was 25 years old. He was 63 not out. The scorebook will show he will remain forever 63 not out. The outpouring of grief of his passing is a matter I have not previously witnessed for any other sportsman. It will be apparent to all in this chamber that the death of this young man has reached beyond that moment at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and has reached well beyond cricket. In part, this is because of the quality of the overwhelmingly sensitive and appropriate coverage by the Australian media of this terrible tragedy. I acknowledge the respect that they have shown. I also acknowledge the Australian cricket team and Cricket Australia. They have been magnificent in the most difficult of circumstances.


You do not have to have known Phillip Hughes to have shed tears. I know of many who have wept at the sheer unfairness of his passing. Phillip has not been gifted with all those extra years to define his cricket career and his life. We have with his death an inkling of what it meant to Australia when we lost Victor Trumper and Archie Jackson. Nor should we forget the two young test cricketers who died in wars in Australian uniform, 'Tibby' Cotter and Ross Gregory.


Death should not come to the young. We grieve for who Phillip was and we grieve for what he might have been. Cricket will never be quite the same. What happens now is in the hands of the players, the umpires, the administrators and the wider family of cricket lovers. That is surely as it should be. Cricket belongs to those who love the game. My sincere condolences and the condolences of those I speak on behalf of today go to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes and to all in Australian cricket, and beyond, who mourn his loss.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:45):  by leave—On behalf of the Australian Greens, I join with Senator Abetz and Senator Faulkner in expressing profound sadness at the tragic death of outstanding young Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes, the 408th Australian selected to wear the beloved baggy green for his country. Today we send our love and thoughts to his family, to his team mates, to the extended cricket family and to the community in Macksville, as we join them in mourning the tragic death, but also celebrating the life, of Phillip Joel Hughes.


Cricket is a much loved national sport for both players and spectators. It brings us all so much joy. But this tragic event brings us an overwhelming feeling of sadness and a coming-together to pay tribute to a wonderful young Australian. The Greens also send our support to Sean Abbott and to all other cricketers around the country. The nation is sending you strength as you reassess your engagement with this great game.


As a mother, I dropped off my son at cricket for years, helped to unpack the bag, wash the cricket whites—going through the whole saga that families go through from one end of the country to the other as they pack up their sons and daughters to get to cricket practice and cricket games. Every time I dropped him off, I never thought that he would die playing the sport that he loved. It does not enter your head as a family as you drop off someone and go through this ritual. No doubt it is exactly the same for families everywhere, including the Hughes family. No doubt, as the family sat in the stands, their great stress for the day was whether he would play well enough to make it back into the Australian team. And by the end of the day tragedy had struck.


I think that is in part why we all find it so profoundly sad—because of its randomness. This tragedy could have hit any cricketing family anywhere, anyone's son or daughter, at any time. That is why we want the Hughes family to know that we care about what has happened to them and we share their grief and send them support. We have enormous respect for Phillip Hughes as a cricketer, but we also want them to know that we recognise he was a much loved son, and we send them our condolence.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:48):  by leave—I rise to speak today on behalf of the Nationals in this place to remember the life of Phillip Hughes. Our thoughts are with his family and friends and the Australian cricket community on what must be a very difficult day today. Phillip Hughes was born in Macksville in 1988 and grew up in the community playing sport. As with so many young Australians, it was such an important part of his childhood. He excelled at rugby league as well as cricket, before moving to Sydney as a 17-year-old to play for the Western Suburbs grade cricket team. From there, Phil's talent and hard work delivered outstanding results on the cricket pitch. He walked on for New South Wales at age 18, scored a century in a one-day final at 19 and made his test debut for Australia at age 20. What an incredible achievement. What an honour for him and his family it must have been to see him awarded baggy green No. 408. 


Phil Hughes was a tremendous Australian who inspired so many young people in this country, not only through his outstanding ability but also because of his down to earth and humble character. He will be remembered by all who knew him as a genuine good bloke. The effect Phil's tragic death has had on the cricket community, as well as the broader community in Australia and around the world, shows us the impact this young Australian had already made. The touching tributes that have been flowing in from our Australian cricket captain, Michael Clarke, from the New Zealand and Pakistani cricket teams who have been playing this week, from junior cricketers and from the wider community, show how much this tragedy has not only rocked the sport but also impacted on us all. It is fitting that the Australian cricket team has retired his one-day number, 64, so we can always acknowledge his special place in Australian cricket. Today is a sad day but also a day to celebrate Phil Hughes's outstanding contribution. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.



The PRESIDENT:  I ask senators to stand in silence as a mark of respect for Phil Hughes.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:23):  I rise to speak on the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Case Load) Bill 2014. Before I commence my contribution I want to acknowledge the large number of emails and visits we have had from members of the community who are genuinely concerned about what is involved in this bill. I think all senators would have received emails and visits from people who really care about what is happening with asylum seeker policy in this country, and who have raised issues about this bill.


The bill contains the most comprehensive set of changes to—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order! Sorry, Senator Moore. Senators: Senator Moore is on her feet and there are a lot of conversations going on. Could you please give Senator Moore the courtesy of being heard.




Senator MOORE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This bill contains the most comprehensive set of changes to Australian law on immigration and asylum seekers to be brought before the parliament since the Abbott government took office. Much of the bill is a response to actions of the judiciary. Some of the response is understandable, but much of it is an attempt to pre-empt work that the courts ought to be allowed to do. Labor has grave concerns about many of the provisions of this bill. We believe the bill should be rejected entirely. If it is given a second reading, we propose to introduce substantial amendments.


The minister described the bill as a formal legislative recognition of the government's policy of turning back asylum seeker boats. He claims that this is about saving lives at sea. Let me be clear: Labor does not want to see deaths at sea. That is why, when were in government, we established asylum-seeker processing in PNG. That decision has played an enormous part in stemming the flow of boat arrivals. However, we have grave concerns about the turn-back policy, for two reasons. The first concerns the impact of the policy on Australia's relationship with Indonesia. The turn-backs have clearly harmed that relationship. If there is to be a long-term resolution to the question of boat arrivals, it could only be in the context of a close cooperation between Australia and the country from which most vessels bearing asylum seekers depart. That close cooperation existed when Labor was in office. The government's actions have destroyed it. Turn-backs have resulted in at least six incursions into Indonesian territorial waters. The other aspect of the turn-back policy that is of concern is the question of whether it does in fact save lives at sea, or whether it puts them at risk. The government have never been able to give satisfactory assurances on this question, because of their clear obsession with operational secrecy.


The minister's argument that the aim of the bill is to recognise turn-backs is deceptive. In fact, the relevant clauses of the bill are about a case now before the High Court: CPCF v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection & Anor. In essence, this legislation seeks to scuttle that case, which is fundamentally about the Maritime Powers Act. If the bill passes with these clauses, the precedent value of the case would be made redundant. Labor believes that this is inappropriate. The High Court has a role in upholding the rule of law that parliament must not undermine. If, after the court has made its decision, the government believes that legislation is required because of the consequences of that decision, it can bring another bill before the parliament. But it is not appropriate to legislate while the relevant case is being heard.


On the issue of new visas, the bill also resurrects temporary protection visas, TPVs, and creates a new class of temporary visas, the safe haven enterprise visa. Labor's position on temporary protection visas is well known. We oppose them because they place their recipients in limbo, with no certainty or assurance about their future beyond the three-year duration of the visa. Our view is that people who have been found to be entitled to Australia's protection should be given permanent protection visas and provided with assistance to settle within the community as quickly as possible. That also gets them off the government's tab, as quickly as possible, and on their way to becoming constructive and contributing members of society. Let us be clear: the vast majority of these people will live here for the rest of their lives, and want to do so. That is what we saw when TPVs were effectively abandoned during the Howard government. We should not repeat that experience. We should accept our obligations, and give those receiving Australia's protection the permanency to which they are entitled.


This bill, the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Case Load) Bill 2014, also purports to introduce another visa class, the safe haven enterprise visa, ostensibly in fulfilment of undertakings the government made to the Palmer United Party. I say 'ostensibly' because, in fact, all this bill does is to name a new visa The explanatory memorandum states that 'the conditions and operation of SHEVs will be laid down by regulation next year'. The bill therefore holds out a glimmer of hope for permanency to those who might be eligible for the new visa, but guarantees them nothing—in fact, it tells nobody what is involved in these new visas. Labor believes that a pathway to permanent protection, and ultimately to citizenship, is worth supporting. But that pathway must be more than just a name in a bill. The government should withdraw this bill and introduce another that provides a real pathway, and it should also provide information in regulations about how it will work.


Mr Acting Deputy President, this is an issue I have been raising for years, with various governments: the need to have the regulation and the legislation made available at the same time, so that people can see the detail. Too often, we have the situation where the real details are in regulations which are in the future at some time. This is something that needs action across all areas of legislation.


The government should withdraw this bill, as we have said. If it does not and this bill reaches the committee stage, Labor will join with other senators in proposing amendments that turn the imagined pathway provided by the new visa class into a real one. Under those amendments, the new safe haven enterprise visa would be a temporary visa valid for five years and applicants for this visa would need to demonstrate their intent to work and/or study in regional Australia. If visa holders do work and/or study in a regional area for at least 3½ years of the visa period, they would become eligible for permanency. Under other amendments we would propose, the right to work would be extended to asylum seekers on bridging visas while their claims for refugee status are assessed and sections of the bill concerning temporary protection visas would be deleted. We believe these should be either abolished or automatically converted to a permanent protection visa after a successful application for refugee status.


Under the issue of fast-tracking, the bill also seeks to change the refugee assessment process in two ways. First, the bill seeks to speed up the process for assessing claims by people who are in Australia in an unauthorised way either because they have overstayed their visa or because they have arrived without appropriate paperwork. It is not clear how this fast-track process will work, because that will depend on regulation, and details of the necessary regulations have not been provided. The second change is the replacement of the Refugee Review Tribunal by an immigration assessment authority, with a limitation of the existing right of review of adverse decisions. This change is of grave concern. Since the Abbott government was elected, Labor has supported much legislation intended to strengthen the refugee assessment process. This support has caused considerable debate, but the Labor Party has actually supported the proposition put forward by the government. In our view this change goes well beyond that. It guts the process. Labor cannot support limiting applicants' rights of review to the extent envisaged in this bill, or can we support the proposed fast-tracking of applications, which doesn't offer much by way of reducing the duration of the process but would go a long way towards reducing people's rights.


With regard to the refugee convention, the bill seeks to remove any reference in the act to refugees. Labor absolutely rejects this. The government argues that the bill codifies the obligations existing under the convention so that the decisions of Australian courts, rather than the decisions of international tribunals or courts in other jurisdictions, will determine Australia's law in this area. There is no good reason for this change, and it is any case unlikely to achieve the government's objective. The minister's second-reading speech makes clear that Australia remains a party to the refugee convention, and that this is given legislative effect by the Migration Act. Our courts will inevitably refer to decisions by courts in other common-law countries when determining how obligations of this kind should be interpreted in Australian law. That happens now and will continue to happen. The codification set out will not remove the established practice of judicial reasoning


There is a further problem raised by the attempt to codify the law. The bill inserts a requirement in the act that, if persons are able to alter their behaviour reasonably, they should not be able to claim Australia's protection. There are cases now before Australian courts in which a version of that requirement is under consideration, and courts have made decisions on a similar basis in the past, but setting the requirement down in fixed, statutory form raises questions that would not be easy to resolve. What if someone sought protection of the basis of sexual preference, but protection was denied on the basis that alteration of their behaviour would result in that person not being persecuted in his or her country of origin? That may not be the intention of this schedule, but it is not difficult to see how such a possibility could arise.


The bill also contains a provision removing the 90-day rule for hearing of asylum claims, which is an important accountability measure. At the time of last year's federal election, when Labor left government, about half of protection applications were decided within the prescribed 90 days; but, in the most recent report on the Abbott government's performance, only 14 per cent of decisions were being made within go days. The 90-day rule, which was introduced by the Howard government, has proven its worth as a test of the speed with which governments process applications. The rules should be retained. If the 90-day rule is not being met by the department, there should be rationale as to why it is not being met. Rather than changing the rule, there should be an acceptance that the 90-day rule stays and that exceptions to that should be subject to question and a process of explanation from the department to the minister and then to the parliament.


For all of these reasons, Labor opposes this bill, and we will vote to deny it a second reading.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-12-03,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:35):  Today I stand here with the overwhelming majority of legal and human rights experts in this country to condemn the regressive and dangerous Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 before us today. This piece of legislation, if it were to pass, would be a fundamental shift from what are known as due process, fairness before the law, a fair go under the refugee system and, of course, the proper checks and balances to make sure whoever is the government of the day is abiding by our international obligations as well as the basic rules and values of decency and fairness.


This bill should not be called the asylum legacy case bill. It should be called the immigration minister's outrageous grab for power bill. That is all that is in this piece of legislation. This bill is all about Scott Morrison, as the Minister for Immigration, grabbing more power for himself to dictate who will be a refugee, under what conditions they will be a refugee and whether or not they get access to a visa. Of course, overarching all of this is whether children and families remain languishing in terrible conditions on Christmas Island.


When it comes to the way we treat refugees in this country, never before have we seen a bill as insidious, as deceptive and as downright dangerous as this. It is a smorgasbord of suffering, a buffet of brutality, and it should not be allowed to pass this place today. Within this bill the immigration minister wants to make babies that are being born in Australia stateless. He wants to send those babies to camps of cruelty offshore.


He wants to give himself a licence to break international law. He wants to rip the refugee convention from the Australian law books. He wants to change the very definition of who is and who is not a refugee. He wants to fast-track the refugee determination process to remove the right of review, meaning there would be less protection for people who deserve it, less protection for people who may, as a result of mistakes, be sent back to death and torture.


He wants to deny protection to as many refugees as possible. He wants to introduce temporary protection visas for those who have been found to be in genuine need of protection, making them suffer even more for the fact that they dared to dream of freedom and safety for their families. That will leave thousands of refugees—genuine refugees who have been through the proper process, who desperately need protection and have every right to start putting their lives back together—in limbo effectively for the rest of their lives.


He wants to trick the Senate crossbench into thinking that a new visa that is being offered is a pathway to permanency when there is no detail of the safe haven enterprise visa in this legislation. If the minister thinks he can continue to trick this Senate and the crossbenchers in this place, he better think twice because he cannot. It is as clear as day that this minister has no intention of following through with the agreement that was made with the Palmer United Party and with the statements that have been made. He wants only more power for himself and less protection for refugees.


This is an unbelievable grab of power from the minister, and senators in this place have the opportunity to stop this minister, who is so arrogant and so drunk with power, from being able to have even more unfettered discretion. The immigration minister wants to give himself the ability to play God. He wants to be the judge, the jury and the executioner in all these cases. He wants to send refugees, including families and children, back to danger in their homelands. The whole point of this bill is to give as few refugees as possible the opportunity for protection. Even if they are granted protection, he will not even bother to give them a permanent visa that will allow them to rebuild their lives and allow them to contribute to this country. We have thousands of refugees living in the Australian community desolate, without work rights, without the ability to study and without even the right to be able to volunteer. All these people want to be able to do is get on with the rest of their lives—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What about the 1,200 who can't? 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  and this minister wants to start shipping them offshore.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Senator Hanson-Young has the right to be heard in silence. I would appreciate her being able to continue in silence.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Right now there are about 30,000 asylum seekers waiting for processing in Australia. Disturbingly, there are also 559 children in detention facilities across the country. In total there are 3,084 people in detention here in Australia. To our great shame, there are 167 children locked up on Nauru and in total 1,095 people are detained on Nauru and 1,056 on Manus Island. There is no question that these people need to have their claims processed immediately and be taken out of detention, put into the community and given the opportunity to start contributing to this country and rebuilding their lives. This bill does none of that.


Astonishingly, the immigration minister is using the suffering of these children in detention as a disgusting bargaining chip. He is trying to blackmail the Senate crossbench into accepting this cruel bill by threatening to send each and every one of them to the hellhole on Nauru. How appalling to see the minister who already has so much power—the power to keep people in detention—and who is keeping these children locked up, threaten this place today by saying: 'If you do not pass the bill the way I like it, it is my way or the highway. The children will remain in jail.'


What kind of human being uses children as his pawns in a game of politics? How gross, distasteful and sickening is the minister if he is willing to do this? These are children and they are being destroyed by these policies. The immigration minister is threatening to turn the screws on them even harder. He says that until he gets his own way he will keep them locked up in appalling conditions—conditions that have been condemned by the United Nations and condemned by our own Human Rights Commission here in Australia. That is not being a leader; that is being a bully and a coward.


What the immigration minister does not want senators in this chamber to understand is that he can release all of these children today if he wants to. He has the power to keep them in detention or to release them into the community. You do not need a bill that condemns them to a life of uncertainty just to get them out of the locked gates and out from behind the barbed wire. He can have them in the community and be processing their claims as we speak. He is actually obliged to do that under the current domestic law, but in fact he is refusing to act as the law currently prescribes to process people's claims, to get on with assessing them.


If they are genuine refugees, let them stay and let them get on with their lives. If they are not, then send them home. No-one is arguing that anyone should get a free ride here. Get on and process their claims. If they are refugees, they can stay. If they are not, deport them. At the moment we have the worst of both worlds. We have a minister who is keeping children locked up, incarcerated in immigration prisons, and babies being born to asylum seeker parents being told they have no right to protection in Australia. Despite being born in Australian hospitals, they will be on the next flight to Nauru, where we know children are being abused and are witnessing abuse every single day.


The Senate inquiry into this bill heard from thousands of human rights lawyers, refugee advocates, academics and community members, all of whom object to this outright. Over 5,000 submissions were made to this Senate inquiry and every single one of them bar the immigration minister's own department said this bill was wrong, said this bill would set Australia up for failure when it comes to looking after some of the world's most vulnerable people.


The overwhelming evidence from experts and the community was that this bill cannot pass, must not pass. Who does this minister think he is to delete the refugee convention from our law books—to say that we will delete the refugee convention from our law books and it will be he who interprets our obligations? Scott Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, wants this Senate to give him the power to dictate who is a refugee and who is not—unfettered, unchecked and not able to be appealed.


Australia is obliged to provide protection to those who arrive on our shores. We are obliged to do that under international law, but we are actually required to do it as part of being a good global citizen—as a nation that stands for fairness, as a nation and that cares about the rule of law, as a nation who proudly drafted the refugee convention 60 years ago because we did not want to see vulnerable people turned away and deported back to danger. And here we have a bill that in the midst of the political heat of the refugee issue here in Australia we have the Abbott government wanting to undermine and delete those very values from our law books.


There are some ways forward in how we manage the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in this country. There are 30,000 people who need their claims assessed. Get on and assess them, find out whether they do need protection or not. If they do, we resettle them and we let them get on with our lives—we get them into the workforce, we get the students and the children into school, we allow families to rebuild here in Australia and contribute to our local communities. If they are not refugees, finish their application process and send them home. But give people who do need assistance a fair go—and that means a genuine pathway to permanency.


The SHEV visa that has been spoken about and was part of the Palmer United Party's deal on this piece of legislation is not what is before us today. There is no detail about how the safe haven enterprise visa would work. Why would that be? It is because the minister has no intention of following through on his obligations. If he did it would be in the legislation or there would be substantial amendments that would have been circulated and talked through in this place. But we see none of that from the government. This is, 'My way or the highway,' according to the immigration minister and the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.


There is nothing in this piece of legislation that upholds the original deal between the Palmer United Party and Scott Morrison. In addition to that, they have stapled on six other schedules in this piece of legislation that fundamentally undermine the spirit of that arrangement in the first place: more people will be in detention, children born here in Australia sent off to the detention camps on Nauru, deleting the refugee convention, handing ultimate power to the minister to make a decision as to who he thinks deserves his tick of approval and who does not. We know the track record of this minister on these issues and he doesn't give two hoots about the humanitarian needs of those who have come to our shores. Why do we know that? Because we see that he is keeping children locked in appalling conditions every day. Every day those children remain in detention they are damaged further. Mr Morrison keeps them there locked up.


The Australian Greens agree with the majority submitters to the inquiry into this bill that this is a radical deviation from Australia's longstanding commitment to international law and human rights. If this bill passes, it will seriously endanger the lives of many thousands of asylum seekers. The Greens strongly recommend that this bill be rejected by this place today. There would need to be substantial amendments made to this bill if it were to proceed. Six of the seven schedules would need to be deleted and the remaining schedule would need to have a genuine pathway to permanency, so that if people are found to be refugees—after all this time they have spent in detention, all this time they have been left dumped in the community—they should be able to stay, work, pay their taxes and send their kids to school. It is simply asking for a fair go and for people to be treated with dignity and respect. As this bill stands none of that is in here. I strongly urge this place to vote it down at the second reading.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:51):  It is always easy to follow Senator Hanson-Young in any debate because each debate relating to migration she uses the same emotive words, no matter what lies they are, no matter how untruthful, how contrary to the facts. We have just had another example of that. Don't worry about what is actually in the bill; just use your normal, emotive language that you use on everyone, as I say, no matter how inaccurate and what complete mistruths those statements are. Let me take up some of the things Senator Hanson-Young said. She said, for example: 'We are going to delete the refugee convention from the Australian books.' 



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is not just wrong, Minister—it is absolutely ludicrous that that would be suggested. But it is the typical thing. I have been around for a while and I have been able to work out the Greens. They never bother about the facts, never bother about the legislation; they just come out with whatever lie they can think of and try and fool the public—and it works with the eight per cent or so of Australians who do vote for the Greens.


I experienced Senator Ludlam talking about the telephone interception bill and quite unashamedly saying, 'If this metadata legislation goes through the government, Big Brother will be able to know exactly what you are looking at on your computer.' I was not involved in the debate, but I thought, 'Hang on, I have just been through a Senate inquiry into this, and that is simply wrong!' So I got up and I said to the chamber, 'That is wrong, Senator Ludlam!', and he sat there in the corner with a big smile on his face and nodded. That is the way the Greens behave—do not bother about the truth, do not bother about what the legislation says; just tell any old lie and hope that some people will believe you. As I say, eight per cent of the people clearly do believe the Greens.


I have written down some of Senator Hanson-Young's words, but I should not have to write them down, because you hear them all the time—'unforgivable', 'drunk with power', 'unfettered discretion', 'play God', 'refugees sent back to danger'—it goes on. If you listened to Senator Hanson-Young just then, check what she said back against any speech she has ever made on migration and you will get the same sorts of words. Can I again put out another deliberate mistruth by the previous speaker? She said there are, outrageously, 559 children still in detention—384 in Australia and 167 on Manus Island. Actually, she knows as well as I do that there are 167 on Christmas Island. But let me give you the full facts about children in detention, to put this all in perspective. When John Howard left the government as Prime Minister there were zero, zilch, none—no children in immigration detention. Under six years of Labor government supported by Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Wright and their party, we had thousands of children in detention and thousands of children who lost their lives at sea. We never heard any condemnation from Senator Hanson-Young over the loss of lives of children at sea. Not once did we hear that. Why? Because it was under the watch of the Labor Party, who the Greens kept in power—in fact they were part of that power.


When John Howard left government zero children were in immigration detention. When Tony Abbott became Prime Minister there were 1,743 children in detention centres. Did we hear from Senator Hanson-Young about that? No. Did we hear from the Human Rights Commission about that? No. But that was a year ago—1,743 children in immigration detention. Since the Abbott government has been in power, and thanks to the good work of Senator Cash and Mr Morrison, the relevant ministers, that number is now down to 647. You do not have to take my word for this—have a look at the evidence given at the estimates hearing held last Thursday in this building, a hearing that Senator Hanson was at. She knows these figures: 1,743 when the Abbott government took over, when Mr Morrison and Senator Cash started dealing with Labor's problem. Now there are only 647 in immigration detention. At estimates last week—and Senator Hanson-Young was there, so she knows this—I said to the officials: 'What is the forward projection? What do you think is going to happen to these 647?' And I was told—and it is on the record in Hansard; you can go and look at it yourself—that by June next year there would be no children in immigration detention. No children. I said to them, 'What does ""no"" mean?', and they said, 'We will be trying to get to nil, but we can almost guarantee less than 100.'  That was on the proviso that this legislation gets through the parliament so the officials can have the necessary authority to do what needs to be done to get those children out of immigration detention.'


If you had heard Senator Hanson-Young, would you believe that that was the case? Of course you would not, because they will tell any lie, misstate any fact, to convince a few vulnerable voters that the Greens have a heart. The Greens do not have a heart. If they had a heart they would not have been part of thousands of people losing their lives at sea under the watch of the Greens political party and Labor, and there would not have been 1,743 children in detention at the end of their time in government. These are facts. They are not emotive words; they are not any old lie to try and gather a little bit of political support from the few who would believe that sort of rubbish. You see, this is not just Senator Hanson-Young—any member of the Greens political party is the same. They will just say anything, anything at all, to get a vote. I mentioned Senator Ludlam's comment—which he acknowledged! He knew it was a lie. But did that stop him from saying it?


These are the lies that the Greens propagate, and they expect people to believe them. Senator Hanson-Young says these children are 'behind barbed wire' in prison camp. Again, go and see what the officials said about that very subject last Thursday at estimates. They said there is no barbed wire around—the only chain wire fences are around the swimming pools that are put there for the children. Yet if anyone would believe Senator Hanson-Young, and I suspect that as every day goes past there are fewer and fewer people who do believe her, all 647 children in detention are behind barbed wire. How emotive!




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Have you been there?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  No, I have not, but clearly you have not because the officials told you last Thursday—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:


Madam Acting Deputy President, you are quite right. I should—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resume your seat, please.



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, order! Please make your remarks through the chair. I would appreciate Senator Macdonald being given the opportunity to be heard in silence.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I take your admonishment. It is a shame there is someone in the Senate, a colleague of the house, who tells deliberate untruths about children in detention being behind barbed wire. When that question was put to officials last Thursday in a Senate estimates committee hearing, I think their comment was that the only chain wire fences, which of course are required in every Australian jurisdiction, are around the swimming pools.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  That is to stop them drowning. We do everything we can to stop them drowning.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You make a very good point, Senator O'Sullivan. We will do everything possible to stop children from drowning, unlike the Greens and the Labor Party who presided over the deaths at sea of hundreds and hundreds of children and nary a word of condemnation. I hope someone will be able to apologise on behalf of the Greens later in this debate.


Senator Hanson-Young uses words like 'the minister is a bully and a coward and he bullies children in detention camps'. Those of you who know Mr Morrison and Senator Cash know that you would not find any more humane people than those two people. They are there trying to do a job. I might say the Australian people asked us at the last election to stop the boats. Had they been stopped during the Labor regime, there would not have been 30,000 people in immigration detention at the moment, there would not have been 30,000 people wanting to have their cases dealt with. Not in this particular bill but in other bills before the parliament the minister is trying to give certainty to those people who are in Australia at the moment. If Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens political party wanted to have a look at the bill they would see that the bill before us is particularly beneficial. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a period of up to three  years. Senator Hanson-Young would have told you in her speech—if anyone who listened believed it—that nobody was going to get a temporary protection visa. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a period of up to three years. On the expiration, a person's circumstances will be reassessed. Those who are found to still be owed protection will be granted a further temporary protection visa or what is called a SHEV. I want to  talk about the safe haven enterprise visa because I think it is a very good initiative of the government. I congratulate Senator Cash and Mr Morrison for doing this.


Consistent with the Abbott government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa called the safe haven enterprise visa will be created. The safe haven enterprise visa will be open to applications from those who have been processed under the legacy case load and those who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. The SHEV will be an alternative temporary visa to the temporary protection visa and will encourage enterprise through earning and learning. That is a great initiative. Perhaps the minister can elaborate in her speech on how it is going to be introduced. I think it will be introduced by regulation very shortly. The visa will be valid for five years and, like a temporary protection visa, it will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. 


The SHEV holders who have worked in regional Australia without requiring access to income support for 3½ years will be able to apply for and, if they meet eligibility requirements, will be granted other onshore visas—for example, family and skilled visas as well as temporary, skilled and student visas. So contrary to what Senator Hanson-Young would have you believe, this bill contains a lot of protections and it starts to bring some order to the chaotic situation left to us by the Labor and Green government of the last six years, a government which presided over many deaths at sea, including the deaths of children.


I would hope Senator Hanson-Young might rise at some time during the day and apologise for misleading the Senate about those statistics on the children. She should because she was at the estimates committee just last Thursday when all of these figures were explained by officials. There were zero children in detention when the Howard government was defeated. When the Abbott government came to power, there were 1,743 children in detention, with not a word from the Greens and not a word from the Human Rights Commission. Since that time, in a short 12 months, over 1,000 of those children have been released and by June next year, according to officials—this is their hope, if they are given the authority to do this—there will be no children left in immigration detention. One would have thought that, if the Greens had any care at all, if they had any compassion, if they cared about children in detention they would be the first ones here supporting this bill.


It is my honour and pleasure to chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which looks into these bills very carefully. Senator Hanson-Young would tell you, I think she said, that there were 5,000 submitters to this inquiry. Well, sorry; there was a petition—the sort of petition you leave at the coffee shop and everyone signs it without knowing what is in it—but the number of submitters is clearly shown in the committee's report and, I am sorry, Senator Hanson-Young, they do not reach 5,000 or 2,000 or whatever other exaggerated number you might have said. There were the usual witnesses at the hearings; a lot of them are refugee advocates. I might say that I think the government's decision not to have taxpayer funding for these migration agents has caused some concern in the migration agents industry. We do get a number of people who, I concede and I congratulate them, do have some expertise in this area; however, they come from a particular view. We on this side come from the view that Australia has an ordered immigration system. We take around 14,000 refugees every year. But if you jump the queue, and if you are wealthy enough to pay the people smugglers—I often wonder whether the people smugglers are donors to the Greens political party; you would think there might be some other reason why the Greens are so in favour of the people smugglers—




Senator Moore:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I believe that Senator Macdonald's past comment reflects very seriously on people in this Senate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I am talking about the Greens political party. I am not talking about any member in this chamber.




Senator Moore:
  On the point of order: I think the slur on the party and the members here, about people smugglers being donors to the party, is a very serious reflection on the party and the participants in the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I thought Senator Moore might have taken a point of order on Senator Hanson-Young calling a distinguished minister a bully and a coward. She did not seem to worry about that.




Senator Moore:
  No.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Very selective, Senator Moore, but then you would expect that from Labor, because Labor and the Greens presided over the worst mess that Australia has seen. Clearly the Greens and Labor do not want people to understand this, but Australia takes about 14,000 refugees every year. This means that, on a per capita basis, Australia is one of the best countries in the world for accepting refugees. We punch well above our weight.


When people jump the queue, when they have enough money pay people smugglers and other people who support people smugglers, it means that those genuine refugees who are languishing in squalid refugee camps right around the world miss their chance to come into Australia because we take only 14,000. If they come in illegally by sea, then those who are waiting their turn in squalid refugee camps around the world who have already been determined by the UNHCR to be genuine refugees miss out. They have to wait yet another year. I just want to bring some reality to this debate.


The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looked at this legislation and made four recommendations. I am going to run out of time so I cannot go into those recommendations in detail, but they suggest that some amendment be made and that there be improvements made to the bill. The fourth recommendation was that, subject to the preceding three recommendations, the bill be passed. I commend the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill to the Senate.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-12-03,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I rise today to speak about the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 and to put clearly on the record my disgust for what is an outrageously cruel bill. The content of this bill sends shivers down the spine of all Australians who care about human rights and who consider that the moral health of our nation can be judged by how we treat our fellow human beings who are most in need.


If passed, this bill will widen the immigration minister's powers, marginalise international law and the rules of natural justice and muzzle the ability of Australian courts to scrutinise the government's treatment of asylum seekers. It will also establish a new high-water mark in the cruelty Australia is willing to show to those men, women and children who come to us from persecution and violence and throw themselves on our mercy. Increasingly, our wellsprings of mercy are running completely dry.


The title of this bill refers to the legacy caseload—that is, the 30,000 people who sought Australia's protection between August 2012 and December 2013 and who have suffered the physical and mental anguish of mandatory detention, family separation, uncertainty about their legal status, and the constant risk of removal to Nauru or Manus Island. To quote the New South Wales Bar Association, this bill goes far beyond what is necessary to deal with the legacy caseload. It involves serious departures from Australia's international obligations to human rights and, more generally, to the extent that the bill does deal with the legacy caseload, it does so in a way which is procedurally unjust and unfair. 


One of the thousands of submissions received by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has described the bill as 'punitive and nasty' and written so as to suggest that, 'asylum seekers are being punished for their temerity in seeking our compassion; for taking at face value our oft-proclaimed commitment to human rights and the rule of law.'


Along with other migration bills before the parliament, this bill constitutes the single biggest change to Australia's asylum seeker policy ever made. The bill's six schedules would fundamentally change the way protection claims are assessed. The bill changes the criteria by which a person is found to be owed protection and the nature of the protection provided by Australia to those in genuine need. It also changes the legal status of those seeking our protection and empowers a range of government agencies to restrict or remove their liberty. In each schedule, the bill removes the now rare existing features of the Migration Act which operate to protect the rights and interests of asylum seekers, in favour of a system that departs from international law and rule of law principles. 


As the Greens spokesperson on legal affairs, I have to raise particular concerns about those features of the bill that remove procedural rights and review rights, longstanding protections against oppression in our Australian legal system. These features prescribe a legal framework for the determination of refugee and protection status that is contrary to international law and rule of law principles. 


In a move of shameless legal manipulation, the government uses this bill to remove references to the refugee convention from the Migration Act and replaces them with the government's own interpretation of the convention. How can we possibly persuade other countries to fulfil their international obligations when our own actions show that we are prepared to manipulate and undermine an important international convention? Our hypocrisy will be seen for what it is. 


This bill also removes fundamental procedural rights to safeguard the integrity of what can be a life-or-death decision about a person's need for protection. It does this by introducing a new fast-track procedure which will give asylum seekers one shot at setting out the evidence needed to substantiate their protection claim to an immigration official, but without providing them any access to independent advice or support. They will not be able to have the merits of the claim reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal.


There are so many other egregious betrayals of human rights and rule of law principles in this bill. Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into it. But there is a deep chasm between this proposed law and a principled, fair and dignified approach to providing protection to those in genuine need. The Australian Greens strenuously oppose the passage of this bill. This bill is indefensible and un-Australian.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (11:17):  I am not really sure why Senator Wright did not have the time to go into the detail of this bill; she had another 15 minutes on the clock. Perhaps it would have been better if Senator Wright did go into some of the detail. I think that the Greens in this debate do not want to get bogged down in detail because that would mean getting bogged down in facts, and the facts do not support their argument. That is why we heard that five minute contribution. That is why we heard the hysterical contribution from Sarah Hanson-Young earlier, the disgraceful contribution from Senator Hanson-Young. The hypocrisy that we see in an ongoing way from the Greens on this issue and from the Labor Party on this issue—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Before you go on, Senator Seselja, when you are referring to senators, please use the term 'Senator'.




Senator SESELJA:
  I do apologise. The hypocrisy we have seen from the likes of Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Wright and Labor senators on this issue is absolutely extraordinary. I can see why Senator Wright would not want to get into the detail of this, because the detail does not back their argument. The detail does not back the Greens argument. It does not back the argument that comes from the left of the Labor Party, which seems to now be dominating them in opposition once more on this issue of border protection and illegal arrivals. 


The Labor Party pretended at the end of its time—having completely messed up this policy with tragic consequences—that it had learnt its lesson. But in opposition unfortunately, as we see with this bill again today, the Labor Party is showing that it has not learnt a thing. It has shown that, if it is ever given the opportunity again to govern and to be responsible for the border protection of this nation, it will go back to the same old failed policies that the Greens advocate here openly and which the Labor Party has pretended is not part of their policy any more, but we are seeing it more and more.


I want to go to the difference in approach on this issue between the coalition government and the Labor-Greens view of the world, as put in place in government when they were there and as continued to be advocated by the opposition and by the Greens here today in an ongoing way. The difference is crystal clear. The Labor-Greens policy saw 50,000 illegal arrivals. We saw a flood of people coming to this country illegally and claiming refugee status. We saw at least 1,200 people drown in an effort to get to Australia, lured by the bad policies which were put in place by the Labor-Greens coalition—by the Labor Party in government, egged on by their Greens partners. That is their legacy. There were something like 2,000 children in detention under the Labor Party at one point, because they had been lured here. There were children and adults who got on those boats and did not make it here. That is the tragedy of these policy failures. We have seen a dramatic turnaround on all of those indicators—and I will go to each of them. 


Anyone who really cares about this issue should acknowledge that the coalition's policies have actually seen a positive shift, because people are not drowning any more. We should be celebrating that fact. We should be celebrating the fact that we see fewer people in detention, fewer children in detention, now than when we came to office. 


I heard Senator Macdonald's excellent contribution earlier where he talked about what the committee had been told in relation to the dramatic reduction in numbers that we had seen. And in fact the expectation is that those numbers will continue to reduce so that we will see, hopefully very soon, a situation where we do not any more have children in detention, just as we did at the end of the Howard government. That is the legacy when you get control of the borders. When you get this policy right, not only do you stop the drownings, not only do you regain control of the borders but you also see the ability for governments to effectively deal with these issues, and that is what the coalition is getting on with the job of dealing with.


I do find it extraordinary—we expect it from the Greens as they are quite extreme on this issue and we have come to expect it from parts of the Labor Party, though it is concerning—that a party of government, the opposition in this nation, still allows itself to go back to a policy direction which it acknowledges failed. Labor ministers saw that those policies were failing. They were failing Australia, they were failing our responsibilities, they were failing those who got on boats and did not make it here and they were failing those who waited in refugee camps overseas who could not be resettled because there were far too many people coming here and claiming asylum. So the policies failed across the board, and the Labor Party continues to advocate them.


I do find it extraordinary that we see protests. I have had protests at my office in recent times, and people are entitled to protest. Some of those protesters and some of those who were silent when people were drowning—and many of those people were silent when people were drowning—are now coming out and are very loud. As I said, we had had 50,000 arrivals but what has happened this year? I think there has been one successful people smuggling venture to this country this year compared to 50,000 arrivals over the term of the Labor government. Those people should be saying that is a good thing and some of them occasionally acknowledge that but many do not. The Greens party certainly does not. I have not heard the Labor Party acknowledge it. But I would ask those protesters, as well-intentioned as some of them may be: why were they silent when people were drowning trying to get here because of bad policy? They were silent. Many of them were silent. They believe that those policies were reasonable, well, they were not and they failed.


Why was the Human Rights Commissioner silent? It was extraordinary, the evidence we heard recently, where the Human Rights Commissioner said that her concerns were there in late 2012. She had concerns about these issues in late 2012 but she chose not to launch an inquiry in 2012. She chose not to launch an inquiry while there was a Labor government all through 2013 and the boats continued to arrive, when numbers peaked at 2,000 children in detention. Apparently the Human Rights Commission was not concerned enough to inquire into that. Lo and behold there was a change of government to a coalition government. We stopped the boats, we started to significantly reduce the number of children in detention and that was when the Human Rights Commission thought it was a good time to start inquiring. Based on those facts, you would have to question the impartiality of such a body. It had got concerns from late 2012 and did nothing about it until after there was a change of government. That change of government actually significantly improved the situation that the Human Rights Commission was concerned about, but that was when it started to inquire. So Australians could be forgiven for thinking that many of these activists and the Human Rights Commission are not coming to this in an impartial way. They are actually found out to be quite partisan on this, and I think that is unfortunate.


So let's look at the record on these issues that we are told are of concern. All of us should be concerned about people getting on a leaky boat and not making it here. Thank God that no longer appears to be happening. It is a very rare thing. Thank God we have not seen drownings in recent times. We should all be pleased with that outcome. Surely that is something we can all agree on—that that is a good thing and that that is a significant improvement. Surely that has come about due to policy change because the message has gone out that that is not the path the residency. Getting on that leaky boat is no longer the path to residency in this country and that must be good thing.


We are reducing the numbers, we are getting through the legacy case load and this legislation goes to that legacy case load. It must be a good thing that we are seeing fewer and fewer children in detention. In fact there are far fewer children in detention now than when we came to office. The expectation is that with the right policy settings that will go down to zero as soon as possible, and that is what we should be striving for. I say to some of those critics including the Human Rights Commission, including some of those protesters: why not actually look at those facts and say we are heading in that direction? We are stopping the drownings, we are seeing fewer children in detention and we are getting order back into our immigration system—order that was sadly lacking for the past six years.


In taking significant measures, the coalition now has to deal with the legacy case load that was left to us by the Labor-Greens, Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. That is what we are doing and this legislation is about dealing with that. Labor and the Greens now, having created the problem, are again trying to sabotage the solution and are denying work rights to thousands of people—because people who are voting against this bill are denying work rights. So the Greens on the one hand say they want to see work rights but there is a policy in place from the Labor Party that denies people work rights. We are looking to reinstate them through this legislation and they are voting against it.


So what does that say about their commitment? What does that say about their commitment to these people? It says it all—that they would far prefer to pontificate and to oppose, and to go back to their failed policies, than actually help us deal with solutions that will improve the lot of many but that will maintain the integrity of our immigration system. If we do not maintain the integrity of our immigration system we can see the catastrophic results: we see the thousands of people drowning, we see children in detention and we see all of the things that we do not want to see.


That is what this bill does; it honours the coalition's commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures to stop the boats. It reintroduces temporary protection visas; it introduces the safe haven enterprise visa—which is also a temporary visa; it reinforces the government's powers to undertake maritime turnbacks; and it introduces rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements.


The issue around turnbacks is an important one and it is worth reflecting on. Turnbacks have worked. Turnbacks have been an important part of the suite of policy measures that the coalition has put in place. Richard Marles knows this. Richard Marles acknowledged the turnbacks have worked.




Senator Moore:
  It is Mr Marles!




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, he did! This is where the fundamental confusion is in the Labor Party over this policy.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  We got no information on it!




Senator SESELJA:
  Richard Marles went on television and said, 'We acknowledge that they have had an impact.' And he was very quickly rebuked and brought back into line. He was speaking the truth. It was a rare moment from this Labor opposition, where he was acknowledging that the policies that we have put in place have worked, and he was very quickly undermined by others in the Labor Party, including his own leader.


The turnbacks do work. The turnbacks are part of a suite of measures that have sent a very clear message that getting on a leaky boat and paying a people smuggler is not the path to citizenship in this country. It is not. We have made that absolutely clear, and that should be reinforced. All of our policies should reinforce that, rather than undermine that as they did under the previous government.


I often have discussions, as I said, with advocates. Many of them are well intentioned, but I think those advocates forget—and what they cannot seem to reconcile—that if you are going to have a limit on the number of people you take in an immigration setting then you have to have rules. Whether you take them in the humanitarian space, in refugee places or more broadly, if you are going to limit the refugee space—and virtually all Australians would agree that we have to have a limit—then we have to set those limits in terms of how many people come to Australia. If you are going to do that then you have to have rules and you have to enforce those rules. If you do not enforce those rules then the people smugglers get to choose. They get to choose who gets to be accepted as a refugee in this country.


There are those who languish in other countries in refugee camps—and I have spoken to many of them who are now in my electorate. Many of them waited for many years. I am not saying that some of the people who have arrived here by boat do not have legitimate claims. I am saying that we should not have a policy that is set up to give favouritism and preference, and to make the test of whether you are accepted as a refugee in this country being whether you can arrive here. Under the previous government—under lax border protection policies—those who got here got preference. Those who do not have the means to get here—those who, one would argue, are the most disadvantaged; of all the displaced people, those with the least means—they are the ones who are most disadvantaged under the former policies. They will never get a look-in because there will always be someone who gets preference by paying a people smuggler and getting here. So, if you acknowledge that we have to have limits then we have to have rules, and those rules have to be enforced. That is at the heart of the difference in how we do border protection and how we manage these things.


There are other significant problems that have flowed from those failed policies. Because so much extra money was being spent we saw cutbacks in other areas—things like Customs screening were cut back significantly under the former government; they were running out money because they blew such a hole in the budget. That is also important. It is important that we screen what is coming into this country, whether it is drugs or other illegal goods. That was undermined because the whole system was in chaos.


The reintroduction of TPVs is fundamental to the government's key objectives to process the current backlog of protection claims. The government is providing temporary protection to those IMAs who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. TPVs will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights. This is a really important part of this legislation: it is providing work rights. The alternative from those who want to vote against this is to deny work rights so that people who have not been processed and who are waiting cannot actually work to sustain themselves. Surely, that is not a good outcome? Surely that is not something that should be advocated, yet it is. It is being advocated; whether they say it or not, that is what they are advocating with their vote.


There are a range of other aspects to this bill, but it fundamentally goes to continuing our job of fixing the problems that we inherited when it comes to border protection. We have made amazing strides in that area, because we no longer see the boats, we no longer see the deaths at sea and we are seeing the numbers of children in detention dramatically reduced. All of those things are great strides, which have come about through strong border protection policies. This is the next step; this is the next part of dealing with that legacy, and I would commend this bill to the Senate.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (11:37):  I rise today to speak on the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014. This bill is a key part of the coalition government's promise to stop the boats. The coalition government, through this bill, is introducing a package of measures to resolve the immigration status of the illegal maritime arrivals legacy caseload, which currently sits at a staggering 30,000 people who arrived under the policies of the former Labor-Greens government.


In fact, when we came to government there were over 33,000 unresolved cases, 27,000 of which had not even started to be dealt with, and some of them had been in detention since August 2012. This bill honours the coalition's commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures to stop the boats. These measures were successfully used under the Howard government but abolished by the former Labor government. I was working for the Howard government when we introduced these measures and faced this crisis over a decade ago. What happened under the previous Labor-Greens coalition was utterly foreseeable because we had been there before. We knew if you put the people smugglers back into business and you gave them a business model and a product to sell, they would do it. There is absolutely no surprise that once you implemented these policies then a flood of people would start to come in again. In fact, 50,000 people paid people smugglers to enter this country illegally. That was totally foreseeable, as were the consequences. If you get that many people coming in on boats you know people will die on the journey. You know that when they arrive they will have to be put into detention, and you also know they will have to be processed. But despite all of this being foreseeable as a consequence of the policy so irresponsibly implemented by those opposite, they did not make the provisions to process this increasing flood of people.


Those opposite talk about compassion all the time. Listening to the debate on this bill, and on similar bills and issues in recent times, I am still struggling—in fact, I find it impossible—to find compassion in a policy that entices people either to their deaths or to indefinite detention in this country. I do not understand the compassion; I see no compassion. In fact, with this legacy caseload, under the system of processing implemented and maintained by those opposite when in government, 30,000 people are still languishing under this system. Now what does that mean? It means 30,000 mothers, fathers and children whose lives are in limbo.


At the recent legislative committee hearing into this legislation, the department of immigration said that 'the government has made it very clear that no illegal maritime arrival will be granted a permanent protection visa. If this legislation is not passed, illegal maritime arrivals will remain barred from being able to lodge an application for a permanent protection visa.' So anybody who opposes this bill will be actively ensuring that these people remain in limbo. The question for these 30,000-plus people is: how long will they remain in limbo? The department said that 'if the government continued to process the IMA backlog for consideration of a grant of a temporary humanitarian concern visa in lieu of the TPVs'—which those on the other side have been blocking; now this is the important bit—'it is estimated that the backlog under the Labor-Greens legislation and processes would take at least seven years to process.'


I will say that again: if those opposite block this legislation it will mean that 30,000 people will remain in limbo, many of them for up to seven years. I struggle to understand where the compassion is in that—that is, leaving people, who were enticed to pay to come to this country, in limbo for a further seven years. Surely the most compassionate option would be to speed up their processing time by years so that they can get a decision: yes, they can stay on one of the new visas we are proposing; or, no, they cannot. Surely it is better to give people the news as soon as possible and not leave them in limbo indefinitely.


This bill will reintroduce temporary protection visas and will introduce safe haven enterprise visas, which are also temporary visas. It will reinforce the government's powers to undertake maritime turn backs and it will introduce rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements. Surely a compassionate response is to provide visas; to get people out in the community and provide them with an opportunity to work. It is not compassionate to provide permanent visas. This would again put the people smugglers back in business and we would start all over again with the deaths, with the arrivals, and with more people and more children in detention. 


These measures deliver on the government's election commitments to reintroduce these TPVs, to ensure that no IMA will be granted a permanent protection visa, and critically, and most compassionately, to process Labor's backlog of 30,000 asylum seekers. This should come as no surprise to anybody in this chamber or anybody in the Australian community. The reintroduction of TPVs is fundamental to the government's key objectives to process the current backlog of IMA claims. I was on the committee inquiry into this bill; I heard the submissions from a wide range of people. Not a single one of them put forward a credible and implementable solution to this backlog that would not put the people smugglers back in business. To me, that is not the responsible and the compassionate course of action.


Under this policy from our government, we are providing temporary protection to those illegal maritime arrivals who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights, despite what those opposite have been claiming. However, most importantly, temporary protection visas will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. Those of you who have had a look at recent committee testimony from a number of different inquiries will see that that is one of the products that people smugglers sell: you send us your young children—'anchor children'—and if they get in and get a visa, you can bring your whole family in. That is a horrific and an inhumane offering on behalf of the people smugglers and we cannot not deal with it.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What about people who want to be with their families? What about them?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  If Senator Whish-Wilson thinks that sending children by boat is a compassionate way to deal with children and that there are remotely has any human rights aspects to it, he is welcome to address that in the chamber later.


These visas will be credited for a period of up to three years. On expiration, a person's individual circumstances will quite reasonably be reassessed. Those who are found to still be owed protection will only be granted a further TPV or a SHEV, a safe haven enterprise visa. If they are found not to engage Australia's protection obligations, they will be required to leave.


Consistent with this government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa, the safe haven enterprise visa, will also be created by this bill. Again, it absolutely astounds me that people in this chamber, people who represent rural and regional communities in this country, would not be supportive of this new visa. The safe haven enterprise visa will be open to applications by those who have been processed under this legacy case load and who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. They will be an alternative to the TPV and will also encourage enterprise through learning and earning, which I think is wonderful.


Those granted a SHEV will work in designated regions, identified through a national self-nomination process. These visas will be valid for five years and, like the TPV, will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia because, again, that is another product for people smugglers to sell. Holders of these visas will be targeted to designated regions and encouraged to fill regional job vacancies, and will have access to the same support arrangements as a TPV holder, including Medicare, social security benefits and work rights.


In the last few months as a senator in this place and from my travels around regional Western Australia, I have had many conversations with growers and farmers who simply cannot find local people to do these jobs that keep their businesses, their farms and their horticultural industries going. Any opportunity like this to help growers and farmers across Australia find hardworking employees is something to be commended. Again, I cannot understand how anybody in this place would not think that is a good thing.


What happens to them after they have worked in regional Australia? If they have worked in regional Australia without requiring access to income support for 3½ years, they will be able to apply, if they meet eligibility requirements, to be granted other onshore visas—for example, family and skilled visas as well as temporary and skilled student visas. If a SHEV holder was to access government assistance to study for a degree, a diploma or a trade certificate in a designated regional area, this would not be classified as accessing social security benefits. However, holders of this visa will not be able to apply for a permanent protection visa. If a holder of a SHEV has relied on income support for more than 18 months during a five-year period, they will only be eligible to apply for another SHEV or a TPV, and this will only be granted if they are found to be engaging Australia's protection obligations. If they are not found to have engaged Australia's protection obligations, they will be required to leave the country.


Amendments in this bill to the Maritime Powers Act strengthen Australia's maritime enforcement framework and the ongoing conduct of border security and maritime enforcement activities. These amendments also reinforce the government's powers and support for Australian border protection officers conducting maritime operations to stop people-smuggling ventures at sea. Enforced turn-backs are a critical component of the government's suite of border protection measures and have been successful in stopping the boats, stopping people dying and putting people smugglers out of business. 


These measures affirm and strengthen our government's ability to continue with the successful cessation of boat arrivals in Australia. As someone with firsthand experience with border protection policies, I know the effectiveness of stopping the boats. They are not easy decisions. They are probably some of the hardest decisions that any government has to take, but they have to be made in the national interest and, I must say, in the interest of those who are thinking of putting their lives at risk by paying people smugglers, and now in the interest of the 30,000 illegal maritime arrivals whose lives will be held in limbo under the policies of this government for nearly seven years if this legislation does not go through.


The migration system as it stands promotes a one-size-fits-all approach to responding to other claims. The framework is inconsistent with the robust protection system that promotes efficiency and integrity. While efficiency and integrity are buzzwords used in government and in business, what that actually means for those 30,000 people is that they will have to wait for up to seven years in limbo, and that is not acceptable. Under this bill, a new process, the fast-track assessment process, will efficiently and effectively respond to unmeritorious claims for asylum and, it has to be pointed out, there are many unmeritorious claims for asylum just as there are many that are meritorious. This new fast-track assessment process will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with access to a new model of review—the Immigration Assessment Authority, known as the IAA. These measures are specifically aimed at addressing the current backlog of illegal maritime arrivals.


As we heard during our Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearings on this, 30,000 people are affected. Those who have meritorious claims will be afforded far better treatment under the provisions of this bill. However, it is the government's policy that, if fast-tracked applicants present unmeritorious claims or have protection elsewhere, their cases will be channelled towards a direct immigration outcome, rather than having them access the merits review process in order to prolong their stay in Australia. The measures in this bill will support a robust and timely process, which is, as I said, the humanitarian and the right process. It will better prioritise and assess claims, and afford a differentiated approach depending on the characteristics of the claims. Prompt removal of failed asylum seekers from Australia also supports the integrity of our protection program and reduces the likelihood of applicants deliberately frustrating and playing the system, and delaying removal plans.


The cost of the former Labor government's failures on our border over the last six years of government have been substantial in both humanitarian and financial terms. When looking at this bill and these measures, it is, I think, very important to go back and have a look at what they are designed to address. Labor and the Greens' failed border protection policies resulted in an environment where 50,000 people put their lives and their families' lives at risk by paying people smugglers, working through a pipeline of countries, to make this illegal journey. And why did they do it? Because those opposite deliberately, knowingly and with foresight implemented policies that drew them back to our country. Again, as I have said, I see no compassion in any government that would deliberately do that—not only deliberately bring them here in large numbers but put them into detention centres that were not ready and were not capable of looking after that many people. That is not compassion. That is not humane. Trying now to obstruct legislation that would deal with these 30,000 people in less than the seven years that their system would have taken—that is not the humane or right way to treat these 30,000 human beings.


As a consequence of the policies of those opposite, more than 14,800 have been waiting offshore in very desperate circumstances. Because of the policies of those opposite, they have been denied Australia's protection through humanitarian visas, as places were taken in our program by those illegal maritime arrivals who had paid to come here—many of whom had paid and sent their children on that journey so that the whole family could come in behind them. That is in no way a humanitarian or a responsible government approach.


To me, the most compassionate and humanitarian approach is to pass this legislation to give these 30,000 human beings a decision. If they are not going to stay, it is the right thing to do to tell them so they can get on with their lives elsewhere. If they are able to stay, we should provide them with visas so that they can work, study and raise their families here. That is the humanitarian way. Do not leave them in detention for up to seven years. That would be the consequence of not passing this bill, which I commend to the Senate.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:57):  In rising to support the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014, I support the comments of those who have come before me, particularly those of Senator Reynolds in the last few minutes. I will be urging, from a humanitarian point of view, everybody in the chamber to support this legislation. I do want to reflect initially, if I may, on why we are where we are, because I think it is important for people to have some understanding of the history of this issue.


We know that the previous coalition Prime Minister, Mr Howard, dealt with this issue. He of course made the statement that we, Australia, would decide who comes to our country and the circumstances under which they come. It was interesting for me, not long after I came here some six years ago, to hear a comment by the honourable Philip Ruddock, whom Mr Howard appointed as the immigration minister. Coming from his legal background, particularly associated with supporting those in need, one might have thought that Mr Ruddock's view would be very much along the lines of: 'What can we do to encourage more to come?' The interesting point he made was this: 'I came to the realisation that the best way of protecting these would-be asylum seekers who would come by sea under circumstances in which they are encouraged by people smugglers was to make sure that they didn't get on boats in the first place.' 


Philip Ruddock took the view that the safest position for those people was to make sure they were not put on old wooden leaky hulks, having paid significant, indeed scandalous, sums of money to people smugglers. So Ruddock went about the process of making sure that that took place. History of course records that that is what the Howard government achieved. At the time, the shadow minister  for immigration was Ms Gillard. Ms Gillard used to have a press release. The press release was headed: 'Another boat, another policy failure.' It got to the stage that her staff or their printers were not troubled by that media release, because they stopped when the vessels stopped.


I remember, before meeting Philip Ruddock—Senator Cash would recall as well—watching him being interviewed by a very aggressive BBC interviewer in London. This man was being highly critical and highly rude, and Philip Ruddock in his usual quiet way listened to this fellow for awhile and then said to him, 'Why are you attacking our country when you yourselves have exactly the problem that we did have?' He said, 'The only difference is we have addressed it and you haven't.'


Of course, when the Rudd government came into power, the first thing they did was dismantle the processes, practices, procedures and legislation that had stood the test of time with the Howard government. As one who had recently worked in and had businesses in Asia, on the subcontinent and in the Middle East, it became apparent to everybody that the message to the people smugglers was: 'We're back in business. We can put our sign up again because once again Australia is a weak target.' So what we saw in that time was the lamentable circumstance of tens of thousands of people paying hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively to people smugglers to get on leaking boats for the possibility of making it to Australia or to one of our offshore islands.


We know that in excess of 50,000 people got on those more than 800 boats. We know about 1,100 people—about one every second day that Labor was in government between 2007 and 2013 that we know about—were lost at sea. Why do I emphasise that point? I return to some discussions with our naval personnel with whom I had the pleasure and privilege of visiting at the Larrakeyah Barracks as part of Sovereign Borders in July of this year. For those in the gallery who may not be aware: we have this wonderful program between the parliamentarians and the Australian Defence Force where we—there are 14 of us each year—can participate in a program with our Defence Force personnel. We are given no privileges. We meet everybody from the cooks to the generals to the admirals. We have the opportunity to learn from them at the coalface what their activities are, where their challenges lie. For their sins the military officers come and spend a week with us in Parliament House in September or October.


A circumstance played out last night on national television. That was the stress to naval personnel who have been associated with the illegal-boat-led immigration programs over the last few years. The small amount of footage that I saw was distressing. But the point they made to me was they were sure there were well in excess of 1,100 people who would have been lost at sea. They are the ones that we know about. One can only be open in admiration of the work that those naval and related Army personnel do in protecting our borders but also in offering assistance to those who used to come. They were stressed out because of increased workload. The vessels were certainly stressed out because of increased workload.


But the worst thing of all for them was that recently our national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ran a line that our naval personnel had forced the hands of asylum seekers onto hot engine parts on those vessels. You had better have a clear understanding of their anger and their disappointment that such an allegation would be aired on a publicly funded national broadcasting service. I for one praised the Minister for Defence and others who drew attention to the scandalous allegation that was made and which has never been fully retracted, with a half-hearted apology from the head of the ABC.


Let's reflect on what has happened since Minister Morrison, ably assisted by his assistant minister, Michaelia Cash, took over responsibility for this portfolio. Since December last year—about this time—there has been one people smuggling venture, associated with 157 personnel. Only the one. Prior to that time, as we know, from September 2012 to September 2013—prior to us coming into government—there were no fewer than 401 such ventures, with 26½ thousand people on board.


I want to draw attention to the plight of genuine refugees—those who have gone through the process, those who have been found to actually be eligible for refugee status in this country who have been left floundering and rotting in refugee camps around the world as a result of the previous Labor government's policies. And why were they? Because Australia would accept a certain number per year. For each illegal immigrant—each illegally sourced asylum seeker who came—a genuine refugee then continued to rot with their families in refugee camps. I recall in Perth a young Sri Lankan fellow coming to see me, telling me that what was happening in these refugee camps was that, as a family got to the top of the list to come to Australia, unbeknownst to them, as a result of graft and corruption by management of some of these refugee camps, they never got to find out their names got to the top of the queue. Why? Because somebody came along with the inevitable brown paper bag, paid money, went to the top of the queue, came to Australia and had the deserving family continue to rot in such circumstances.


I was delighted to learn that the minister has indicated that we are now back to the stage of accepting some, I believe, 13,500 genuine refugees each year. On top of that, the people who will be the subject of this legislation are actually additional to those numbers. This is critically important—they are additional. So we will see again the flow of genuine refugees coming to this country under the conditions we have always approved and want to see in this place.


It is not just the direct cost—the $11 billion of cost—that the previous government ran up because they discontinued the policies of the Howard government that they inherited and that were working; it is what they then did when trying to account for some of those costs. The problem was compounded because they cut nearly 700 staff from the Customs service at a time when their duties were being increased as a result of not just illegal boat arrivals but also the burgeoning importation of drugs into this country. Only the other day we saw our border protection, customs, police and related services apprehend some $1.5 billion worth of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs. 


We do not for a minute think that we are getting all that is coming into this country, but when you cut the guts out of the customs and immigration service—when you take 700 competent people out—what does that do to the drug cartels? It has been put to me that the drug trade is so lucrative that they say to the drug mules and others in the trade, 'If you get apprehended, we will replace the product free of charge.' Those are the challenges we are facing. The number of sea cargo inspections under the Labor government decreased by 25 per cent and there has been a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo inspections, so the chances now of being apprehended if you bring something in by air are not high. These are some of the spin-offs that occur when you end up squandering $11 billion when you inherited a situation that was under control.


I now come to the circumstance of this legislation directly. Temporary protection visas do exactly as their name suggests. If somebody comes to this country and returning them to their country of origin would put them at risk, they will be provided with a temporary protection visa. Wonderful. Over time, as we know, the conditions that caused them to have to leave their country, if they were the genuine asylum purposes, may change or can be the subject of examination and inspection.


I think one of the fairest components of the legislation we are considering, and the one I urge my colleagues in this place to support, is the capacity for a person during the time they are under a temporary protection visa to be provided access to Medicare and social security benefits and allowed to work. A lot of people in our community do not agree with that. We get email traffic that says: 'Why is the Australian taxpayer providing Medicare services for these people? Why are we providing social security benefits?' There are a number of reasons: firstly, we are generous people; secondly, we want to try to minimise the adverse impacts on these people; and, thirdly, we want to give them the dignity that goes with the capacity to work. How terrible it must be, for whatever reason and in whatever circumstances, for a person who comes to this country to be left rotting and not be able to work because they were not processed by the previous government, which had no sense of generosity and no capacity for administration.


As a person from a rural and regional background I support the comments of my colleague Senator Reynolds with regard to work in rural and regional areas. At this very moment where fruit and other crops are being harvested we have a shortage of labour because Australians are unwilling to leave their towns and cities to avail themselves of this work. Fruit is not being picked and is rotting on trees and vines, and grain is not being harvested. Here we have a tremendous opportunity for these people.


The second element of Minister Morrison's legislation is the safe haven enterprise visa. This is a visa for a five-year period. If holders of these visas have worked in regional Australia without requiring income support for 3½ years and if they meet the eligibility requirements, they will be able to apply for other onshore visas—family, skilled, temporary skilled and student visas. What a fantastic opportunity. We all know from our own experiences how quickly those who came in post the Second World War from Southern Europe—Italians, Greeks and others—assimilated into our communities and how we benefited from their involvement. We then had the later wave during and after the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese who have come to this country have enriched this country with their diligence, their hard work and their desire to study and improve themselves, and of course they have changed our cuisine and our outlook on life.


Here under this legislation we are giving those people who will accept and be involved in the safe haven enterprise visa the chance, should they work for 3½ years—which is what they want to do; they do want to do the work that so many Australians do not seem to want to do—of family and skilled visas as well as temporary skilled and student visas. So they can set themselves up with sets of skills that indeed at the conclusion of that time they may well be able to take back to their country of origin, if indeed that is where they return, so that of course their lives and the lives of their children are enhanced into the future.


The legislation certainly requires a circumstance that people do make sure that they comply with Australia's rules and regulations. Perfectly, the Australian community would expect, that if a person on whatever form of these or whatever form of activity in this country, if they cannot comply with the rules of this country, if they cannot comply with reasonable legislation in this country, then they should be denied their right to continue here. I think that is an entirely reasonable circumstance.


Just in the last few minutes I do want to go back to the humanitarian activity and I do want to return to the topic briefly associated with our own military personnel. It is and has been an enormous burden. When we were in Darwin they actually asked us to put the clothing on that the personnel wear when they get into the rubber duckies to actually go to the vessel that they will be intercepting, remembering what temperatures would be like and humidity is like this time of the year. They will be in that equipment for six to eight hours, apprehensive, tentative, not knowing what they are going to meet when they arrive at the vessel. This is a pressure that they endure day after day. I for one want to say how pleased and proud I am of those people. I also want to say that this type of legislation will limit even more quickly and even more severely those who attempt—people smugglers—to bring people to this country illegally.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-12-03,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:17): Australia's migration policies have always had a long and vexed history. They have been, and rightfully so, open to significant scrutiny from international and domestic courts, independent experts, interest groups and the electorate. It has and will continue to be a passionate debate about a wicked and vexed issue. For me it is always important, always, to remember that we are dealing with legislation that relates to people, our fellow human beings. They are not numbers; they are not the myriad of labels that have been applied to them by all sides of the debate; and they are not political inconveniences, punching bags or props. They are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, friends, neighbours and acquaintances. They are, in short, people just like you and me who have found themselves in extraordinarily difficult circumstances—some, unimaginable circumstances. So I would like to approach this debate with respect, with compassion and with dignity. 


This has not been an easy process for me. On one side this bill does contain a number of measures that I am not comfortable with. But on the other side, if we do not act, the 30,000 people currently awaiting processing will continue to be left in limbo. If this bill does not pass there is also the real risk that the government will use a nonstatutory process instead, which will not result in any better outcomes for the people who are currently in Australia. This problem is a true Hobson's choice: we are left to decide between two potentially negative outcomes.


Back in 2012 the former government put up a number of proposals, the so-called Malaysia solution, which was rejected by the then opposition and the Australian Greens. I remember at the time—I remember well—I was in hospital and I asked for my vote to be recorded. There is a saying: 'Not to have the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.' As imperfect as the former government's solution was, it was preferable to doing nothing. We saw more and more drownings, more and more people pass away, and more and more people fall victim to people smugglers and the awful consequences of that.


What is being proposed by the government here is by no means perfect—in fact, it is quite imperfect—but the consequences of not supporting it will mean that asylum seekers will be in a worse position, in my view. It also has to be noted what the immigration minister said a few moments ago. He has agreed, as part of a process of constructive engagement with crossbenchers, to increase the humanitarian intake by 7,500 people—a significant increase. My view is that we should double the humanitarian intake or more. We are a big country with a big heart. But I am trying to deal with the actual political realities here. We have an opportunity to increase significantly the humanitarian and refugee intake by 7,500 people on top of the 30,750 per annum. We have an opportunity to have something like 25,000 people on bridging visas have work rights for the first time. We have an opportunity to significantly improve the lot of those individuals who have been left in limbo. The reality is that under the former government border control, immigration policy, was out of control, and that is something we need to take into account.


I have met with many interest groups and representatives, including Amnesty International and also Paris Aristotle of Foundation House and the former government's expert panel. My view on this issue changed when I saw what Angus Houston, Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange said in that expert panel. I congratulate former Prime Minister Gillard for having the foresight to set up that panel—to actually have a circuit breaker to try to look at this in a different way, because to me it meant that we needed to consider the awful moral dilemmas that we had to deal with. I thought the panel headed by Angus Houston came up with a number of sensible proposals.


In that context, I have approached the government to request changes to the bill and to migration policy to improve the conditions for the men, women and children who are awaiting processing. That doesn't mean that we cannot still advocate for a significant increase in the humanitarian intake. It does not mean that we stop being critical of the government's policies, but if we do nothing, if we do not support this bill, then I believe fervently that what will happen is that asylum seekers will be worse off if this bill is not passed, as imperfect as this bill is. That is the moral dilemma; that is the wicked problem. 


I want to make it clear that my vote for this bill is conditional on these changes and those circulated by the Palmer United Party. The government has taken my concerns into account and, I understand, will be circulating amendments to that effect. As such, I will not speak to those amendments in detail, but I would like to take this opportunity to outline the changes that I have proposed. I also want to make it very clear that these proposals do not necessarily represent my ideal outcomes. They do not, but they do make important steps forward—and I do not believe they should be rejected because they are only 'good' rather than 'perfect'.


Firstly, I have proposed changes to allow people holding TPVs or SHEVs to travel outside Australia where the minister is satisfied there are compassionate or compelling circumstances and the minister has approved that travel. That has never occurred before, either under this government or under the previous government, and I think that is an important concession. This would cover circumstances where a TPV or SHEV holder wants to travel to visit family in circumstances such as significant family illness or death. While I would prefer to allow family reunification on these visas, I believe this is an important step in granting these visa holders rights that go some way towards acknowledging the importance of family. 


Secondly, I have proposed changes to ensure that, through the use of a disallowable instrument, the fast-track process only applies to the legacy caseload. This will make sure that the use of this fast-track process will be subject to the scrutiny of the Senate. Thirdly, I have proposed changes to the definition of 'manifestly unfair' in relation to the rejection of claims so that it more accurately reflects language used by the UNHCR—and that is important. I think that is a benchmark that we need to look at very carefully. 


Fourthly, I have proposed some changes to the fast-track review process to ensure that it is not only efficient and quick but must meet the natural justice provisions already included in the Migration Act. This will help to ensure that decisions take natural justice into account within the confines of the act and so are more balanced and fair. I have also proposed changes to the requirement for the review to take new information into account. My specific intention in this case is to ensure that information that was not provided for personal reasons, including mental health reasons, can be taken into account. One example that has been put to me are the many cases of sexual or other assault, where the victim may not volunteer that information in the first instance. I think all of us can appreciate the reasons behind not sharing that information—the shame and the trauma that may prevent someone from speaking out. My proposal to the government was that this type of information and these circumstances must be taken into account, and I believe these changes will improve the review process in that regard. 


Fifthly, I have raised concerns relating to the non-refoulement provisions and how we can be sure that a person being returned to a country is not facing persecution. In this case the government has agreed to use phrasing similar to that of the UNHCR to define both when a person is considered to be part of a particular social group and what effective protection measures should be taken into account when considering if that person should be returned. I believe these definitions will bring Australia more in line with UNHCR best practice in terms of defining and applying these clauses. 


Further, I have advocated, as have others, for an increase in Australia's humanitarian intake and to extend work rights to people on bridging visas. I have always been a strong advocate of increasing our humanitarian intake. I believe the government could go further, but I do acknowledge the increase they have proposed will make a real difference—7½ thousand people. That is 7½ thousand people who can be taken in through that humanitarian and refugee intake and who can be part of our community. I do not want to throw that away. That does not mean that my colleagues in the Australian Greens or the opposition cannot say that we should double it—I think we should—or that we should have a much bigger humanitarian intake, a much bigger refugee intake. It could be an issue at the next election. I do not have an issue with that—it ought to be. But I do not want to throw away this opportunity to have 7½ thousand more people come in to this country through that humanitarian and refugee intake process.


Extending work rights to those on bridging visas is also vitally important. Participating in the workforce, even in a small way, makes people a part of our community and society. It gives them, quite simply, a reason to get up in the morning—to feel valued and that they are making a contribution. I do not want to pretend that any of these measures is an ideal outcome or that they represent what I would see happen in the perfect world. But they will make a true difference to the people who are here right now, who are in detention right now, who are waiting to be processed right now. This may not be perfect, but it is good. It is also important to remember that this is not the end of the debate. These measures do not mean that I, as many others, will stop pushing for improvements. They are merely the next step, not the final one, and I would urge my colleagues to support this bill.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-12-03,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:27):  The Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 makes significant changes to the way asylum seekers in this country are processed. With amendments, the bill is even more complex than without. The bill will do many things, not least of which is the bringing back of TPVs. As I understand it, the government will not back down on their view in support of TPVs, and I have a problem in backing down on my view against them. As such, I think we are, at this point in time, possibly at a stalemate. 


But I want people to be crystal clear that I genuinely want to find the solution to the problem of asylum seekers and what they are experiencing. Having visited Villawood and Broadmeadows on a number of occasions, I know that these people wish to have some surety in their lives. I also know that many of them will be found to be genuine refugees and that there will be some who will be found, ultimately, not to be genuine. I personally think the whole debate has become so polarised. I am not casting aspersions on anybody's motivations here but just asking people to remember that we are all going to go home at the end of this week. We are all going to be with our families 


We all know where we are going, so to speak. The issue of asylum seekers, the issue of dealing with compassion and dignity, the issue of addressing the concerns of people in the wider Australian community have to be treaty logically and with respect. There are many moving parts to this machine but in the end it is about people and you cannot commodify people. They are not numbers; they are people. At this point, I cannot support the government's legislation as it stands, but I acknowledge the work of Senator Xenophon. There are a lot of people in this place who are looking for a genuine and a just outcome.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2014-12-03,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (12:30):  This is the first time in this place I have had the opportunity to speak on any refugee or immigration matters. At the outset, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments put on the record by Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan. We do have a moral obligation to do what we can to accept people who are in unfortunate positions, who do not have the grace and benefit of being born in the safe and democratic nation in which we were born. We try to do the best in the world, as we do in our own lives, to help as many people as we can. I know often I personally fall down in not giving charity to as many fellow Australians as perhaps I should from time to time. Likewise, as a nation I am sure we can do more from time to time, we but we cannot do everything. The problem of refugees or displaced people has existed for as long as human history itself, going right back to biblical times. As a small nation at one end of the Pacific, we simply cannot fix that problem. We can, however, contribute to helping a not insubstantial number of people to relocate to a new nation, to make a new life, and to give them the opportunity to escape from threats to their life and liberty.


Through my own experiences, although I have not had a lot to do with refugee issues, I have from time to time been in contact with the Hazara community in Brisbane. They are great Australians who have come to this nation in the last decade or so, have found work and made themselves a family, and have taken advantage of the great Australian dream which we offer to everyone who is born here. It is a fantastic thing we can also offer to people from all around the world.


We try to take in around 13,500 refugees a year, which is a high proportion of the population relative to other nations' takes. It is something I fully support. In the past few years, that intake has been breached largely through unauthorised arrivals by boat. While I support an open and welcoming refugee policy where we do not control who is coming to this nation, I have great concern that those refugee places are not necessarily going to the people most in need across the world. They go to the people most able to afford to get on a boat or have access to places like Indonesia where they can take advantage of people-smuggling activities. 


There certainly needs to be a change in policy and a recalibration of where we are at. This bill deals with the legacy of policies which have contributed to the fact that we have 30,000 people in migration limbo at the moment, people who came here in an unauthorised way, and we have no real system to process those individuals.


As I said, I think we have a moral obligation to help people. We do not have a moral obligation because we have signed international treaties or because other people tell us we should act in that way; we have that obligation because we are human beings, just as these people are human beings and we should try our best to make their lives better if we can. The changes we are making in this bill have the potential to improve the lives of the 30,000 people. I know others in this chamber do not support temporary protection visas, but I think they are a reasonable compromise between ensuring people have asylum from threats which might impact them in their home countries, while recognising that we cannot help everyone in that situation. 


Over time, if the temporary protection visa system works well, we could help more people than we could if we were to offer permanent asylum because there is a limit to the number of people we can take. While I believe we have the obligation to provide people with asylum, it does not extend to say that we have to provide them with permanent residence, only that they should be granted asylum in the period when they need asylum. If circumstances change in their home countries, I see no abrogation of our responsibilities if we ask them to return to their home country when the situation improves. In fact, in my view we do the home countries a disservice if we do not encourage people to go home in those circumstances. We have been involved in fighting a long and hard war in Afghanistan. While I see the need for the Hazara to have asylum, hopefully in the long  term Afghanistan will find a  modicum of peace and security and the Hazara people will be integral to building peace and stability in that nation. If all we do is take the good people out of a nation and provide them with asylum, then those other countries will be denuded of those good people and will struggle to rebuild their own nations and to fight against evil and tyranny that sometimes, unfortunately, temporarily succeeds in other countries. 


Providing temporary protection is, to me, quite consistent with our obligations, and a temporary protection visa has always seemed to me to be a reasonable and proportionate response to this very difficult issue. Of course, the policy changes I flagged earlier have made a marked difference in the number of boat arrivals in this country. There has been only one people-smuggling venture that has successfully arrived in Australian waters since 19 December 2013—almost a year ago—and with only 157 people. That compares with the 50,000 or so that arrived here under the former government, and that has meant that we have a backlog of 30,000 people in asylum right now. 


The government went to an election last year with a clear policy—indeed it has been to the last two elections with a clear policy—to implement changes to our refugee program. The changes have included a program of turning back boats where it is safe to do so, reopening the facilities on Nauru and Manus Island—which the former government did take steps to do before the election—and, of course, the reintroducing temporary protection visas. I think there was a very clear mandate at the last election and widespread support for those policies, and some components have been successfully implemented by the government and have clearly had an impact. As I said earlier, I recognise the concerns of other senators about temporary protection visas, but it seems to me to be a reasonable compromise in this very fraught debate and I would hope that particularly those senators who come from an independent or crossbench perspective will look closely at this compromise and consider it to be a reasonable alternative.


I want to give credit to some of the crossbench and government senators who have introduced a new element to this program. I think that the safe haven enterprise visa, as it has been called, is an extremely innovative and welcome development. We have other visas in this nation which are very beneficial to rural and regional areas; indeed, some of our farms, meatworks and agricultural enterprises would not survive without 457 visas or 417 visas, the holiday visa program. These are essential to providing a workforce for industries in so many areas where unemployment is high. Unfortunately, many Australians do not want to go and pick fruit at a farm, pick grapes in St George or cut down 14-kilogram banana trunks in Innisfail or Tully, and we do rely on getting people from other nations to sustain those industries and farming activities. The enterprise visa will add another menu item to those visas which I think would be quite beneficial. People among those 30,000 who are in that backlog who want to gain access to work can move to an area of need—although I recognise that any area can be designated a region, my understanding is that the government will seek to ensure that those regions are in need of employment and are designated accordingly. People could apply to get a safe haven enterprise visa and move to these areas to add a new source of dynamism and diversity to regions of Australia which need workers, and it would allow these people to get on with their lives and earn some money for their families so that they can afford all the things that we in this chamber, I am sure, are very lucky to be able to afford.


The safe haven enterprise visas would be temporary in nature but my understanding is that after 3½ years on those visas people would be able to apply to be granted other onshore visas, including family-related visas which would not normally be allowed under TPVs generally. This will provide those people in this queue with hope for a better life. If we pass this bill today, it will provide 30,000 people who are somewhere on our territory, or territory that we have contracted for in Pacific nations, to have a hope for a better life. They can get some form of visa right now. They can apply for rights to work and to provide for their families, and if they prove themselves to tick all the right boxes while undertaking those activities, working and paying taxes, they will be able to become fully-fledged Australians. I think that is a great thing, and I am surprised that it is all that controversial in this place. Why wouldn't we want to give some portion of these 30,000 people hope for a better life? That is what this bill will do.


The government is of a view that a one size fits all approach is not appropriate to this problem because it limits our ability to address and remove unmeritorious claims and diverts resources away from individuals who have more complex claims. This bill will introduce a fast-track assessment process that will efficiently and effectively respond to claims that are deemed to have no merit and will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with a new model of review—the immigration assessment authority, known as the IAA. These changes are consistent with the other issues that have been raised with respect to the surge in boat arrivals that have occurred in the last few years that has, in my view, given priority to people who perhaps are not as much in need as those who are waiting in camps—those who are in a queue, so to speak—waiting to get to a nation of asylum, whether it be Australia or another country. 


Our review processes likewise have been blocked and unnecessarily diverted from dealing with claims that are of more merit by those that would seek to abuse processes. However, I completely understand why people might want to do that. I must say, if my family were living in Iran or another nation, I would try to do everything I could to get my family out and to a better life. As I said at the start, we cannot do everything. That does not mean we do nothing but we need to do something that we can do, and we need to do it in the best possible we can, given the scarce resources and the constraints that we have as a nation, and it needs to be consistent with our obligations in this place. This bill does that. It gives people better opportunities and it should be supported by this chamber.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:23):  I rise to speak on the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Case Load) Bill 2014. Before I commence my contribution I want to acknowledge the large number of emails and visits we have had from members of the community who are genuinely concerned about what is involved in this bill. I think all senators would have received emails and visits from people who really care about what is happening with asylum seeker policy in this country, and who have raised issues about this bill.


The bill contains the most comprehensive set of changes to—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order! Sorry, Senator Moore. Senators: Senator Moore is on her feet and there are a lot of conversations going on. Could you please give Senator Moore the courtesy of being heard.




Senator MOORE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This bill contains the most comprehensive set of changes to Australian law on immigration and asylum seekers to be brought before the parliament since the Abbott government took office. Much of the bill is a response to actions of the judiciary. Some of the response is understandable, but much of it is an attempt to pre-empt work that the courts ought to be allowed to do. Labor has grave concerns about many of the provisions of this bill. We believe the bill should be rejected entirely. If it is given a second reading, we propose to introduce substantial amendments.


The minister described the bill as a formal legislative recognition of the government's policy of turning back asylum seeker boats. He claims that this is about saving lives at sea. Let me be clear: Labor does not want to see deaths at sea. That is why, when were in government, we established asylum-seeker processing in PNG. That decision has played an enormous part in stemming the flow of boat arrivals. However, we have grave concerns about the turn-back policy, for two reasons. The first concerns the impact of the policy on Australia's relationship with Indonesia. The turn-backs have clearly harmed that relationship. If there is to be a long-term resolution to the question of boat arrivals, it could only be in the context of a close cooperation between Australia and the country from which most vessels bearing asylum seekers depart. That close cooperation existed when Labor was in office. The government's actions have destroyed it. Turn-backs have resulted in at least six incursions into Indonesian territorial waters. The other aspect of the turn-back policy that is of concern is the question of whether it does in fact save lives at sea, or whether it puts them at risk. The government have never been able to give satisfactory assurances on this question, because of their clear obsession with operational secrecy.


The minister's argument that the aim of the bill is to recognise turn-backs is deceptive. In fact, the relevant clauses of the bill are about a case now before the High Court: CPCF v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection & Anor. In essence, this legislation seeks to scuttle that case, which is fundamentally about the Maritime Powers Act. If the bill passes with these clauses, the precedent value of the case would be made redundant. Labor believes that this is inappropriate. The High Court has a role in upholding the rule of law that parliament must not undermine. If, after the court has made its decision, the government believes that legislation is required because of the consequences of that decision, it can bring another bill before the parliament. But it is not appropriate to legislate while the relevant case is being heard.


On the issue of new visas, the bill also resurrects temporary protection visas, TPVs, and creates a new class of temporary visas, the safe haven enterprise visa. Labor's position on temporary protection visas is well known. We oppose them because they place their recipients in limbo, with no certainty or assurance about their future beyond the three-year duration of the visa. Our view is that people who have been found to be entitled to Australia's protection should be given permanent protection visas and provided with assistance to settle within the community as quickly as possible. That also gets them off the government's tab, as quickly as possible, and on their way to becoming constructive and contributing members of society. Let us be clear: the vast majority of these people will live here for the rest of their lives, and want to do so. That is what we saw when TPVs were effectively abandoned during the Howard government. We should not repeat that experience. We should accept our obligations, and give those receiving Australia's protection the permanency to which they are entitled.


This bill, the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Case Load) Bill 2014, also purports to introduce another visa class, the safe haven enterprise visa, ostensibly in fulfilment of undertakings the government made to the Palmer United Party. I say 'ostensibly' because, in fact, all this bill does is to name a new visa The explanatory memorandum states that 'the conditions and operation of SHEVs will be laid down by regulation next year'. The bill therefore holds out a glimmer of hope for permanency to those who might be eligible for the new visa, but guarantees them nothing—in fact, it tells nobody what is involved in these new visas. Labor believes that a pathway to permanent protection, and ultimately to citizenship, is worth supporting. But that pathway must be more than just a name in a bill. The government should withdraw this bill and introduce another that provides a real pathway, and it should also provide information in regulations about how it will work.


Mr Acting Deputy President, this is an issue I have been raising for years, with various governments: the need to have the regulation and the legislation made available at the same time, so that people can see the detail. Too often, we have the situation where the real details are in regulations which are in the future at some time. This is something that needs action across all areas of legislation.


The government should withdraw this bill, as we have said. If it does not and this bill reaches the committee stage, Labor will join with other senators in proposing amendments that turn the imagined pathway provided by the new visa class into a real one. Under those amendments, the new safe haven enterprise visa would be a temporary visa valid for five years and applicants for this visa would need to demonstrate their intent to work and/or study in regional Australia. If visa holders do work and/or study in a regional area for at least 3½ years of the visa period, they would become eligible for permanency. Under other amendments we would propose, the right to work would be extended to asylum seekers on bridging visas while their claims for refugee status are assessed and sections of the bill concerning temporary protection visas would be deleted. We believe these should be either abolished or automatically converted to a permanent protection visa after a successful application for refugee status.


Under the issue of fast-tracking, the bill also seeks to change the refugee assessment process in two ways. First, the bill seeks to speed up the process for assessing claims by people who are in Australia in an unauthorised way either because they have overstayed their visa or because they have arrived without appropriate paperwork. It is not clear how this fast-track process will work, because that will depend on regulation, and details of the necessary regulations have not been provided. The second change is the replacement of the Refugee Review Tribunal by an immigration assessment authority, with a limitation of the existing right of review of adverse decisions. This change is of grave concern. Since the Abbott government was elected, Labor has supported much legislation intended to strengthen the refugee assessment process. This support has caused considerable debate, but the Labor Party has actually supported the proposition put forward by the government. In our view this change goes well beyond that. It guts the process. Labor cannot support limiting applicants' rights of review to the extent envisaged in this bill, or can we support the proposed fast-tracking of applications, which doesn't offer much by way of reducing the duration of the process but would go a long way towards reducing people's rights.


With regard to the refugee convention, the bill seeks to remove any reference in the act to refugees. Labor absolutely rejects this. The government argues that the bill codifies the obligations existing under the convention so that the decisions of Australian courts, rather than the decisions of international tribunals or courts in other jurisdictions, will determine Australia's law in this area. There is no good reason for this change, and it is any case unlikely to achieve the government's objective. The minister's second-reading speech makes clear that Australia remains a party to the refugee convention, and that this is given legislative effect by the Migration Act. Our courts will inevitably refer to decisions by courts in other common-law countries when determining how obligations of this kind should be interpreted in Australian law. That happens now and will continue to happen. The codification set out will not remove the established practice of judicial reasoning


There is a further problem raised by the attempt to codify the law. The bill inserts a requirement in the act that, if persons are able to alter their behaviour reasonably, they should not be able to claim Australia's protection. There are cases now before Australian courts in which a version of that requirement is under consideration, and courts have made decisions on a similar basis in the past, but setting the requirement down in fixed, statutory form raises questions that would not be easy to resolve. What if someone sought protection of the basis of sexual preference, but protection was denied on the basis that alteration of their behaviour would result in that person not being persecuted in his or her country of origin? That may not be the intention of this schedule, but it is not difficult to see how such a possibility could arise.


The bill also contains a provision removing the 90-day rule for hearing of asylum claims, which is an important accountability measure. At the time of last year's federal election, when Labor left government, about half of protection applications were decided within the prescribed 90 days; but, in the most recent report on the Abbott government's performance, only 14 per cent of decisions were being made within go days. The 90-day rule, which was introduced by the Howard government, has proven its worth as a test of the speed with which governments process applications. The rules should be retained. If the 90-day rule is not being met by the department, there should be rationale as to why it is not being met. Rather than changing the rule, there should be an acceptance that the 90-day rule stays and that exceptions to that should be subject to question and a process of explanation from the department to the minister and then to the parliament.


For all of these reasons, Labor opposes this bill, and we will vote to deny it a second reading.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-12-03,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:35):  Today I stand here with the overwhelming majority of legal and human rights experts in this country to condemn the regressive and dangerous Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 before us today. This piece of legislation, if it were to pass, would be a fundamental shift from what are known as due process, fairness before the law, a fair go under the refugee system and, of course, the proper checks and balances to make sure whoever is the government of the day is abiding by our international obligations as well as the basic rules and values of decency and fairness.


This bill should not be called the asylum legacy case bill. It should be called the immigration minister's outrageous grab for power bill. That is all that is in this piece of legislation. This bill is all about Scott Morrison, as the Minister for Immigration, grabbing more power for himself to dictate who will be a refugee, under what conditions they will be a refugee and whether or not they get access to a visa. Of course, overarching all of this is whether children and families remain languishing in terrible conditions on Christmas Island.


When it comes to the way we treat refugees in this country, never before have we seen a bill as insidious, as deceptive and as downright dangerous as this. It is a smorgasbord of suffering, a buffet of brutality, and it should not be allowed to pass this place today. Within this bill the immigration minister wants to make babies that are being born in Australia stateless. He wants to send those babies to camps of cruelty offshore.


He wants to give himself a licence to break international law. He wants to rip the refugee convention from the Australian law books. He wants to change the very definition of who is and who is not a refugee. He wants to fast-track the refugee determination process to remove the right of review, meaning there would be less protection for people who deserve it, less protection for people who may, as a result of mistakes, be sent back to death and torture.


He wants to deny protection to as many refugees as possible. He wants to introduce temporary protection visas for those who have been found to be in genuine need of protection, making them suffer even more for the fact that they dared to dream of freedom and safety for their families. That will leave thousands of refugees—genuine refugees who have been through the proper process, who desperately need protection and have every right to start putting their lives back together—in limbo effectively for the rest of their lives.


He wants to trick the Senate crossbench into thinking that a new visa that is being offered is a pathway to permanency when there is no detail of the safe haven enterprise visa in this legislation. If the minister thinks he can continue to trick this Senate and the crossbenchers in this place, he better think twice because he cannot. It is as clear as day that this minister has no intention of following through with the agreement that was made with the Palmer United Party and with the statements that have been made. He wants only more power for himself and less protection for refugees.


This is an unbelievable grab of power from the minister, and senators in this place have the opportunity to stop this minister, who is so arrogant and so drunk with power, from being able to have even more unfettered discretion. The immigration minister wants to give himself the ability to play God. He wants to be the judge, the jury and the executioner in all these cases. He wants to send refugees, including families and children, back to danger in their homelands. The whole point of this bill is to give as few refugees as possible the opportunity for protection. Even if they are granted protection, he will not even bother to give them a permanent visa that will allow them to rebuild their lives and allow them to contribute to this country. We have thousands of refugees living in the Australian community desolate, without work rights, without the ability to study and without even the right to be able to volunteer. All these people want to be able to do is get on with the rest of their lives—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What about the 1,200 who can't? 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  and this minister wants to start shipping them offshore.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Senator Hanson-Young has the right to be heard in silence. I would appreciate her being able to continue in silence.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Right now there are about 30,000 asylum seekers waiting for processing in Australia. Disturbingly, there are also 559 children in detention facilities across the country. In total there are 3,084 people in detention here in Australia. To our great shame, there are 167 children locked up on Nauru and in total 1,095 people are detained on Nauru and 1,056 on Manus Island. There is no question that these people need to have their claims processed immediately and be taken out of detention, put into the community and given the opportunity to start contributing to this country and rebuilding their lives. This bill does none of that.


Astonishingly, the immigration minister is using the suffering of these children in detention as a disgusting bargaining chip. He is trying to blackmail the Senate crossbench into accepting this cruel bill by threatening to send each and every one of them to the hellhole on Nauru. How appalling to see the minister who already has so much power—the power to keep people in detention—and who is keeping these children locked up, threaten this place today by saying: 'If you do not pass the bill the way I like it, it is my way or the highway. The children will remain in jail.'


What kind of human being uses children as his pawns in a game of politics? How gross, distasteful and sickening is the minister if he is willing to do this? These are children and they are being destroyed by these policies. The immigration minister is threatening to turn the screws on them even harder. He says that until he gets his own way he will keep them locked up in appalling conditions—conditions that have been condemned by the United Nations and condemned by our own Human Rights Commission here in Australia. That is not being a leader; that is being a bully and a coward.


What the immigration minister does not want senators in this chamber to understand is that he can release all of these children today if he wants to. He has the power to keep them in detention or to release them into the community. You do not need a bill that condemns them to a life of uncertainty just to get them out of the locked gates and out from behind the barbed wire. He can have them in the community and be processing their claims as we speak. He is actually obliged to do that under the current domestic law, but in fact he is refusing to act as the law currently prescribes to process people's claims, to get on with assessing them.


If they are genuine refugees, let them stay and let them get on with their lives. If they are not, then send them home. No-one is arguing that anyone should get a free ride here. Get on and process their claims. If they are refugees, they can stay. If they are not, deport them. At the moment we have the worst of both worlds. We have a minister who is keeping children locked up, incarcerated in immigration prisons, and babies being born to asylum seeker parents being told they have no right to protection in Australia. Despite being born in Australian hospitals, they will be on the next flight to Nauru, where we know children are being abused and are witnessing abuse every single day.


The Senate inquiry into this bill heard from thousands of human rights lawyers, refugee advocates, academics and community members, all of whom object to this outright. Over 5,000 submissions were made to this Senate inquiry and every single one of them bar the immigration minister's own department said this bill was wrong, said this bill would set Australia up for failure when it comes to looking after some of the world's most vulnerable people.


The overwhelming evidence from experts and the community was that this bill cannot pass, must not pass. Who does this minister think he is to delete the refugee convention from our law books—to say that we will delete the refugee convention from our law books and it will be he who interprets our obligations? Scott Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, wants this Senate to give him the power to dictate who is a refugee and who is not—unfettered, unchecked and not able to be appealed.


Australia is obliged to provide protection to those who arrive on our shores. We are obliged to do that under international law, but we are actually required to do it as part of being a good global citizen—as a nation that stands for fairness, as a nation and that cares about the rule of law, as a nation who proudly drafted the refugee convention 60 years ago because we did not want to see vulnerable people turned away and deported back to danger. And here we have a bill that in the midst of the political heat of the refugee issue here in Australia we have the Abbott government wanting to undermine and delete those very values from our law books.


There are some ways forward in how we manage the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in this country. There are 30,000 people who need their claims assessed. Get on and assess them, find out whether they do need protection or not. If they do, we resettle them and we let them get on with our lives—we get them into the workforce, we get the students and the children into school, we allow families to rebuild here in Australia and contribute to our local communities. If they are not refugees, finish their application process and send them home. But give people who do need assistance a fair go—and that means a genuine pathway to permanency.


The SHEV visa that has been spoken about and was part of the Palmer United Party's deal on this piece of legislation is not what is before us today. There is no detail about how the safe haven enterprise visa would work. Why would that be? It is because the minister has no intention of following through on his obligations. If he did it would be in the legislation or there would be substantial amendments that would have been circulated and talked through in this place. But we see none of that from the government. This is, 'My way or the highway,' according to the immigration minister and the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.


There is nothing in this piece of legislation that upholds the original deal between the Palmer United Party and Scott Morrison. In addition to that, they have stapled on six other schedules in this piece of legislation that fundamentally undermine the spirit of that arrangement in the first place: more people will be in detention, children born here in Australia sent off to the detention camps on Nauru, deleting the refugee convention, handing ultimate power to the minister to make a decision as to who he thinks deserves his tick of approval and who does not. We know the track record of this minister on these issues and he doesn't give two hoots about the humanitarian needs of those who have come to our shores. Why do we know that? Because we see that he is keeping children locked in appalling conditions every day. Every day those children remain in detention they are damaged further. Mr Morrison keeps them there locked up.


The Australian Greens agree with the majority submitters to the inquiry into this bill that this is a radical deviation from Australia's longstanding commitment to international law and human rights. If this bill passes, it will seriously endanger the lives of many thousands of asylum seekers. The Greens strongly recommend that this bill be rejected by this place today. There would need to be substantial amendments made to this bill if it were to proceed. Six of the seven schedules would need to be deleted and the remaining schedule would need to have a genuine pathway to permanency, so that if people are found to be refugees—after all this time they have spent in detention, all this time they have been left dumped in the community—they should be able to stay, work, pay their taxes and send their kids to school. It is simply asking for a fair go and for people to be treated with dignity and respect. As this bill stands none of that is in here. I strongly urge this place to vote it down at the second reading.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:51):  It is always easy to follow Senator Hanson-Young in any debate because each debate relating to migration she uses the same emotive words, no matter what lies they are, no matter how untruthful, how contrary to the facts. We have just had another example of that. Don't worry about what is actually in the bill; just use your normal, emotive language that you use on everyone, as I say, no matter how inaccurate and what complete mistruths those statements are. Let me take up some of the things Senator Hanson-Young said. She said, for example: 'We are going to delete the refugee convention from the Australian books.' 



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is not just wrong, Minister—it is absolutely ludicrous that that would be suggested. But it is the typical thing. I have been around for a while and I have been able to work out the Greens. They never bother about the facts, never bother about the legislation; they just come out with whatever lie they can think of and try and fool the public—and it works with the eight per cent or so of Australians who do vote for the Greens.


I experienced Senator Ludlam talking about the telephone interception bill and quite unashamedly saying, 'If this metadata legislation goes through the government, Big Brother will be able to know exactly what you are looking at on your computer.' I was not involved in the debate, but I thought, 'Hang on, I have just been through a Senate inquiry into this, and that is simply wrong!' So I got up and I said to the chamber, 'That is wrong, Senator Ludlam!', and he sat there in the corner with a big smile on his face and nodded. That is the way the Greens behave—do not bother about the truth, do not bother about what the legislation says; just tell any old lie and hope that some people will believe you. As I say, eight per cent of the people clearly do believe the Greens.


I have written down some of Senator Hanson-Young's words, but I should not have to write them down, because you hear them all the time—'unforgivable', 'drunk with power', 'unfettered discretion', 'play God', 'refugees sent back to danger'—it goes on. If you listened to Senator Hanson-Young just then, check what she said back against any speech she has ever made on migration and you will get the same sorts of words. Can I again put out another deliberate mistruth by the previous speaker? She said there are, outrageously, 559 children still in detention—384 in Australia and 167 on Manus Island. Actually, she knows as well as I do that there are 167 on Christmas Island. But let me give you the full facts about children in detention, to put this all in perspective. When John Howard left the government as Prime Minister there were zero, zilch, none—no children in immigration detention. Under six years of Labor government supported by Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Wright and their party, we had thousands of children in detention and thousands of children who lost their lives at sea. We never heard any condemnation from Senator Hanson-Young over the loss of lives of children at sea. Not once did we hear that. Why? Because it was under the watch of the Labor Party, who the Greens kept in power—in fact they were part of that power.


When John Howard left government zero children were in immigration detention. When Tony Abbott became Prime Minister there were 1,743 children in detention centres. Did we hear from Senator Hanson-Young about that? No. Did we hear from the Human Rights Commission about that? No. But that was a year ago—1,743 children in immigration detention. Since the Abbott government has been in power, and thanks to the good work of Senator Cash and Mr Morrison, the relevant ministers, that number is now down to 647. You do not have to take my word for this—have a look at the evidence given at the estimates hearing held last Thursday in this building, a hearing that Senator Hanson was at. She knows these figures: 1,743 when the Abbott government took over, when Mr Morrison and Senator Cash started dealing with Labor's problem. Now there are only 647 in immigration detention. At estimates last week—and Senator Hanson-Young was there, so she knows this—I said to the officials: 'What is the forward projection? What do you think is going to happen to these 647?' And I was told—and it is on the record in Hansard; you can go and look at it yourself—that by June next year there would be no children in immigration detention. No children. I said to them, 'What does ""no"" mean?', and they said, 'We will be trying to get to nil, but we can almost guarantee less than 100.'  That was on the proviso that this legislation gets through the parliament so the officials can have the necessary authority to do what needs to be done to get those children out of immigration detention.'


If you had heard Senator Hanson-Young, would you believe that that was the case? Of course you would not, because they will tell any lie, misstate any fact, to convince a few vulnerable voters that the Greens have a heart. The Greens do not have a heart. If they had a heart they would not have been part of thousands of people losing their lives at sea under the watch of the Greens political party and Labor, and there would not have been 1,743 children in detention at the end of their time in government. These are facts. They are not emotive words; they are not any old lie to try and gather a little bit of political support from the few who would believe that sort of rubbish. You see, this is not just Senator Hanson-Young—any member of the Greens political party is the same. They will just say anything, anything at all, to get a vote. I mentioned Senator Ludlam's comment—which he acknowledged! He knew it was a lie. But did that stop him from saying it?


These are the lies that the Greens propagate, and they expect people to believe them. Senator Hanson-Young says these children are 'behind barbed wire' in prison camp. Again, go and see what the officials said about that very subject last Thursday at estimates. They said there is no barbed wire around—the only chain wire fences are around the swimming pools that are put there for the children. Yet if anyone would believe Senator Hanson-Young, and I suspect that as every day goes past there are fewer and fewer people who do believe her, all 647 children in detention are behind barbed wire. How emotive!




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Have you been there?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  No, I have not, but clearly you have not because the officials told you last Thursday—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:


Madam Acting Deputy President, you are quite right. I should—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resume your seat, please.



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, order! Please make your remarks through the chair. I would appreciate Senator Macdonald being given the opportunity to be heard in silence.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I take your admonishment. It is a shame there is someone in the Senate, a colleague of the house, who tells deliberate untruths about children in detention being behind barbed wire. When that question was put to officials last Thursday in a Senate estimates committee hearing, I think their comment was that the only chain wire fences, which of course are required in every Australian jurisdiction, are around the swimming pools.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  That is to stop them drowning. We do everything we can to stop them drowning.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You make a very good point, Senator O'Sullivan. We will do everything possible to stop children from drowning, unlike the Greens and the Labor Party who presided over the deaths at sea of hundreds and hundreds of children and nary a word of condemnation. I hope someone will be able to apologise on behalf of the Greens later in this debate.


Senator Hanson-Young uses words like 'the minister is a bully and a coward and he bullies children in detention camps'. Those of you who know Mr Morrison and Senator Cash know that you would not find any more humane people than those two people. They are there trying to do a job. I might say the Australian people asked us at the last election to stop the boats. Had they been stopped during the Labor regime, there would not have been 30,000 people in immigration detention at the moment, there would not have been 30,000 people wanting to have their cases dealt with. Not in this particular bill but in other bills before the parliament the minister is trying to give certainty to those people who are in Australia at the moment. If Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens political party wanted to have a look at the bill they would see that the bill before us is particularly beneficial. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a period of up to three  years. Senator Hanson-Young would have told you in her speech—if anyone who listened believed it—that nobody was going to get a temporary protection visa. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a period of up to three years. On the expiration, a person's circumstances will be reassessed. Those who are found to still be owed protection will be granted a further temporary protection visa or what is called a SHEV. I want to  talk about the safe haven enterprise visa because I think it is a very good initiative of the government. I congratulate Senator Cash and Mr Morrison for doing this.


Consistent with the Abbott government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa called the safe haven enterprise visa will be created. The safe haven enterprise visa will be open to applications from those who have been processed under the legacy case load and those who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. The SHEV will be an alternative temporary visa to the temporary protection visa and will encourage enterprise through earning and learning. That is a great initiative. Perhaps the minister can elaborate in her speech on how it is going to be introduced. I think it will be introduced by regulation very shortly. The visa will be valid for five years and, like a temporary protection visa, it will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. 


The SHEV holders who have worked in regional Australia without requiring access to income support for 3½ years will be able to apply for and, if they meet eligibility requirements, will be granted other onshore visas—for example, family and skilled visas as well as temporary, skilled and student visas. So contrary to what Senator Hanson-Young would have you believe, this bill contains a lot of protections and it starts to bring some order to the chaotic situation left to us by the Labor and Green government of the last six years, a government which presided over many deaths at sea, including the deaths of children.


I would hope Senator Hanson-Young might rise at some time during the day and apologise for misleading the Senate about those statistics on the children. She should because she was at the estimates committee just last Thursday when all of these figures were explained by officials. There were zero children in detention when the Howard government was defeated. When the Abbott government came to power, there were 1,743 children in detention, with not a word from the Greens and not a word from the Human Rights Commission. Since that time, in a short 12 months, over 1,000 of those children have been released and by June next year, according to officials—this is their hope, if they are given the authority to do this—there will be no children left in immigration detention. One would have thought that, if the Greens had any care at all, if they had any compassion, if they cared about children in detention they would be the first ones here supporting this bill.


It is my honour and pleasure to chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which looks into these bills very carefully. Senator Hanson-Young would tell you, I think she said, that there were 5,000 submitters to this inquiry. Well, sorry; there was a petition—the sort of petition you leave at the coffee shop and everyone signs it without knowing what is in it—but the number of submitters is clearly shown in the committee's report and, I am sorry, Senator Hanson-Young, they do not reach 5,000 or 2,000 or whatever other exaggerated number you might have said. There were the usual witnesses at the hearings; a lot of them are refugee advocates. I might say that I think the government's decision not to have taxpayer funding for these migration agents has caused some concern in the migration agents industry. We do get a number of people who, I concede and I congratulate them, do have some expertise in this area; however, they come from a particular view. We on this side come from the view that Australia has an ordered immigration system. We take around 14,000 refugees every year. But if you jump the queue, and if you are wealthy enough to pay the people smugglers—I often wonder whether the people smugglers are donors to the Greens political party; you would think there might be some other reason why the Greens are so in favour of the people smugglers—




Senator Moore:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I believe that Senator Macdonald's past comment reflects very seriously on people in this Senate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I am talking about the Greens political party. I am not talking about any member in this chamber.




Senator Moore:
  On the point of order: I think the slur on the party and the members here, about people smugglers being donors to the party, is a very serious reflection on the party and the participants in the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I thought Senator Moore might have taken a point of order on Senator Hanson-Young calling a distinguished minister a bully and a coward. She did not seem to worry about that.




Senator Moore:
  No.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Very selective, Senator Moore, but then you would expect that from Labor, because Labor and the Greens presided over the worst mess that Australia has seen. Clearly the Greens and Labor do not want people to understand this, but Australia takes about 14,000 refugees every year. This means that, on a per capita basis, Australia is one of the best countries in the world for accepting refugees. We punch well above our weight.


When people jump the queue, when they have enough money pay people smugglers and other people who support people smugglers, it means that those genuine refugees who are languishing in squalid refugee camps right around the world miss their chance to come into Australia because we take only 14,000. If they come in illegally by sea, then those who are waiting their turn in squalid refugee camps around the world who have already been determined by the UNHCR to be genuine refugees miss out. They have to wait yet another year. I just want to bring some reality to this debate.


The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looked at this legislation and made four recommendations. I am going to run out of time so I cannot go into those recommendations in detail, but they suggest that some amendment be made and that there be improvements made to the bill. The fourth recommendation was that, subject to the preceding three recommendations, the bill be passed. I commend the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill to the Senate.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-12-03,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I rise today to speak about the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 and to put clearly on the record my disgust for what is an outrageously cruel bill. The content of this bill sends shivers down the spine of all Australians who care about human rights and who consider that the moral health of our nation can be judged by how we treat our fellow human beings who are most in need.


If passed, this bill will widen the immigration minister's powers, marginalise international law and the rules of natural justice and muzzle the ability of Australian courts to scrutinise the government's treatment of asylum seekers. It will also establish a new high-water mark in the cruelty Australia is willing to show to those men, women and children who come to us from persecution and violence and throw themselves on our mercy. Increasingly, our wellsprings of mercy are running completely dry.


The title of this bill refers to the legacy caseload—that is, the 30,000 people who sought Australia's protection between August 2012 and December 2013 and who have suffered the physical and mental anguish of mandatory detention, family separation, uncertainty about their legal status, and the constant risk of removal to Nauru or Manus Island. To quote the New South Wales Bar Association, this bill goes far beyond what is necessary to deal with the legacy caseload. It involves serious departures from Australia's international obligations to human rights and, more generally, to the extent that the bill does deal with the legacy caseload, it does so in a way which is procedurally unjust and unfair. 


One of the thousands of submissions received by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has described the bill as 'punitive and nasty' and written so as to suggest that, 'asylum seekers are being punished for their temerity in seeking our compassion; for taking at face value our oft-proclaimed commitment to human rights and the rule of law.'


Along with other migration bills before the parliament, this bill constitutes the single biggest change to Australia's asylum seeker policy ever made. The bill's six schedules would fundamentally change the way protection claims are assessed. The bill changes the criteria by which a person is found to be owed protection and the nature of the protection provided by Australia to those in genuine need. It also changes the legal status of those seeking our protection and empowers a range of government agencies to restrict or remove their liberty. In each schedule, the bill removes the now rare existing features of the Migration Act which operate to protect the rights and interests of asylum seekers, in favour of a system that departs from international law and rule of law principles. 


As the Greens spokesperson on legal affairs, I have to raise particular concerns about those features of the bill that remove procedural rights and review rights, longstanding protections against oppression in our Australian legal system. These features prescribe a legal framework for the determination of refugee and protection status that is contrary to international law and rule of law principles. 


In a move of shameless legal manipulation, the government uses this bill to remove references to the refugee convention from the Migration Act and replaces them with the government's own interpretation of the convention. How can we possibly persuade other countries to fulfil their international obligations when our own actions show that we are prepared to manipulate and undermine an important international convention? Our hypocrisy will be seen for what it is. 


This bill also removes fundamental procedural rights to safeguard the integrity of what can be a life-or-death decision about a person's need for protection. It does this by introducing a new fast-track procedure which will give asylum seekers one shot at setting out the evidence needed to substantiate their protection claim to an immigration official, but without providing them any access to independent advice or support. They will not be able to have the merits of the claim reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal.


There are so many other egregious betrayals of human rights and rule of law principles in this bill. Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into it. But there is a deep chasm between this proposed law and a principled, fair and dignified approach to providing protection to those in genuine need. The Australian Greens strenuously oppose the passage of this bill. This bill is indefensible and un-Australian.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (11:17):  I am not really sure why Senator Wright did not have the time to go into the detail of this bill; she had another 15 minutes on the clock. Perhaps it would have been better if Senator Wright did go into some of the detail. I think that the Greens in this debate do not want to get bogged down in detail because that would mean getting bogged down in facts, and the facts do not support their argument. That is why we heard that five minute contribution. That is why we heard the hysterical contribution from Sarah Hanson-Young earlier, the disgraceful contribution from Senator Hanson-Young. The hypocrisy that we see in an ongoing way from the Greens on this issue and from the Labor Party on this issue—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Before you go on, Senator Seselja, when you are referring to senators, please use the term 'Senator'.




Senator SESELJA:
  I do apologise. The hypocrisy we have seen from the likes of Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Wright and Labor senators on this issue is absolutely extraordinary. I can see why Senator Wright would not want to get into the detail of this, because the detail does not back their argument. The detail does not back the Greens argument. It does not back the argument that comes from the left of the Labor Party, which seems to now be dominating them in opposition once more on this issue of border protection and illegal arrivals. 


The Labor Party pretended at the end of its time—having completely messed up this policy with tragic consequences—that it had learnt its lesson. But in opposition unfortunately, as we see with this bill again today, the Labor Party is showing that it has not learnt a thing. It has shown that, if it is ever given the opportunity again to govern and to be responsible for the border protection of this nation, it will go back to the same old failed policies that the Greens advocate here openly and which the Labor Party has pretended is not part of their policy any more, but we are seeing it more and more.


I want to go to the difference in approach on this issue between the coalition government and the Labor-Greens view of the world, as put in place in government when they were there and as continued to be advocated by the opposition and by the Greens here today in an ongoing way. The difference is crystal clear. The Labor-Greens policy saw 50,000 illegal arrivals. We saw a flood of people coming to this country illegally and claiming refugee status. We saw at least 1,200 people drown in an effort to get to Australia, lured by the bad policies which were put in place by the Labor-Greens coalition—by the Labor Party in government, egged on by their Greens partners. That is their legacy. There were something like 2,000 children in detention under the Labor Party at one point, because they had been lured here. There were children and adults who got on those boats and did not make it here. That is the tragedy of these policy failures. We have seen a dramatic turnaround on all of those indicators—and I will go to each of them. 


Anyone who really cares about this issue should acknowledge that the coalition's policies have actually seen a positive shift, because people are not drowning any more. We should be celebrating that fact. We should be celebrating the fact that we see fewer people in detention, fewer children in detention, now than when we came to office. 


I heard Senator Macdonald's excellent contribution earlier where he talked about what the committee had been told in relation to the dramatic reduction in numbers that we had seen. And in fact the expectation is that those numbers will continue to reduce so that we will see, hopefully very soon, a situation where we do not any more have children in detention, just as we did at the end of the Howard government. That is the legacy when you get control of the borders. When you get this policy right, not only do you stop the drownings, not only do you regain control of the borders but you also see the ability for governments to effectively deal with these issues, and that is what the coalition is getting on with the job of dealing with.


I do find it extraordinary—we expect it from the Greens as they are quite extreme on this issue and we have come to expect it from parts of the Labor Party, though it is concerning—that a party of government, the opposition in this nation, still allows itself to go back to a policy direction which it acknowledges failed. Labor ministers saw that those policies were failing. They were failing Australia, they were failing our responsibilities, they were failing those who got on boats and did not make it here and they were failing those who waited in refugee camps overseas who could not be resettled because there were far too many people coming here and claiming asylum. So the policies failed across the board, and the Labor Party continues to advocate them.


I do find it extraordinary that we see protests. I have had protests at my office in recent times, and people are entitled to protest. Some of those protesters and some of those who were silent when people were drowning—and many of those people were silent when people were drowning—are now coming out and are very loud. As I said, we had had 50,000 arrivals but what has happened this year? I think there has been one successful people smuggling venture to this country this year compared to 50,000 arrivals over the term of the Labor government. Those people should be saying that is a good thing and some of them occasionally acknowledge that but many do not. The Greens party certainly does not. I have not heard the Labor Party acknowledge it. But I would ask those protesters, as well-intentioned as some of them may be: why were they silent when people were drowning trying to get here because of bad policy? They were silent. Many of them were silent. They believe that those policies were reasonable, well, they were not and they failed.


Why was the Human Rights Commissioner silent? It was extraordinary, the evidence we heard recently, where the Human Rights Commissioner said that her concerns were there in late 2012. She had concerns about these issues in late 2012 but she chose not to launch an inquiry in 2012. She chose not to launch an inquiry while there was a Labor government all through 2013 and the boats continued to arrive, when numbers peaked at 2,000 children in detention. Apparently the Human Rights Commission was not concerned enough to inquire into that. Lo and behold there was a change of government to a coalition government. We stopped the boats, we started to significantly reduce the number of children in detention and that was when the Human Rights Commission thought it was a good time to start inquiring. Based on those facts, you would have to question the impartiality of such a body. It had got concerns from late 2012 and did nothing about it until after there was a change of government. That change of government actually significantly improved the situation that the Human Rights Commission was concerned about, but that was when it started to inquire. So Australians could be forgiven for thinking that many of these activists and the Human Rights Commission are not coming to this in an impartial way. They are actually found out to be quite partisan on this, and I think that is unfortunate.


So let's look at the record on these issues that we are told are of concern. All of us should be concerned about people getting on a leaky boat and not making it here. Thank God that no longer appears to be happening. It is a very rare thing. Thank God we have not seen drownings in recent times. We should all be pleased with that outcome. Surely that is something we can all agree on—that that is a good thing and that that is a significant improvement. Surely that has come about due to policy change because the message has gone out that that is not the path the residency. Getting on that leaky boat is no longer the path to residency in this country and that must be good thing.


We are reducing the numbers, we are getting through the legacy case load and this legislation goes to that legacy case load. It must be a good thing that we are seeing fewer and fewer children in detention. In fact there are far fewer children in detention now than when we came to office. The expectation is that with the right policy settings that will go down to zero as soon as possible, and that is what we should be striving for. I say to some of those critics including the Human Rights Commission, including some of those protesters: why not actually look at those facts and say we are heading in that direction? We are stopping the drownings, we are seeing fewer children in detention and we are getting order back into our immigration system—order that was sadly lacking for the past six years.


In taking significant measures, the coalition now has to deal with the legacy case load that was left to us by the Labor-Greens, Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. That is what we are doing and this legislation is about dealing with that. Labor and the Greens now, having created the problem, are again trying to sabotage the solution and are denying work rights to thousands of people—because people who are voting against this bill are denying work rights. So the Greens on the one hand say they want to see work rights but there is a policy in place from the Labor Party that denies people work rights. We are looking to reinstate them through this legislation and they are voting against it.


So what does that say about their commitment? What does that say about their commitment to these people? It says it all—that they would far prefer to pontificate and to oppose, and to go back to their failed policies, than actually help us deal with solutions that will improve the lot of many but that will maintain the integrity of our immigration system. If we do not maintain the integrity of our immigration system we can see the catastrophic results: we see the thousands of people drowning, we see children in detention and we see all of the things that we do not want to see.


That is what this bill does; it honours the coalition's commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures to stop the boats. It reintroduces temporary protection visas; it introduces the safe haven enterprise visa—which is also a temporary visa; it reinforces the government's powers to undertake maritime turnbacks; and it introduces rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements.


The issue around turnbacks is an important one and it is worth reflecting on. Turnbacks have worked. Turnbacks have been an important part of the suite of policy measures that the coalition has put in place. Richard Marles knows this. Richard Marles acknowledged the turnbacks have worked.




Senator Moore:
  It is Mr Marles!




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, he did! This is where the fundamental confusion is in the Labor Party over this policy.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  We got no information on it!




Senator SESELJA:
  Richard Marles went on television and said, 'We acknowledge that they have had an impact.' And he was very quickly rebuked and brought back into line. He was speaking the truth. It was a rare moment from this Labor opposition, where he was acknowledging that the policies that we have put in place have worked, and he was very quickly undermined by others in the Labor Party, including his own leader.


The turnbacks do work. The turnbacks are part of a suite of measures that have sent a very clear message that getting on a leaky boat and paying a people smuggler is not the path to citizenship in this country. It is not. We have made that absolutely clear, and that should be reinforced. All of our policies should reinforce that, rather than undermine that as they did under the previous government.


I often have discussions, as I said, with advocates. Many of them are well intentioned, but I think those advocates forget—and what they cannot seem to reconcile—that if you are going to have a limit on the number of people you take in an immigration setting then you have to have rules. Whether you take them in the humanitarian space, in refugee places or more broadly, if you are going to limit the refugee space—and virtually all Australians would agree that we have to have a limit—then we have to set those limits in terms of how many people come to Australia. If you are going to do that then you have to have rules and you have to enforce those rules. If you do not enforce those rules then the people smugglers get to choose. They get to choose who gets to be accepted as a refugee in this country.


There are those who languish in other countries in refugee camps—and I have spoken to many of them who are now in my electorate. Many of them waited for many years. I am not saying that some of the people who have arrived here by boat do not have legitimate claims. I am saying that we should not have a policy that is set up to give favouritism and preference, and to make the test of whether you are accepted as a refugee in this country being whether you can arrive here. Under the previous government—under lax border protection policies—those who got here got preference. Those who do not have the means to get here—those who, one would argue, are the most disadvantaged; of all the displaced people, those with the least means—they are the ones who are most disadvantaged under the former policies. They will never get a look-in because there will always be someone who gets preference by paying a people smuggler and getting here. So, if you acknowledge that we have to have limits then we have to have rules, and those rules have to be enforced. That is at the heart of the difference in how we do border protection and how we manage these things.


There are other significant problems that have flowed from those failed policies. Because so much extra money was being spent we saw cutbacks in other areas—things like Customs screening were cut back significantly under the former government; they were running out money because they blew such a hole in the budget. That is also important. It is important that we screen what is coming into this country, whether it is drugs or other illegal goods. That was undermined because the whole system was in chaos.


The reintroduction of TPVs is fundamental to the government's key objectives to process the current backlog of protection claims. The government is providing temporary protection to those IMAs who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. TPVs will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights. This is a really important part of this legislation: it is providing work rights. The alternative from those who want to vote against this is to deny work rights so that people who have not been processed and who are waiting cannot actually work to sustain themselves. Surely, that is not a good outcome? Surely that is not something that should be advocated, yet it is. It is being advocated; whether they say it or not, that is what they are advocating with their vote.


There are a range of other aspects to this bill, but it fundamentally goes to continuing our job of fixing the problems that we inherited when it comes to border protection. We have made amazing strides in that area, because we no longer see the boats, we no longer see the deaths at sea and we are seeing the numbers of children in detention dramatically reduced. All of those things are great strides, which have come about through strong border protection policies. This is the next step; this is the next part of dealing with that legacy, and I would commend this bill to the Senate.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (11:37):  I rise today to speak on the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014. This bill is a key part of the coalition government's promise to stop the boats. The coalition government, through this bill, is introducing a package of measures to resolve the immigration status of the illegal maritime arrivals legacy caseload, which currently sits at a staggering 30,000 people who arrived under the policies of the former Labor-Greens government.


In fact, when we came to government there were over 33,000 unresolved cases, 27,000 of which had not even started to be dealt with, and some of them had been in detention since August 2012. This bill honours the coalition's commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures to stop the boats. These measures were successfully used under the Howard government but abolished by the former Labor government. I was working for the Howard government when we introduced these measures and faced this crisis over a decade ago. What happened under the previous Labor-Greens coalition was utterly foreseeable because we had been there before. We knew if you put the people smugglers back into business and you gave them a business model and a product to sell, they would do it. There is absolutely no surprise that once you implemented these policies then a flood of people would start to come in again. In fact, 50,000 people paid people smugglers to enter this country illegally. That was totally foreseeable, as were the consequences. If you get that many people coming in on boats you know people will die on the journey. You know that when they arrive they will have to be put into detention, and you also know they will have to be processed. But despite all of this being foreseeable as a consequence of the policy so irresponsibly implemented by those opposite, they did not make the provisions to process this increasing flood of people.


Those opposite talk about compassion all the time. Listening to the debate on this bill, and on similar bills and issues in recent times, I am still struggling—in fact, I find it impossible—to find compassion in a policy that entices people either to their deaths or to indefinite detention in this country. I do not understand the compassion; I see no compassion. In fact, with this legacy caseload, under the system of processing implemented and maintained by those opposite when in government, 30,000 people are still languishing under this system. Now what does that mean? It means 30,000 mothers, fathers and children whose lives are in limbo.


At the recent legislative committee hearing into this legislation, the department of immigration said that 'the government has made it very clear that no illegal maritime arrival will be granted a permanent protection visa. If this legislation is not passed, illegal maritime arrivals will remain barred from being able to lodge an application for a permanent protection visa.' So anybody who opposes this bill will be actively ensuring that these people remain in limbo. The question for these 30,000-plus people is: how long will they remain in limbo? The department said that 'if the government continued to process the IMA backlog for consideration of a grant of a temporary humanitarian concern visa in lieu of the TPVs'—which those on the other side have been blocking; now this is the important bit—'it is estimated that the backlog under the Labor-Greens legislation and processes would take at least seven years to process.'


I will say that again: if those opposite block this legislation it will mean that 30,000 people will remain in limbo, many of them for up to seven years. I struggle to understand where the compassion is in that—that is, leaving people, who were enticed to pay to come to this country, in limbo for a further seven years. Surely the most compassionate option would be to speed up their processing time by years so that they can get a decision: yes, they can stay on one of the new visas we are proposing; or, no, they cannot. Surely it is better to give people the news as soon as possible and not leave them in limbo indefinitely.


This bill will reintroduce temporary protection visas and will introduce safe haven enterprise visas, which are also temporary visas. It will reinforce the government's powers to undertake maritime turn backs and it will introduce rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements. Surely a compassionate response is to provide visas; to get people out in the community and provide them with an opportunity to work. It is not compassionate to provide permanent visas. This would again put the people smugglers back in business and we would start all over again with the deaths, with the arrivals, and with more people and more children in detention. 


These measures deliver on the government's election commitments to reintroduce these TPVs, to ensure that no IMA will be granted a permanent protection visa, and critically, and most compassionately, to process Labor's backlog of 30,000 asylum seekers. This should come as no surprise to anybody in this chamber or anybody in the Australian community. The reintroduction of TPVs is fundamental to the government's key objectives to process the current backlog of IMA claims. I was on the committee inquiry into this bill; I heard the submissions from a wide range of people. Not a single one of them put forward a credible and implementable solution to this backlog that would not put the people smugglers back in business. To me, that is not the responsible and the compassionate course of action.


Under this policy from our government, we are providing temporary protection to those illegal maritime arrivals who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights, despite what those opposite have been claiming. However, most importantly, temporary protection visas will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. Those of you who have had a look at recent committee testimony from a number of different inquiries will see that that is one of the products that people smugglers sell: you send us your young children—'anchor children'—and if they get in and get a visa, you can bring your whole family in. That is a horrific and an inhumane offering on behalf of the people smugglers and we cannot not deal with it.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What about people who want to be with their families? What about them?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  If Senator Whish-Wilson thinks that sending children by boat is a compassionate way to deal with children and that there are remotely has any human rights aspects to it, he is welcome to address that in the chamber later.


These visas will be credited for a period of up to three years. On expiration, a person's individual circumstances will quite reasonably be reassessed. Those who are found to still be owed protection will only be granted a further TPV or a SHEV, a safe haven enterprise visa. If they are found not to engage Australia's protection obligations, they will be required to leave.


Consistent with this government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa, the safe haven enterprise visa, will also be created by this bill. Again, it absolutely astounds me that people in this chamber, people who represent rural and regional communities in this country, would not be supportive of this new visa. The safe haven enterprise visa will be open to applications by those who have been processed under this legacy case load and who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. They will be an alternative to the TPV and will also encourage enterprise through learning and earning, which I think is wonderful.


Those granted a SHEV will work in designated regions, identified through a national self-nomination process. These visas will be valid for five years and, like the TPV, will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia because, again, that is another product for people smugglers to sell. Holders of these visas will be targeted to designated regions and encouraged to fill regional job vacancies, and will have access to the same support arrangements as a TPV holder, including Medicare, social security benefits and work rights.


In the last few months as a senator in this place and from my travels around regional Western Australia, I have had many conversations with growers and farmers who simply cannot find local people to do these jobs that keep their businesses, their farms and their horticultural industries going. Any opportunity like this to help growers and farmers across Australia find hardworking employees is something to be commended. Again, I cannot understand how anybody in this place would not think that is a good thing.


What happens to them after they have worked in regional Australia? If they have worked in regional Australia without requiring access to income support for 3½ years, they will be able to apply, if they meet eligibility requirements, to be granted other onshore visas—for example, family and skilled visas as well as temporary and skilled student visas. If a SHEV holder was to access government assistance to study for a degree, a diploma or a trade certificate in a designated regional area, this would not be classified as accessing social security benefits. However, holders of this visa will not be able to apply for a permanent protection visa. If a holder of a SHEV has relied on income support for more than 18 months during a five-year period, they will only be eligible to apply for another SHEV or a TPV, and this will only be granted if they are found to be engaging Australia's protection obligations. If they are not found to have engaged Australia's protection obligations, they will be required to leave the country.


Amendments in this bill to the Maritime Powers Act strengthen Australia's maritime enforcement framework and the ongoing conduct of border security and maritime enforcement activities. These amendments also reinforce the government's powers and support for Australian border protection officers conducting maritime operations to stop people-smuggling ventures at sea. Enforced turn-backs are a critical component of the government's suite of border protection measures and have been successful in stopping the boats, stopping people dying and putting people smugglers out of business. 


These measures affirm and strengthen our government's ability to continue with the successful cessation of boat arrivals in Australia. As someone with firsthand experience with border protection policies, I know the effectiveness of stopping the boats. They are not easy decisions. They are probably some of the hardest decisions that any government has to take, but they have to be made in the national interest and, I must say, in the interest of those who are thinking of putting their lives at risk by paying people smugglers, and now in the interest of the 30,000 illegal maritime arrivals whose lives will be held in limbo under the policies of this government for nearly seven years if this legislation does not go through.


The migration system as it stands promotes a one-size-fits-all approach to responding to other claims. The framework is inconsistent with the robust protection system that promotes efficiency and integrity. While efficiency and integrity are buzzwords used in government and in business, what that actually means for those 30,000 people is that they will have to wait for up to seven years in limbo, and that is not acceptable. Under this bill, a new process, the fast-track assessment process, will efficiently and effectively respond to unmeritorious claims for asylum and, it has to be pointed out, there are many unmeritorious claims for asylum just as there are many that are meritorious. This new fast-track assessment process will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with access to a new model of review—the Immigration Assessment Authority, known as the IAA. These measures are specifically aimed at addressing the current backlog of illegal maritime arrivals.


As we heard during our Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearings on this, 30,000 people are affected. Those who have meritorious claims will be afforded far better treatment under the provisions of this bill. However, it is the government's policy that, if fast-tracked applicants present unmeritorious claims or have protection elsewhere, their cases will be channelled towards a direct immigration outcome, rather than having them access the merits review process in order to prolong their stay in Australia. The measures in this bill will support a robust and timely process, which is, as I said, the humanitarian and the right process. It will better prioritise and assess claims, and afford a differentiated approach depending on the characteristics of the claims. Prompt removal of failed asylum seekers from Australia also supports the integrity of our protection program and reduces the likelihood of applicants deliberately frustrating and playing the system, and delaying removal plans.


The cost of the former Labor government's failures on our border over the last six years of government have been substantial in both humanitarian and financial terms. When looking at this bill and these measures, it is, I think, very important to go back and have a look at what they are designed to address. Labor and the Greens' failed border protection policies resulted in an environment where 50,000 people put their lives and their families' lives at risk by paying people smugglers, working through a pipeline of countries, to make this illegal journey. And why did they do it? Because those opposite deliberately, knowingly and with foresight implemented policies that drew them back to our country. Again, as I have said, I see no compassion in any government that would deliberately do that—not only deliberately bring them here in large numbers but put them into detention centres that were not ready and were not capable of looking after that many people. That is not compassion. That is not humane. Trying now to obstruct legislation that would deal with these 30,000 people in less than the seven years that their system would have taken—that is not the humane or right way to treat these 30,000 human beings.


As a consequence of the policies of those opposite, more than 14,800 have been waiting offshore in very desperate circumstances. Because of the policies of those opposite, they have been denied Australia's protection through humanitarian visas, as places were taken in our program by those illegal maritime arrivals who had paid to come here—many of whom had paid and sent their children on that journey so that the whole family could come in behind them. That is in no way a humanitarian or a responsible government approach.


To me, the most compassionate and humanitarian approach is to pass this legislation to give these 30,000 human beings a decision. If they are not going to stay, it is the right thing to do to tell them so they can get on with their lives elsewhere. If they are able to stay, we should provide them with visas so that they can work, study and raise their families here. That is the humanitarian way. Do not leave them in detention for up to seven years. That would be the consequence of not passing this bill, which I commend to the Senate.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:57):  In rising to support the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014, I support the comments of those who have come before me, particularly those of Senator Reynolds in the last few minutes. I will be urging, from a humanitarian point of view, everybody in the chamber to support this legislation. I do want to reflect initially, if I may, on why we are where we are, because I think it is important for people to have some understanding of the history of this issue.


We know that the previous coalition Prime Minister, Mr Howard, dealt with this issue. He of course made the statement that we, Australia, would decide who comes to our country and the circumstances under which they come. It was interesting for me, not long after I came here some six years ago, to hear a comment by the honourable Philip Ruddock, whom Mr Howard appointed as the immigration minister. Coming from his legal background, particularly associated with supporting those in need, one might have thought that Mr Ruddock's view would be very much along the lines of: 'What can we do to encourage more to come?' The interesting point he made was this: 'I came to the realisation that the best way of protecting these would-be asylum seekers who would come by sea under circumstances in which they are encouraged by people smugglers was to make sure that they didn't get on boats in the first place.' 


Philip Ruddock took the view that the safest position for those people was to make sure they were not put on old wooden leaky hulks, having paid significant, indeed scandalous, sums of money to people smugglers. So Ruddock went about the process of making sure that that took place. History of course records that that is what the Howard government achieved. At the time, the shadow minister  for immigration was Ms Gillard. Ms Gillard used to have a press release. The press release was headed: 'Another boat, another policy failure.' It got to the stage that her staff or their printers were not troubled by that media release, because they stopped when the vessels stopped.


I remember, before meeting Philip Ruddock—Senator Cash would recall as well—watching him being interviewed by a very aggressive BBC interviewer in London. This man was being highly critical and highly rude, and Philip Ruddock in his usual quiet way listened to this fellow for awhile and then said to him, 'Why are you attacking our country when you yourselves have exactly the problem that we did have?' He said, 'The only difference is we have addressed it and you haven't.'


Of course, when the Rudd government came into power, the first thing they did was dismantle the processes, practices, procedures and legislation that had stood the test of time with the Howard government. As one who had recently worked in and had businesses in Asia, on the subcontinent and in the Middle East, it became apparent to everybody that the message to the people smugglers was: 'We're back in business. We can put our sign up again because once again Australia is a weak target.' So what we saw in that time was the lamentable circumstance of tens of thousands of people paying hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively to people smugglers to get on leaking boats for the possibility of making it to Australia or to one of our offshore islands.


We know that in excess of 50,000 people got on those more than 800 boats. We know about 1,100 people—about one every second day that Labor was in government between 2007 and 2013 that we know about—were lost at sea. Why do I emphasise that point? I return to some discussions with our naval personnel with whom I had the pleasure and privilege of visiting at the Larrakeyah Barracks as part of Sovereign Borders in July of this year. For those in the gallery who may not be aware: we have this wonderful program between the parliamentarians and the Australian Defence Force where we—there are 14 of us each year—can participate in a program with our Defence Force personnel. We are given no privileges. We meet everybody from the cooks to the generals to the admirals. We have the opportunity to learn from them at the coalface what their activities are, where their challenges lie. For their sins the military officers come and spend a week with us in Parliament House in September or October.


A circumstance played out last night on national television. That was the stress to naval personnel who have been associated with the illegal-boat-led immigration programs over the last few years. The small amount of footage that I saw was distressing. But the point they made to me was they were sure there were well in excess of 1,100 people who would have been lost at sea. They are the ones that we know about. One can only be open in admiration of the work that those naval and related Army personnel do in protecting our borders but also in offering assistance to those who used to come. They were stressed out because of increased workload. The vessels were certainly stressed out because of increased workload.


But the worst thing of all for them was that recently our national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ran a line that our naval personnel had forced the hands of asylum seekers onto hot engine parts on those vessels. You had better have a clear understanding of their anger and their disappointment that such an allegation would be aired on a publicly funded national broadcasting service. I for one praised the Minister for Defence and others who drew attention to the scandalous allegation that was made and which has never been fully retracted, with a half-hearted apology from the head of the ABC.


Let's reflect on what has happened since Minister Morrison, ably assisted by his assistant minister, Michaelia Cash, took over responsibility for this portfolio. Since December last year—about this time—there has been one people smuggling venture, associated with 157 personnel. Only the one. Prior to that time, as we know, from September 2012 to September 2013—prior to us coming into government—there were no fewer than 401 such ventures, with 26½ thousand people on board.


I want to draw attention to the plight of genuine refugees—those who have gone through the process, those who have been found to actually be eligible for refugee status in this country who have been left floundering and rotting in refugee camps around the world as a result of the previous Labor government's policies. And why were they? Because Australia would accept a certain number per year. For each illegal immigrant—each illegally sourced asylum seeker who came—a genuine refugee then continued to rot with their families in refugee camps. I recall in Perth a young Sri Lankan fellow coming to see me, telling me that what was happening in these refugee camps was that, as a family got to the top of the list to come to Australia, unbeknownst to them, as a result of graft and corruption by management of some of these refugee camps, they never got to find out their names got to the top of the queue. Why? Because somebody came along with the inevitable brown paper bag, paid money, went to the top of the queue, came to Australia and had the deserving family continue to rot in such circumstances.


I was delighted to learn that the minister has indicated that we are now back to the stage of accepting some, I believe, 13,500 genuine refugees each year. On top of that, the people who will be the subject of this legislation are actually additional to those numbers. This is critically important—they are additional. So we will see again the flow of genuine refugees coming to this country under the conditions we have always approved and want to see in this place.


It is not just the direct cost—the $11 billion of cost—that the previous government ran up because they discontinued the policies of the Howard government that they inherited and that were working; it is what they then did when trying to account for some of those costs. The problem was compounded because they cut nearly 700 staff from the Customs service at a time when their duties were being increased as a result of not just illegal boat arrivals but also the burgeoning importation of drugs into this country. Only the other day we saw our border protection, customs, police and related services apprehend some $1.5 billion worth of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs. 


We do not for a minute think that we are getting all that is coming into this country, but when you cut the guts out of the customs and immigration service—when you take 700 competent people out—what does that do to the drug cartels? It has been put to me that the drug trade is so lucrative that they say to the drug mules and others in the trade, 'If you get apprehended, we will replace the product free of charge.' Those are the challenges we are facing. The number of sea cargo inspections under the Labor government decreased by 25 per cent and there has been a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo inspections, so the chances now of being apprehended if you bring something in by air are not high. These are some of the spin-offs that occur when you end up squandering $11 billion when you inherited a situation that was under control.


I now come to the circumstance of this legislation directly. Temporary protection visas do exactly as their name suggests. If somebody comes to this country and returning them to their country of origin would put them at risk, they will be provided with a temporary protection visa. Wonderful. Over time, as we know, the conditions that caused them to have to leave their country, if they were the genuine asylum purposes, may change or can be the subject of examination and inspection.


I think one of the fairest components of the legislation we are considering, and the one I urge my colleagues in this place to support, is the capacity for a person during the time they are under a temporary protection visa to be provided access to Medicare and social security benefits and allowed to work. A lot of people in our community do not agree with that. We get email traffic that says: 'Why is the Australian taxpayer providing Medicare services for these people? Why are we providing social security benefits?' There are a number of reasons: firstly, we are generous people; secondly, we want to try to minimise the adverse impacts on these people; and, thirdly, we want to give them the dignity that goes with the capacity to work. How terrible it must be, for whatever reason and in whatever circumstances, for a person who comes to this country to be left rotting and not be able to work because they were not processed by the previous government, which had no sense of generosity and no capacity for administration.


As a person from a rural and regional background I support the comments of my colleague Senator Reynolds with regard to work in rural and regional areas. At this very moment where fruit and other crops are being harvested we have a shortage of labour because Australians are unwilling to leave their towns and cities to avail themselves of this work. Fruit is not being picked and is rotting on trees and vines, and grain is not being harvested. Here we have a tremendous opportunity for these people.


The second element of Minister Morrison's legislation is the safe haven enterprise visa. This is a visa for a five-year period. If holders of these visas have worked in regional Australia without requiring income support for 3½ years and if they meet the eligibility requirements, they will be able to apply for other onshore visas—family, skilled, temporary skilled and student visas. What a fantastic opportunity. We all know from our own experiences how quickly those who came in post the Second World War from Southern Europe—Italians, Greeks and others—assimilated into our communities and how we benefited from their involvement. We then had the later wave during and after the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese who have come to this country have enriched this country with their diligence, their hard work and their desire to study and improve themselves, and of course they have changed our cuisine and our outlook on life.


Here under this legislation we are giving those people who will accept and be involved in the safe haven enterprise visa the chance, should they work for 3½ years—which is what they want to do; they do want to do the work that so many Australians do not seem to want to do—of family and skilled visas as well as temporary skilled and student visas. So they can set themselves up with sets of skills that indeed at the conclusion of that time they may well be able to take back to their country of origin, if indeed that is where they return, so that of course their lives and the lives of their children are enhanced into the future.


The legislation certainly requires a circumstance that people do make sure that they comply with Australia's rules and regulations. Perfectly, the Australian community would expect, that if a person on whatever form of these or whatever form of activity in this country, if they cannot comply with the rules of this country, if they cannot comply with reasonable legislation in this country, then they should be denied their right to continue here. I think that is an entirely reasonable circumstance.


Just in the last few minutes I do want to go back to the humanitarian activity and I do want to return to the topic briefly associated with our own military personnel. It is and has been an enormous burden. When we were in Darwin they actually asked us to put the clothing on that the personnel wear when they get into the rubber duckies to actually go to the vessel that they will be intercepting, remembering what temperatures would be like and humidity is like this time of the year. They will be in that equipment for six to eight hours, apprehensive, tentative, not knowing what they are going to meet when they arrive at the vessel. This is a pressure that they endure day after day. I for one want to say how pleased and proud I am of those people. I also want to say that this type of legislation will limit even more quickly and even more severely those who attempt—people smugglers—to bring people to this country illegally.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-12-03,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:17): Australia's migration policies have always had a long and vexed history. They have been, and rightfully so, open to significant scrutiny from international and domestic courts, independent experts, interest groups and the electorate. It has and will continue to be a passionate debate about a wicked and vexed issue. For me it is always important, always, to remember that we are dealing with legislation that relates to people, our fellow human beings. They are not numbers; they are not the myriad of labels that have been applied to them by all sides of the debate; and they are not political inconveniences, punching bags or props. They are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, friends, neighbours and acquaintances. They are, in short, people just like you and me who have found themselves in extraordinarily difficult circumstances—some, unimaginable circumstances. So I would like to approach this debate with respect, with compassion and with dignity. 


This has not been an easy process for me. On one side this bill does contain a number of measures that I am not comfortable with. But on the other side, if we do not act, the 30,000 people currently awaiting processing will continue to be left in limbo. If this bill does not pass there is also the real risk that the government will use a nonstatutory process instead, which will not result in any better outcomes for the people who are currently in Australia. This problem is a true Hobson's choice: we are left to decide between two potentially negative outcomes.


Back in 2012 the former government put up a number of proposals, the so-called Malaysia solution, which was rejected by the then opposition and the Australian Greens. I remember at the time—I remember well—I was in hospital and I asked for my vote to be recorded. There is a saying: 'Not to have the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.' As imperfect as the former government's solution was, it was preferable to doing nothing. We saw more and more drownings, more and more people pass away, and more and more people fall victim to people smugglers and the awful consequences of that.


What is being proposed by the government here is by no means perfect—in fact, it is quite imperfect—but the consequences of not supporting it will mean that asylum seekers will be in a worse position, in my view. It also has to be noted what the immigration minister said a few moments ago. He has agreed, as part of a process of constructive engagement with crossbenchers, to increase the humanitarian intake by 7,500 people—a significant increase. My view is that we should double the humanitarian intake or more. We are a big country with a big heart. But I am trying to deal with the actual political realities here. We have an opportunity to increase significantly the humanitarian and refugee intake by 7,500 people on top of the 30,750 per annum. We have an opportunity to have something like 25,000 people on bridging visas have work rights for the first time. We have an opportunity to significantly improve the lot of those individuals who have been left in limbo. The reality is that under the former government border control, immigration policy, was out of control, and that is something we need to take into account.


I have met with many interest groups and representatives, including Amnesty International and also Paris Aristotle of Foundation House and the former government's expert panel. My view on this issue changed when I saw what Angus Houston, Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange said in that expert panel. I congratulate former Prime Minister Gillard for having the foresight to set up that panel—to actually have a circuit breaker to try to look at this in a different way, because to me it meant that we needed to consider the awful moral dilemmas that we had to deal with. I thought the panel headed by Angus Houston came up with a number of sensible proposals.


In that context, I have approached the government to request changes to the bill and to migration policy to improve the conditions for the men, women and children who are awaiting processing. That doesn't mean that we cannot still advocate for a significant increase in the humanitarian intake. It does not mean that we stop being critical of the government's policies, but if we do nothing, if we do not support this bill, then I believe fervently that what will happen is that asylum seekers will be worse off if this bill is not passed, as imperfect as this bill is. That is the moral dilemma; that is the wicked problem. 


I want to make it clear that my vote for this bill is conditional on these changes and those circulated by the Palmer United Party. The government has taken my concerns into account and, I understand, will be circulating amendments to that effect. As such, I will not speak to those amendments in detail, but I would like to take this opportunity to outline the changes that I have proposed. I also want to make it very clear that these proposals do not necessarily represent my ideal outcomes. They do not, but they do make important steps forward—and I do not believe they should be rejected because they are only 'good' rather than 'perfect'.


Firstly, I have proposed changes to allow people holding TPVs or SHEVs to travel outside Australia where the minister is satisfied there are compassionate or compelling circumstances and the minister has approved that travel. That has never occurred before, either under this government or under the previous government, and I think that is an important concession. This would cover circumstances where a TPV or SHEV holder wants to travel to visit family in circumstances such as significant family illness or death. While I would prefer to allow family reunification on these visas, I believe this is an important step in granting these visa holders rights that go some way towards acknowledging the importance of family. 


Secondly, I have proposed changes to ensure that, through the use of a disallowable instrument, the fast-track process only applies to the legacy caseload. This will make sure that the use of this fast-track process will be subject to the scrutiny of the Senate. Thirdly, I have proposed changes to the definition of 'manifestly unfair' in relation to the rejection of claims so that it more accurately reflects language used by the UNHCR—and that is important. I think that is a benchmark that we need to look at very carefully. 


Fourthly, I have proposed some changes to the fast-track review process to ensure that it is not only efficient and quick but must meet the natural justice provisions already included in the Migration Act. This will help to ensure that decisions take natural justice into account within the confines of the act and so are more balanced and fair. I have also proposed changes to the requirement for the review to take new information into account. My specific intention in this case is to ensure that information that was not provided for personal reasons, including mental health reasons, can be taken into account. One example that has been put to me are the many cases of sexual or other assault, where the victim may not volunteer that information in the first instance. I think all of us can appreciate the reasons behind not sharing that information—the shame and the trauma that may prevent someone from speaking out. My proposal to the government was that this type of information and these circumstances must be taken into account, and I believe these changes will improve the review process in that regard. 


Fifthly, I have raised concerns relating to the non-refoulement provisions and how we can be sure that a person being returned to a country is not facing persecution. In this case the government has agreed to use phrasing similar to that of the UNHCR to define both when a person is considered to be part of a particular social group and what effective protection measures should be taken into account when considering if that person should be returned. I believe these definitions will bring Australia more in line with UNHCR best practice in terms of defining and applying these clauses. 


Further, I have advocated, as have others, for an increase in Australia's humanitarian intake and to extend work rights to people on bridging visas. I have always been a strong advocate of increasing our humanitarian intake. I believe the government could go further, but I do acknowledge the increase they have proposed will make a real difference—7½ thousand people. That is 7½ thousand people who can be taken in through that humanitarian and refugee intake and who can be part of our community. I do not want to throw that away. That does not mean that my colleagues in the Australian Greens or the opposition cannot say that we should double it—I think we should—or that we should have a much bigger humanitarian intake, a much bigger refugee intake. It could be an issue at the next election. I do not have an issue with that—it ought to be. But I do not want to throw away this opportunity to have 7½ thousand more people come in to this country through that humanitarian and refugee intake process.


Extending work rights to those on bridging visas is also vitally important. Participating in the workforce, even in a small way, makes people a part of our community and society. It gives them, quite simply, a reason to get up in the morning—to feel valued and that they are making a contribution. I do not want to pretend that any of these measures is an ideal outcome or that they represent what I would see happen in the perfect world. But they will make a true difference to the people who are here right now, who are in detention right now, who are waiting to be processed right now. This may not be perfect, but it is good. It is also important to remember that this is not the end of the debate. These measures do not mean that I, as many others, will stop pushing for improvements. They are merely the next step, not the final one, and I would urge my colleagues to support this bill.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-12-03,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:27):  The Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 makes significant changes to the way asylum seekers in this country are processed. With amendments, the bill is even more complex than without. The bill will do many things, not least of which is the bringing back of TPVs. As I understand it, the government will not back down on their view in support of TPVs, and I have a problem in backing down on my view against them. As such, I think we are, at this point in time, possibly at a stalemate. 


But I want people to be crystal clear that I genuinely want to find the solution to the problem of asylum seekers and what they are experiencing. Having visited Villawood and Broadmeadows on a number of occasions, I know that these people wish to have some surety in their lives. I also know that many of them will be found to be genuine refugees and that there will be some who will be found, ultimately, not to be genuine. I personally think the whole debate has become so polarised. I am not casting aspersions on anybody's motivations here but just asking people to remember that we are all going to go home at the end of this week. We are all going to be with our families 


We all know where we are going, so to speak. The issue of asylum seekers, the issue of dealing with compassion and dignity, the issue of addressing the concerns of people in the wider Australian community have to be treaty logically and with respect. There are many moving parts to this machine but in the end it is about people and you cannot commodify people. They are not numbers; they are people. At this point, I cannot support the government's legislation as it stands, but I acknowledge the work of Senator Xenophon. There are a lot of people in this place who are looking for a genuine and a just outcome.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2014-12-03,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (12:30):  This is the first time in this place I have had the opportunity to speak on any refugee or immigration matters. At the outset, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments put on the record by Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan. We do have a moral obligation to do what we can to accept people who are in unfortunate positions, who do not have the grace and benefit of being born in the safe and democratic nation in which we were born. We try to do the best in the world, as we do in our own lives, to help as many people as we can. I know often I personally fall down in not giving charity to as many fellow Australians as perhaps I should from time to time. Likewise, as a nation I am sure we can do more from time to time, we but we cannot do everything. The problem of refugees or displaced people has existed for as long as human history itself, going right back to biblical times. As a small nation at one end of the Pacific, we simply cannot fix that problem. We can, however, contribute to helping a not insubstantial number of people to relocate to a new nation, to make a new life, and to give them the opportunity to escape from threats to their life and liberty.


Through my own experiences, although I have not had a lot to do with refugee issues, I have from time to time been in contact with the Hazara community in Brisbane. They are great Australians who have come to this nation in the last decade or so, have found work and made themselves a family, and have taken advantage of the great Australian dream which we offer to everyone who is born here. It is a fantastic thing we can also offer to people from all around the world.


We try to take in around 13,500 refugees a year, which is a high proportion of the population relative to other nations' takes. It is something I fully support. In the past few years, that intake has been breached largely through unauthorised arrivals by boat. While I support an open and welcoming refugee policy where we do not control who is coming to this nation, I have great concern that those refugee places are not necessarily going to the people most in need across the world. They go to the people most able to afford to get on a boat or have access to places like Indonesia where they can take advantage of people-smuggling activities. 


There certainly needs to be a change in policy and a recalibration of where we are at. This bill deals with the legacy of policies which have contributed to the fact that we have 30,000 people in migration limbo at the moment, people who came here in an unauthorised way, and we have no real system to process those individuals.


As I said, I think we have a moral obligation to help people. We do not have a moral obligation because we have signed international treaties or because other people tell us we should act in that way; we have that obligation because we are human beings, just as these people are human beings and we should try our best to make their lives better if we can. The changes we are making in this bill have the potential to improve the lives of the 30,000 people. I know others in this chamber do not support temporary protection visas, but I think they are a reasonable compromise between ensuring people have asylum from threats which might impact them in their home countries, while recognising that we cannot help everyone in that situation. 


Over time, if the temporary protection visa system works well, we could help more people than we could if we were to offer permanent asylum because there is a limit to the number of people we can take. While I believe we have the obligation to provide people with asylum, it does not extend to say that we have to provide them with permanent residence, only that they should be granted asylum in the period when they need asylum. If circumstances change in their home countries, I see no abrogation of our responsibilities if we ask them to return to their home country when the situation improves. In fact, in my view we do the home countries a disservice if we do not encourage people to go home in those circumstances. We have been involved in fighting a long and hard war in Afghanistan. While I see the need for the Hazara to have asylum, hopefully in the long  term Afghanistan will find a  modicum of peace and security and the Hazara people will be integral to building peace and stability in that nation. If all we do is take the good people out of a nation and provide them with asylum, then those other countries will be denuded of those good people and will struggle to rebuild their own nations and to fight against evil and tyranny that sometimes, unfortunately, temporarily succeeds in other countries. 


Providing temporary protection is, to me, quite consistent with our obligations, and a temporary protection visa has always seemed to me to be a reasonable and proportionate response to this very difficult issue. Of course, the policy changes I flagged earlier have made a marked difference in the number of boat arrivals in this country. There has been only one people-smuggling venture that has successfully arrived in Australian waters since 19 December 2013—almost a year ago—and with only 157 people. That compares with the 50,000 or so that arrived here under the former government, and that has meant that we have a backlog of 30,000 people in asylum right now. 


The government went to an election last year with a clear policy—indeed it has been to the last two elections with a clear policy—to implement changes to our refugee program. The changes have included a program of turning back boats where it is safe to do so, reopening the facilities on Nauru and Manus Island—which the former government did take steps to do before the election—and, of course, the reintroducing temporary protection visas. I think there was a very clear mandate at the last election and widespread support for those policies, and some components have been successfully implemented by the government and have clearly had an impact. As I said earlier, I recognise the concerns of other senators about temporary protection visas, but it seems to me to be a reasonable compromise in this very fraught debate and I would hope that particularly those senators who come from an independent or crossbench perspective will look closely at this compromise and consider it to be a reasonable alternative.


I want to give credit to some of the crossbench and government senators who have introduced a new element to this program. I think that the safe haven enterprise visa, as it has been called, is an extremely innovative and welcome development. We have other visas in this nation which are very beneficial to rural and regional areas; indeed, some of our farms, meatworks and agricultural enterprises would not survive without 457 visas or 417 visas, the holiday visa program. These are essential to providing a workforce for industries in so many areas where unemployment is high. Unfortunately, many Australians do not want to go and pick fruit at a farm, pick grapes in St George or cut down 14-kilogram banana trunks in Innisfail or Tully, and we do rely on getting people from other nations to sustain those industries and farming activities. The enterprise visa will add another menu item to those visas which I think would be quite beneficial. People among those 30,000 who are in that backlog who want to gain access to work can move to an area of need—although I recognise that any area can be designated a region, my understanding is that the government will seek to ensure that those regions are in need of employment and are designated accordingly. People could apply to get a safe haven enterprise visa and move to these areas to add a new source of dynamism and diversity to regions of Australia which need workers, and it would allow these people to get on with their lives and earn some money for their families so that they can afford all the things that we in this chamber, I am sure, are very lucky to be able to afford.


The safe haven enterprise visas would be temporary in nature but my understanding is that after 3½ years on those visas people would be able to apply to be granted other onshore visas, including family-related visas which would not normally be allowed under TPVs generally. This will provide those people in this queue with hope for a better life. If we pass this bill today, it will provide 30,000 people who are somewhere on our territory, or territory that we have contracted for in Pacific nations, to have a hope for a better life. They can get some form of visa right now. They can apply for rights to work and to provide for their families, and if they prove themselves to tick all the right boxes while undertaking those activities, working and paying taxes, they will be able to become fully-fledged Australians. I think that is a great thing, and I am surprised that it is all that controversial in this place. Why wouldn't we want to give some portion of these 30,000 people hope for a better life? That is what this bill will do.


The government is of a view that a one size fits all approach is not appropriate to this problem because it limits our ability to address and remove unmeritorious claims and diverts resources away from individuals who have more complex claims. This bill will introduce a fast-track assessment process that will efficiently and effectively respond to claims that are deemed to have no merit and will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with a new model of review—the immigration assessment authority, known as the IAA. These changes are consistent with the other issues that have been raised with respect to the surge in boat arrivals that have occurred in the last few years that has, in my view, given priority to people who perhaps are not as much in need as those who are waiting in camps—those who are in a queue, so to speak—waiting to get to a nation of asylum, whether it be Australia or another country. 


Our review processes likewise have been blocked and unnecessarily diverted from dealing with claims that are of more merit by those that would seek to abuse processes. However, I completely understand why people might want to do that. I must say, if my family were living in Iran or another nation, I would try to do everything I could to get my family out and to a better life. As I said at the start, we cannot do everything. That does not mean we do nothing but we need to do something that we can do, and we need to do it in the best possible we can, given the scarce resources and the constraints that we have as a nation, and it needs to be consistent with our obligations in this place. This bill does that. It gives people better opportunities and it should be supported by this chamber.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I would like to talk today about something which should concern all governments of all persuasions in the Western World and all their constituents. Can I just start by outlining what we see for the future: by 2050, there will be nine billion people on the planet, and 50 per cent of them will be poor for water. Ninety-seven per cent of the world's water is actually sea water; three per cent of the world's water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tied up permanently in snow and ice. Two-thirds of the world's population by 2050 will be living in the Asian area; 30 per cent of their productive capacity will be gone; about 1.6 billion people on the planet will possibly be displaced. That is the challenge for the planet. 


The challenge for the human race of course is the low intake of antibiotics in the food chain—and bacterial resistance—the great challenge for feeding humanity. We do not have a solution to the global food task. By 2070, barring human catastrophe—there is always that caveat—there will be 12 billion people on the planet. China itself will have close to two billion people and will have to have an organisational concept to feed half their people from someone else's resources. 


The next great challenge for the Western world and the world to which we have become accustomed in its sovereignty is capturing the revenue base, which is really where I want to go today. I have to say that we are not even noticing the cost that we are going through and the revenue leakage we are going through. We are taking it for granted that 'she'll be right', whether it is paying for the ABC or paying for whatever governments expect—schools and public hospitals—although there are some exceptions to that. Senator Leyonhjelm does not think we should have public schools and public hospitals. I happen to think we should. We are not even noticing revenue leakage. 


Last year the World Bank estimated we missed out on about $3 trillion involved in revenue leakage in the G20, which is mainly the Group of Eight nations. And most of that is through derivative swaps and transfer pricing. The derivate swap market was about $700 trillion. The shadow banking market is 69 per cent of China's banking. And you wonder why they don’t put the currency on the market! These are serious issues which the electorate needs to be informed of, because what we should be doing—whoever is in government should be doing it—is modelling where we have come from in the last 20 years and modelling where we are going in 20 years time if we do not change the law to catch up with the times in capturing our revenue base. 


The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 is completely out of date. It does not deal with how we capture revenue from sovereign investors. It needs to be redefined globally. Why does the Future Fund—and I noticed Peter Costello the other day saying 'Oops! Why would the Future Fund want 14 and now 17 companies in tax havens?' It is because they do not want to pay tax where countries still charge sovereign investors tax. Australia does not. A passive sovereign investor coming into Australia does not pay tax. A passive investor investing in investment and production in Australia, if they declare that production for humanitarian purposes, gets charitable status, for God's sake! So we have some serious issues. 


Ninety per cent of the world's economy is involved in G20 and the OECD countries. As a group of nations we should solve this, unless we want to be the generation that redefined sovereignty. I went to a bitcoin inquiry the other day and was just amazed that the people promoting it could not tell me whether it was defined as a commodity or a currency—and that included people on the phone from the US and the UK and some bright young people from Australia. Yet it is trading. To me, it aids and abets revenue leakage, so there is tax avoidance. 


I absolutely think that we have to come to terms with this. Last year the turnover of the shadow banking world was about $120 trillion, which is 1¼ times the global GDP. These are challenges that most people do not want to talk about. I noticed the US corporate world responded the other day—and congratulations to the government on their G20 approach and putting revenue leakage on the agenda—by saying, 'we don't think it's such a crime to have all this revenue leakage going overseas because they are creating jobs here'. That is alright if you do not want to have schools and hospitals and they leave you in the gutter if you get sick. But the US last year estimated they missed out on between $650 billion and $800 billion in tax that was avoided. In fact the largest anti tax-avoidance case last financial year was with an Australian identified company. 


So I think it is time that we in the parliament took a responsible stand. There is an inquiry—I think there ought to be a select committee that looks at this—to model where we have come from and the things we have taken for granted. These people are not breaking the law; the law is out of date. We need to model where are we going to finish up. 


If you want to finish up like southern Europe—or Greece or somewhere where they do not collect their taxes and they have no enforcement regime. The euro is the common currency—and southern Europe goes to sleep after lunch and northern Europe goes back to work—and they think the currency should be commonly denominated. These things need to be thought through. 


I am concerned about the legal point-scoring that is occurring in Australia with things like whether we should have a $7 Medicare co-payment or not. All of these things are well and good to be debated politically but, if we do not solve the issue of having the revenue to pay for the expectations of the electorate, we are wasting our time. 


Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table a document, which I have notified the government and the opposition about. 


Leave granted. 




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  Thank you. This document is an article from 21 November 2014 in the Australian Doctor. Lots of people would find it difficult to come to terms with a $7 co-payment; obviously lots of people could pay it. A packet of cigarettes is more, but not everyone smokes and not everyone buys a coffee every day. But there are places we can save money. Besides capturing our revenue base—and this is a serious problem which is going to redefine sovereignty if we do not fix it. There was $3 trillion in tax avoidance globally last year. This article points to where we could save some money:


The Professional Services Review said it was concerned about high-end claimers, including one GP working in a large suburban practice who drew up more than 400 management plans, 400 team care arrangements and then billed for 1,300 reviews in the space of 12 months.


This is where the doctor gets $250 to fill out a little form and send you down the road to have a care plan done for you.


On review of a sample of this practitioners plans, we noted little evidence of input from anyone other than the practice nurse.


I will go further into the article.


In another case investigated by the PSR, a GP generated $600,000 in Medicare billings during his first seven months practising in Australia.


That is $30,000 a week just billing Medicare—I do not how you would see the patients and think you were taking care of them.


We should put the politics aside. If we want to keep Australia the best place in the world to raise a family, to breathe fresh air and to drink clean water, for God's sake, let's get the politics out of the road. Let us not worry about what tomorrow's headline says or what the next election is going to be about. Let's look at what where we are going to be in 15 or 20 years' time as a nation. I do not want to be blamed for living through a period when our sovereignty was redefined because we did not allow the law to catch up with technology. When the present Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act was written in 1975, we were just barely past the telegram era—and a lot of our laws were written when it took six weeks for the Australian cricket team to go to England by ship. We really need to understand that we need to redefine where we are in the world if we are to maintain our sovereignty.


Last year, the World Bank said there was about $1 trillion involved in bribes. You can get a signature on anything you like in Asia, as long as you find the right person to pay the bribe to. And the cost of those bribes—that is, the corruption that followed —was five per cent of global GDP. These are serious issues. It is a given these days that, to compete in the market, the big companies take as a given that they will pay little or no tax.


The average punter and certainly people listening to this—if there is anyone—would not know the derivative swap market. The derivative swap market is a serious deal as is the challenge of coming to terms with the bitcoin market, which will aid and abet tax avoidance, transfer, profits, drug laundering et cetera. So the great challenge for Australia—it does not matter who is in government—is to capture our revenue base. Let's first find out what is going wrong with what we are doing.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Johnston) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


It really is quite interesting to watch a ministerial career disintegrating before our eyes. We have a minister in Senator Johnston who does not have the confidence of his Prime Minister, who does not have the confidence of the Australian public, who does not have the confidence of his own backbench. This is a minister who is incompetent and cannot deliver in the interests of Australia's defence priorities. 


And it is not just the opposition senators that are saying this. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, drew to our attention, the South Australian parliament has unanimously passed a resolution condemning Senator Johnston. I want to read what the South Australian parliament says. This is Independents, Labor, Liberal—it is all parties in that House. It says that the Premier will move that the South Australian Parliament: '(a) condemns the remarks of the Commonwealth Minister for Defence that he would ""not trust the Australian Submarine Corporation to build a canoe"", (b) reaffirms its support for ASC workers and all other South Australians employed in the defence industry, (c) demands that the Abbott Liberal government upholds its election commitment to build the 12 future submarines in Adelaide, and (d) notes that Australians should have the right to trust the word of their leaders when it comes to decisions that affect the national security of this country.' Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to table the resolution of the South Australian parliament.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted?




Senator Abetz:
  No.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is not granted.




Senator Abetz:
  Incompetence again.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Abetz, from the sidelines, talks about incompetence. If anyone has seen incompetence, it is the ministerial team in this chamber. The most incompetent has been Senator Johnston. Only a whisker behind him is Senator Abetz, who has delivered on absolutely nothing that he promised before the election. That is the nature of this coalition: promise much, deliver nothing, and just lie to the Australian public. It is about lying to the Australian public. That resolution has been passed by all parties in the South Australian parliament. It goes to the issue of lies. It goes to the issue of trust. 


And when Senator Johnston made that infamous remark about honest, hardworking, highly skilled Australians not being able to build a canoe, he sat there thinking he had done a great thing—that it was fantastic. He sat smirking, he sat laughing and he was full of arrogance. But the look of horror behind him was good to see because people knew that this was an issue that South Australians held dearly. They want a defence industry in South Australia and this incompetent minister has not delivered despite giving a promise to South Australians that the submarines would be built in South Australia.


This is a government that has come to power based on lies. This is a government that cannot be trusted. This is a government that is incompetent. And this is a government that contains members and senators from South Australia that do not have any backbone, that do not have any capacity to stand up for their own state. They will not stand up for the Australian defence industry, they will not stand up for the families in South Australia, they will not stand up for the skills and they will not stand up for the capacity of the industry in South Australia. They are weak kneed, they are jelly backed and they are incompetent. Where are the people standing up in South Australia for jobs in South Australia? It is not the weak kneed South Australians senators in this place. This minister should go.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:08):  What an intemperate pile of drivel. This debate is squarely aimed at trying to vilify a person who is scrambling to fill a void which you left. Senator Cameron comes in here and talks about the activities of this government when he, while sitting around on the fringes of the Labor reign of power, did nothing. Let us look at the record of those opposite. The then leader, Kevin Rudd said we will build these submarines at the ASC in about 2017. Now that is not far from here. So what did those opposite do? Did they sign a contract? Did they go out and look for procurement? No. In the 2010 campaign they told us, 'We promise to build the submarines at ASC in Adelaide.' What did they do? Did they go out and ask for contracts? No, they did nothing.


Do you know what those opposite did in the lead-up to the 2013 election? Mr Shorten, in the lead-up to the 2013 election, did not promise anything. Those opposite did not even have a defence policy. They got sick of promising it. They did not mention the 'submarine' word. They just ran out of puff. Actually, they ran out of money. Do you know what was going on? At the heart of the issue was the competence of that government.


Those opposite seem quite shrill over there. I see Senator Cameron has left the chamber. He needs to be reminded of why those opposite did not commit to submarine builds—they ran out of other people's money. They ran out of taxpayers' money. That is why they did not build them. There was $19.6 billion pulled out of that budget and those opposite sit there after 12 months of us being in power saying 'if you are going to build them, build them here'. How extraordinary. The people listening to this—




Senator Lines:
  How extraordinary to want to build something in Australia.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, you had better check with the attendants: I am not sure but I think there might be a seagull in the chamber somewhere. The $16 billion is what happened—the lowest levels of spending on defence since 1938. It was incompetence writ large. In 2012-13, Labor made the largest single cut to the defence budget since the end of the Korean conflict. Labor cut 10.5 per cent more from the budget. On Labor's watch, the Australian defence industry shed more than 10 per cent of its workforce because of budget cuts and deferrals.


How was the record of those opposite on open tenders? Out of 77-odd, I think there were about 70 that never got put out for open tender. As those opposite know over there, I am an advocate for an open tender on this program. Do you know why? Because it is the single biggest defence infrastructure project in this nation's history. And who is doing it? We are. What did those opposite do? Zero, nothing. And how shrill they sound. They ran out of money.


Those opposite do not even know how to manage money because they never have. All they have ever had to do is give their union dues and look after their numbers at their next preselection, and that is the only counting they have ever done. They have never had a bank manager. There are a couple of you over there on the other side, I must give you your due, that have run a business. But the only counting those opposite have ever done is vote to get elected to this place. That is what happens.


We are getting about and doing what we have to do to bring this project back into order to address the essential security of this country. It is so important to our front-line defence. What did those opposite do with it? Nothing. We are doing something about it and we are doing it now.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:14):  I acknowledge the contribution of my good friend Senator Edwards from South Australia, who has been working with us quite closely on the reports our committee has been doing on the future of Australian shipbuilding. I note that he is saying a very different thing in this chamber than what he said when he was out there talking to the South Australia media.


It is time for the defence minister to go. Uniformed members of the ADF say it is time for him to go. His former long-serving staff say that it is time for him to go. The party backbench says it is time for him to go. And today we learned that the assistant minister says that David Johnston is already gone. The Financial Review scuttlebutts have duly reported a tip-off today that Assistant Minister for Defence, Stuart Robert, described Johnston as 'a goner' within earshot of everyone in business class on a Virgin flight out of Canberra last week. He did not even feel the need to bother to whisper it.


Also speaking up for everyone to hear is Johnston's former staffer, Russell Stranger. After more than a dozen years of service as a senior adviser, Mr Stranger has unloaded on his former boss, who he now describes as 'toothless' and 'incidental'. Mr Stranger has spent 12 years propping up the senator from WA, but the Australian people have taken less than 12 months to figure out that this minister is a dud. Certainly, the Prime Minister knows his minister needs to go. In Russell Stranger's words:


Senator Johnston has been relegated by the Prime Minister’s office to a role as an incidental minister …


This is from a man who knows Senator Johnston only too well.


Senator Johnston is a sheep in sheep's clothing. By his own admission, he has nothing to add. When asked by the press why he skipped a National Security Committee meeting in October he replied:


I wasn’t going to add too much …


These are the senator's own words. I could not agree with Senator Johnston more!


But the defence minister's word is not always reliable. No, we must never take him at his word. We cannot take this government, that will go down in history for its falsehoods and as led by a Prime Minister who has repeatedly told mistruths to Australia, at its word. Senator Johnston was also less than truthful when he promised to build submarines in Adelaide.


Senator Johnston is not just an accident waiting to happen; he is an accident that will not stop happening. In this place almost exactly one week ago, his slur against the men and women of the ASC left his own party members dazed and confused. He knows the Liberal Party senators from South Australia, be they Senator Birmingham, Senator Edwards, Senator Fawcett or Senator Ruston, have spoken out against the proposals that he has been floating.


Senator Johnston's own pay deal for our defence forces on the eve of Christmas holidays has shown us just how poorly he values the work of our uniformed personnel. Today, he tried to claim again during question time that he has a great relationship with our defence forces. But, Mr Deputy President, can you imagine how embarrassed they must be by his bumbling, mumbling and stumbling? Prime Minister Tony Abbott will not even stand beside Senator Johnston. Last week, the Prime Minister was spotted in his courtyard on Monday, rubbing his hands and begging for forgiveness, with his own defence minister nowhere to be seen. We say: enough! Bring this sad mess to a sad end. What on earth is Senator Johnston waiting for? Christmas? The New Year? Another crisis? It is simply time for him to go.


The soldiers, the sailors, the airmen and the civilians who toil to keep us safe every day—these men and women deserve better. I say to the Prime Minister: it is time to take action on Senator Johnston. Listen to your own backbenchers who think it is time for him to go. Listen to the uniformed members of the ADF who think it is time for him to go. Listen to Senator Johnston's former staff who clearly think it is time for him to go. The assistant minister said it loud enough for everyone in business class to hear last week, that he is a goner. Nobody deserves Senator Johnston, not even Tony Abbott.




Senator Abetz:
  That is 'Mr Abbott' to you!

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-12-03,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:19):  I am sure that the former speaker was referring to the Prime Minister, 'Mr' Abbott when he shut down his so-called words of wisdom.


I find it amazing that those opposite are making a big political issue out of the building of the submarines. The first question you ask is: what did the Labor Party do for the construction of submarines in the six years they were in government? The answer is very simple—




Senator Abetz:
  Nothing!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Senator Abetz, I will take your interjection! Of course, the answer is simple: 'nothing'. Nothing at all. Hang on—we actually got that wrong. They did one thing: they talked about it.




Senator Abetz:
  They announced it!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Like many things, they made announcements. But, of course, actions speak louder than words, and they never did a thing as far as improving our Defence Force to keep our nation safe and secure.


The hysteria of the Labor Party on this issue must end. They must put national security ahead of supporting their union mates. The government's approach to acquire the submarines follows exactly the same process as that in place for all major defence projects since the 2003 Kinnaird reforms to defence procurement. This process has been used by previous governments, and was the same process that was going to be used by Labor if they ever got around to making any decisions.


We will follow due process. There will be a thorough, two-pass cabinet process and we will receive advice from our defence chiefs and procurement experts to ensure we get the very best capability at the best value for taxpayer dollars.


It is amazing that under Labor, $16 billion was cut from defence—$16 billion: a fact. The share of GDP spent on defence had fallen to 1.56 per cent, its lowest level since 1938. That is absolutely disgusting! How could the previous Labor government treat our Defence Force with such disdain; to cut, cut and cut and now leave us in the situation of the lowest percentage of GDP since 1938? This was just prior to World War II, of course! That is what our predecessors did to our Defence Force.




Senator Edwards:
  And we're fixing it!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  That is exactly right—I will take your interjection, Senator Edwards. We are out there to fix their mess. That is a thing that we have to do all the time: fix their mess—especially the financial mess they left us in, as they have done for all of my life. Ever since I left school at the end of 1972, whenever there is a Labor government and then they are thrown out of government, how are the books? The books are terrible! How is the bank account? The bank account is empty! How is the overdraft? The overdraft is bigger!


That is the history right throughout of Labor governments' management of money, whether it be at a state level—from Victoria to South Australia to New South Wales to Western Australia to Tasmania—or a federal level. The Hawke-Keating government left $96 billion of debt at the end of their era in 1996. Who cleaned up the mess? The coalition government of course, under John Howard as Prime Minister and Peter Costello as Treasurer. The challenge we have now is to clean up your financial mess—almost $350 billion of debt as of last Friday—and here we are trying to put our budget back together so that we have money to spend on very important issues like defence, but you will not help us to get our budget in order.




Senator Dastyari:
  What about paid parental leave?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Even $5 billion of savings that you were going to put forward, Senator Dastyari—through you, Mr Deputy President—you now oppose. You oppose your own savings! How ironic is that? How hypocritical is that? You are here to obstruct. I will tell you now: if the budget is not brought into order it will lead to one thing down the road; in five, 10 or 15 years' times it will lead to higher taxes. As the debt goes up and the interest bill goes up, higher taxes will be inevitable.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Do you think taxes might rise in 15 years?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  When we hit the brick wall of debt, Senator Carr, because of the actions of people like you—you are content to mortgage our grandchildren's futures away without any concerns about their financial situation—we will look back and we will look on you as the money wreckers who blocked our savings to get the budget in order. That is the most important thing, getting the budget in order so that we can afford to have a proper, secure Defence Force with modern equipment. But, no, you over there are just out to wreck the budget. It is in your DNA. It is as simple as that. A Labor government means budget mess. As I said, it has happened all my life. And here is a case of you crying poor, crying crocodile tears for the Defence Force, when history proves you made an absolute mess of our Australian Defence Force. You should be ashamed of yourselves. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:24):  It is hard to know where to start. Let me begin by refuting this rubbish from across the chamber about the budget crisis. Everything they have done, every bad decision they have made has been constructed around this falsehood that there is some kind of budget crisis. There is not. We have debt that we can manage, and we have debt that we can manage because we created a stimulus package to make sure jobs were not lost during the global financial crisis. What the Liberal Party and the coalition government cannot cope with is that we were enormously successful in achieving our goals and now we find ourselves in here being lectured to by people peddling misinformation about the state of the budget. 


On the back of that, they have constructed a budget which cuts the heart out of so many things that Australians value, so many things that Australians understand form part of what it is to live in a society that is both civil and fair. One of the things that is civil and fair about Australian society is that we value the work of our public servants in general terms, and yet what they are getting from this government is a blanket cut to a basic wage increase that covers their cost-of-living expenses—the CPI. What we know from this government, and I would like to refer to a statement put out by my colleagues, is that the Prime Minister stated in parliament last week:




I can assure members opposite that no-one in the public sector will be


getting a better deal th
an our Defence Force personnel … 



What that tells me is this government are prepared to do a despicable thing, such as withholding budgeted wage increases for our ADF, so that they can justify holding back, unfairly, Commonwealth public servants' wage increases. There is a pattern of behaviour here, and it is appalling. I know, as its representative, that the ACT probably has the highest ratio of both Defence Force personnel and Commonwealth public servants. And I know that these people were both outraged and shattered, if they were in fact Liberal Party supporters, because they did not expect such appalling treatment from the party that they voted for.


In relation to the Defence Force wage increase, we heard today that Minister Johnston is going to pursue the activities in relation to his junior minister, who was apparently incredibly dismissive and rude to the petitioners who went to him to express their outrage regarding the Defence Force wage cut. I am pleased to hear the minister is going to pursue this—or at least he said he would—and provide some kind of retribution for the petitioners who basically came out of that meeting and said about the government, and I quoted this during question time, that it was 'arrogant, ill-informed and self-centred'. This is not language used very often by petitioners trying to lobby a government or advocate for a certain point of view. It is an extremely harsh criticism, but I think it is a fair criticism, of a government that has lost its way.


Today, we have seen a long list of things that the defence minister and the Abbott government need to address. The Defence Force pay issue is a critical one. I do not believe that concessions delivered in relation to the Christmas allowances go far enough in any way to resolve the complaint of the Defence Force. Everybody needs to have a living wage. As I have said in this place previously, to attack our Defence Force personnel in the way that they have with this unfair wage cut, despite a previously budgeted full wage increase, is one of the most disappointing and disturbing features of this government's decision-making to date.


Finally, I would like to draw people's attention to the fact that there is an obvious link, which has now been put into the public domain by the government, with the Commonwealth Public Service wage claims. I know the CPSU is locked into processes and disputes to pursue its members' interests, and I wish it all the best with that. We have suffered long and hard under a coalition government here in the ACT. I have strong memories— (Time expired)

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (15:37):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Defence Legislation Amendment (Military Justice Enhancements—Inspector-General ADF) Bill 2014 (the Bill) amends the Defence Act 1903 to provide transparency, predictability and accountability in decision making affecting Australian Defence Force members. It will do this by enhancing the independence of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force and enabling regulatory reform of the Australian Defence Force's redress of grievance, investigation and inquiry practices. 


Following detailed review of Defence's system of inquiry, investigation, review and audit, the Australian Defence Force concluded its current arrangements for these processes are unnecessarily complex, inefficient and legalistic. I am conscious of the need to support commanders to make good decisions, not to impede or discourage them from doing so. The complexity and inflexibility of current arrangements do not provide that support. I am also conscious of the need for robust, professional, credible, and independent oversight of the military justice system. 


Finally, I am conscious of the need to ensure that complex and sensitive matters concerning the Defence Force, such as those events that come to my and the Chief of Defence Force's attention, including the death of ADF members related to, or arising from their Service, can be subject to efficient and specialised internal inquiry and review. 


Such inquiries currently enjoy provisions overriding the privilege against self-incrimination so that underlying causes can be ascertained—such as in the Sea King Board of Inquiry—and addressed to prevent recurrences. However, the abrogation of this privilege should not be capable of being abused to obtain evidence for the imposition of criminal sanctions against persons. Therefore the Bill will prevent witness evidence obtained by the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination being used against that witness in service tribunals or civilian courts. 




The Bill: 



makes it clear that the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force mechanism for internal audit and review of the military justice system is independent of the ordinary chain of command 


provides that the Minister or the Chief of the Defence Force may utilise the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force as a mechanism to inquire into or investigate any other matters concerning the Australian Defence Force;


places beyond doubt that the privilege against self-incrimination for witnesses is abrogated in relation to inquiries conducted by the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force and inquiry officers or assistants appointed by IGADF;


places beyond doubt that the witness evidence use immunity in subsection 124(2C) applies in relation to Inspector-General Australian Defence Force inquiries and Inspector-General Australian Defence Force inquiry officer inquiries. Witness evidence use immunity prevents a witness's evidence given to an inquiry from being used against them in a service tribunal or civilian court;


requires the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force to prepare an annual report relating to the Inspector-General's functions for tabling in Parliament; and


further strengthens the independence of the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force by making it clear that, where the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force is directed to conduct an inquiry or investigation by the Chief of the Defence Force, or where an Inspector General Australian Defence Force is acting on their own motion or at the request of another party, the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force may cease the inquiry or investigation if the Inspector-General Australian Defence Force forms a belief that the continuation of the inquiry or investigation is not otherwise warranted, having regard to all the circumstances.


These amendments to the Defence Act 1903 will facilitate regulatory reforms to: 


Replace the existing multi-layered, sometimes opaque, often complex, Australian Defence Force redress of grievance process with a single layer of formal internal review incorporating involvement from the member's chain of command, overseen by the Inspector General Australian Defence Force. A member dissatisfied with the outcome of this internal review would retain their existing rights to seek external review, such as from the Defence Force Ombudsman. 


Improve the efficiency of investigating Service-related deaths. Under current arrangements, Service-related deaths must be investigated through a Chief of the Defence Force Commission of Inquiry, unless I direct otherwise. While on one hand this approach provides government and the public with the appearance of an independent inquiry into deaths, it is inefficient and is costly. It is my intention that, following the passage of the Bill, the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 1985 will be amended so that there is no automatic requirement for a statutory inquiry for all service-related deaths. Instead, service-related deaths will be referred to the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force for review/inquiry. The Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force will determine in each case the process for review, or inquiry, into each death and may decide to conduct a public hearing, an inquiry in private, or a desk-top review only. Utilising the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force in this role will provide assurance that the Australian Defence Force is responding appropriately to service-related deaths and should significantly reduce the costs associated with such inquiries, while retaining credible and independent oversight of these sensitive matters.


The outcome of these reforms will be:


a simple and efficient administrative inquiry process that will be more responsive to command requirements for timely administrative decision making; 


a fair and prompt Australian Defence Force Redress of Grievance system that appropriately balances a member's right to complain with the Australian Defence Force interests of timeliness and certainty in command decision making; 


a more timely and cost effective mechanism to address inquiries concerning Australian Defence Force deaths; and,


improved oversight and prioritisation of matters with strategic implications for Defence.


I commend the Bill.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until 9 February 2015, in accordance with standing order 111.

  I commend the YWCA for the work they do to empower young women and girls to aspire to leadership positions. I also commend the 1,600 girls and young women who participated in the She Speaks survey and brought to life a number of important issues on leadership discrimination and safety. The government is proud to support a range of programs for the benefit of women and girls across government, including providing $450,000 to support the Every Girl program which aims to empower girls aged nine to 14 from disadvantaged areas to become confident engaged leaders who are active in their communities. The policies of the government show a clear commitment to improving outcomes for all women and girls in Australia and globally. I also note that this government's new approach to overseas development assistance requires 80 per cent of investments, regardless of their objectives, to effectively address gender issues in their implementation.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:10):  I rise today to speak about the MPI, to talk about the Abbott government's barnacles and their budget of broken promises. It is an inconvenient truth: a promise broken is a broken promise, and, despite the Abbott government's pathetic attempts to outright deny and lie, they have broken promises. Despite their convoluted language—calling cuts and broken promises something else—voting Australians know that the Abbott government has broken promise after promise and that it has made cuts to a range of government services. Voters know fact from fiction.


On the eve of the federal election Mr Abbott told SBS there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS if the coalition were elected to government. There were of course other pledges during the election campaign. Who could forget that wonderful outburst of 'We are on a unity ticket on Gonski!' But now Australian kids will pay the price of that ripped-up unity ticket, as postcodes will continue to determine educational outcomes—not a fairer funding system. Earlier this week the Prime Minister held his mea culpa media conference and promised us that he would take the barnacles off before Christmas. Despite the Labor opposition asking many questions here in the Senate, one of the barnacles—Senator Johnston, the Minister for Defence—is still here. There are just a couple more sitting days before Christmas if the barnacles are to come off, assuming they require legislation to do so.


The government is not winning. Despite the Prime Minister's mea culpa, the government is not winning. Its harsh, cruel budget has been well and truly exposed along with its string of broken promises. I think that, when the Prime Minister had a closer look at the barnacles, he realised that it is the whole ship that is sinking. Even if he now removes the barnacles—whether that be the Minister for Defence, backing down on the GP tax, backing down on the cuts to the ABC or backing down on the cuts to education—nothing will save the Abbott government ship, because it has become a ship of fools.


Yesterday in this place, Labor, along with the Greens and some of the crossbenchers, let the Abbott government know well and truly that the higher education changes in their bill were harsh and unfair. In fact they were just plain wrong. We voted that bill down. But, completely undeterred—the message seemingly is not getting through to the Abbott government—they have fronted up this morning with a new bill. We are not quite sure where it is up to and when we will see it, but we understand that in that bill the massive cuts to universities remain.


Despite Labor saying right from day one it would not support the cuts to that higher education bill and despite us having a Senate inquiry and hearing overwhelmingly from universities that the cuts would hurt, seemingly the Abbott government did not hear that. So the cuts remain, the new fee imposts for students remain and nothing of substance has changed, and Labor's position remains unchanged. We will not support the government's second, replica, unfair higher education bill.


What we learned from this new bill is the fact that the government needs to put forward the regional transition fund in and of itself says that what they are proposing is not going to work. We have heard in this place senator after senator and the ministers telling us that competition is good, that making a market out of universities is good. Yet what have they now done? They have suddenly realised that, if they want to go down this track, they have to stump up regional universities because regional universities—in fact all universities except the Group of Eight—told us they would not be able to survive without some sort of transitional fund. The government did not call it a transitional fund. Many of the universities told us they would need that additional funding from the federal government forever.


It was really quite a shock to me and was revealed as an absolute blight on the system when the University of Newcastle told us that, with the cuts being imposed by the federal government, they simply could not recoup those cuts through an increase in fees. That is the Abbott government signing the death warrant of that fine university in Newcastle, a regional university. Yet the Abbott government does not seem to care. Somehow it likes to kid itself that turning universities into a market and making them compete is going to save them, when the evidence we heard at the Senate inquiry was quite contrary to that, with regional universities being very clear about their future, an uncertain future, a future they could not predict. So this nonsense of competition in their higher education market has been exposed.


Surely, if we have to stump up taxpayer dollars to take account of these harsh cuts, that says the government's plan for marketisation will not work. It is a failure right from the word go. Just now Universities Australia have put out a media release. Universities Australia strike me as a fairly savvy organisation. They are often here lobbying. They certainly meet with Labor senators and Labor shadows and talk to us about their vision for universities in the future. Guess what they are saying? That this bill does not quite get it right. Bills are not playthings. The government cannot keep putting up bill after bill until they get it right. Voters of Australia demand the government get it right in the first instance. Up until yesterday, Minister Pyne was singing the praises of Universities Australia, telling us how onside they were. Yet today in black and white from Universities Australia we have a media release which says: 'Oops, you haven’t quite got it right, Minister Pyne. The 20 per cent cuts are going to hurt us.'


Finally, whatever Kool-Aid Universities Australia drank when the first bill was proposed has worn off, because they are now starting to criticise the government's higher education bill by saying today that this does not get it right, that this does not cut it. And money being put into a transition fund for three years will not cut it either because regional universities have said very clearly that the cuts are going to hurt them. Again this is another broken promise from the Abbott government—'No cuts to education'. We all know there has been a 20 per cent cut to our universities.


One of the other things the Abbott government is quite good at doing—I often wonder which universe they are in. They are obviously in some kind of parallel universe. They do not live in the real world I live in because they like to invent new language for their cuts. Who remembers the increased tax on higher earners, which nobody had an issue with? But it is not an increase in tax; it is a levy. We just use different language because we know that the Abbott government promised no increased taxes. So they kind of think, 'If we call it something else, people will just believe us.' Of course they do not. We can all tell fact from fiction and there is another fiction. It is time the Abbott government realised they are deeply unpopular because their budget is too harsh and cruel on everyday Australians.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (16:20):  Acting Deputy President Williams, Merry Christmas. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Thank you.




Senator MASON:
  About seven years ago, when the Labor Party took office, having won the election in November 2007, they inherited the best books, the best set of national accounts ever inherited by any incoming government in our national history. In 113 years of our national history, they received the best accounts ever with billions and billions of dollars in the bank. When we took over government in September last year, we received the worst national accounts in the history of our nation. They received the best; we received the worst and now we are trying to fix them. The horror is not that Labor spent too much on overpriced school halls, the cash splash and the disastrous pink batts; it is that so many of them do not believe there is a problem at all. 


It gets worse. They are even, at the moment, sabotaging the government's attempts to repay the debt. We want to do that, and it is being sabotaged. We do know that they have no plan to solve the problem. No plan has been put forward by 'barnacle' Bill Shorten—Mr Shorten—at all. The problem now is not the amount of the debt but the trajectory of the debt. In just over nine years it will reach $667 billion with $3 billion a month in interest. What could we do with that? That is the point.


It gets much worse than that, and this has not been raised in this place. In the history of developing countries, since World War II, no-one has ever repaid a debt of that magnitude. What will happen is that we will become like western Europe and the United States and we will never repay it. We either repay it now or we are a country that is stuck with systemic debt, just like western Europe and the United States. And we will be paying billions of dollars in interest for the privilege. It will become a permanent fixture in our public life. The government will become the centre of the economy—just as Kevin Rudd wished all those years ago.


The Labor Party profess to be the party of social justice. They have this sort of sense about them that they are the party of social justice—with a touch of moral vanity, I might add. They have argued since May that the budget is not fair for pensioners, students and working families. That is what they say: 'it is not fair'. But I will tell you who it is not fair for. It is not fair for the people who will have to pay the debt. The government believe that this generation should live within their means. We believe that the health, the education and the welfare of our community should be paid for by the community—not by our children and not by our grandchildren. That is the disgrace of a party that talks about social justice and equality: they do not give a damn about our children and our grandchildren. It is not only fiscally reckless but also morally contemptible. But there is a reason for it. The Labor Party know that our children and those yet to be born, of course, cannot vote. They know that. We are standing up for people who cannot yet vote. This lot will never, ever do that. They will put more and more money on the credit card, because they know there are very, very few repercussions of that. Every democratic incentive is not to pay back the debt, because when you pay back debt it causes electoral pain. I accept that; we all accept that. We are paying it back because it is fiscally responsible and morally it is the only way to go.


We believe, ultimately, that if pensioners, working families and students think the government is that poor, they will throw us out. That is fine. That is democracy. But what the Labor Party believe and know is this: those who will pay Labor's debt cannot yet vote. They cannot throw the Labor Party out because they cannot yet vote. It is a gutless approach to politics—one that has been adopted by nearly every country in western Europe, including Greece, Portugal, France and Spain, because the politicians of those nations did not have the guts to pay back the debt and they wanted future generations to pay for today's living standards. And that is the solution of the Australian Labor Party. I can put up with the fact that the Labor Party cannot manage a budget. That is a fact.




Senator Polley:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I just wonder if we could turn the volume down a little bit on his microphone. You cannot hear yourself think.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  There is no point of order. Continue, Senator Mason.




Senator MASON:
  We all know that Labor cannot manage budgets. They never have, since Federation. They have never managed budgets. But it is morally contemptible to ask our children to pay for them. When I was at university I used to see these signs everywhere from the Left that said, 'eat the rich'. There are no longer enough rich left. Today the Labor Party Left say, 'eat the young'.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:27):  I rise on this matter of public importance to expose some of the nonsense and the rhetoric that we have just heard from Senator Mason. The Prime Minister has said that he is about removing barnacles. I have to say: it is not the barnacles that are the problem. It is the actual ship. This government reminds me of the political equivalent of the old 'ships of shame' that used to come to this country—rust buckets with people in the bilges, trying to pump the bilges out on a continuous basis. It is not the barnacles; it is the ship. 


Senator Mason said, 'merry Christmas'. I have to say that it will not be a merry Christmas for the pensioners who are getting indexation reduced by this government. It will not be a merry Christmas for those who need and rely on the health system, with $50 billion cut out of the health system. It will not be a merry Christmas for kids in needy schools, with $50 billion cut out of schools over 10 years. It will not be a merry Christmas for those students who would have been facing $100,000 a year to get an education if we had not stopped that crazy proposition from this coalition government. It will not be a merry Christmas for those workers at the ABC and SBS who are losing their jobs because the government cannot lie straight in bed. It will not be a merry Christmas for the poor in this country, or the unemployed, or the vulnerable because they are, according to this government, the 'leaners'. They are leaning on people. This is a government with no compassion, no common sense and no economic credibility, and I will not be lectured by the coalition about economic credibility. 


This is a coalition that under Peter Costello and John Howard just threw the rule book out the door. It was tax cut after tax cut after tax cut, with no building for the future. There was no investment in schools, no investment in infrastructure and no investment in health. That was not the way for this country to get ahead and look after future generations. It was short-termism of the worst nature, a lack of political vision and certainly no political values. 


This budget takes from the have-nots and gives to those that have got it. The so-called 'contribution' of a politician or a high-income earner—on three times the average wage—to this government's budget repair is $29 a week. People earning $200,000 or $300,000-plus are paying $29 a week. That is one per cent of their disposable income. But if you are a single-income couple with two school-age children on average earnings—guess what?—you pay $90 a week. That is the contribution of single-income families with a couple of kids at school under this government. That is six per cent of their disposable income. Where is the fairness in that? How can anyone trust a government who does this? 


This is a government who did not tell the Australian public about any of the policies they would introduce after the election. This is a government who systematically lied to the Australian public. They told the Australian public that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and not cuts to the ABC, no cuts to SBS and no cuts to pensions. Yet what do they do? When they get into government, they rip and tear at our education system, our health system and the poorest people in this country. They are really the political equivalent of the ships of shame. 


It is a government that is forever on reset, forever on reboot, forever on remessage. Now they are on barnacle removal duty. What a rabble this mob is! What an absolute rabble! They are untrustworthy. They have lied their way into power. If the public had known what this government was going to do, they would not be sitting on the government benches now. 


The Treasurer only opens his mouth to change feet. His foot is always in his mouth. The government just does not get the message. They have not got the message from the Victorian election. The Australian public are just not buying the budget or the poor sales job. It is not about the sales job; it is about the policies. The policies are bad. The budget is a shocker. The budget is unfair. The government cannot be trusted. This is the problem with this government. 


Then what do they do? They rely on the rhetoric from Senator Mason about bad economic management. They just failed to tell anyone that there was a global financial crisis. They just failed to tell people that governments all over the world had to invest in keeping people in jobs. No, that was not mentioned. In fact, they argued here it was only a North American crisis; they said there was not a crisis in Australia at all. Yet business could not get any investment; funds were drying up; the market was grinding to a halt. It was only the Labor Party in government that fixed that. 


They are not getting the message. The message is: the Senate is not going to pass your GP tax. The Senate does not like your cuts to health. The Senate does not like your cuts to schools. We do not like you beating up on the poor and the vulnerable. These are the issues that are important to the Australian public. No matter what they are told, this government is completely deaf to the real issues for ordinary Australians. They are completely out of touch. It is a government in utter chaos. 


They talk about a year of achievement. It has been a year of achievement for the government! You have chased the auto industry out of the country. You have trashed billions of dollars of investment in renewable energy projects. You have reopened tax loopholes for multinational tax avoiders. You have doubled the budget deficit even before your disastrous budget was handed down in May. You broke every promise you ever made. And there is not a South Australian senator in here that stands up for jobs in South Australia, because they are too weak-kneed and jelly-backed to actually stand up to a bad budget and bad decisions by this government. 


They have trashed the trust of the voters. That is their achievement. They are significant achievements. They have proved that you cannot govern without ideas, you cannot govern on three-word slogans and you cannot govern if you tell lies. That is what this government is: completely out of touch. They are so out of touch. 


The Liberals are out of touch, but the National Party is all at sea. They have gone from being the wombats—you know, the tough guys: the Sinclairs, the Anthonys and the Nixons—to being the doormats. That is what they are. Senator O'Sullivan, you are no Sinclair. Senator Canavan, you are no Doug Anthony. And, Senator McKenzie, you will never be as good as Nixon was at looking after country people. You are the doormats. 


Nowhere is that clearer than when you hear Senator Canavan get excited—being from Rockhampton you would think the senator would be interested in things like making sure the agriculture minister's botched handling of the farm household assistance and drought funding was fixed. But, no, Senator Canavan comes in here and makes speeches about Hayekian philosophy. He talks about currency competition. He talks about Friedman. This is awful. I am sure listeners to the Senate broadcast in Central Queensland in Biggenden are glued to the radio, listening to Senator Canavan. Senator Canavan is not representing Biggenden; he is representing the big end of town. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-12-03,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:37):  It grieves me, but I am glad to actually participate in this ridiculous debate where, once again, the Labor Party trots out its tired lines—although I am quite excited about some of the adjectives those opposite have chosen to throw into today's motion. But I think it is actually merely disguising the fact that the Labor Party, straight after the federal election, completely reset the clock on how this nation is to be configured. Those opposite actually forgot about the previous six years, chose to say they did not count. Any responsibility borne for the mess we are now in, they will not be held accountable for. It is an absolute shell, a fig leaf, if you like, that is actually about hiding the facts behind what we are having to deal with as a government.


The fact is that we are delivering on our promises and those opposite do not like to hear it. We were elected to fulfil a most crucial of promises and that was to repair the sea of debris, the oceans of debt and the tsunami of deficits that were faced by this nation thanks to their absolute incompetence. It was incompetence on a scale never before seen in this nation. We had school halls built at triple the cost of anywhere else. Money was thrown out hand over fist. And now they choose to use the fig leaf of the 'financial crisis'. That was not the case. It was actually press release politics on the most ridiculous scale. I cannot believe it.


Let's go to the facts. The facts were that we did not have $50 billion in the bank. We had $200 billion of net debt when we took government 12 months ago and $667 billion of gross debt. The last six years that landed our government in the most precarious of positions. We have been battling against and are achieving against that position for the betterment—as Senator Mason mentioned in his contribution—of future generations.


We are not going to be bound by the political cycle. We are going to be bound by principles, which will underpin the future competitiveness of young Australians who cannot vote. Many of them are unemployed right now. Right through regional Australia there is high unemployment. We are seeking to build a positive future for them and to give them options in education, in training, in trades and, indeed, in higher education to ensure that they can access those opportunities so that they can contribute to increased productivity and enjoy all the positive outcomes that work will provide. The debt of the former government was the fastest accrual of debt in dollar terms as a share of GDP in modern Australia. It was not that it was the highest—although it was by a significant amount—but, man, was it quick. Like a catamaran versus a mirror, it was just absolutely phenomenal.


What this government is interested in doing is delivering on the very real promises we made at the last election to the Australian people that they voted for and that those opposite have continually frustrated in this place. Those opposite continually frustrate in their pious attempts to forget the past. Like deluded adolescents, they forget the past. It was the responsibility of those opposite and therefore those opposite have a responsibility in this place to lend a shoulder to the wheel to help us to repair the debt and deficit that those opposite left us so that we can as a society, as a parliament, build a positive future for young Australians. They were shallow slogans from Senator Cameron, but do we expect anything else?


We have also sorted out the growing regulatory burden, and it is not just on business. Higher education complained of the regulatory burden. The old friends of those opposite, the school sector, the AEU even—I think Angelo got on board—started complaining and bringing to the fore the regulatory burden that the former government placed not only business but on the environment, on higher education, on schools. Right throughout our society, the former government's stranglehold reduced our competitiveness, reduced our productivity and our ability to make productivity gains. Indeed, it stifled this nation to the point of static. Like a yacht with no wind, those opposite were no help.


We have delivered on the carbon tax promise. Help us. Why are you not thanking us? All those workers at SPC Ardmona and all the workers in the dairy industry were so thankful for getting rid of that carbon tax. The people who pay their wages are not having to pay tens of thousands of dollars in additional costs for a carbon tax that was never going to deliver the environmental outcomes that those opposite sought to achieve.


It is not just us. Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics said that our budget is the only road map to structural fiscal repair Australia has. Those opposite do not like to hear it. Those opposite do not have a credible alternative. Those opposite are very happy to carp on the sideline when someone else tries to fix up their mess. It is absolutely disgusting. It is immature and there is no leadership throughout the Australian Labor Party as those opposite sit here and carp on the sideline while we fix up their mess.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:43):  I rise to make a contribution to the matter of public importance debate this afternoon about the Abbott government's budget of barnacles and broken promises. I would like to follow on from Senator Mason, who wished everyone a Merry Christmas. While it is a very noble expression of goodwill, it is a shame this government has not demonstrated any since being in power.


I would like to reflect on those people who have lost their jobs in my home state of Tasmania under this government. There have been countless Tasmanians who have lost their jobs. Thousands and thousands of pensioners around this country were lied to before the election. They were told that there would be no changes to the pension, just as people were told that there would be no new taxes—'not under my government', according to Mr Abbott. The list goes on. Those people who are unemployed will face a very bleak Christmas. But with the changes this government tried to introduce, it would have been much darker. This is a government that is heartless and it is harsh.


We know that those people who work with the ABC and SBS and their families—those tens of hundreds of Australians who work for those two institutions—are going to have a very bleak Christmas. This was the government and this was the Senate that tried to pass a budget and has failed to do that since May—and they still have not. Why has the budget not passed? Why have those bills not been passed? It is because the Australian people know that they were lied to. They were lied to by Tony Abbott.


I just want to reflect on Mr Abbott's performance on the Today show this week. It was really quite interesting. It is not a show that I watch that often. But to have the Prime Minister, in a very sincere way and even with a straight face, complain about the Senate being obstructionist towards them! He said that the Labor opposition was in a 'feral mood'. That is the biggest—the biggest!—case of the pot calling the kettle black that I have ever heard!. It is not often that I actually agree with Karl Stefanovic, but I think he hit the nail on the head this week when his response to the Prime Minister was:


With respect you were fairly feral in opposition ...


That is the truth. That is precisely what those people who are now sitting on that side of the chamber were when they were in opposition. They were negative, negative, negative.


If the Today show are scoring important points off Mr Abbott, the situation must be getting pretty desperate. Perhaps it is time that Mr Abbott gave up? Recently, we have also heard that the Prime Minister says he needs to take care of a few 'barnacles' on the ship before Christmas. I think that Senator Cameron was quite right: it is not the barnacles on the ship, it is the ship that is on its way down to the bottom of the ocean, along with its captain and a few of the lieutenants—or should I say 'chief petty officers' on that side? They are going to find themselves in the drink.


Before the election, the government promised and said, 'We're on a unity ticket with the Labor Party. There will be no cuts to education.' But we have seen the first attempt in this government's plan to wreck higher education in this country. Yesterday we also learnt that there was a deal being discussed that would see federal money going towards a revamp of the University of Tasmania, in my home state. Well, that is all very well, but if it were not for the government abolishing the Education Investment Fund in the first place such drastic action would not be needed.


But I have to say that we have not seen any real detail, and I have no confidence at all in the 'three amigos'—the members for Bass, Braddon and Lyons—to be able to negotiate anything with this government to ensure that there is adequate funding going to the University of Tasmania. This government has ripped $30 million out of the university's budget in Tasmania. My colleagues, senators Brown, Singh, Urquhart and Bilyk, and I have no confidence at all in the three amigos. And I know that the Tasmanian community does not have any confidence at all in those three amigos.


But we should not be fooled, because we know that the higher education changes will make a university education inaccessible for many people. As I have said earlier this week, going to university should be based on your talent and hard work, not how big a cheque book your parents have or how big a credit card you have. It should be your talent that decides whether or not you should be able to continue and have the opportunity of a tertiary education. Scraping off one or two of the barnacles will not be enough. As I said, it is not the barnacles that are the problem: it is the ship and the captain. I have to say that this ship is sinking fast, and there is no harbour in sight. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that no-one is taking charge.


We have to remember—it has to be 6½ months ago now—that the Australian people listened to the Treasurer bringing down his budget. But they do not buy it: they did not buy it in May, they did not buy it in June and they did not buy it in July, August, September, October or November. And they certainly are not buying it now. We know that this budget was made up of nothing but broken promises—promises that were made, I would have thought, in good faith, to the Australian community. But what we have seen is that there was deception and deceit by the Prime Minister and his Treasurer. Quite frankly, I think it is pretty obvious that they are both out of their depth.


Let us look once again at the proposed GP tax—another tax. But those people on the other side said during the election campaign that there would be no new tax, and that there would be no cuts to health and no cuts to education. The leadership team still do not know: is there going to be a GP tax or is there not going to be a GP tax? One thing I do know is that if they do bring such legislation into this chamber that we will fight tooth and nail to prevent it. That tax will hurt the most vulnerable people in our community. But, no, those on the other side—what did they say?—they said they were going to be the 'adults' in government. They were going to be the adults! I have to say that they are not even behaving as well as children in pre-kinder would, because they have no idea. They have no vision.


We know how heartless they are, because there is not a sector in our community that has not been hit. And there is the uncertainty—because these people do not care. I have heard it firsthand from people working in pharmacies and the pharmacists themselves, saying, 'Older Australians are concerned about whether or not they are going to be able to afford their medication.' They are going to their pharmacists—



Senator Smith interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  This is serious! You may laugh on the other side, but this is quite serious! They are asking in the pharmacies whether or not they need to take all of their tablets. That is serious!


As I said, those people on the other side have misled the Australian people. They have misled them and, in fact, this is not only about misleading them: they have lied. Those opposite can never again criticise Labor for being dysfunctional and uncertain. They can never again launch attacks on internal tensions on the other side. They can never again claim that they are the party of stability. Most of all, they can never again claim that they are a party of no surprises and no excuses, because they have fallen; and how mighty those on the other side are when they fall—they fall very hard.


What is also incredible is that at least some of those on the frontbench, including the Treasurer, are committed to persisting with the GP tax. He wants it to go ahead. As I have said in this place on a number of occasions, this is going to hurt people in my home state. This is a short-sighted tax because it is going to hurt those who can least afford to be hurt. It is going to hit pensioners, it is going to hit low-income families and it is going to hit people with chronic illnesses in particular. No parent should have to decide whether or not they can take their child to see a doctor simply because they do not have a large enough credit card.


It does not stop there. My area of responsibility is aged care, and we on this side know they have lied to this sector. They took away the dementia supplement that was paid to the providers; they said a new scheme would come in, but we have seen nothing of that. The fact that they have changed the way pensions will be indexed will affect the aged-care sector as well. We are still waiting for those in government to come into this chamber— (Time expired)

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (16:53):  A merry Christmas to you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I should say that in case this is the last time I speak here. A merry Christmas to everyone.


The biggest barnacle to getting the budget back under control is the Labor Party. It is the Labor Party that is causing all the budget issues that we are facing here at the moment—the Labor Party and its friends in the Greens. This is the axis of 'just say no'; they are saying no to everything.




Senator Polley:
  Just like you did when you were in opposition.




Senator McGRATH:
  You said no to $5.8 billion worth of cuts that you proposed yourselves. You have done an amazing somersault. The Labor Party should go in the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games or even the Tasmanian games: you would get a gold medal. But in the spirit of Christmas, I really would like to thank Senator Moore for allowing us to have this debate. It was supposed to be listed yesterday, but sadly, for whatever reasons, we could—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator Smith:
  They needed an extra 24 hours for their argument.




Senator McGRATH:
  Thank you, Senator Smith. They need an extra 24 hours for their argument, so they had to get—



Senator Polley interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Resume your seat, Senator McGrath. Senator Polley, I did my best to prevent people from interjecting when you were speaking and I ask you to show the same respect.




Senator McGRATH:
  Labor senators have been very naughty boys and girls and, I will tell you what, Santa Claus will not be visiting Labor Party households this year. He is going to be checking his list twice to see whether they have been naughty or nice, and those opposite have been very, very naughty—very naughty. If they are lucky, they will get a nice lump of Queensland coal in their stockings. As for the Greens, you will get some nice gender neutral coal in your stockings to play with. This is what we are talking about. The Greens, who were not happy with just destroying the economic future of Australian children, have decided to try to destroy Christmas for them. They want to take Christmas away from children with their nonsense about having gender neutral toys for children. What do children want for Christmas? Children want a cuddle and they want some toys to play with. They do not want dogma from the Greens; they do not want leftist tripe from puritanical Grinches. Imagine waking up in a Green household at Christmas. You would have some sort of androgynous dalek, you would have malevolent Barbies and you would have a neutered Peppa Pig. I could not think of anything worse than waking up in a Greens household and then getting the presents afterwards.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  You would be confused.




Senator McGRATH:
  You would be very, very confused. But let us get back to talking about this economy. Let us get back to what Labor has done to this economy. Let us get back to that big, big barnacle known as the Labor Party—the Labor Party that has destroyed this country economically, destroyed it through its poor economic management. It started with Kevin Rudd. He said he was an economic conservative.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Which time?




Senator McGRATH:
  We have had many different Kevin Rudds. I think this was the first Kevin Rudd. I am going to quote lines from a speech on 14 November 2007 at the Labor campaign launch in Brisbane. It is a crime scene where he gave this speech, a pure crime scene. He said:


Today I am saying loud and clear that this sort of reckless spending must stop. I am determined that any commitments I make are first and foremost economically responsible.


He made this big show and dance, like a Las Vegas showgirl, about how he was some type of economic conservative. He was anything but.


It is in the DNA of the Labor Party: they get into office and they cannot control themselves. I feel sorry for them; I think they need counselling or some type of help. They get into office and they spend, spend and spend. If you look at the history of this country, it is the Labor Party, now with their good friends the Greens, who constantly destroy the economy. Look at 1931: when we got back in after Joseph Scullin we had to clean up the mess. Look at 1949: we stopped the Labor Party from trying to nationalise the banks—imagine the damage that would have done to the economy. Look at 1975: the damage of Gough Whitlam—Saint Gough. Look at what he did with that three-year Labor administration—compared to the administration in this country between 2007 and 2013, it was probably quite a good Labor administration—the second worst Labor government on record. We had the Hawke-Keating government, which left this country in 1996 with $96 billion worth of debt. We got to 2013 and, once again, the cavalry came along. We had the Liberals and Nationals, the coalition, elected to clean up Labor's mess. And it is Labor's mess. They not only failed to understand how to run a business, how to look at profit and loss sheets, but they also are—




Senator O'Sullivan interjecting
—





Senator McGRATH:
  union barons—thank you, Senator O'Sullivan—who are very good at spending other people's money. When I say 'other people's money' I mean spending their union members' money. So when they get into power it is like they have won Gold Lotto every Saturday night. When Labor are in power they think, 'We've got all this money to spend and we can spend it on all our crazy schemes'. Let us talk about the carbon tax and how that did not work; let us talk about how it destroyed the Australian economy. Let us talk about the mining tax, the world's craziest tax since the Georgians had the window tax. This tax raised very, very little money. The carbon tax was a tax on families who wanted to have things like electricity so that they could operate televisions, fans and turn the oven on—




Senator Smith:
  Refrigerators.




Senator McGRATH:
  and refrigerators—thank you, Senator Smith. It was a tax on the cost of living; it was a tax on families. That is why this budget is in trouble. It is not because of anything on this side of the chamber. It is because of the barnacles that are the Labor Party and the Greens party and the damage they have done to this country. And on that, I wish everybody a very merry Christmas and I look forward to seeing you all in 2015.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:59):  Can I also share festive greetings with Senator McGrath and others in the chamber. 


We have been having a debate this afternoon about so-called barnacles and so-called broken promises. But let us be clear: what we have heard are carping and cliches from the other side. What we have not heard is an alternative. What we have not heard is a different plan. What we have not heard is one new idea from those opposite about how we can put this country on the best fiscal path possible—that has been missing from the contributions of Labor senators today. They would like you to believe that we should erase from our memory the last six years of Labor rule across this country—six years dominated by poor policy, poor implementation and a string of budget deficits. They would like you to ignore that from the current fiscal challenge that faces our nation. They refuse to admit that the country has a debt and deficit disaster. They refuse to admit that it is a disaster of their own making. Importantly, they reject what four Labor leaders have said. And I will come to that in a moment. But let me start with the commentary from a distinguished Australian businessman. Let us hear from Maurice Newman about what he thinks about the challenge.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you, Senator Cameron. I cannot wait for the interjection when I get to the commentary of four former Labor leaders about the budget problems and what they are saying about your failure to meet the challenges of the budget problems that we have. Let us hear from Maurice Newman, a distinguished business leader. He said:


The Shorten opposition still fails to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem. It plays semantic games questioning whether our deteriorating fiscal situation is a genuine budget emergency. It ignores the copious evidence that a political tipping point is reached long before an economic crisis becomes a reality …


He further said:


By playing to welfare dependence, class envy and the notion that there is nothing serious to worry about, the illusion has been created that there is a painless growth option—


a painless option in terms of getting the budget back to surplus. Of course, we know the truth: there is no pain free way, unfortunately, to correct the economic vandalism and recklessness of the former government.


More critically than what Maurice Newman has had to say is Labor's repudiation of what Bob Hawke has had to say, Labor's repudiation of what Paul Keating has had to say, Labor's repudiation of what even Mark Latham has had to say. It is not good enough that they reject the distinguished commentary of Australia's business leaders; they are rejecting the commentary of their own former Labor leaders. Let us turn to that.


What did Bob Hawke and Paul Keating say in The Australian on 1 January this year? The Australian states:


Bob Hawke and Paul Keating—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  That is your Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, Senator Bilyk and Senator Cameron—


Bob Hawke and Paul Keating have urged the Abbott government to slash spending and speedily repair the budget bottom line—


things that you are stopping the government from doing—


arguing they faced up to a similar challenge in 1986-87 when the terms of trade collapsed and the dollar plummeted.


…      …   …


You've got to have a prime minister and treasurer, and a competent ministry which understands the issue and is prepared to make hard decisions.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  You are repudiating one of your most distinguished parliamentary leaders. I do not mind saying that the economic stewardship of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating was not bad. I do not mind saying that. I am not too proud to say that and you too, Senator Bilyk, can embrace what Bob Hawke and Paul Keating are saying, and be part of the change that is necessary to get the country back on track.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  What did Bill Hayden have to say, another distinguished Labor leader that Senator Cameron and Senator Bilyk would like to ignore and erase from history? Again, from The Australian, this time just last month, 8 November:


Former Labor leader Bill Hayden has urged the party to be build 'economic credibility'—


he urged Labor senators in this place to build economic credibility—


with the voters and stressed the need to reduce the influence of factions to reform its internal structures and overhaul its policies to regain government.


It is to be expected that Labor might reject the commentary of distinguished business leaders, but when they start to reject the commentary of their own former Labor leaders about the importance of establishing economic credibility, that is the bottom of the barrel. Unfortunately, Labor senators in this place have reached the bottom of the barrel.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-12-03,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:05):  I just cannot thank Senator Moore enough for the opportunity to draw attention and put the spotlight on the absolutely impoverished government that was the Labor government of the last six years. The interesting thing to reflect upon is that there were three prime ministers in that time—Mr Rudd followed by Ms Gillard followed by Mr Rudd. Two of the prime ministers were actually gotten rid of by Labor's own caucus. They did not even give the Australian people the opportunity to get rid of them; they just waited until 2013 to do that—so hypocrisy writ large. 


When you think of Kevin Rudd, what comes to mind? You think of pink batts and the terrible loss of four lives, and you think of billions of dollars. You think, of course, of the $900 and the $1, 200 cheques that were thrown around like confetti. When you think of Ms Gillard, you think immediately of failed memorial halls, many of which are falling down now—another $13 billion of taxpayers' money. Then you have the quinella—the Wayne Swan and Senator Penny Wong quinella, the worst Treasurer and finance minister combination in Australia's history who took a surplus of $22 billion and turned it into a massive debt who took an economy that had no net debt and created $200 billion of accumulated deficits who managed to put us in a position where we are borrowing a billion dollars a month. That is two new primary schools a day, seven days a week. What a wonderful opportunity Senator Moore has given us! 


Let me go on. We now think of Mr Shorten. As Minister for Workplace Relations he destroyed Australian jobs and watched unemployment go up as a result of his bad industrial laws. We think of Senator Ludwig, who, with no compassion and no thought, trashed not just Australia's international reputation but the live cattle industry—from which we are yet to recover.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  And then—right on cue, thank you very much—comes Senator Conroy with his failed NBN scheme that of course did not need to go to tender! Certainly in many instances he did not bother going to tender. Then there was Australia's overseas media operation, which is a fair dinkum disgrace, incidentally—Bananas in Pyjamas! Senator Conroy, having set up a tender, interfered in the process. He reversed the tender result and gave it to the ABC—and we know what the end result was.


Why would Senator Moore give us this opportunity? Here we have a past Labor government that operated with the best terms of trade in Australia's history yet managed to run successive deficits. Spend, spend, spend—the whole time. Let me come to this question about the promises of this—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Back, resume your seat. Senators, I remind you that interjections are disorderly.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bilyk! I remind you that interjections are disorderly. If you are going to make them, they might be a little more interesting at least.




Senator BACK:
  The clock needs to be extended, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will explain to Senator Bilyk afterwards what the significance of my 'Bananas in Pyjamas' comment was—I watched them on television in Singapore recently. 


Let us have a look at what we came into government to do. We said we would get rid of the shocking mining tax—a tax that was earning no income. We did it. We said we would get rid of the carbon tax and return money to Australian consumers and return confidence to the Australian electricity system. We have done it. We said that we would turn the boats around and take control of our borders again. We have done it. We said we would repair the budget—and who is standing on the hose of that process?


The question becomes one of how this government is performing. Let me spell it out. We have reduced that shocking projected debt, moving to $600 billion, by $300 billion. With infrastructure, we have committed $50 billion which will leverage up to $125 billion. We are already seeing it around Australia—something Labor was never capable of doing. On the state reforms and asset recycling, which were the first two territories or states to put their hands up for this asset recycling? The Labor led ACT and the Labor led South Australian governments. Isn't that amazing! We have privatised Medibank Private to put those funds back into working for the Australian community. We have got rid of 57,000 pages of red tape, with a saving of $2 billion a year. With Mr Andrew Robb, who is back on a plane now, incidentally, we have managed to put together three free trade agreements with three of our most important trading partners. A trillion dollars of environmental approvals, some 300 major projects, are all now underway. Last time around, Labor could not do it. We have reintroduced an employee share scheme to operate from 1 July—once again giving employees in businesses in this country the opportunity to share even further in the benefits. We have removed 100 Labor tax measures that went back to 2002. 


So where are we are now in terms of business confidence? Business confidence and consumer confidence are back at their long-term averages. Retail trade is going upwards. Housing approvals are the best in 10 years. Where are the barnacles? If there are barnacles, who contaminated the waters? Who roughened the hull of this ship called 'Australia'? This mob on the other side did it. We are in a situation now where our terms of trade have deteriorated relative to the terms of trade experienced by the former government. Can you imagine for a minute if this crowd were let back in charge of the purse strings? It would be a catastrophe.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-12-03,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:12):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.



The Australian Greens welcome this report of the Productivity Commission inquiry into access to justice arrangements, but I would not be surprised if the Attorney-General finds it hard to do so, because it lays out for all to see the flaws in this government's approach to legal assistance. It is a substantial report—almost 1,000 pages—with a total of 83 recommendations. So there is much to consider. The Australian Greens will be looking at it very closely. However, it is already clear to me that the Productivity Commission's report runs counter to the Commonwealth government's current agenda of funding cuts and advocacy restrictions. I will come to both of these in a minute.


The Australian Greens firmly believe that access to justice is a cornerstone of a modern democratic society. We know that a fair and just society with equality before the law does not just happen. Every year, half a million Australians miss out on essential legal services and hundreds of thousands of others never pursue justice because the legal system is just too complex and too expensive. These problems have been recognised by the Productivity Commission in this report. The Productivity Commission recognises that access to justice is no longer just an issue for traditionally disadvantaged people, such as people who are poor, new arrivals or those who have disabilities or mental illness. It talks about the 'missing middle'—middle-income Australians who do not qualify for legal aid but also do not have the cash for large and unexpected legal costs.


The Productivity Commission report raises a number of ways we can address this issue and the broader challenges with access to justice. I would like to speak briefly to two of these. The first is increased funding for legal assistance services and the second is the efficiency of advocacy and law reform work by those services.


The report has recommended additional funding from Commonwealth, state and territory governments of around $200 million a year for legal assistance services to be used for better alignment of the means test used by legal aid commissions with other measures of disadvantage, to maintain existing front-line services that have a demonstrated benefit to the community and to allow legal assistance providers to offer a greater number of services in areas of law that have not previously attracted funding.


It is particularly important to note that the commission has noted that belt-tightening and tough financial circumstances are not an excuse to scrimp on legal assistance. The report says:


Not providing legal assistance in these instances can be a false economy as the costs of unresolved problems are often shifted to other areas of government spending such as health care, housing and child protection. Numerous Australian and overseas studies show that there are net public benefits from legal assistance expenditure.


Secondly, I would like to note that the Australian Greens are very pleased that this report has recognised, from an economic perspective, that advocacy and law reform work are an efficient use of government funding. I have had arguments with Senator Brandis, the Attorney-General, many, many times about this issue. But I hope the fact that Australia's Productivity Commission has set out the case for advocacy will enable this government to now see sense and reverse its nonsensical and purely ideological restrictions on the use of Commonwealth funds for this purpose.


Quoting from the report again:


Frontline service delivery should be prioritised, along with advocacy work where it efficiently and effectively solves systemic issues which would otherwise necessitate more extensive individualised service provision … The Australian, State and Territory Governments should provide funding for strategic advocacy and law reform activities that seek to identify and remedy systemic issues and so reduce demand for frontline services.


As the Australian Greens' spokesperson for legal affairs, I have spoken consistently about the need to reform and improve access to justice since coming to this place. I care deeply about supporting and strengthening community legal services so that every Australian can seek justice to ensure that legal issues can be resolved on the merits of their claim and not the size of their wallet. It is fundamental to our democracy that our legal system is open to everyone who has been wronged and is seeking a fair outcome, not just those who happen to have big incomes.


I hope I will be speaking to this place again soon about these issues, but next time I hope that I will be speaking in support of Commonwealth reforms based on this Productivity Commission report to help take us down the path to improved access to justice. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:26):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I wish to take note of the response tabled by the minister, Senator Fifield, to the order for production of documents that I put to the Senate and that the Senate supported—an order to provide the final version of the report entitled Evaluating New Income Management in the Northern Territory. I am aware that the department had had a draft report prior to this final version. The order is for the final report which, as I understand it, was submitted to the government at the end of September. The response to the order to produce this document is: 'The government is not in a position to release the Evaluating New Income Management in the Northern Territory: Final Report at this stage because the minister is yet to receive it. I do understand that the Department of Social Services received the report, and that they are presently preparing advice to the government on its content. The minister expects to receive the final report soon and has every intention of releasing it publicly.'


This report has been with the government for two months now. As a final report, they knew what was in it. This income management is what the government proposes to extend if they support the Forrest report recommendation for a healthy welfare card. From reports in the media, the Forrest review is critical of income management. It says it has not done what it was set up to do. Now the government appears to be supporting, or at least giving serious consideration to, the idea of a healthy welfare card—which, as I have said in this place before, is income management on steroids—and extending it to everybody. Yet the report on income management—the biggest experiment in the world, I suspect, that has been carried out on this form of income management and that has been going on for seven years—shows, if the media reports I have seen today are correct, that it has failed. The government is considering it, yet they have not bothered to give priority to consideration of the report. They have had it for two months and have not bothered to give it to the minister or to get the minister to consider it, yet they are busily considering the healthy welfare card. That is nonsense. 


The final report should be publicly available so that everybody can see what a farce income management is and so that the public and the community can consider this report when they are looking at the concept of the healthy welfare card. Methinks that the government does not want to release a report that shows that income management has not worked—at least not while they are considering expanding it and giving it a boost across the rest of the country. It is outrageous that this report is not available and that the government is defying the will of the Senate. This report should be released immediately. I will continue to pursue it.

The speeches read as follows—



ACT GOVERNMENT LOAN BILL 2014


The ACT Government Loan Bill underpins the Government's decision to provide a concessional loan to the ACT Government of up to $1 billion to undertake a loose-fill asbestos remediation programme. 


The ACT Government faces significant challenges in dealing with the remediation of loose-fill asbestos across the Territory.


The one-off size and cost of dealing with this issue represents about a fifth of the Australian Capital Territory's annual budget. 


Without the Commonwealth's assistance, the ACT's capacity to deal with this issue would have been significantly curtailed and put at threat its own credit rating. 


The loan will ensure that the ACT Government is in a position to deliver a well-structured remediation programme in the coming years.


The Bill provides authority for the Commonwealth to enter into a loan agreement with the ACT for an amount that must not exceed $1 billion.


The terms and conditions of the loan will be set out in the loan agreement. The Minister administering the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 may enter into the loan agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development has responsibility for that Act.


The Bill also appropriates $750 million from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 2014-15 for the purposes of making payments under the loan agreement. The appropriation will be brought into existence on the day after it receives Royal Assent. The remaining $250 million will be appropriated through the 2015‑16 Budget. 


The ACT Government has also introduced legislation this week seeking to appropriate funding for the remediation programme reflecting this split across years.


A Portfolio Supplementary Estimates Statement will be tabled in the Parliament.


 


ACTS AND INSTRUMENTS (FRAMEWORK REFORM) BILL 2014


This Bill seeks to improve the operation and clarity of legislative frameworks for Commonwealth Acts and instruments. It is an important deregulatory measure that will create administrative efficiencies across government, while enhancing the public accessibility of Commonwealth laws.


The key purpose of the Bill is to reform the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.


The Legislative Instruments Act came into force in 2005 and provides a comprehensive regime for the registration, tabling, scrutiny and sunsetting (or automatic repeal) of Commonwealth legislative instruments.


It ensures that members of the public, businesses, regulatory agencies, lawyers and courts can easily access complete and authoritative legislative instruments and their explanatory statements on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. This is an important mechanism for ensuring access to justice.


In 2008, a statutory review of the Legislative Instruments Act was conducted by a committee comprising two senior members of the Commonwealth public service and the then Commonwealth Ombudsman. The committee consulted a broad range of stakeholders, with the release of an issues paper and over 60 responses to that paper. The committee also held extensive meetings with interested stakeholders.


The review found that the Legislative Instruments Act had been largely successful in improving public access and facilitating parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments. It also found that a number of improvements could be made to the scheme and released a number of recommendations.


Following the review, measures have been implemented to strengthen the legislative instruments framework.


There has been a significant amount of work to manage the sunsetting of legislative instruments across the Commonwealth. This has included the Government's efforts over both Repeal Days this year to repeal over 10,000 spent and redundant legislative instruments from the statute books.


The sunsetting of older legislative instruments also presents a unique opportunity for the Government to reduce red tape, deliver clearer and simpler laws, and align existing legislation with current government policy.


Technical enhancements have been made to the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments to ensure a high level of performance and useability, and to support the sunsetting of legislative instruments.


Further, the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel have issued new guidance materials to help Commonwealth rule-makers and agencies to manage their legislative instruments efficiently, effectively and in accordance with the law.


But there is still more work to do to enhance access to instruments and to improve the efficiency and operation of the scheme.  Some of this work follows the recommendations of the review, and some of it comes from the experience gained by the passage of time with the scheme now in place for almost 10 years.


This Bill seeks to simplify and consolidate legislative frameworks for the publication of Commonwealth Acts and the registration of Commonwealth instruments, into a single Act.  The Bill will implement this change by renaming the Legislative Instruments Act the Legislation Act 2003 and repealing the Acts Publication Act 1905.


The current database of Commonwealth Acts and the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, which are both accessed through ComLaw, will be integrated into a single Register called the Federal Register of Legislation.  Importantly, this Register will provide users with the ability to access other documents and information relevant to Commonwealth laws.


There are other types of instruments made by the Commonwealth that are not made as legislative instruments as they are not legislative in character.  These instruments do not currently need to be published on the Federal Register. Historically, many of these instruments were published in paper form only.  Over time, there have been efforts to ensure that instruments are published electronically and able to be accessed by users online.


The problem is that instruments are published in many different places, including in various government gazettes, on agency websites or portals or in newspapers. This makes it difficult for users to find these instruments or to even be aware they exist. It also places a burden on agencies to manage their stock of instruments and ensure they have adequate infrastructure in place to support the publication of these instruments.


The Bill helps to address this problem. It expands the scope of the legislative instruments framework to cover a new category of instruments, called notifiable instruments. This means that instruments which are not legislative in character can also be registered on the centrally managed and authoritative Federal Register of Legislation, which will allow them to be more readily publicised and accessed.


These amendments will align the processes for registration, compilations and authorised versions for Acts and a broader range of instruments. The amendments will also enable the First Parliamentary Counsel to make minor editorial changes in preparing registered compilations of Acts and instruments that do not change the effect of the legislation.


These amendments will produce administrative efficiencies across government.


Consistent with the Government's deregulation agenda and efforts to promote clearer and simpler laws, the Bill will enable bulk amendments or repeals arising from the thematic review of instruments to be made more quickly and simply. In consultation with the relevant rule makers, the Attorney General will be able to advise the Governor-General to make a single instrument that would give effect to such a review across government portfolios.


The Bill will help clarify and better define legislative instruments and legislative character to ensure that instruments are made in their appropriate form and able to be enforceable by registration as legislative instruments on the Register.


It will move certain content from the Act to regulations to help consolidate detail that may be more suitably placed in delegated legislation and which may need to be updated regularly.


It will also allow the First Parliamentary Counsel to make rules about matters for the purpose of meeting his or her obligation to maintain a consistent, accurate and up to date Register.


This mechanism will facilitate a level of procedural detail that may not be appropriate for including in the Act or the regulations. The rules will be a legislative instrument, which means they will be subject to parliamentary oversight.


The Bill also clarifies consultation requirements for the drafting of legislative instruments to ensure that the requirement of rule makers to undertake appropriate consultation applies equally to instruments that affect business and competition and those that do not.


Further, the Bill will remove transitional mechanisms for dealing with instruments made before the Legislative Instruments scheme was introduced in 2005. It will amend numerous other Acts to make clear in enabling legislation that certain instruments are legislative or notifiable instruments for the purpose of the Legislation Act, and update references to repealed provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and the repealed Statutory Rules Publication Act 1905 to relevant provisions in the Legislation Act.


Consequently, the Bill repeals the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003 which will become redundant.


The Bill will also amend other Acts to convert gazettal or other publication requirements into requirements to register an instrument on the Federal Register where this would be appropriate or would reflect current practice.


Certain provisions on the statute book that provide an implied power to make an instrument will be updated to expressly confer a power to make an instrument. This will not change the effect of those provisions but will remove any doubt about whether such provisions are effective in conferring power.


The Bill will repeal section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides for non-legislative disallowable instruments, and makes consequential amendments to laws that provide for these instruments.  This will reduce the number of disallowance regimes for instruments, encourage a reduction in separate gazettal procedures, and enhance the status of the Federal Register as a central repository and authoritative source of Commonwealth legislative instruments.


Finally, the Bill will amend the Acts Interpretation Act to expand and simplify the provisions dealing with machinery of government changes.


The amendments will broaden the rules for interpreting references to ministers and departments in legislation, and for interpreting references to authorities in agreements entered into by or on behalf of the Commonwealth.


This will provide more legal certainty for the ongoing valid exercise of powers and functions immediately following machinery of government changes.


The Bill will not alter the processes for the consideration of Bills and legislative instruments by Parliament. The measures in the Bill will not substantially alter the way in which Acts are handled under the existing publication regime.


This Bill provides the opportunity for significant reforms to the legislative frameworks for Commonwealth Acts and instruments. It will create administrative efficiencies across the government, helping to reduce 'beige tape' which can cause large imposts on government agencies. It will also facilitate efforts to reduce red tape. Most importantly, this Bill will promote the principle of access to justice by enhancing the accessibility of Commonwealth laws.


 


FEDERAL COURTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2014


The Federal Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 will make minor, technical and uncontroversial amendments to improve the operation and clarity of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999. 


The Bill will also confer jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to hear certain Commonwealth tenancy disputes. This is the most cost effective and efficient forum to hear these disputes. 




Federal Court of Australia Act amendments



The amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act will clarify that appeals cannot be made from minor procedural decisions, such as decisions to change hearing dates. This will reduce delays in the court system to ensure more efficient administration of justice. 


Additionally, the amendments will clarify that police officers and court sheriffs can use reasonable force to enter premises to execute an arrest warrant for persons who are the subject of proceedings for contempt of court or for summary offences. This resolves current uncertainty about whether officers can use reasonable force. There have been occasions when an arrest warrant has not been executed due to this uncertainty.




Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act amendments



The amendments will confer jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to hear certain Commonwealth tenancy disputes. These amendments are vital in order to provide a suitable forum to hear these disputes. 


At present, in most jurisdictions, the applicable law provides for Commonwealth tenancy disputes to be resolved in state or territory tribunals, which can lead to inconsistency of approach. While superior courts may also be able to hear these matters, it is not considered an appropriate use of these courts' resources as it may lengthen the dispute resolution process and increase costs. This means that there is currently no suitable or affordable forum to hear these disputes. Conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to hear these disputes provides a cost effective option and will provide a consistent forum available across Australia. 


Additionally, amendments to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act will clarify specific limitations on the award of costs prescribed in other legislation, such as public interest disclosure legislation. This will clarify the limitations on the Federal Circuit Court's jurisdiction to award costs and will assist readers to locate related provisions.




Conclusion



In conclusion, this Bill will provide a more suitable and cost effective forum for the resolution of certain Commonwealth tenancy disputes.


This Bill will also improve the operation and clarity of the Federal Court of Australia Act and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act, which will contribute towards streamlining and reducing the complexity associated with navigating the justice system.


TREASURY LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS (REPEAL DAY) BILL 2014


The Government is committed to cutting red tape costs by $1 billion a year to improve our nation's competitiveness, help to create more jobs and lower household costs.  This is a critical step towards improving Australia's productivity.


'Red tape', which is an umbrella term for excessive and unnecessary regulation, reduces productivity and investment, stifles job creation, creates uncertainty and saps confidence.  Red tape prevents business from getting on with the job, and places heavy demands on the community's time and resources that could better be spent elsewhere.


It goes without saying therefore that reducing red tape across the economy will create an enormous opportunity to increase Australia's productivity and competitiveness.


Deregulation—the process of eliminating red tape—needs a whole-of-government approach to tackling excessive or unnecessary regulations, no matter how big.  The goal is long-term cultural change, from the bureaucracy to the ministry, for the betterment of the community. 


We want to see a paradigm shift in Australia's approach to regulation, whereby new standards, rules and compliance burdens are never used as the default option, but are only introduced as a last resort and only after alternatives have been assessed and the cost of new regulation fully understood.


We also want a renewed focus on ensuring that existing regulation is as efficient as possible, and is only retained where the benefits clearly outweigh the costs.


The Government's deregulation efforts are therefore focused on a number of key areas including actively reducing the volume of regulation.  


Following on from the first Repeal Day back in March, the Government has continued its commitment to repeal counterproductive, unnecessary and redundant legislation and regulations. 


Our reforms to drive red tape reduction across Government are also paying dividends in streamlining administration.


On 20 June 2014 the Government announced administrative changes to the entry thresholds for the PAYG instalments system, reducing the number of taxpayers required to pay instalments.  The thresholds, which had not been reviewed since 2001-02, were changed as follows: 


the business or investment income threshold increased from $2,000 to $4,000;


the balance of assessment threshold increased from $500 to $1,000; 


the notional tax threshold increased from $250 to $500; and 


the requirement for entities registered for goods and services tax to remain in the system despite having a zero instalment rate was removed.


The Australian Taxation Office has estimated that this will remove more than 560,000 taxpayers from the pay-as-you-go instalments system and lead to annual savings of $67.3 million in compliance costs. 


On 18 August 2014 the Government announced its chosen model for transforming the existing Australian Small Business Commissioner into a Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. 


The Ombudsman will be a Commonwealth-wide advocate for small businesses and family enterprises and contribute to the development of small business friendly Commonwealth laws and regulations. 


The Ombudsman will also provide a concierge service to help small businesses resolve disputes fairly and efficiently.


On 21 August 2014 the Government implemented changes to the SuperStream regulations to remove the requirement for employers to use a unique 'payment reference number' when making superannuation contributions. 


Removing this provision allows employers and funds to retain existing payment processes and ensures balances are allocated to member accounts in a timely fashion.  This has been estimated to lead to an annual saving of $3.8 million in compliance costs.


Today, on the Government's second Repeal Day, we are building on these initiatives to cut red tape.


This Bill—one of a number of Bills introduced today—forms part of our whole-of-government commitment to repeal counterproductive, unnecessary and redundant legislation and consequently removing associated regulations. 


This Bill amends various laws relating to taxation, superannuation and shareholdings in certain financial sector companies to implement a range of improvements to Australia's laws.


Schedule 1 to this Bill will repeal the payslip reporting provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 that would have increased the regulatory burden on employers beyond that currently imposed under the Fair Work legislation.


There are existing requirements in the Fair Work Act 2009 and the Fair Work Regulations 2009 that require employers to include on payslips the amount of superannuation contributions they are liable to make.  This Bill will not make any change to these existing requirements.


The current payslip reporting provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 require employers to include in employee payslips information prescribed by the regulations.  Labor had intended that regulations be made so that employers had to report on payslips the amount of superannuation contributions and the date on which the employer expects to pay them.  Labor never made these regulations. 


Removing these provisions will reduce unnecessary duplication in the law and provide certainty to employers so they do not need to be preparing for costly upgrades to their payslip reporting software.


Schedule 2 to this Bill simplifies the taxation laws by consolidating duplicated taxation administration provisions contained in various taxation Acts into a single set of provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953.


Schedule 2 to this Bill also repeals spent or redundant taxation laws, such as the older harsh penalty regimes, and moves longstanding regulations into the primary law.  Tidying up our tax laws in line with good legislative practices is an important part of the care and maintenance of our tax system. 


Schedule 3 to this Bill amends the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 so that persons who do not hold a direct control interest in a financial sector company will no longer be deemed to have a stake in that financial sector company as a consequence of their associates' direct control interest.


Currently the law requires the associates of a person, such as a person's relatives, partner or related companies, who is seeking a shareholding in excess of 15 per cent to also seek approval from the Treasurer for the shareholding.  


This is required irrespective of whether an associate has any actual shareholding or financial interest in the company in which the new shareholding is sought.  


These associates are caught by the wide definition of associate under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 which requires them to undertake this action for no policy benefit.   


The changes in this Bill remove an unnecessary burden for associates with no direct interest in the company without compromising the examination of a shareholder's controlling interest.  Associates will no longer be caught in a technical trap that requires them to hold approval from the Treasurer under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act1998.  


Schedule 4 to this Bill addresses the fact that, currently, the definition of 'Australia' for taxation purposes is complex, overly detailed and expressed differently in different parts of the taxation laws, despite the fact that the laws are intended to achieve a simple and largely equivalent result. 


Schedule 4 rewrites the definition of 'Australia' into a single location in the tax law for use across all the tax laws in a simple and coherent form. 


This will involve amending various tax laws, taking another step towards achieving a single income tax assessment act for Australia.


In conclusion, these changes will improve the operation of tax law and remove unnecessary red tape from the superannuation law and shareholder regulatory framework. 


Combined with our reforms that are driving regulators and the public service to cut red and green tape, these changes add up.


Removing even small grains of sand from an engine allows the whole machine to operate more efficiently.


In the same way, progressively removing individual pieces of unnecessary red tape and regulation, and making our laws simpler and shorter, plays an important role in helping Australia's economy become more efficient.


On our second Repeal Day, we are building on the progress we have already made—right across Government—to cut red and green tape. 


Full details of these measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:42):  The Greens do not support the National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014. The National Water Commission is a most important organisation that we really do need to retain. It provides crucial oversight of our water policies. It is worth remembering that it operates with a very small team, doing important work. I understand that that team recently went from about 41 down to eight. 


The commission has provided government and industry with quality information needed to make good decisions about the effectiveness of our current water policies and directions for the future. What is being lost here is the integrated approach. The integrated approach is so important when it comes to water, and that is what the commission has provided for water policy in the 10 years of its existence. We really cannot afford to lose it. It is of grave concern to me that, given the current threats to our water supplies from climate change and the mining industry, in particular, and the ongoing struggles between water used for production and water used for the environment, we are looking at removing the only body that brings together oversight of our water policy. 


It is true that there are other bodies that provide important information in this area, such as the government's Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. But the National Water Commission is the place where these groups actually come together to sort through these issues. The processes of the National Water Initiative and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan have been well shepherded by the commission. This work is still tenuous and needs ongoing support. Removing the National Water Commission sends the wrong message to those involved in these processes. It is of great concern to me, as the National Water Commission itself has pointed out, that the proposed reporting date for the first audit of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been moved to 2018 in this legislation. We have already had delays in the readiness of this plan, which is why the commission was able to offer only an interim report in 2013. 


This is one of the crucial aspects of this legislation that underlines why this bill should not pass. We need oversight of the Murray-Darling Basin process from an independent body. That is what we have right now. And that is what we could lose. As many of the stakeholders in this debate have noted, the government cannot be marking its own homework. That was the message we heard time and again at the inquiry that was held into this legislation. Yet, under the government's plans, the marking does not even occur. The plan will be implemented before we are able to intervene. This is a very concerning aspect of this legislation. 


This legislation proposes to move the National Water Commission's reporting requirements on the National Water Initiative and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan over to the Productivity Commission. This is not satisfactory. It will really degrade this work. It is a concern to the Greens and should be a concern to all who care about the future of our water planning. You will hear many people here say that, but if they are sincere they will keep the National Water Commission.


As a number of submissions to the inquiry on this legislation have pointed out, the commission does not yet have the expertise needed to advise on these matters. The Productivity Commission's expertise is in economic matters, not those of the environment. That is set out when you look at the objects of how the Productivity Commission works. It is very clear. It is quite narrow—we are not disputing that—but it does not have the expertise and background to take on the important work of the NWC. 


The Productivity Commission was never established with the management of environmental matters in mind. It came about in 1998 out of the combination of the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. Its legislation reflects these priorities very clearly. Part 2, section 6 of the act, 'Functions of commission' sets this out. It uses the phrase: 'industry, industry development and productivity', and it uses those terms five times. Nowhere is the environment mentioned. Not once. Protecting the environment is not a function of the Productivity Commission. 


Part 2, section 8 of the act, the policy guidelines for the Productivity Commission, is about economic performance, reducing regulation, encouraging growth and economic adjustments, and other issues to do with the economy and industry. It is not until we get down to part 2, section 8(1)(i) that we see the term 'ecologically sustainable'. This still is only in the context of industry development. It is not set out in terms of an environmental judgement; the environment is not a key consideration of how this body undertakes its work. 


The Productivity Commission has multiple competing priorities in its reporting requirements. It is not able to sufficiently capture—and nor does this legislation allow it to—the breadth of work carried out by the National Water Commission. That is a key point. I know that the government has been lobbying hard to get support for taking the work of the National Water Commission over to the Productivity Commission, and making out that the Productivity Commission can cover the important endeavours and work undertaken by the NWC. But right now, with how the Productivity Commission is actually structured, that is not possible. 


The ongoing functions of the National Water Commission, in particular relating to stakeholder engagement on all water related issues, are nowhere to be found in this legislation. Imagine that! Stakeholder engagement is not found in this legislation; it is a key part of how the National Water Commission has operated and that is what we will lose if this bill goes through. Some minimal functions go to the Department of the Environment and others, but there is no central coordination of all these issues. That is another very worrying aspect; we need that central coordination and that is what we could lose. This I suggest is precisely what the government wants. There is an agenda here, pushed by the government, and this is part of it. 


The government's approach is really quite fragmented. It removes the thorough leadership and the continuity offered by the commission. The government's plan to remove the National Water Commission is not leadership; it is not even the management we need when it comes to water policy across this country. Sustaining our water supply and protecting the environment should be our top priority. That is what we could lose if this bill goes through.


Hearings at the inquiry into this legislation have made it abundantly clear that contrary to government claims that the National Water Commission has done its job and that water is well covered by other government bodies, water reform at the state level is at risk of unravelling if we lose the National Water Commission.


In my state of New South Wales we have seen the consolidation of water bodies at the same time as water licenses are, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation, being handed out to farmers who have illegally diverted water. This is what we mean about 'unravelling'. Not only is there a lack of integration but some very dubious practices are being allowed to play out, and that threatens our water resources. 


Following the abolition of Queensland's Water Commissioner that state is keeping up its reputation for really tearing apart anything to do with the environment by amending its water act to automatically grant licences to mine coal seam gas operations. That can be a direct threat to our water resources. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to happen automatically. 


The picture is no better elsewhere. In Victoria, water protections are being weakened, and in Western Australia and the Northern Territory they are not compliant with the National Water Initiative. The National Water Commission itself has argued that water has fallen off the COAG agenda. This is actually not a surprise since it seems that the current policy of coalition governments at state and federal levels is a return to the laissez-faire days where we allow irresponsible use of water resources until there is another emergency. Governments may get away with letting anything happen to water resources and not have the plans and limits in place, but there will be another that drought. There will be another extreme weather event associated with climate change. There will be another weather emergency that we need to respond to and that is why we need to retain the National Water Commission—so we are well placed for that response, we are ready for it and we can take the measures to limit the impact of those very damaging extreme weather events


Crucial areas of water policy that were highlighted by the inquiry into this legislation but were not covered at all by this legislation demonstrate the need for real leadership on water policy. When you get rid of the National Water Commission, you are basically getting rid of leadership in this area. The commission's job to identify areas in need of reform and begin those discussions is the gap that will be left by the commission.


One of those crucial areas is Indigenous water rights. Working on Indigenous water rights with the First People's Water Engagement Council, the commission earned itself a most important and well-earned reputation for its consultative approach to these issues. This process involved extensive engagement culminating in a First People's National Water Summit, which gave advice to the commission in May 2012. It was outstanding and I would say it was historic—and, again, it underlines how much we stand to lose if this bill goes through.


The initiative has already wound back the Indigenous Water Advisory Committee formed by the Department of the Environment in June this year. This is a pattern we are seeing with this government. This legislation has not gone through yet but there has been so many steps that this government has taken, so many actions to actually gut the National Water Commission before the legislation gets here. I think it is a very immoral and undemocratic way that they operate.


The story of these organisations is a sad indictment on the way governments too often operate in their interactions with Indigenous people. For the first time, the Aboriginal community had been engaged on these issues. Such much would have been achieved at the meetings and roundtables of these organisations. There had been talk of even adding an Indigenous Commissioner to the National Water Commission. How impressive is that? Progress was being made but what we have seen is a government that makes out it has a commitment to Indigenous issues. It will even make out it has a commitment to decent water policies but, in that quite simple but very negative damaging act, it has set back the rights of Indigenous people with regard to water in this country. The closure of the National Water Commission will be the final step in undoing these important processes.


We have also seen initiatives from the commission highlighting the potential impact of coal seam gas on our water supplies. Across the nation, I am sure many of us have witnessed in the last three or four years in particular an explosion of local communities coming together opposing coal seam gas and mining projects. Often they are farmers whose livelihood depends on the safety and health of their water. Whenever I visit these communities, the issue that is raised is: how do we protect our water now and into the future? The National Water Commission raised this issue in 2010 and continued to voice concerns that this is an area which needs more work.


Staying in New South Wales and looking to our northwest, there is an ongoing drought there. This is a real reminder that what will happen in this country is there will be another drought. There will be massive droughts and droughts located in certain areas. We need to be prepared. We have much more knowledge these days. But we need the National Water Commission to provide that integrated leadership. We may have recovered from the millennium drought, and we may have negotiated—and I emphasise 'negotiated'—a plan to recover the Murray-Darling, but the work of water reform is far from over. The negotiations are not really finished despite what we are hearing from the minister. I would have hoped that we would learn from this process. It is very expensive to retrospectively fix a problem with water and sometimes it is not possible. And I would point out to Minister Joyce, who seems to think that if we just build massive dams everywhere we will be fine, you have to have the water to start with. Dams do not create water, as the minister seems to allude to in some of his ridiculous statements. Not only do we need to preserve our water but we need to ensure we do it in a way that is clean.


We also need to make sure we will not be diverting water from places where it is desperately needed—and that is another great failing of Minister Joyce's approach to water conservation in this country. It is a not only a grave mistake to destroy our only body, the National Water Commission, that is independent and has the relevant expertise to guide our governments on water policy but it is really utterly irresponsible.


As was pointed out to the committee investigating this legislation, keeping the National Water Commission would push the government's budget out by one-ten thousandth of a percent. This is not a budget measure in this case. We often can identify what is a budget measure—obviously the higher education bill this week has been a standout. This bill, however, is not a budget measure. You really feel it is ideologically driven because the government wants to strip down the quite simple but not extensive leadership and at times control the National Water Commission has in this area because it wants to be able to favour its big constituents—those who need big water operations for their activities in rural Australia. Again, that is very short-term thinking, even short-term thinking for those who will benefit in the short run. Because right now we need to be doing everything to bring our water policy to a point where it is responsible, not just for certain users but for the whole nation, not just for this generation but for future generations and not just for those of us in the city but for those of us across the whole country. And environmental protection needs to be a part of that.


As was pointed out to the committee investigating this legislation, keeping the National Water Commission would push the government budget, as I said, out by just a fraction. That is a bargain. I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote against abolishing the National Water Commission and to support the reinstatement of funding that is about to go to the Productivity Commission if this bill is passed. The National Water Commission still has its leadership in place. All its fine work is still there: the need to address issues across the nation—integration between the states and to take forward the National Water Initiative—is work that remains to be done. This bill should not pass.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:00):  I rise to speak to the National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014. In 2004, the Howard government established the National Water Commission, or NWC, as part of the National Water Initiative—the national plan for sustainable water use in Australia—to ensure that communities and industry have a reliable water supply, while protecting the health of our water systems. It was set up in recognition of the need for national water leadership to help address serious challenges. These included drought and climate change, water's role in securing Australia's economic and environmental future, the value of water for recreation and tourism, the need to advance the sustainable use of water and the impacts of fast-growing cities on water availability and delivery.


Labor contends that these issues are just as important today as they were in 2004. We believe this bill will create a huge gap in the area of national water oversight and will threaten ongoing water reform for very little gain. I was the deputy chair of the inquiry into this bill through the Environment and Communications Committee. The inquiry received 32 submissions from a range of stakeholders, experts, government bodies and interested individuals. Many submissions pointed out Australia's excellent international reputation for taking early, decisive action in the area of water reform. This was particularly evident in the case of the millennium drought, which resulted in large portions of the country being drought declared and which saw the federal government provide $4.5 billion in assistance.


On this issue, the OECD's 2012 report entitled Meeting the water reform challenge said:


… some countries have been at the cutting edge of water policy innovation and have developed sophisticated policy frameworks to address water challenges.


Australia, for example, has had a long period of water policy reform …


There is little doubt that the National Water Commission played an important role in this proud history, and to abolish it now would be short-sighted to say the least. Not one sector of our economy could survive if we did not have secure, safe and strategically managed water supplies. Our economic, environmental and personal health and, indeed, the stability of our society, relies on the security and strategic allocation of water resources.


It has been said that water is either an A-level issue or a Z-level issue. That is to say that in times of drought, or when concerns about scarcity or pollution arise, water quickly shoots to the top of the political and media agendas. However, a little while after the crisis passes, complacency can set in and water can slip off the policy radar. Attention wanes and resources are allocated to other issues. But we need to recognise that it is the solid, ongoing reform work that is done during 'Z' times that ensures that 'A' times do not hit or, if they do, that we are better equipped to respond to them. To cut funding to vital water reform institutions just because we have had a few good years of rain is short-sighted to say the least. If we do not maintain resources now, we will force a hastily-invoked crisis response when water challenges inevitably arise in the future.


Submitters to the inquiry told the committee how crucial the NWC has been to the progress that has been made so far on the National Water Initiative. Again and again, the committee heard concerns for the future of this important reform if the NWC is lost. In fact, it was hard to find any criticism of the NWC in the submissions.


Here are just a few comments to give you an idea of the regard held for the commission and the critical role it has played in our water management arrangements. Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science, Prof. Richard Kingsford said:


The National Water Commission has performed and excellent service in coordinating water reform in Australia, as an independent organisation at arm’s length of state and Federal governments.


Environs Kimberley said in their submission:


The importance of the Commission’s role in providing independent expert advice on matters of national water reform and assessing and monitoring the National Water Initiative (NWI) cannot be overstated.


The Arid Lands Environment Centre said:


The National Water Initiative has provided critical support for national decision-making on issues related to water management. The long-term vision and independence of the Commission has provided Australia with a world class national water policy framework that has supported a holistic approach to water management and water reform.


Stormwater Qld said:


The National Water Initiative, facilitated by the National Water Commission (NWC), provides the opportunity to augment the economically, socially and environmentally efficient management of water in Australia.  We believe the NWC has played an important role in advancing total water cycle management and water sensitive urban design in Australia.


The Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre said:


There has been substantial technical innovation and reform by industry and state governments in meeting urban water needs across Australia in recent years, in large part driven by the challenges of changing climate conditions and drought. We believe that these initiatives were greatly assisted by the national focus that resulted from the establishment of the National Water Commission (NWC) in 2004 and the development of the National Water Initiative (NWI).


These words all echo the findings of the independent COAG review into the NWC, which was undertaken in 2011. The report of the review recognises the importance of the NWC in Australia's strategic water reform arrangements when it says:


Having a single entity responsible for monitoring, audit and assessment, and knowledge leadership therefore enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of each of the individual activities. This will become even more important in the future as reforms become more difficult.


Which begs the question: if the vast majority of stakeholders rate the work of the commission so highly, then why is the government persisting with its abolition?


The main argument used by the government to justify the actions of the National Water Commission is that it will save money. However, as the Australian Conservation Foundation pointed out in their submission to the inquiry 'the potential savings represent less than 0.0001 per cent of our annual budget'. Surely the care and management of our most precious national resource is worth that much. We also need to look at what we stand to lose with the savings touted by those opposite. On this matter Stormwater Queensland said:


We believe the economic costs of abolishing the [National Water Commission], in terms of inefficient water management, are likely to far outweigh that cost.


The government has said the key functions of the National Water Commission will be carried over to other bodies including ABARES, the Productivity Commission and the Department of the Environment. However, submitters to the inquiry contradict this view. The submissions from the Australian Water Association and the Water Services Association pointed out that the bill transfers only two statutory functions to the Productivity Commission. Similarly, the Australian Conservation Foundation raised concerns in their submission that a number of legislative policy advice functions have not been transferred in the new arrangements.


Another factor to consider is resourcing. We know that the National Water Commission had 41 staff before the budget, but questioning during the hearing revealed that only 12 or 13 of these staff will transfer to the department. Surely, the government cannot really expect us to believe resources can be cut by two-thirds with no loss of output, stringency or depth. We will need to remember that this situation can only be exacerbated by the broad staff cuts that are currently being inflicted on the Public Service. The reality is that the government's argument about cost savings does not stack up. The committee has been told that in fact the opposite is true. We simply cannot afford to drop the ball on water reform now.


Another argument the government has used in its attempt to axe the NWC is that, in the words of Senator Birmingham, 'much of the commission's reform work has already been done'. However, Senator Birmingham's statement is contradicted by the vast majority of expert advice. In fact, the COAG review I mentioned earlier also had a bit to say about the state of water reform in Australia when it said:


The NWI remains a relevant and active reform agenda supported by most stakeholders.


It added:


The elements of the NWI still to be implemented are, by their nature, the more difficult ones and the role that can be played by a specialist and independent body like the NWC is likely to be … more important in the future.


Submitters to the inquiry also concurred with this perspective. On this issue, the Australian Conservation Foundation said:


National water reform, as envisaged under the National Water Initiative is a long term journey. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go, particularly within the context of changes to the use of water resources in northern Australia.


Submissions from the Australian Water Association, the Water Services Association of Australia and Konfluence noted that the reasons that the Howard government established the NWC are just as relevant today as they were 10 years ago. They also pointed out that a number of new challenges have arisen to make the task even more complex. These include the role of water management in energy production, generation and use of energy in water management, the potential alignment of water, energy and waste services at a retail level, the special issue of water management in northern Australia and balancing the creation of long-lived assets such as desalination plants against short-term affordability issues.


All three submissions also acknowledged the very contemporary issue of water management in the resources sector, especially coal seam gas. And all three submissions echoed the concerns of many when they said that meeting these challenges will be harder 'without national leadership' and could result in 'inferior outcomes for customers, industry and the environment'. The Australian Water Association also saw the need for specific reforms in the areas of water pricing, trading and infrastructure as well as long-term sustainability in urban and rural water use.


The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists was also very specific in its analysis of the work still to be done and provided the inquiry with a long list of areas where reform is still needed. These included the treatment of extreme events in water plans, improvement and expansion of water markets, integrated management of surface and groundwater, identification of over-allocated systems, environmental watering monitoring, urban and rural water pricing and the impacts of water planning decisions for Indigenous communities. So we can see that there is a clear conflict between the government's claims that reform work is largely complete and the expert testimony that the water reform journey has just begun. Unlike this government, Labor is willing to listen to the experts. And unlike this government, we are not willing to compromise Australia's ability to respond to the ongoing challenges of water reform.


Another concern shared by many of the submitters to the inquiry was that the abolition of the NWC would see a loss of independent oversight of Australia's water arrangements and the National Water Initiative. Submitters recognised the value of an independent body that can provide frank and fearless advice to governments and maintain a long-term perspective that transcends election cycles. On this issue, Environment Centre NT submitted:


Independent Federal oversight of the NWI is required to ensure water resources are far less likely to become depleted, that resource allocation decisions are made under a fair, transparent and informed process.


Importantly, research conducted and funded by the NWC has also been critical to building well-informed decision-making processes around water resource allocation and management.


Many submitters took particular note of the important role the NWC has played in overseeing the actions of the states, which are largely responsible for implementing actions within the National Water Initiative. On this matter, University of New South Wales's Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science, Professor Richard Kingsford, raised concerns about the potential for 'a loss of engagement and accountability of the states and what they are doing'. He went on to say, 'That is my biggest concern about the National Water Initiative'. Interestingly, it was not that long ago that those opposite seemed to agree. In fact, in 2012 Senator Simon Birmingham said the National Water Commission's:


… role in holding the states and the Commonwealth to account for actually delivering on water reform is [vital].


Clearly, the Abbott government is no longer concerned about ensuring accountability, but Labor are, and this is yet another reason we will be opposing this bill.


Another big concern the committee heard with the abolition of the NWC is the enormous amount of knowledge and expertise that we stand to lose. Currently, the National Water Commission Act specifies the areas of high level expertise required by commissioners for appointment, including water resource management; freshwater ecology or hydrology; resource economics; public sector governance; and the audit, evaluation or implementation of programs relating to natural resource management.


The National Farmers Federation called for this expertise requirement to be maintained in the transfer of National Water Commission functions to the Productivity Commission. Sadly, if this bill proceeds, this will not happen and Australia will lose this incredible bank of knowledge and experience. Under questioning, the Productivity Commission conceded that this expertise does not exist within the organisation and would have to be hired in on a needs basis. This is very different from having ongoing in-house expertise that can inform every element of water reform, and Labor does not believe that it is sufficient.


Labor are concerned that if the bill proceeds, Australia will lose this expertise and with it the ability to make the best decisions based on the latest scientific information. As part of this bill, responsibility for assessing progress on the National Water Initiative and for auditing of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan as well as monitoring water markets and payments to Basin states would transfer to the Productivity Commission. While no-one would suggest that the Productivity Commission is not an excellent and laudable institution, the inquiry heard many concerns that the NWC role in stakeholder engagement and consultation would be lost if the bill proceeds. Many submitters lauded the success of the NWC's coordination and consultative processes, which have been performed through its stakeholder reference group. And many voiced concerns that the Productivity Commission is not equipped to take on this type of ongoing consultation and engagement. 


In this regard, the National Farmers Federation recommended that the Productivity Commission institute a stakeholder reference panel, but, unfortunately, this option is not on the table. Labor is persuaded by the arguments of the NFF and other submitters that the NWC's consultative role is vital and that it will not adequately be supported in the new arrangements.


Another commonly voiced concern with the transfer of functions to the Productivity Commission is that of focus. Many were worried that the Productivity Commission's prime focus on economic factors would see the vitally important social and environmental factors reduced to a lower priority. The National Farmers Federation were particularly concerned about this and recommended in their submission that the Productivity Commission should be required to adopt a triple bottom-line approach to their proposed water functions. Realistically, however, this change will not be made with this bill, and if it is passed the concerns of the NFF will still stand.


One of the only submitters that fully supported the government's proposed abolition of the NWC and associated arrangements was the National Irrigators Council. Unfortunately, many of the concerns raised by this council in its submission actually will not be addressed by this bill. Issues raised are unlikely to be affected at all by the abolition of the National Water Commission.


Labor stand in unity with the vast majority of submitters to the inquiry into this bill that a national, coordinated approach to water reform is needed to deliver on the National Water Initiative. We believe that the National Water Commission provides valuable, frank and independent advice to governments of all persuasions across jurisdictions. We believe that the NWC's level of expertise and role in bringing stakeholders together cannot be lost. We believe the NWC has a proven track record for promoting the need for and benefits of ongoing water reform, and ensuring plans are made to secure Australia's economic future.


We believe this plan threatens the stability, coherence and accountability of Australia's water reform and puts it at serious risk of falling off the agenda entirely. We do not believe that the very small annual saving goes anywhere near compensating the losses that this bill will create in terms of expertise and the fulfilment of other functions. We also believe that for such a small saving, we simply cannot risk the possibility that we will drop the ball on water reform.


Clearly, this amount of money is negligible when compared to the future of water in this country. And, clearly, when this government is willing to spend billions of dollars to pay millionaires to have babies, we can see some seriously twisted priorities at play. As in so many areas, the statements of this government are at a variance with the experts who deal with this issue every day of their professional lives. Again, this government is ignoring the advice of scientists and experts in— (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,32,1
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-12-03,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:42):  The Greens do not support the National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014. The National Water Commission is a most important organisation that we really do need to retain. It provides crucial oversight of our water policies. It is worth remembering that it operates with a very small team, doing important work. I understand that that team recently went from about 41 down to eight. 


The commission has provided government and industry with quality information needed to make good decisions about the effectiveness of our current water policies and directions for the future. What is being lost here is the integrated approach. The integrated approach is so important when it comes to water, and that is what the commission has provided for water policy in the 10 years of its existence. We really cannot afford to lose it. It is of grave concern to me that, given the current threats to our water supplies from climate change and the mining industry, in particular, and the ongoing struggles between water used for production and water used for the environment, we are looking at removing the only body that brings together oversight of our water policy. 


It is true that there are other bodies that provide important information in this area, such as the government's Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. But the National Water Commission is the place where these groups actually come together to sort through these issues. The processes of the National Water Initiative and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan have been well shepherded by the commission. This work is still tenuous and needs ongoing support. Removing the National Water Commission sends the wrong message to those involved in these processes. It is of great concern to me, as the National Water Commission itself has pointed out, that the proposed reporting date for the first audit of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been moved to 2018 in this legislation. We have already had delays in the readiness of this plan, which is why the commission was able to offer only an interim report in 2013. 


This is one of the crucial aspects of this legislation that underlines why this bill should not pass. We need oversight of the Murray-Darling Basin process from an independent body. That is what we have right now. And that is what we could lose. As many of the stakeholders in this debate have noted, the government cannot be marking its own homework. That was the message we heard time and again at the inquiry that was held into this legislation. Yet, under the government's plans, the marking does not even occur. The plan will be implemented before we are able to intervene. This is a very concerning aspect of this legislation. 


This legislation proposes to move the National Water Commission's reporting requirements on the National Water Initiative and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan over to the Productivity Commission. This is not satisfactory. It will really degrade this work. It is a concern to the Greens and should be a concern to all who care about the future of our water planning. You will hear many people here say that, but if they are sincere they will keep the National Water Commission.


As a number of submissions to the inquiry on this legislation have pointed out, the commission does not yet have the expertise needed to advise on these matters. The Productivity Commission's expertise is in economic matters, not those of the environment. That is set out when you look at the objects of how the Productivity Commission works. It is very clear. It is quite narrow—we are not disputing that—but it does not have the expertise and background to take on the important work of the NWC. 


The Productivity Commission was never established with the management of environmental matters in mind. It came about in 1998 out of the combination of the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. Its legislation reflects these priorities very clearly. Part 2, section 6 of the act, 'Functions of commission' sets this out. It uses the phrase: 'industry, industry development and productivity', and it uses those terms five times. Nowhere is the environment mentioned. Not once. Protecting the environment is not a function of the Productivity Commission. 


Part 2, section 8 of the act, the policy guidelines for the Productivity Commission, is about economic performance, reducing regulation, encouraging growth and economic adjustments, and other issues to do with the economy and industry. It is not until we get down to part 2, section 8(1)(i) that we see the term 'ecologically sustainable'. This still is only in the context of industry development. It is not set out in terms of an environmental judgement; the environment is not a key consideration of how this body undertakes its work. 


The Productivity Commission has multiple competing priorities in its reporting requirements. It is not able to sufficiently capture—and nor does this legislation allow it to—the breadth of work carried out by the National Water Commission. That is a key point. I know that the government has been lobbying hard to get support for taking the work of the National Water Commission over to the Productivity Commission, and making out that the Productivity Commission can cover the important endeavours and work undertaken by the NWC. But right now, with how the Productivity Commission is actually structured, that is not possible. 


The ongoing functions of the National Water Commission, in particular relating to stakeholder engagement on all water related issues, are nowhere to be found in this legislation. Imagine that! Stakeholder engagement is not found in this legislation; it is a key part of how the National Water Commission has operated and that is what we will lose if this bill goes through. Some minimal functions go to the Department of the Environment and others, but there is no central coordination of all these issues. That is another very worrying aspect; we need that central coordination and that is what we could lose. This I suggest is precisely what the government wants. There is an agenda here, pushed by the government, and this is part of it. 


The government's approach is really quite fragmented. It removes the thorough leadership and the continuity offered by the commission. The government's plan to remove the National Water Commission is not leadership; it is not even the management we need when it comes to water policy across this country. Sustaining our water supply and protecting the environment should be our top priority. That is what we could lose if this bill goes through.


Hearings at the inquiry into this legislation have made it abundantly clear that contrary to government claims that the National Water Commission has done its job and that water is well covered by other government bodies, water reform at the state level is at risk of unravelling if we lose the National Water Commission.


In my state of New South Wales we have seen the consolidation of water bodies at the same time as water licenses are, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation, being handed out to farmers who have illegally diverted water. This is what we mean about 'unravelling'. Not only is there a lack of integration but some very dubious practices are being allowed to play out, and that threatens our water resources. 


Following the abolition of Queensland's Water Commissioner that state is keeping up its reputation for really tearing apart anything to do with the environment by amending its water act to automatically grant licences to mine coal seam gas operations. That can be a direct threat to our water resources. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to happen automatically. 


The picture is no better elsewhere. In Victoria, water protections are being weakened, and in Western Australia and the Northern Territory they are not compliant with the National Water Initiative. The National Water Commission itself has argued that water has fallen off the COAG agenda. This is actually not a surprise since it seems that the current policy of coalition governments at state and federal levels is a return to the laissez-faire days where we allow irresponsible use of water resources until there is another emergency. Governments may get away with letting anything happen to water resources and not have the plans and limits in place, but there will be another that drought. There will be another extreme weather event associated with climate change. There will be another weather emergency that we need to respond to and that is why we need to retain the National Water Commission—so we are well placed for that response, we are ready for it and we can take the measures to limit the impact of those very damaging extreme weather events


Crucial areas of water policy that were highlighted by the inquiry into this legislation but were not covered at all by this legislation demonstrate the need for real leadership on water policy. When you get rid of the National Water Commission, you are basically getting rid of leadership in this area. The commission's job to identify areas in need of reform and begin those discussions is the gap that will be left by the commission.


One of those crucial areas is Indigenous water rights. Working on Indigenous water rights with the First People's Water Engagement Council, the commission earned itself a most important and well-earned reputation for its consultative approach to these issues. This process involved extensive engagement culminating in a First People's National Water Summit, which gave advice to the commission in May 2012. It was outstanding and I would say it was historic—and, again, it underlines how much we stand to lose if this bill goes through.


The initiative has already wound back the Indigenous Water Advisory Committee formed by the Department of the Environment in June this year. This is a pattern we are seeing with this government. This legislation has not gone through yet but there has been so many steps that this government has taken, so many actions to actually gut the National Water Commission before the legislation gets here. I think it is a very immoral and undemocratic way that they operate.


The story of these organisations is a sad indictment on the way governments too often operate in their interactions with Indigenous people. For the first time, the Aboriginal community had been engaged on these issues. Such much would have been achieved at the meetings and roundtables of these organisations. There had been talk of even adding an Indigenous Commissioner to the National Water Commission. How impressive is that? Progress was being made but what we have seen is a government that makes out it has a commitment to Indigenous issues. It will even make out it has a commitment to decent water policies but, in that quite simple but very negative damaging act, it has set back the rights of Indigenous people with regard to water in this country. The closure of the National Water Commission will be the final step in undoing these important processes.


We have also seen initiatives from the commission highlighting the potential impact of coal seam gas on our water supplies. Across the nation, I am sure many of us have witnessed in the last three or four years in particular an explosion of local communities coming together opposing coal seam gas and mining projects. Often they are farmers whose livelihood depends on the safety and health of their water. Whenever I visit these communities, the issue that is raised is: how do we protect our water now and into the future? The National Water Commission raised this issue in 2010 and continued to voice concerns that this is an area which needs more work.


Staying in New South Wales and looking to our northwest, there is an ongoing drought there. This is a real reminder that what will happen in this country is there will be another drought. There will be massive droughts and droughts located in certain areas. We need to be prepared. We have much more knowledge these days. But we need the National Water Commission to provide that integrated leadership. We may have recovered from the millennium drought, and we may have negotiated—and I emphasise 'negotiated'—a plan to recover the Murray-Darling, but the work of water reform is far from over. The negotiations are not really finished despite what we are hearing from the minister. I would have hoped that we would learn from this process. It is very expensive to retrospectively fix a problem with water and sometimes it is not possible. And I would point out to Minister Joyce, who seems to think that if we just build massive dams everywhere we will be fine, you have to have the water to start with. Dams do not create water, as the minister seems to allude to in some of his ridiculous statements. Not only do we need to preserve our water but we need to ensure we do it in a way that is clean.


We also need to make sure we will not be diverting water from places where it is desperately needed—and that is another great failing of Minister Joyce's approach to water conservation in this country. It is a not only a grave mistake to destroy our only body, the National Water Commission, that is independent and has the relevant expertise to guide our governments on water policy but it is really utterly irresponsible.


As was pointed out to the committee investigating this legislation, keeping the National Water Commission would push the government's budget out by one-ten thousandth of a percent. This is not a budget measure in this case. We often can identify what is a budget measure—obviously the higher education bill this week has been a standout. This bill, however, is not a budget measure. You really feel it is ideologically driven because the government wants to strip down the quite simple but not extensive leadership and at times control the National Water Commission has in this area because it wants to be able to favour its big constituents—those who need big water operations for their activities in rural Australia. Again, that is very short-term thinking, even short-term thinking for those who will benefit in the short run. Because right now we need to be doing everything to bring our water policy to a point where it is responsible, not just for certain users but for the whole nation, not just for this generation but for future generations and not just for those of us in the city but for those of us across the whole country. And environmental protection needs to be a part of that.


As was pointed out to the committee investigating this legislation, keeping the National Water Commission would push the government budget, as I said, out by just a fraction. That is a bargain. I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote against abolishing the National Water Commission and to support the reinstatement of funding that is about to go to the Productivity Commission if this bill is passed. The National Water Commission still has its leadership in place. All its fine work is still there: the need to address issues across the nation—integration between the states and to take forward the National Water Initiative—is work that remains to be done. This bill should not pass.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:00):  I rise to speak to the National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014. In 2004, the Howard government established the National Water Commission, or NWC, as part of the National Water Initiative—the national plan for sustainable water use in Australia—to ensure that communities and industry have a reliable water supply, while protecting the health of our water systems. It was set up in recognition of the need for national water leadership to help address serious challenges. These included drought and climate change, water's role in securing Australia's economic and environmental future, the value of water for recreation and tourism, the need to advance the sustainable use of water and the impacts of fast-growing cities on water availability and delivery.


Labor contends that these issues are just as important today as they were in 2004. We believe this bill will create a huge gap in the area of national water oversight and will threaten ongoing water reform for very little gain. I was the deputy chair of the inquiry into this bill through the Environment and Communications Committee. The inquiry received 32 submissions from a range of stakeholders, experts, government bodies and interested individuals. Many submissions pointed out Australia's excellent international reputation for taking early, decisive action in the area of water reform. This was particularly evident in the case of the millennium drought, which resulted in large portions of the country being drought declared and which saw the federal government provide $4.5 billion in assistance.


On this issue, the OECD's 2012 report entitled Meeting the water reform challenge said:


… some countries have been at the cutting edge of water policy innovation and have developed sophisticated policy frameworks to address water challenges.


Australia, for example, has had a long period of water policy reform …


There is little doubt that the National Water Commission played an important role in this proud history, and to abolish it now would be short-sighted to say the least. Not one sector of our economy could survive if we did not have secure, safe and strategically managed water supplies. Our economic, environmental and personal health and, indeed, the stability of our society, relies on the security and strategic allocation of water resources.


It has been said that water is either an A-level issue or a Z-level issue. That is to say that in times of drought, or when concerns about scarcity or pollution arise, water quickly shoots to the top of the political and media agendas. However, a little while after the crisis passes, complacency can set in and water can slip off the policy radar. Attention wanes and resources are allocated to other issues. But we need to recognise that it is the solid, ongoing reform work that is done during 'Z' times that ensures that 'A' times do not hit or, if they do, that we are better equipped to respond to them. To cut funding to vital water reform institutions just because we have had a few good years of rain is short-sighted to say the least. If we do not maintain resources now, we will force a hastily-invoked crisis response when water challenges inevitably arise in the future.


Submitters to the inquiry told the committee how crucial the NWC has been to the progress that has been made so far on the National Water Initiative. Again and again, the committee heard concerns for the future of this important reform if the NWC is lost. In fact, it was hard to find any criticism of the NWC in the submissions.


Here are just a few comments to give you an idea of the regard held for the commission and the critical role it has played in our water management arrangements. Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science, Prof. Richard Kingsford said:


The National Water Commission has performed and excellent service in coordinating water reform in Australia, as an independent organisation at arm’s length of state and Federal governments.


Environs Kimberley said in their submission:


The importance of the Commission’s role in providing independent expert advice on matters of national water reform and assessing and monitoring the National Water Initiative (NWI) cannot be overstated.


The Arid Lands Environment Centre said:


The National Water Initiative has provided critical support for national decision-making on issues related to water management. The long-term vision and independence of the Commission has provided Australia with a world class national water policy framework that has supported a holistic approach to water management and water reform.


Stormwater Qld said:


The National Water Initiative, facilitated by the National Water Commission (NWC), provides the opportunity to augment the economically, socially and environmentally efficient management of water in Australia.  We believe the NWC has played an important role in advancing total water cycle management and water sensitive urban design in Australia.


The Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre said:


There has been substantial technical innovation and reform by industry and state governments in meeting urban water needs across Australia in recent years, in large part driven by the challenges of changing climate conditions and drought. We believe that these initiatives were greatly assisted by the national focus that resulted from the establishment of the National Water Commission (NWC) in 2004 and the development of the National Water Initiative (NWI).


These words all echo the findings of the independent COAG review into the NWC, which was undertaken in 2011. The report of the review recognises the importance of the NWC in Australia's strategic water reform arrangements when it says:


Having a single entity responsible for monitoring, audit and assessment, and knowledge leadership therefore enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of each of the individual activities. This will become even more important in the future as reforms become more difficult.


Which begs the question: if the vast majority of stakeholders rate the work of the commission so highly, then why is the government persisting with its abolition?


The main argument used by the government to justify the actions of the National Water Commission is that it will save money. However, as the Australian Conservation Foundation pointed out in their submission to the inquiry 'the potential savings represent less than 0.0001 per cent of our annual budget'. Surely the care and management of our most precious national resource is worth that much. We also need to look at what we stand to lose with the savings touted by those opposite. On this matter Stormwater Queensland said:


We believe the economic costs of abolishing the [National Water Commission], in terms of inefficient water management, are likely to far outweigh that cost.


The government has said the key functions of the National Water Commission will be carried over to other bodies including ABARES, the Productivity Commission and the Department of the Environment. However, submitters to the inquiry contradict this view. The submissions from the Australian Water Association and the Water Services Association pointed out that the bill transfers only two statutory functions to the Productivity Commission. Similarly, the Australian Conservation Foundation raised concerns in their submission that a number of legislative policy advice functions have not been transferred in the new arrangements.


Another factor to consider is resourcing. We know that the National Water Commission had 41 staff before the budget, but questioning during the hearing revealed that only 12 or 13 of these staff will transfer to the department. Surely, the government cannot really expect us to believe resources can be cut by two-thirds with no loss of output, stringency or depth. We will need to remember that this situation can only be exacerbated by the broad staff cuts that are currently being inflicted on the Public Service. The reality is that the government's argument about cost savings does not stack up. The committee has been told that in fact the opposite is true. We simply cannot afford to drop the ball on water reform now.


Another argument the government has used in its attempt to axe the NWC is that, in the words of Senator Birmingham, 'much of the commission's reform work has already been done'. However, Senator Birmingham's statement is contradicted by the vast majority of expert advice. In fact, the COAG review I mentioned earlier also had a bit to say about the state of water reform in Australia when it said:


The NWI remains a relevant and active reform agenda supported by most stakeholders.


It added:


The elements of the NWI still to be implemented are, by their nature, the more difficult ones and the role that can be played by a specialist and independent body like the NWC is likely to be … more important in the future.


Submitters to the inquiry also concurred with this perspective. On this issue, the Australian Conservation Foundation said:


National water reform, as envisaged under the National Water Initiative is a long term journey. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go, particularly within the context of changes to the use of water resources in northern Australia.


Submissions from the Australian Water Association, the Water Services Association of Australia and Konfluence noted that the reasons that the Howard government established the NWC are just as relevant today as they were 10 years ago. They also pointed out that a number of new challenges have arisen to make the task even more complex. These include the role of water management in energy production, generation and use of energy in water management, the potential alignment of water, energy and waste services at a retail level, the special issue of water management in northern Australia and balancing the creation of long-lived assets such as desalination plants against short-term affordability issues.


All three submissions also acknowledged the very contemporary issue of water management in the resources sector, especially coal seam gas. And all three submissions echoed the concerns of many when they said that meeting these challenges will be harder 'without national leadership' and could result in 'inferior outcomes for customers, industry and the environment'. The Australian Water Association also saw the need for specific reforms in the areas of water pricing, trading and infrastructure as well as long-term sustainability in urban and rural water use.


The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists was also very specific in its analysis of the work still to be done and provided the inquiry with a long list of areas where reform is still needed. These included the treatment of extreme events in water plans, improvement and expansion of water markets, integrated management of surface and groundwater, identification of over-allocated systems, environmental watering monitoring, urban and rural water pricing and the impacts of water planning decisions for Indigenous communities. So we can see that there is a clear conflict between the government's claims that reform work is largely complete and the expert testimony that the water reform journey has just begun. Unlike this government, Labor is willing to listen to the experts. And unlike this government, we are not willing to compromise Australia's ability to respond to the ongoing challenges of water reform.


Another concern shared by many of the submitters to the inquiry was that the abolition of the NWC would see a loss of independent oversight of Australia's water arrangements and the National Water Initiative. Submitters recognised the value of an independent body that can provide frank and fearless advice to governments and maintain a long-term perspective that transcends election cycles. On this issue, Environment Centre NT submitted:


Independent Federal oversight of the NWI is required to ensure water resources are far less likely to become depleted, that resource allocation decisions are made under a fair, transparent and informed process.


Importantly, research conducted and funded by the NWC has also been critical to building well-informed decision-making processes around water resource allocation and management.


Many submitters took particular note of the important role the NWC has played in overseeing the actions of the states, which are largely responsible for implementing actions within the National Water Initiative. On this matter, University of New South Wales's Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science, Professor Richard Kingsford, raised concerns about the potential for 'a loss of engagement and accountability of the states and what they are doing'. He went on to say, 'That is my biggest concern about the National Water Initiative'. Interestingly, it was not that long ago that those opposite seemed to agree. In fact, in 2012 Senator Simon Birmingham said the National Water Commission's:


… role in holding the states and the Commonwealth to account for actually delivering on water reform is [vital].


Clearly, the Abbott government is no longer concerned about ensuring accountability, but Labor are, and this is yet another reason we will be opposing this bill.


Another big concern the committee heard with the abolition of the NWC is the enormous amount of knowledge and expertise that we stand to lose. Currently, the National Water Commission Act specifies the areas of high level expertise required by commissioners for appointment, including water resource management; freshwater ecology or hydrology; resource economics; public sector governance; and the audit, evaluation or implementation of programs relating to natural resource management.


The National Farmers Federation called for this expertise requirement to be maintained in the transfer of National Water Commission functions to the Productivity Commission. Sadly, if this bill proceeds, this will not happen and Australia will lose this incredible bank of knowledge and experience. Under questioning, the Productivity Commission conceded that this expertise does not exist within the organisation and would have to be hired in on a needs basis. This is very different from having ongoing in-house expertise that can inform every element of water reform, and Labor does not believe that it is sufficient.


Labor are concerned that if the bill proceeds, Australia will lose this expertise and with it the ability to make the best decisions based on the latest scientific information. As part of this bill, responsibility for assessing progress on the National Water Initiative and for auditing of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan as well as monitoring water markets and payments to Basin states would transfer to the Productivity Commission. While no-one would suggest that the Productivity Commission is not an excellent and laudable institution, the inquiry heard many concerns that the NWC role in stakeholder engagement and consultation would be lost if the bill proceeds. Many submitters lauded the success of the NWC's coordination and consultative processes, which have been performed through its stakeholder reference group. And many voiced concerns that the Productivity Commission is not equipped to take on this type of ongoing consultation and engagement. 


In this regard, the National Farmers Federation recommended that the Productivity Commission institute a stakeholder reference panel, but, unfortunately, this option is not on the table. Labor is persuaded by the arguments of the NFF and other submitters that the NWC's consultative role is vital and that it will not adequately be supported in the new arrangements.


Another commonly voiced concern with the transfer of functions to the Productivity Commission is that of focus. Many were worried that the Productivity Commission's prime focus on economic factors would see the vitally important social and environmental factors reduced to a lower priority. The National Farmers Federation were particularly concerned about this and recommended in their submission that the Productivity Commission should be required to adopt a triple bottom-line approach to their proposed water functions. Realistically, however, this change will not be made with this bill, and if it is passed the concerns of the NFF will still stand.


One of the only submitters that fully supported the government's proposed abolition of the NWC and associated arrangements was the National Irrigators Council. Unfortunately, many of the concerns raised by this council in its submission actually will not be addressed by this bill. Issues raised are unlikely to be affected at all by the abolition of the National Water Commission.


Labor stand in unity with the vast majority of submitters to the inquiry into this bill that a national, coordinated approach to water reform is needed to deliver on the National Water Initiative. We believe that the National Water Commission provides valuable, frank and independent advice to governments of all persuasions across jurisdictions. We believe that the NWC's level of expertise and role in bringing stakeholders together cannot be lost. We believe the NWC has a proven track record for promoting the need for and benefits of ongoing water reform, and ensuring plans are made to secure Australia's economic future.


We believe this plan threatens the stability, coherence and accountability of Australia's water reform and puts it at serious risk of falling off the agenda entirely. We do not believe that the very small annual saving goes anywhere near compensating the losses that this bill will create in terms of expertise and the fulfilment of other functions. We also believe that for such a small saving, we simply cannot risk the possibility that we will drop the ball on water reform.


Clearly, this amount of money is negligible when compared to the future of water in this country. And, clearly, when this government is willing to spend billions of dollars to pay millionaires to have babies, we can see some seriously twisted priorities at play. As in so many areas, the statements of this government are at a variance with the experts who deal with this issue every day of their professional lives. Again, this government is ignoring the advice of scientists and experts in— (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria—Deputy President of the Senate and Chair of Committees) (19:20):  I rise to congratulate Daniel Andrews, the hardworking frontbench and all the members of the Victorian Labor Party. Four years of hard work has paid off with the election of the Andrews government. One of the first acts of the Andrews government will be to resolve the long-running and unnecessary dispute with our paramedics, and to recall parliament to introduce the back to work act, helping to create 100,000 new jobs for retrenched workers and unemployed youth. Daniel Andrews and his new frontbench have a strong mandate to fix the problems in Victoria. They have a set of policies that were very popular in the community: fixing the worst 50 rail crossings, building the Metro Rail tunnel, fixing TAFE and making Victoria the education state to name but a few. I look forward to see these and other initiatives commenced or implemented over the next four years. There is little doubt in my mind that the Andrews government will be a hardworking and very competent government. Critically, they will need to address some key issues that have been left unresolved by the previous government.


Earlier this year, the body responsible for the oversight of the Victorian police force, the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission, or IBAC, asked the government for additional powers and resources so it could properly do its job. The legislation proposed by the previous government as a means to grant more powers to IBAC failed to make it to parliament before the election. This issue needs to be addressed by the Andrews government. IBAC is waiting for a response.


I have made a number of speeches in this chamber about the problems in the Victorian police force. In Victoria, we have a police force that undertakes its own internal investigations of complaints made against its own police. Time and time again, internal investigations of police by police have exonerated the actions of police, even in cases where the courts have found serious wrongdoing. We have a significant number of complaints about police, particularly in the case of police assaults. I believe we have a systemic problem in the Victorian police force. This is as a result of many police believing that they can act with impunity, and it appears that, in the vast majority of cases, they are right. The worst that will generally happen to them is some internal disciplinary charges. They can rely on their fellow officers to back up their version of events or indeed, as we know, concoct a completely new version of events to suit the circumstances.


On handing down a recent decision against police who had concocted a story to cover up an assault, Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg said Victoria Police appeared to suffer from a similar culture of silence to that of the criminal world. He went on to say that, in the criminal underworld, informing on a colleague was known as being a 'dog'. 'A similar culture, for whatever reason, existed in the Victorian police force.' I want to work with the new Andrews government to ensure that, in Victoria, we have a truly independent body to investigate complaints made against police and, importantly, to instigate charges against police for their misconduct.


We still have no action taken against the police who assaulted Corinna Horvath close to 20 years ago. The Magistrates' Court found that the police assaulted Corinna. The United Nations Human Rights Committee found that the state of Victoria failed to provide proper redress for Corinna. And yet we have seen little more than an apology and an ex gratia payment. Three of the four police officers who assaulted Corinna still work in the Victorian police force. Police officers involved should face the criminal charges identified by the County Court's Judge Williams back in 2001, where he found police at fault of assault, unlawful arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, and found that the police told lies on matters of major significance.


The bodies responsible for police oversight in Victoria—IBAC and the Office of Police Integrity, or the OPI—have proved to be completely ineffectual in that role. The OPI dedicated two pages of its 2010-11 annual report to a police raid on a small bungalow in Williamstown, where three teenagers—all minors—were assaulted, pepper sprayed and arrested. The OPI conducted an independent review and found that the police used excessive force, and then referred the incident back to Victoria Police for action. After conducting their own internal review, the police found that many of the OPI's findings were not valid and took no action against the police involved. The body responsible for police oversight was just completely ignored by the Victorian police force command.


One possible solution to this systemic crisis is already in operation internationally. The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's office provides the public with an independent and impartial investigation of complaints made against police. Northern Ireland's police ombudsman has the power to refer charges to the Public Prosecution Service and seek disciplinary action against police. The office has a complement of around 150 people—about two-thirds of whom are employed within the office's investigative teams. In its 2011-12 annual report, the Northern Ireland's police ombudsman stated that it had received 3,336 new complaints against police that year. Nine hundred and eight recommendations were made to the Public Prosecution Service, including nine criminal charges against police. Four hundred and ninety-three recommendations were made to the police force command, including 19 cases where they recommended formal disciplinary proceedings. In comparison, IBAC received 2,567 complaints regarding police misconduct, which covered over 4,860 allegations in the 2013-14 year alone. In that year, IBAC conducted only 24 investigations. This is clearly inadequate by anyone's standard.



Not only did the Northern Ireland police ombudsman make close to 
a thousand
 recommendations to the public prosecution office
 but


it
 also surveyed all complainants after the closure of their complaint. Fifty
-
two per cent of respondents responded that they were very satisfied or satisfied with the investigation, down from 59 per cent last year. I cannot imagine that we would get the same feedback if we were to ask those who had made a complaint about police in Victoria. This is just one of the working models of independent police oversight in operation overseas.


Northern Ireland's police ombudsman is effective, it receives strong support from the public and 
from the 
police
, who are 
in no way


hindered in 
their
 work. In fact
, the

Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland surveyed police after the conclusion of their investigation, and 72 per cent of the police were satisfied or very satisfied by the work of the police ombudsman.The people of Victoria should expect no less of a response to the long-term systemic issue of police assaults. No-one in our state should be above the law. Unfortunately, it appears that some members of the Victoria Police force feel that they can assault citizens without any fear of prosecution.




As well as 
having made 
a number of speeches on this matter, I have also 
raised the issue with


both 
federal and state colleagues
.
 I am confident that support for an independent body to investigate police in Victoria is growing. I will be doing what I can to ensure all Victorians get the changes we need to police o
versight—a
 properly empowered and well-funded independent body that can fully investigate and, most
 important
ly, have charges laid against police for this misconduct. To settle for anything less will not fix the problem. Police need to know that their actions are accountable, that they have a duty of care for every citizen and that our community will not accept that assaulting people is ever acceptable.






Policing is a tough job. It is why we pay our police very well. It is why we invest heavily in the training and professional conduct of our police. Police that then abuse that training and abuse the trust that Victorians give them need to be held accountable for their actions.


Policing can be done with integrity. Policing must be done with integrity. Those officers who conduct assaults against citizens of Victoria must be held accountable as if they were any other citizen for those breaches of the law. Victorians expect this. This is happening in many overseas jurisdictions. We must have an independent body that investigates police. We cannot have police investigating police. We know that that does not work. Case after case has demonstrated that that does not work. We need a truly independent body to conduct those investigations and have the ability to have charges laid against police for their misconduct.
