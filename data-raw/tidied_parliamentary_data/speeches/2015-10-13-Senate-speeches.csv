Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (12:40):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7577:


(1) Schedule 1, item 33, page 14 (lines 23 and 24), omit “the prevailing pay and conditions within the relevant industry for equivalent work”, substitute “the pay and conditions for work performed in similar circumstances, but takes into account the particular circumstances and needs of the employees and the employers who will be covered by the agreement and the enterprise to which the agreement relates”.


(2) Schedule 1, item 33, page 14 (lines 25 to 27), omit the note.


I am moving to replace the words 'consistent with the prevailing pay and conditions within the relevant industry' with 'for work performed in similar circumstances, but takes into account the particular circumstances and needs of the employees and the employers' and the enterprise. My amendments allow enterprise agreements to take into account local conditions, local labour force conditions and local economic conditions—in other words a new site, a new EBA. I commend the amendments.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:41):  I thank Senator Day for his constructive contribution to this debate, and in particular for his engagement with the government on the important reforms in the Fair Work Amendment Bill. As canvassed in the debate yesterday, the purpose of the new prevailing pay and conditions criteria in the bill is to build an extra employee protection for greenfields agreements approved by the Fair Work Commission under the new optional six-month process. The new prevailing standards requirement is in addition to the existing agreement approval tests, including that the employees must be better off overall than they would have been under the award. 


The test start will be applied by the independent Fair Work Commission and will assist in assuring the expeditious resolution of greenfields agreements that provide new employment opportunities. We believe that clause 33 is drafted to meet these objectives. It requires the Fair Work Commission to be satisfied that the agreement, considered on an overall basis, provides the pay and conditions that are consistent with the prevailing pay and conditions within the relevant industry for equivalent work. There is also a note that the Fair Work Commission may have regard to the relevant geographical area. This makes clear that the Fair Work Commission has flexibility to exercise its expert judgement and discretion in considering the relevant pay and conditions standard.


The government has carefully considered Senator Day's proposed amendments to this test and, while we believe that the sentiment behind the proposed amendment is meritorious, the government at this point has made the decision not to support the proposed amendments.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:43):  I do not think it would come as a surprise to Senator Day that Labor opposes these amendments. On the record, can I thank Senator Day for his indulgence last night—we had a long night and I know he gave way to me late in the evening; I sort of got carried away and left Senator Day without an opportunity to speak. I acknowledge that. Senator Day, I must say that the proposition you put up is not acceptable to Labor. The proposition that the government puts up is not quite as bad but it is every bit as bad in relation to the impediment it places before unions to negotiate better pay and conditions than those that apply in particular areas. If you simply had the situation that the government is proposing in this bill, if you only looked at the prevailing pay and conditions, then you would never be in a position to improve wages and conditions anywhere in the country—they would basically be frozen at the existing position. Your position is worse than that. It says that you have to take into account the particular circumstances and needs of the employees, employers and enterprises to which the agreement relates as well as the pay and conditions for work performed in similar circumstances. In our view, this is a recipe for pushing wages and conditions backwards. It is not consistent with allowing proper bargaining under the act. On that basis, we oppose the amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2015-10-13,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (12:45):  Firstly, I thank you for your acknowledgement from last night, Senator. I believe that these amendments are very important for Australia's competitiveness. They correct an error in the government's bill, which would lock in a one-size-fits-all enterprise arrangement regardless of whether the new enterprise or project is in Berri, in Burnie, in Broome or anywhere else.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Or Bunbury or Busselton?




Senator DAY:
  Or Bunbury. We have already had a B in WA! 


Why are these amendments to the provisions of the bill concerning greenfields projects so important? In my discussions with my colleagues, many acknowledged that there is a major problem in job creation regarding greenfields sites around Australia. Here are some data proving that Senator Cameron is wrong and that Australia does have a problem with the conditions for greenfields projects. First, the data shows that the costs of greenfields exploration are now six times higher than they are for brownfields exploration. In 2014-15, exploration expenditure per metre drilled on new greenfield deposits was nearly $700 per metre compared with just one $110 per metre on existing brownfields deposits. The cost differential between greenfields and brownfields exploration has never been higher. The differential or the gap between greenfields projects and brownfields projects is getting higher and higher. In 2014, greenfield exploration accounted for just one-quarter of total metres drilled. 


What is all this saying? It is saying that we have a problem with greenfields projects, where, suddenly, you will have to adopt an EBA from somewhere else across Australia. That EBA will not take into account local circumstances. Like I say, whether it is Busselton, Bunbury or Broome in WA; Berri in South Australia; Bendigo in Victoria—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Or Ballarat?




Senator DAY:
  Or Ballarat in Victoria. We can keep alliterating all afternoon, if we like, but I think that I have made my point. 


I think that this is really, really important. I think that the government have missed the boat on this. I do not think that they quite realise just how important it is. When you set up a new enterprise or a new project on a new greenfields site, the unique circumstances of a particular geographical region are so important, whether it is a canning factory or a petrochemical plant in Shepparton—and I will start with the S names, if you like! My home state of South Australia does not have the cost of living and cost base of a project in, say, Western Sydney. New projects will be locked out of my home state of South Australia. New greenfields projects will not be able to compete and they will not be able to set up, because they will be locked into an industry-wide EBA, which they will have to pick off the shelf from somewhere else. Yes, you can make submissions to the Fair Work Commission and start hacking away at an existing enterprise bargaining agreement from somewhere else, but we all know what happens there. My proposal is that, for a new site, you will start with a new EBA. I thank the minister and the shadow minister for their contributions. I commend my amendment to the Senate.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7577 be agreed to.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:56):  I move opposition amendment (6) on sheet 7771 revised:


(6) Schedule 1, page 16 (after line 15), after item 48, insert:


48A After subsection 240(3)


   Insert:




FWC may deal with greenfields agreement dispute



   (3A) The FWC may deal with a dispute about a proposed single‑enterprise agreement that is a greenfields agreement on its own initiative if the FWC is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.


48B Before subsection 240(4)


   Insert:



Bargaining representatives may agree that FWC can arbitrate



This is about expanding conciliation in relation to greenfields agreements. We heard much from the minister yesterday about bringing certain aspects of the Fair Work Act into the greenfields agreement making and why that was a good thing. If that is the principle then the principle of bringing the aspects of section 240 of the Fair Work Act, which provides a bargaining representative may apply to the Fair Work Commission to deal with a dispute by way of conciliation, should also be in this bill. It would allow the Fair Work Commission to deal with a dispute by way of conciliation on its own initiative, if the Fair Work Commission is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. It keeps that greenfields agreement negotiations consistent with the broader act. It was an argument that the opposition put forcefully yesterday. So, on that basis, I would think the government should accept this as part of the principle. Yesterday, they argued about bringing these issues into line. 


Minister, I want to go to some of the issues that you raised yesterday in your responses. You indicated that good faith bargaining provisions had been extended to greenfields agreements and you argued that that would improve accountability in the negotiation process. You then spoke about past practice. You said: 


… one would anticipate based on past practice that the majority of agreements are going to be negotiated … 


That is page 94 of Hansard. You say that in the majority of cases the employer and the relevant unions will be able to reach an agreement. Minister, isn't it the case that presently all greenfields agreements are negotiated, not merely a majority?

None are excluded?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:59):  No, Senator Cameron. I think you misunderstood what I said last night. As we went through it last night, you have greenfields agreements, you have an employer and you have a union or unions. Under the greenfields process, they get together and negotiate an agreeme 


Many agreements are actually agreed by the employer and the union or unions. In some cases, there will not be an agreement. We are implementing the relief valve—that is, going to the Fair Work Commission as the individual umpire. So I think there was just a slight misunderstanding in terms of what I said last night.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:00):  Minister, it is the statement you made last night that I am seeking clarification on—not what you have just said. You said last night that one would anticipate that, based on past practice, the majority of agreements are going to be negotiated. You used the word 'majority'. You then said later: 


… in the majority of cases the employer and the relevant union or unions will be able to reach an agreement.


Do you accept that, based on past practice, all greenfield agreements—not the majority but all of them—have been negotiated? It is a simple, factual position.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:01):  Again, I think it is just the way that you have interpreted what I said last night. It is implicit within the greenfields process that there is negotiation. Whether or not there is an agreement is up to the parties. If there is an agreement, that is good. If there is not an agreement, then they can utilise the relief valve and go to the Fair Work Commission.

 (New South Wales) (13:01):  Minister, thanks for the answer. Last night, again, you said that the employer then has the optional process of commencing the six-month period by notifying the union.

But, as you will be aware, what we are doing with this particular amendment, as we discussed at length last night, is bringing into the greenfields provisions what is currently not there—that is, the good faith bargaining provisions. So you would expect parties to bargain in good faith, and where they cannot reach an agreement the employer is able to utilise this process should the employer wish to.

Hansard recorded you last night as saying:


… I think we would all hope that during that six-month period an agreement can be reached between the employer and the union or the unions.


That is on page 96 of the Hansard. Minister, there is clearly an incentive for the union to reach agreement with the employer. If they do not, then the employer can lodge an agreement that contains whatever they would like—that is, whatever the employer would like. What is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period?

Senator CASH (

) (
13:03
):  Again, you and I canvassed this for several hours last night. The evidence I gave last night will be the evidence that I re-give you now. I disagree with the fact that the employer can present any agreement that they like. I made it very clear last night that the union must be given a reasonable opportunity to sign the agreement that is put to the Fair Work Commission for approval. If the union has not seen the agreement, then the Fair Work Commission will not be able to approve that particular agreement.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CAMERON

 (
New South Wales
) (
13:04
):  Minister, you simply have not answered the question. The question I have put is: there are obvious incentives for the unions to reach agreement but there is no incentive that you have indicated for employers to reach agreement with the union within the six months; so what is the incentive, under the process that you are proposing, for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:04):  Given that the employer has a project which the employer wants to start, given that the employer is going to have a body of employees waiting to become people who are actually employed, given that the employer is the one assuming all of the risk in relation to this project and given that the employer is probably going to have international financiers who are saying, 'Unless you can get this agreement in place, we may not be able to provide the finance,' I am assuming, Senator Cameron, that there is going to be great incentive for the employer to come to an agreement with the union or unions.


In any event, as I have consistently stated and I will state again, one of the good things that we are doing in relation to this part of the act—which the former government failed to do—is that we are bringing in the good faith bargaining provisions so that employers and employees have to negotiate in good faith. But the other addition to this part of the act—which, again, Labor failed to do in their legislation—is that we are now bringing in, as part of the approval criteria at item 33, prevailing pay and conditions as one of the criteria for the approval of the agreement. Currently, as you would be aware, it is the better off overall test, and you are compared to the relevant award. We are saying, 'If you are going to submit an agreement to the commission for approval, that test is now prevailing pay and conditions as an approval criterion,' and everyone knows, Senator Cameron, that they are going to be higher.




Senator CAMERON:
  Again, I just say, Minister, that the incentive for the employees and the unions—that is, the union representing the employees—is clear. The incentive for the employer, as you outlined, probably gives a bit of strength to the argument that we have been putting, and that is that the incentive for the employer would be to hang on and not make any concessions until the employer gets the agreement that it wants to put to the commission after the six-month period. If you have, as you have indicated, prevailing pay and conditions as the benchmark, that means that workers would not be in a position through that bargaining process to improve on the prevailing pay and conditions. Is that not so?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:07):  That is not correct. They will have an opportunity, but again I go to the point that the award applies currently under your system; under our system it is prevailing pay and conditions. There is a fundamental difference. I also refer you to the review panel that the now Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten himself handpicked to review your legislation. One of the reasons that we are standing here today is that there are a number of recommendations made by that review panel—your review panel, your handpicked people. We canvassed this last night: the reason that the government is considering this greenfields relief valve measure is that an issue has been clearly identified that certain unions have in some circumstances frustrated greenfields agreement processes. Again, we canvassed this last night, and at that time I read from the findings of Labor's own handpicked reviewers of the Fair Work Act, where they recalled evidence and submissions that some unions had hijacked the greenfields processes, that greenfields negotiations were lengthy, torturous and onerous and that within itself jeopardises projects.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:09):  Minister, I do not know why you will not go to the point and answer the question. It is okay to give us all the rhetorical flourishes that you have in your speaking notes, but the reality is that I am asking a simple question, and that is: what is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period, when clearly, on what you outlined early in your answer, it is probably a better incentive for them, if it is all about cost pressures, to resist any improvements to pay and conditions. Thanks very much for advising me that there is a difference between an award and prevailing pay and conditions. I think most people do understand that, but that does not go to the question—what is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period? Doesn't it mean that, if the determination is made on prevailing pay and conditions, then the unions cannot negotiate improvements in pay and conditions in the areas that are under disagreement for prospective employees—so prevailing pay and conditions become a cap?

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (13:10):  Similarly the question to the minister is: where is the incentive for the employer to do anything other? If they cannot reach agreement with the union, they will just sit there and wait out the six months. Those six months may not be much time at all in the whole timeframe of development of the industry. They will sit there and wait and, if no negotiation is needed after that, you can see that is how it will play out.

In any event, the mere fact is that we are bringing in the good-faith bargaining provisions. I can only say that so many times. If you go to that section of the act, and it is quite a lengthy section of the act, you can read what good-faith bargaining is—maybe you have not had an opportunity to read that—and that will outline for you step by step exactly what the employer and the relevant union or unions are required to do by way of good-faith bargaining. In the event that they do not bargain in good faith, one of the parties can go to the Fair Work Commission and they are able to seek what is known as a bargaining order from the commission.

What is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period? Do you not agree that by maintaining the prevailing pay and conditions there is no capacity under your bargaining approach for unions to increase and improve wages and conditions for employees who could be covered by that greenfield agreement?

That is why we are putting in the relief valve. It is so that there is an opportunity at the end of that period of time to go to the Fair Work Commission and have them as the independent umpire—as I described them last night and I think is agreed in the chamber—have a look at the agreement within the approval criteria. 


But I also said last night that you do not have to go to the commission. If you wanted to, you could continue negotiations. Again, from an employer's perspective, you have a major project. You have all sorts of things that are hinging off this major project, let alone the fact that you have a body of people who you want to become employees who are working and accruing entitlements. The system currently enables people to negotiate 'ad infinitum', to quote that phrase, and that is why we are putting in the relief valve.

… an employer can only take a greenfields agreement to the Fair Work Commission to be approved under the new process where it has first given each of the unions that are the bargaining representatives a reasonable opportunity to sign-off on the agreement. This … ensures that the unions have sufficient time to consider the agreement … to the Fair Work Commission.


And on page 96 you said:


… the union must have been given the reasonable opportunity to consider agreeing to the document that is filed with the Fair Work Commission.


I would like to confirm that there is nothing in the bill that says the agreement which has been under discussion for six months is required to be the same document that is filed with the Fair Work Commission, as long as the union has been provided a reasonable opportunity to consider agreeing to the document. I would also like to clarify what happens if the unions disagree with any element that is filed with the Fair Work Commission. What is open to the unions?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:18):  I hope that you understand that negotiations are processes where parties go back and forth between one another. They agree on some things; they do not agree on other things. They might have agreed on something but then decide to change that. That is the whole point of a negotiation. However, to ensure that an agreement is ultimately reached so that the project can get underway and to ensure that the employees, as I said last night, are able to become paid employees and accrue entitlements and have all the rights and conditions that we in this chamber have, we are merely putting in a relief valve. 


Again, I confirm the evidence that I gave last night. The union must have been given a reasonable opportunity to sign the agreement that is put to the Fair Work Commission for approval. The union must have seen that agreement. As we went through last night, if an agreement that the union has not seen is put to the commission, the commission will upload that proposed agreement onto its website. You can only imagine, Senator Cameron, I am sure, what the reaction of the union would be if it saw on the commission's website an agreement that it had not had the opportunity to comment on. 


In any event, I go back to when the Fair Work Commission is looking at this proposed agreement. In terms of the approval criteria, we have ensured that whilst under your legislation the award is the relevant standard—the better-off-overall standard—we are increasing that. This is of benefit to the proposed employees. The approval criteria now include the prevailing standards and conditions within the industry. Employees will be better off as a result of that.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:19):  Employees may not be better off if they are not in a position to improve over and above the prevailing terms and conditions, and we have canvassed that. That is clearly a deficiency in the bill. It is not so much a deficiency; I think it is a deliberate position in the bill that would mean that workers are not able to improve their wages and conditions over a period of time.


I want to get back to another issue. Last night you did not answer my question about whether the union could take the employer to the Fair Work Commission to seek a bargaining order at the end of the notified negotiating period. In the ordinary course of events, a bargaining order can be granted by the Fair Work Commission if a bargaining representative has not met the good faith bargaining requirement. If a bargaining representative has breached a bargaining order, will the Fair Work Ombudsman be able to take legal action against the bargaining representative after the notified negotiating period has concluded?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:21):  Again, I think this goes potentially to a fundamental misunderstanding of what your legislation currently allows people to do and what we, through our amendments to your legislation, are going to enable people to do. You keep attacking good faith bargaining as if it were something bad or deficient. You and I went through this last night, but I am happy to go through it again. It is your right to ask questions, and I appreciate your asking me questions so I can have the opportunity to clarify this yet again with you.


Under the current greenfields agreement-making framework that your government put into place—I think you would acknowledge this, because it is the law—employers and unions have no incentive to bargain for greenfields agreements in good faith. The reason for that is the good faith bargaining rules do not apply at all to these agreements. When you legislated you did not include good faith bargaining for greenfield agreements. What then happens is that the Fair Work Commission has no formal capacity to resolve disputes during greenfield negotiations. For a number of years you had the opportunity to fix this. You had a panel which said, 'Fix it!', but you chose not to. 


I am struggling with the fact that every time you stand up you are almost advocating a position that is opposing the extension of the good faith bargaining provisions to this part of the act. What the government is doing via this amendment is ensuring that the good faith bargaining rules apply to negotiations for all single-enterprise greenfield agreements, as is set out in the Fair Work Act. As I stated to Senator Rice, the act says that, where the good faith bargaining rules are not complied with, parties will be able to access bargaining orders and the Fair Work Commission bargaining assistance for the first time. Currently, they cannot do that. They will be able to do it under the amendment that we are bringing in. That is a good thing.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:23):  Minister, I do not understand why you would need to verbal anyone in relation to this matter. The question being asked is simple. To stand up and to verbal me and the Labor Party, saying that we do not support good faith bargaining, I do not think does you much credit. In reality, the issue is that the problem is not the good faith bargaining principle; the problem is the interaction of good faith bargaining with your flawed process and your bill that would impede proper bargaining and would impede unions having a fair go in the negotiations. Your principle provides a benefit and an added support to the employer over the union bargaining group. We support good faith bargaining—I want to make that clear. 


We have now traversed these issues for some period of time. I understand there are other amendments. I would like to get through our amendments, but I would like to place on record that we support good faith bargaining. We think good faith bargaining is impeded by the bad process you have introduced in this bill.

Review of the operation of amendments



(1) The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of the amendments made by Part 5 of Schedule 1 to be undertaken and completed within 2 years after the commencement of that Part.


(2) The review must consider:


   (a) the effect of the amendments made by Part 5 of Schedule 1; and


   (b) any other related matter that the Minister specifies.


(3) The person who undertakes the review must give the Minister a written report of the review.


(4) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sittings days of receiving it.


My amendment puts in place an important safeguard which will require the minister, regardless of who is in power, to undertake an independent review of the workability of the six-month period installed to negotiate greenfield agreements. The review must be undertaken and completed within two years of the legislation taking effect. The person who undertakes the review must give the minister a written report, which must be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days of the minister receiving it. My amendment puts in place an obligation on the government of the day to work with all stakeholders involved in the negotiation of greenfield agreements to review the success of the six-month time frame. 


While I appreciate the opposition has put forward very late in the day a proposal for arbitration in relation to greenfield agreements, my consultations with unions and businesses indicate that my amendment will work and, importantly, will provide the safeguard to ensure that the system is reviewed within a relatively short time to enable adjustments to be made to the legislation in future if required. My amendment ensures there is a balanced approach to greenfield negotiations and that the process of enterprise bargaining is appropriately respected and supported.

I have spoken with him about this amendment and, indeed, with a number of the crossbenchers. Senator Lazarus indicated that he felt there was a desire for a review of the greenfield provisions after two years.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:27):  The opposition will not be supporting this amendment from Senator Lazarus. We understand where Senator Lazarus is coming from in relation to this amendment which says to us that Senator Lazarus has concerns about the operation of the bill before the parliament. If Senator Lazarus had no concern about this bill, he would not be looking for a review of the operation of the amendments. My view is that this is well intended, but in reality if you have concerns about the operation of the bill, Senator Lazarus, you should not be supporting the bill today. That is the bottom line. 


You have put forward a proposition and negotiated with the minister, as I understand, but really what does it do? The minute the minister causes an independent review to take place, the review considers the effect of the amendments and any other matter the minister specifies—who knows what that may be; I am not sure. Then the person who undertakes the review provides a written report to the minister and the minister causes a copy of the report to be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days of receiving it. Big deal! What does that do? It does nothing, absolutely nothing. Fine, you do a deal with the minister. That is up to you, but if you have concerns about the operation of the bill, the time to deal with it is now. Do not support the bill. Do not put up a proposition that allows the minister to determine issues in a report that she receives and simply tables with no compulsion to do anything other than table the report. I think that this amendment is well-intentioned, but if you have problems, Senator Lazarus, do not support the bill, because this amendment does not fix the major problems in this bill.

Note: The FWC must be constituted by a Full Bench to make a greenfields workplace determination (see subsection 616(4)).


(2) In deciding whether or not the bargaining representatives have exhausted all other reasonable alternatives to reach agreement on the terms that should be included in the agreement, the FWC may take into account any matter the FWC considers relevant, including whether the FWC has provided assistance under section 240 in relation to the agreement.

   Add:




Agreed term for a greenfields workplace determination

Note: The determination must include an agreed term (see subsection 271D(2)).




52D Paragraph 275(b)



   After ""low‑paid workplace determination"", insert ""or a greenfields workplace determination"".

      (e) for a greenfields workplace determination—how productivity might be maximised in the enterprise concerned;


      (ea) for a workplace determination other than a greenfields workplace determination—how productivity might be improved in the enterprise or enterprises concerned;


These amendments cover really important issues that we are raising. These amendments go to certainty.


The minister has spoken much about certainty and the need for investors to have certainty. But the minister herself has conceded that there would be no certainty, because an employer can continue to negotiate ad infinitum. There are appeal processes in place and there are many impediments to certainty. The proposition we put here is about ensuring certainty through the creation of a greenfields workplace determination. I will not go into all the details, given the time, but these are important amendments in relation to providing real certainty for investors. On that basis, I would seek the support of the Senate.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:41):  I thank Senator Day for his constructive contribution to this debate, and in particular for his engagement with the government on the important reforms in the Fair Work Amendment Bill. As canvassed in the debate yesterday, the purpose of the new prevailing pay and conditions criteria in the bill is to build an extra employee protection for greenfields agreements approved by the Fair Work Commission under the new optional six-month process. The new prevailing standards requirement is in addition to the existing agreement approval tests, including that the employees must be better off overall than they would have been under the award. 


The test start will be applied by the independent Fair Work Commission and will assist in assuring the expeditious resolution of greenfields agreements that provide new employment opportunities. We believe that clause 33 is drafted to meet these objectives. It requires the Fair Work Commission to be satisfied that the agreement, considered on an overall basis, provides the pay and conditions that are consistent with the prevailing pay and conditions within the relevant industry for equivalent work. There is also a note that the Fair Work Commission may have regard to the relevant geographical area. This makes clear that the Fair Work Commission has flexibility to exercise its expert judgement and discretion in considering the relevant pay and conditions standard.


The government has carefully considered Senator Day's proposed amendments to this test and, while we believe that the sentiment behind the proposed amendment is meritorious, the government at this point has made the decision not to support the proposed amendments.

On the record, can I thank Senator Day for his indulgence last night—we had a long night and I know he gave way to me late in the evening; I sort of got carried away and left Senator Day without an opportunity to speak. I acknowledge that. Senator Day, I must say that the proposition you put up is not acceptable to Labor. The proposition that the government puts up is not quite as bad but it is every bit as bad in relation to the impediment it places before unions to negotiate better pay and conditions than those that apply in particular areas. If you simply had the situation that the government is proposing in this bill, if you only looked at the prevailing pay and conditions, then you would never be in a position to improve wages and conditions anywhere in the country—they would basically be frozen at the existing position. Your position is worse than that. It says that you have to take into account the particular circumstances and needs of the employees, employers and enterprises to which the agreement relates as well as the pay and conditions for work performed in similar circumstances. In our view, this is a recipe for pushing wages and conditions backwards. It is not consistent with allowing proper bargaining under the act. On that basis, we oppose the amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2015-10-13,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (12:45):  Firstly, I thank you for your acknowledgement from last night, Senator. I believe that these amendments are very important for Australia's competitiveness. They correct an error in the government's bill, which would lock in a one-size-fits-all enterprise arrangement regardless of whether the new enterprise or project is in Berri, in Burnie, in Broome or anywhere else.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Or Bunbury or Busselton?




Senator DAY:
  Or Bunbury. We have already had a B in WA! 


Why are these amendments to the provisions of the bill concerning greenfields projects so important? In my discussions with my colleagues, many acknowledged that there is a major problem in job creation regarding greenfields sites around Australia. Here are some data proving that Senator Cameron is wrong and that Australia does have a problem with the conditions for greenfields projects. First, the data shows that the costs of greenfields exploration are now six times higher than they are for brownfields exploration. In 2014-15, exploration expenditure per metre drilled on new greenfield deposits was nearly $700 per metre compared with just one $110 per metre on existing brownfields deposits. The cost differential between greenfields and brownfields exploration has never been higher. The differential or the gap between greenfields projects and brownfields projects is getting higher and higher. In 2014, greenfield exploration accounted for just one-quarter of total metres drilled. 


What is all this saying? It is saying that we have a problem with greenfields projects, where, suddenly, you will have to adopt an EBA from somewhere else across Australia. That EBA will not take into account local circumstances. Like I say, whether it is Busselton, Bunbury or Broome in WA; Berri in South Australia; Bendigo in Victoria—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Or Ballarat?




Senator DAY:
  Or Ballarat in Victoria. We can keep alliterating all afternoon, if we like, but I think that I have made my point. 


I think that this is really, really important. I think that the government have missed the boat on this. I do not think that they quite realise just how important it is. When you set up a new enterprise or a new project on a new greenfields site, the unique circumstances of a particular geographical region are so important, whether it is a canning factory or a petrochemical plant in Shepparton—and I will start with the S names, if you like! My home state of South Australia does not have the cost of living and cost base of a project in, say, Western Sydney. New projects will be locked out of my home state of South Australia. New greenfields projects will not be able to compete and they will not be able to set up, because they will be locked into an industry-wide EBA, which they will have to pick off the shelf from somewhere else. Yes, you can make submissions to the Fair Work Commission and start hacking away at an existing enterprise bargaining agreement from somewhere else, but we all know what happens there. My proposal is that, for a new site, you will start with a new EBA. I thank the minister and the shadow minister for their contributions. I commend my amendment to the Senate.

   Insert:



Bargaining representatives may agree that FWC can arbitrate



This is about expanding conciliation in relation to greenfields agreements. We heard much from the minister yesterday about bringing certain aspects of the Fair Work Act into the greenfields agreement making and why that was a good thing. If that is the principle then the principle of bringing the aspects of section 240 of the Fair Work Act, which provides a bargaining representative may apply to the Fair Work Commission to deal with a dispute by way of conciliation, should also be in this bill. It would allow the Fair Work Commission to deal with a dispute by way of conciliation on its own initiative, if the Fair Work Commission is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. It keeps that greenfields agreement negotiations consistent with the broader act. It was an argument that the opposition put forcefully yesterday. So, on that basis, I would think the government should accept this as part of the principle. Yesterday, they argued about bringing these issues into line. 


Minister, I want to go to some of the issues that you raised yesterday in your responses. You indicated that good faith bargaining provisions had been extended to greenfields agreements and you argued that that would improve accountability in the negotiation process. You then spoke about past practice. You said: 


… one would anticipate based on past practice that the majority of agreements are going to be negotiated … 


That is page 94 of Hansard. You say that in the majority of cases the employer and the relevant unions will be able to reach an agreement. Minister, isn't it the case that presently all greenfields agreements are negotiated, not merely a majority?

 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:59):  No, Senator Cameron. I think you misunderstood what I said last night. As we went through it last night, you have greenfields agreements, you have an employer and you have a union or unions. Under the greenfields process, they get together and negotiate an agreeme 


Many agreements are actually agreed by the employer and the union or unions. In some cases, there will not be an agreement. We are implementing the relief valve—that is, going to the Fair Work Commission as the individual umpire. So I think there was just a slight misunderstanding in terms of what I said last night.

 (New South Wales) (13:00):  Minister, it is the statement you made last night that I am seeking clarification on—not what you have just said. You said last night that one would anticipate that, based on past practice, the majority of agreements are going to be negotiated. You used the word 'majority'. You then said later: 


… in the majority of cases the employer and the relevant union or unions will be able to reach an agreement.


Do you accept that, based on past practice, all greenfield agreements—not the majority but all of them—have been negotiated? It is a simple, factual position.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:01):  Again, I think it is just the way that you have interpreted what I said last night. It is implicit within the greenfields process that there is negotiation. Whether or not there is an agreement is up to the parties. If there is an agreement, that is good. If there is not an agreement, then they can utilise the relief valve and go to the Fair Work Commission.

But, as you will be aware, what we are doing with this particular amendment, as we discussed at length last night, is bringing into the greenfields provisions what is currently not there—that is, the good faith bargaining provisions. So you would expect parties to bargain in good faith, and where they cannot reach an agreement the employer is able to utilise this process should the employer wish to.

Hansard recorded you last night as saying:


… I think we would all hope that during that six-month period an agreement can be reached between the employer and the union or the unions.


That is on page 96 of the Hansard. Minister, there is clearly an incentive for the union to reach agreement with the employer. If they do not, then the employer can lodge an agreement that contains whatever they would like—that is, whatever the employer would like. What is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period?

13:03

I disagree with the fact that the employer can present any agreement that they like. I made it very clear last night that the union must be given a reasonable opportunity to sign the agreement that is put to the Fair Work Commission for approval. If the union has not seen the agreement, then the Fair Work Commission will not be able to approve that particular agreement.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CAMERON

 (
New South Wales
) (
13:04
):  Minister, you simply have not answered the question. The question I have put is: there are obvious incentives for the unions to reach agreement but there is no incentive that you have indicated for employers to reach agreement with the union within the six months; so what is the incentive, under the process that you are proposing, for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:04):  Given that the employer has a project which the employer wants to start, given that the employer is going to have a body of employees waiting to become people who are actually employed, given that the employer is the one assuming all of the risk in relation to this project and given that the employer is probably going to have international financiers who are saying, 'Unless you can get this agreement in place, we may not be able to provide the finance,' I am assuming, Senator Cameron, that there is going to be great incentive for the employer to come to an agreement with the union or unions.


In any event, as I have consistently stated and I will state again, one of the good things that we are doing in relation to this part of the act—which the former government failed to do—is that we are bringing in the good faith bargaining provisions so that employers and employees have to negotiate in good faith. But the other addition to this part of the act—which, again, Labor failed to do in their legislation—is that we are now bringing in, as part of the approval criteria at item 33, prevailing pay and conditions as one of the criteria for the approval of the agreement. Currently, as you would be aware, it is the better off overall test, and you are compared to the relevant award. We are saying, 'If you are going to submit an agreement to the commission for approval, that test is now prevailing pay and conditions as an approval criterion,' and everyone knows, Senator Cameron, that they are going to be higher.




Senator CAMERON:
  Again, I just say, Minister, that the incentive for the employees and the unions—that is, the union representing the employees—is clear. The incentive for the employer, as you outlined, probably gives a bit of strength to the argument that we have been putting, and that is that the incentive for the employer would be to hang on and not make any concessions until the employer gets the agreement that it wants to put to the commission after the six-month period. If you have, as you have indicated, prevailing pay and conditions as the benchmark, that means that workers would not be in a position through that bargaining process to improve on the prevailing pay and conditions. Is that not so?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:07):  That is not correct. They will have an opportunity, but again I go to the point that the award applies currently under your system; under our system it is prevailing pay and conditions. There is a fundamental difference. I also refer you to the review panel that the now Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten himself handpicked to review your legislation. One of the reasons that we are standing here today is that there are a number of recommendations made by that review panel—your review panel, your handpicked people. We canvassed this last night: the reason that the government is considering this greenfields relief valve measure is that an issue has been clearly identified that certain unions have in some circumstances frustrated greenfields agreement processes. Again, we canvassed this last night, and at that time I read from the findings of Labor's own handpicked reviewers of the Fair Work Act, where they recalled evidence and submissions that some unions had hijacked the greenfields processes, that greenfields negotiations were lengthy, torturous and onerous and that within itself jeopardises projects.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:09):  Minister, I do not know why you will not go to the point and answer the question. It is okay to give us all the rhetorical flourishes that you have in your speaking notes, but the reality is that I am asking a simple question, and that is: what is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period, when clearly, on what you outlined early in your answer, it is probably a better incentive for them, if it is all about cost pressures, to resist any improvements to pay and conditions. Thanks very much for advising me that there is a difference between an award and prevailing pay and conditions. I think most people do understand that, but that does not go to the question—what is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period? Doesn't it mean that, if the determination is made on prevailing pay and conditions, then the unions cannot negotiate improvements in pay and conditions in the areas that are under disagreement for prospective employees—so prevailing pay and conditions become a cap?

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (13:10):  Similarly the question to the minister is: where is the incentive for the employer to do anything other? If they cannot reach agreement with the union, they will just sit there and wait out the six months. Those six months may not be much time at all in the whole timeframe of development of the industry. They will sit there and wait and, if no negotiation is needed after that, you can see that is how it will play out.

In any event, the mere fact is that we are bringing in the good-faith bargaining provisions. I can only say that so many times. If you go to that section of the act, and it is quite a lengthy section of the act, you can read what good-faith bargaining is—maybe you have not had an opportunity to read that—and that will outline for you step by step exactly what the employer and the relevant union or unions are required to do by way of good-faith bargaining. In the event that they do not bargain in good faith, one of the parties can go to the Fair Work Commission and they are able to seek what is known as a bargaining order from the commission.

Given that there is clearly an incentive for the unions to reach agreement with the employer—if they do not reach agreement and the employer can lodge an agreement that contains the issues that employer wants imposed on workers. What is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period? Do you not agree that by maintaining the prevailing pay and conditions there is no capacity under your bargaining approach for unions to increase and improve wages and conditions for employees who could be covered by that greenfield agreement?

 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:15):  That reflects the current situation, whereby an employer or a union can continue to negotiate. That is why we are putting in the relief valve. It is so that there is an opportunity at the end of that period of time to go to the Fair Work Commission and have them as the independent umpire—as I described them last night and I think is agreed in the chamber—have a look at the agreement within the approval criteria. 


But I also said last night that you do not have to go to the commission. If you wanted to, you could continue negotiations. Again, from an employer's perspective, you have a major project. You have all sorts of things that are hinging off this major project, let alone the fact that you have a body of people who you want to become employees who are working and accruing entitlements. The system currently enables people to negotiate 'ad infinitum', to quote that phrase, and that is why we are putting in the relief valve.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:16):  I am cognisant of the time, so I will not pursue this, but I must indicate that I think your responses do not shine any light on these issues at all. Let me try again. On page 93 of Hansard last night you said:


… an employer can only take a greenfields agreement to the Fair Work Commission to be approved under the new process where it has first given each of the unions that are the bargaining representatives a reasonable opportunity to sign-off on the agreement. This … ensures that the unions have sufficient time to consider the agreement … to the Fair Work Commission.


And on page 96 you said:


… the union must have been given the reasonable opportunity to consider agreeing to the document that is filed with the Fair Work Commission.


I would like to confirm that there is nothing in the bill that says the agreement which has been under discussion for six months is required to be the same document that is filed with the Fair Work Commission, as long as the union has been provided a reasonable opportunity to consider agreeing to the document. I would also like to clarify what happens if the unions disagree with any element that is filed with the Fair Work Commission. What is open to the unions?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:18):  I hope that you understand that negotiations are processes where parties go back and forth between one another. They agree on some things; they do not agree on other things. They might have agreed on something but then decide to change that. That is the whole point of a negotiation. However, to ensure that an agreement is ultimately reached so that the project can get underway and to ensure that the employees, as I said last night, are able to become paid employees and accrue entitlements and have all the rights and conditions that we in this chamber have, we are merely putting in a relief valve. 


Again, I confirm the evidence that I gave last night. The union must have been given a reasonable opportunity to sign the agreement that is put to the Fair Work Commission for approval. The union must have seen that agreement. As we went through last night, if an agreement that the union has not seen is put to the commission, the commission will upload that proposed agreement onto its website. You can only imagine, Senator Cameron, I am sure, what the reaction of the union would be if it saw on the commission's website an agreement that it had not had the opportunity to comment on. 


In any event, I go back to when the Fair Work Commission is looking at this proposed agreement. In terms of the approval criteria, we have ensured that whilst under your legislation the award is the relevant standard—the better-off-overall standard—we are increasing that. This is of benefit to the proposed employees. The approval criteria now include the prevailing standards and conditions within the industry. Employees will be better off as a result of that.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:19):  Employees may not be better off if they are not in a position to improve over and above the prevailing terms and conditions, and we have canvassed that. That is clearly a deficiency in the bill. It is not so much a deficiency; I think it is a deliberate position in the bill that would mean that workers are not able to improve their wages and conditions over a period of time.


I want to get back to another issue. Last night you did not answer my question about whether the union could take the employer to the Fair Work Commission to seek a bargaining order at the end of the notified negotiating period. In the ordinary course of events, a bargaining order can be granted by the Fair Work Commission if a bargaining representative has not met the good faith bargaining requirement. If a bargaining representative has breached a bargaining order, will the Fair Work Ombudsman be able to take legal action against the bargaining representative after the notified negotiating period has concluded?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:21):  Again, I think this goes potentially to a fundamental misunderstanding of what your legislation currently allows people to do and what we, through our amendments to your legislation, are going to enable people to do. You keep attacking good faith bargaining as if it were something bad or deficient. You and I went through this last night, but I am happy to go through it again. It is your right to ask questions, and I appreciate your asking me questions so I can have the opportunity to clarify this yet again with you.


Under the current greenfields agreement-making framework that your government put into place—I think you would acknowledge this, because it is the law—employers and unions have no incentive to bargain for greenfields agreements in good faith. The reason for that is the good faith bargaining rules do not apply at all to these agreements. When you legislated you did not include good faith bargaining for greenfield agreements. What then happens is that the Fair Work Commission has no formal capacity to resolve disputes during greenfield negotiations. For a number of years you had the opportunity to fix this. You had a panel which said, 'Fix it!', but you chose not to. 


I am struggling with the fact that every time you stand up you are almost advocating a position that is opposing the extension of the good faith bargaining provisions to this part of the act. What the government is doing via this amendment is ensuring that the good faith bargaining rules apply to negotiations for all single-enterprise greenfield agreements, as is set out in the Fair Work Act. As I stated to Senator Rice, the act says that, where the good faith bargaining rules are not complied with, parties will be able to access bargaining orders and the Fair Work Commission bargaining assistance for the first time. Currently, they cannot do that. They will be able to do it under the amendment that we are bringing in. That is a good thing.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:23):  Minister, I do not understand why you would need to verbal anyone in relation to this matter. The question being asked is simple. To stand up and to verbal me and the Labor Party, saying that we do not support good faith bargaining, I do not think does you much credit. In reality, the issue is that the problem is not the good faith bargaining principle; the problem is the interaction of good faith bargaining with your flawed process and your bill that would impede proper bargaining and would impede unions having a fair go in the negotiations. Your principle provides a benefit and an added support to the employer over the union bargaining group. We support good faith bargaining—I want to make that clear. 


We have now traversed these issues for some period of time. I understand there are other amendments. I would like to get through our amendments, but I would like to place on record that we support good faith bargaining. We think good faith bargaining is impeded by the bad process you have introduced in this bill.

Review of the operation of amendments



(1) The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of the amendments made by Part 5 of Schedule 1 to be undertaken and completed within 2 years after the commencement of that Part.


(2) The review must consider:


   (a) the effect of the amendments made by Part 5 of Schedule 1; and


   (b) any other related matter that the Minister specifies.


(3) The person who undertakes the review must give the Minister a written report of the review.


(4) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sittings days of receiving it.


My amendment puts in place an important safeguard which will require the minister, regardless of who is in power, to undertake an independent review of the workability of the six-month period installed to negotiate greenfield agreements. The review must be undertaken and completed within two years of the legislation taking effect. The person who undertakes the review must give the minister a written report, which must be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days of the minister receiving it. My amendment puts in place an obligation on the government of the day to work with all stakeholders involved in the negotiation of greenfield agreements to review the success of the six-month time frame. 


While I appreciate the opposition has put forward very late in the day a proposal for arbitration in relation to greenfield agreements, my consultations with unions and businesses indicate that my amendment will work and, importantly, will provide the safeguard to ensure that the system is reviewed within a relatively short time to enable adjustments to be made to the legislation in future if required. My amendment ensures there is a balanced approach to greenfield negotiations and that the process of enterprise bargaining is appropriately respected and supported.

My view is that this is well intended, but in reality if you have concerns about the operation of the bill, Senator Lazarus, you should not be supporting the bill today. That is the bottom line. 


You have put forward a proposition and negotiated with the minister, as I understand, but really what does it do? The minute the minister causes an independent review to take place, the review considers the effect of the amendments and any other matter the minister specifies—who knows what that may be; I am not sure. Then the person who undertakes the review provides a written report to the minister and the minister causes a copy of the report to be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days of receiving it. Big deal! What does that do? It does nothing, absolutely nothing. Fine, you do a deal with the minister. That is up to you, but if you have concerns about the operation of the bill, the time to deal with it is now. Do not support the bill. Do not put up a proposition that allows the minister to determine issues in a report that she receives and simply tables with no compulsion to do anything other than table the report.

These amendments cover really important issues that we are raising. These amendments go to certainty.


The minister has spoken much about certainty and the need for investors to have certainty. But the minister herself has conceded that there would be no certainty, because an employer can continue to negotiate ad infinitum. There are appeal processes in place and there are many impediments to certainty. The proposition we put here is about ensuring certainty through the creation of a greenfields workplace determination. I will not go into all the details, given the time, but these are important amendments in relation to providing real certainty for investors. On that basis, I would seek the support of the Senate.


Question negatived.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that the bill, as amended, be agreed to.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:01):  I rise to correct an answer I gave to Senator Ludlam. Senator Ludlam, you asked what the government's intentions were in relation to legislation for a mandatory data breach notification scheme. As I recall, my answer was that the government intends to legislate for such a scheme this year. I should have said that the government intends to introduce legislation before the end of this year.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today relating to employment.


Isn't it amazing that we have already had a correction of the record from yesterday? What we are seeing now from Senator Cash is backflipping, backtracking, correcting the record and the different use of language around the jobs that are to be created under the various free trade agreements.


Today she started off with 'I was advised,' and gone was the banging of the table and the absolutely categorical statement that thousands of millions will be created. We heard today that there 'can be'—she used the words 'can be'—jobs on offer from China. So gone was 'will be' and it was 'can be' today—and today it was based on 'sound modelling'. But we of course did not get any reference to the sound monitoring, and I am just wondering if, when she said that today, she meant the sound modelling she was referring to yesterday—and she has just stood up and corrected the record on that. So perhaps tomorrow she will come in and correct the record once again on whatever the sound modelling was that she was relying on today that, according to Senator Cash, says that thousands of jobs will be created. What are we to believe? No longer is it categorical. No longer is it absolutely determined. We hear words like she was 'advised' and many jobs 'can be' created and 'sound modelling', and at the end of question time, oopsy daisy, she corrects the record and the term is now back to 'many thousands of jobs'.


Last night, in relation to the Fair Work Bill, Senator Cameron asked time and time again, 'Where's the proof; where's the evidence?' According to what she says, Senator Cash likes to have an evidence based framework. She is on the public record as saying that. Senator Cameron asked, 'Where is the evidence that greenfields negotiations are being dragged out for longer than six months?' I think Senator Cameron asked that three or four times—certainly in the time that I was in the chamber. Senator Cash's response was that that was what employers had told her. So, again, we get Senator Cash relying on this 'sound evidence' and then not being able to produce the sound evidence or the sound modelling and then we get the backtracking and correcting of the record. That is all that we are hearing from Senator Cash in her new position as Minister for Employment.


Today Senator Bullock asked her directly whether the government was going to cut penalty rates, and Senator Cash said a number of times, 'Penalty rates are determined by the Fair Work Commission.' But just a couple of weeks ago, on 30 September, she said that 'any proposal by the government to reduce Sunday penalty rates will be taken to the next election'. So what are we to believe? She stands in here today and says, 'No, that is the job of the Fair Work Commission,' and a couple of weeks ago she said, 'Well, if we are going to cut penalty rates'—which is all they have been talking about—'we will do that at the next election; we will take a package to the next election.' 


So what are we to believe? What is the truth here? The truth is that they do not have a clue. But they have a very clear mandate on cutting penalties. There has been enough said about it, particularly by Senator Cash. And she could try to backtrack and say that it is up to the Fair Work Commission at question time today, but in an interview on 30 September she said that the government would determine the package.


The other thing she likes to say is that somehow the Productivity Commission has come up with this idea to create a two-tiered Sunday penalty system all by itself. Well, who put the reference to the Productivity Commission? It was the poor old former Treasurer under the old management, Mr Hockey. So that link between the terms of reference and what the government wants to do in terms of penalty rates is very clearly established. There is no mystery here: the terms of reference given to the Productivity Commission give the Productivity Commission plenty of room to deliver the response right to them that the government can change penalty rates. That was very clearly demonstrated when on 30 September Senator Cash said in a radio interview, 'If we are going to cut penalty rates we will take it to the next election.'


She did not mention the Fair Work Commission in that interview, just like today when she had to correct the record on her modelling of yesterday. Let's see what tomorrow brings!

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-10-13,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:08):  It is interesting to contribute to the debate on the answers to questions by Senator Cash. Senator Cash is right when she says that when it comes to penalty rates, the sorts of standards that are set out there are set by the Fair Work Commission. It is as simple as that. As I said in a speech here just recently—I think it was on Senator Leyonhjelm's private member's bill or a general business discussion on a Thursday—they are set by the Fair Work Commission, and that is the end of the story.


Now, if there are going to be changes at the Fair Work Commission then Fair Work Australia are going to have to do their job to make changes if they wish to, without any arguments for it. I said in that speech that I have a problem with some of the penalty rates. Let me explain why. Come a public holiday, anyone working who is 21 years old or over gets paid at least $47 an hour, plus workers comp plus superannuation. It costs employers about $57 an hour. So here is my problem: if you go out to a country hotel in a small community on, say, Easter Monday and walk into the pub and see who is working at the bar, it is the publican—the male publican and his wife. Or, if the licensee is a female, it is the publican who is the wife and her husband or family who are running the pub. Guess what? No-one is getting any casual work or penalty rates in that pub on that weekend. Why? Because they cannot take enough money to pay the extra costs. So what do we have? Everyone missing out!


I have been on both sides of the fence. I have been an employer and an employee. I have said that whatever comes to be in this place, that life is about fairness—a fair day's work for a fair day's pay and vice versa: a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. If you are working weekends or odd times then you should be paid more. Imagine the nurses, male and female—perhaps I might be game enough to say that most of them are female—working night shifts. They must be paid more for the inconvenience—the odd hours and the long hours that they have to work. They are very tiring hours.


There are our ambos and our police officers—those people working through the night. Many of them are called into hospitals—doctors and specialists—and of course they have to be paid more for the inconvenience and extra work. Every worker for the public must be treated in the same way and be paid extra for those difficult hours and especially for times like public holidays. Most people are at the dam, perhaps having a barbecue with their friends, or watching sport or whatever, and these people are going to work.


I make the point again that business does the employing. I am sure there are many coffee shops in Sydney that simply do not open on those days. So how many people get penalty rates on those days? None. It comes back to the owner or manager of the business making the decisions. We can regulate what we want in this place and make whatever we want but it comes back to the business owners to say, 'Well, I'm sorry, we're not opening the doors because our costs are so high that we cannot make a profit. We're losing money.' Businesses are not charities; they are not out there to open their doors to lose money, even though many over many years—probably all my life and longer—have opened their doors and lost money in difficult times.


It was amazing during question time today, the debate about jobs. I cannot believe those opposite—and the Greens especially—when it comes to the free trade agreements. I am very fortunate enough to live in a town where we have an abattoir—Bindaree Beef. It is a family owned business, with great people doing a great job and employing 850 people. But demand for beef is huge. The prices have come off a bit of late because of the hot, dry weather, but in general the beef market is doing very well—the best ever in my lifetime and that of anyone else in the beef industry.


Those abattoirs are increasing their work and the number of their employees. They are looking for workers. Unfortunately, they do not get them all in Australia. Many people in Australia do not want to work in an abattoir. They would rather stay on the unemployment benefits and have the workers brought in from overseas. But with these trade agreements and with the lower Australian dollar, we are getting more exports and more value. These businesses are growing and there are more jobs. Yet I cannot believe that the Greens are saying that these trade agreements are no good. They want to keep the tariffs on; they want to curb our businesses, especially agriculture and the beef, lamb and mutton industries. And there are the wine and dairy industries—these are industries which bring so much wealth to our nation. The better we can do as far that as trade agreements go and remove those barriers then the more people will be employed and businesses will grow.


Thank goodness, businesses grow! Every big business started as a small business, and when they grow they employ more people. We should encourage that. This whole building here, both houses, should encourage more growth, more employment, more jobs and a better living standard for all. But instead, we have some opposite just being cynical about the trade agreements that Andrew Robb, the trade minister, has done a magnificent job on over the time he has had that portfolio.

"Bullock, Sen Joseph",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (15:13):  I too rise to take note of the answers by Senator Cash. I should say at the outset that there is a lot to like about Senator Cash. Firstly, she is a West Australian and that naturally is an enormous advantage!




Senator Nash:
  Hear, hear to that!




Senator BULLOCK:
  Secondly, and I say this as a former secretary of the Western Australian Hairdressers and Wigmakers Union, Senator Cash is to be congratulated for consistent and ongoing support for our industry! Thirdly, there is her renowned theatricality: her demonstrative hand gestures and her propensity in pursuit of emphasis to overstate her case. She could, for example, lay the blame for the downfall of civilisation on a combination of the incompetence and malignant intent of 'those opposite'—a sentiment with which I could have some sympathy, albeit from the different perspective of this side of the chamber!


It is, however, this practice of overstatement—more so even than her cruelty to vowels—which opens the senator to well-deserved criticism. Take for example, her answer to the question as to how many new jobs would be created by the China, Japan and Korea free trade agreements. Undoubtedly swept away by her enthusiasm for FTAs, she advised the Senate yesterday—it was slightly corrected today—that up to 178,000 jobs would be created by the time the agreements came fully into force in 2035. I am reminded of a song by Frank Sinatra extolling the virtue of having high hopes, but high hopes are no substitute for the facts.


I have here a report by the Centre for International Economics, prepared for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the economic benefits of Australia's North Asian FTAs, dated 12 June this year. On page 35 it sets out the employment impact for Australia of the North Asian FTAs, year by year, for every year from 2016 till 2035. I have added up all of the figures on this page for all of the years, and they come to 178,568—just like Senator Cash said. Unfortunately for Senator Cash, I can read as well as add up, and the introduction to the table at the top of the page helpfully explains how to interpret it. It says:


This table should be interpreted in the same manner as the other results in this report … For example, we expect there to be 7925 more people employed in 2016 if the FTAs are implemented compared to if they aren’t implemented. Similarly, in 2020 there would be 14,566 more jobs if the FTAs are implemented compared to what would be the case in 2020 if the FTAs were not implemented.


So there it is. The figures set out against each year indicate the total number of new jobs expected to have been created from the inception of the FTAs until that year—not in that year. So, when this report states that there will be 5,434 jobs, next to the year 2035, it means that 5,434 jobs will be created by 2035—not in 2035. Five thousand four hundred and thirty-four new jobs is a far cry from 178,568 new jobs. One hundred and seventy-eight thousand is a wild exaggeration of the employment impact of the FTAs. The Senate is not assisted by wild exaggerations by Senator Cash in answering questions. It is this propensity for wild exaggerations which led one of my colleagues to suggest to me this morning that Senator Cash was loose with the truth. I might not use such colourful language myself, but Australia deserves a minister in the critically important Employment portfolio who can be trusted to stick to the facts and is not prone to wild exaggeration. 


The practice of presenting a vision of the world as she wishes it might be, rather than as it actually is, was evident once again in the controversy over the $12 million in cuts to the budget of community legal services nationally. These cuts are very clear to everyone in the sector, including Ms Liana Buchanan, who 'was surprised and appalled to hear a government minister providing such false information to the public'. The false information was Senator Cash's insistence that the $12 million in cuts was simply a false and misleading campaign by legal centres. Given that $12 million in cuts can be transformed into merely a 'false and misleading campaign', and 5,434 jobs— (Time expired)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-10-13,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:18):  It is great to have the opportunity to respond to the Labor Party. In listening to the contributions so far, it is hard to know who to give the bigger own-goal question to—whether it is the Labor Party asking about penalty rates, given Bill Shorten's record, or whether it is Senator Lambie with questions around Chinese money donations, given how the Palmer campaign was funded at the last federal election.


I want to focus on penalty rates but also on free trade, because we in the coalition—unlike those opposite, it would appear; increasingly, the Labor Party are walking away from free trade—believe passionately in free trade, in opening up markets and in the transformative potential that this has for the Australian economy and for Australian jobs. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb, who has done an outstanding job representing Australia's interests, negotiating these difficult and complex trade agreements—most recently the Trans-Pacific Partnership but also the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the free trade agreements with Korea and Japan. These present a massive opportunity for the Australian economy, a massive opportunity for working Australians, because we know that the way you provide jobs is to grow the economy. One of the great ways of growing the economy is through trade with other nations. The TPP opens up more and freer trade with some of our biggest trading partners in the region and builds on the fantastic free trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan. We are now entering into an era of much freer trade, where Australian exporters—be they exporters of services or agricultural or other goods—can get access to these markets. But, as we break down these trade barriers and get rid of some of these remaining tariffs, it is good for Australian consumers as well. It is good for Australian consumers as they can buy goods more cheaply. We should be very proud of what this government has achieved.


The Labor Party are walking away from the Hawke-Keating years, where there appeared to be a commitment to growing the economy, where there appeared to be a commitment to freer trade. The Labor Party are trashing those free trade credentials in attacking the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. You wonder why. I was contemplating why they would be doing it. To get the answer you only have to go to the former head of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson. Martin Ferguson tells us how the modern Labor Party creates its policy and how it comes to the conclusions that it comes to. I will quote from Martin Ferguson, because I think he has put it very well. He says:


Too many of that Shadow Ministry and the Caucus are almost as if they're prisoners of the union movement. It's the union movement now who funds individual candidates. They wait for the phone call from the trade union heavy to tell them what to do.


And haven't we seen that on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: they wait for the trade union heavy to give them the call to tell them what to do. But, of course, when we hear from the Labor Party about jobs we know, including from Martin Ferguson, that it is often about their own jobs. Martin Ferguson goes on to tell us how the Labor Party look after jobs. It is not about the jobs of the workers; it is about the jobs of union officials. This is from Martin Ferguson:


… there's always been a very strong union involvement. And I must say, I think back. In the history of the Labor Party we always allowed, ah, the unions to put a few people in our state upper houses.


There was always a retirement, ah, pasture for those who had done a good job. Or some of them worked on the basis: if you can't put them in the Industrial Commission, you put the duds in the Senate or the … Upper Houses.


That is pretty harsh from Martin Ferguson. They are his words, pretty harsh, and I do not want to cast aspersions on some of my fellow senators, but if that is the attitude of the modern union movement—that they use the Senate as a retirement pasture for some of their lower performing union members or union delegates—then that is not a good reflection of the union movement's commitment to growing jobs and growing the economy. On the other hand, the coalition is committed to growing the economy and growing jobs, as demonstrated by the recent free trade agreements. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  So we have learnt today that Minister Cash continues to fabricate figures, rewrite history and deny the indisputable. She has misrepresented the effects of free trade agreements on job creation by a factor of more than 30. In doing so, the minister ran perilously close to misleading the Senate. She has today, I note, corrected the record on this misinformation that she provided to the Senate. So what are we to believe now?


She has tried to hoodwink the Australian people into thinking that savage cuts to community legal services are nothing but a scare campaign. Today I would like to focus on this. The Abbott-Turnbull government's deplorable cuts to legal services have had devastating consequences for Australian women who are seeking to find a way to escape family violence. As Minister for Women, Senator Cash has again tried to misrepresent reality and pretend that the cuts are a figment of Labor's imagination. Tragically, one woman dies every week at the hands of a current or former partner. Domestic violence is a national tragedy, and it has gone on too long. The Abbott government sat on its hands. I am not going to argue that the new government has done nothing to address domestic violence. In fact, I congratulate those opposite on the commitments that have been made in recent weeks. It has been a long time coming, but there are some commendable actions. But it is simply not enough. It is estimated that Australian police deal with 657 domestic violence matters every day; that is one every two minutes. This is a crisis, and there is absolutely no justification for a government that says it is committed to addressing the scourge of domestic violence to maintain short-sighted and damaging cuts to community legal services.


Labor recognises and applauds the recent decision to return the $15 million to legal assistance services to help women experiencing domestic violence, but the Liberals' record on this is clear: those opposite have cut $24 million from community legal centres, those opposite have slashed $15 million from legal aid commissions, those opposite have hacked $13 million from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, and those opposite have forced family violence prevention legal services to retender for their funding after they were axed from the Attorney-General's Department. We know how these cuts have impacted in Australian communities. We have seen programs cancelled. Women in need are turned away at the door, and staff have been laid off. While we acknowledge that the government has been forced to walk away from some of these cuts, not all have been reversed. The reality is that its new national partnership agreement locks in future cuts to community legal centres, which will lose almost a third of their funding from 2017-18. This is not acceptable, and the minister has not been truthful about how hard these cuts will hit.


But you do not need to take my word for it. Just listen to the voices of people who will have to deal with the fallout—people like ARC Justice Executive Officer Peter Noble, who told it like it is when he said that arguments over semantics of cuts or non-renewed funding do not change the reality on the ground:


Whichever way you look at it, it will hit community legal centres nationally.


National Association of Community Legal Centres Chair Michael Smith confirmed that the deal locks in a national 30 per cent funding cut from 2017-18 and has seen immediate cutbacks in some areas. Mr Smith pointed out the clear disconnect between the government's words and its actions when he said:


This is at odds with the government's rhetoric on … family violence across Australia.


Community legal centres provide some of our most important front-line protections and services to enable women to escape family violence. Australian Legal Assistance Forum Chair Mark Woods brought the issue home clearly when he said:


Lack of legal assistance can be a major barrier to victims escaping violence or putting their lives—and their children's lives—back together.


If women are going to be able to do this, they absolutely need appropriate advice and support. As Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said recently, these cuts must be reversed, or we will not even have got to where we were before the 2013 election. If the government is truly committed to ending the scourge of domestic violence, this funding must be restored. If Minister Cash wants to salvage any credibility, she needs to fight for these cuts to be reversed and start being honest with the Australian people. (Time expired)

  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Distribution of the Goods and Services Tax (the ""GST"") has been problematic because it has not been allowed to evolve while the world economic environment is fast changing. Western Australia (""WA"") has been a victim of the distribution model's failure to adapt to the new terms of global trading, especially those around the iron ore market. Global iron ore trades shifted to quarterly prices 5 years ago with a lot of iron ore traded on a spot market. The commodity market has its ups and downs but because of this shift commodity prices have become less predictable.


Yes of course, WA being a mining state, has been hit fairly badly by the volatility during recent years. But the Commonwealth Grants Commission still calculates each state or Territory's capacity to raise mining royalty based on data at 3-year intervals. This, frankly is the 20th century way of thinking and it fails to adjust to the way the 21st century world trades.


A bad year is a bad year. It cannot be moderated just because the 2 previous years were better. So the states and territories should be provided with the means to cope with revenue shortfall immediately, not 3 years later.


Using 3 year old mining revenue data has driven a huge reduction in GST distribution to Western Australia at the same time as the actual mining royalties reduced.


The issue of the volatility of mining revenue has been raised in the Commonwealth Grants Commission reviews of the GST distribution process for 10 years now. The issue is of particular importance to the Western Australia Government and, to a lesser extent, the Queensland Government.


WA's share of the GST revenue has been unacceptably low in recent years. Ironically the prices of iron ore have fallen in the same period as WA's share of the GST shrinks. 


This Bill instructs the Commonwealth Grants Commission, when considering the capacity of a State or a Territory to raise mining revenue in preparing its annual recommendation on GST distribution, to only take into account the most recent financial year for which data is available.


Some may say that using annual assessments of royalty revenue will disadvantage the mining states when these royalties are increasing. This argument clearly shows a lack of understanding of the current impacts felt by Western Australia. My Bill offers a real buffer to the states against the volatility.


Of course I am putting forward this Bill because the GST distribution has not been fair to my home state. But more importantly, I am doing so because we now know that the distribution model has a problem which is capable of producing undesirable results, as proven in this case by Western Australia's unfair share of the GST. This problem has to be fixed so that it will not haunt another state or territory in the future as the state and territories' economic circumstances and revenue mix change. It could be Queensland, it could be Tasmania, it could be any of my good colleagues' home state should the mining industry become a bigger part of its economy.


I welcome the $500 million Commonwealth compensation to Western Australia this year. But the fundamental problem with the GST distribution remains untouched. We cannot sweep it under the carpet and pretend the job is done. Why is it that my home state has to cry for compensation every now and then like a baby crying for milk? Honestly I do not like the prospect. And dare I say, if it was a bigger state population-wise suffering from this unfair distribution, we would have this problem fixed in no time because there are more House of Representatives seats.


Yes, unanimous agreement by all states and territories is required for the Commonwealth to change the rate of the GST but no such agreement is needed to modify the distribution.


Under my Bill, if legislated, Western Australia would have received $2,395 million additional GST revenue in 2013-14, $3,057 million in 2014-15 and $3,500 million in 2015-16. Queensland would also benefit in the foreseeable future.


I am putting forward this Bill for WA, a state I love, a state I am a representative of here in the Parliament. I make no apology for doing this because WA has been ripped off for too long. But any state or territory could potentially benefit from this long overdue change.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:23): by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report by the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee into the Landholders' Right to Refuse (Gas and Coal) Bill 2015.


The Greens have introduced this legislation not once, not twice but three times into this federal parliament over the last four years. In that time, we have seen growing community concern for the scientific impacts and for the impact on health, community and climate of this new, rapacious fossil fuel industry, which is coal-seam gas, shale gas and tight gas or unconventional gases, as is the overarching term. We are seeking to give landholders the right to refuse access to coalmining companies and unconventional gas companies, which come knocking at all hours of the day and night. Currently landholders cannot say no. There is no legal right for them to refuse entry or access to their land, for it to be turned into an open cut coalmine ought to be hydrologically fracked—'fracking' as it is known, for evident reasons. Landholders have absolutely no right to determine that they in fact want to continue to farm this beautiful land. 


In Queensland, we have seen the coal-seam gas industry roll out on some of our best food producing land which has some of our best soils, which, sadly, we have too little of. It was with that community sentiment and with the scientific concern in mind that we once again introduced this private member's bill, to empower landholders to protect their land and water and to enable them to continue to produce food, of which we are currently a net exporter, and to continue to address climate change, given the huge fugitive emissions from unconventional gas and given the direct impacts of coalmining on climate.


In the course of this inquiry, we heard some incredibly powerful evidence. I want to take the opportunity to thank all of the communities who took the time to make submissions and to give us evidence at the hearings. It was a deeply emotional experience from many community members who have had their lives and their land overrun and who, in many instances, have suffered personal family health impacts. I would like to take this opportunity to read into the record some of the evidence given by some very passionate community members on that topic. We heard from Shay Dougall and Narelle Nothdurft from the Hopeland Community Sustainability Group. Narelle's family have documented problems with eyes, nose and throat. They have problems with chronic headaches and migraines. She said in a letter:


My seven year old boy … has been suffering fast onsetting headaches for a few years now. They are so severe he bangs his head into the wall or the floor anything to make them stop. 


We heard some evidence that there had been some studies recommended by the Queensland Department of Health to be done into air quality. Those studies were discontinued for no apparent or discernible reason and the studies were not in fact then carried out. Two years later the residents are still waiting to find out what sadly they already know from the daily experience—that their family's health is being threatened by this new industry. 


We had heard some very serious evidence from the CSIRO and from the Department of the Environment who confirmed that in their studies into hydraulic fracturing they have not even started to look at the impact of fracking on deep aquifers. They also acknowledged that that meant they had not looked at the risks of mobilising naturally occurring carcinogens in the geology, which occurs in the fracking process. Those studies are in their infancy. 


We also heard that there have been several jurisdictions, not just domestically. Some of the states, in recognition of the scientific dangers, have placed a moratorium on fracking—that is, Victoria and Tasmania. Of course, internationally many jurisdictions have said that fracking is too risky for our communities and our land—in Canada, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and in Europe, Germany, Wales, Scotland, France, Bulgaria and the Netherlands and there are many states of the USA. We are hearing more and more about the potential dangers of this process, yet we also heard in the course of the inquiry that the big parties do not wish to do anything about it. 


I found it incredibly disappointing—that would be understating it—that the report into this bill does in fact acknowledge that there are problems but it then proceeds to recommend doing absolutely nothing about those identify problems. In effect, it is a statement that says, 'This is not our problem; let's leave it up to the state governments. They're doing a perfectly find job.' Clearly, they are not doing a perfectly fine job. We heard evidence from many legal groups saying that the regulation of this industry is utterly woeful, that there are multiple breaches of permits, that there is a real risk to land and water from this new fossil fuel rapacious industry and that national leadership is required to at least put a moratoria on fracking until we better understand the kind of experiment that we are wreaking on communities. In the Greens' view, that evidence is already clear enough and there should be a ban.


Coming back to the key aspect of the bill, which is to allow landholders to say no to large coalmines and unconventional gas and fracking on their land, it was really quite duplicitous, I thought, to hear from industry saying, 'But look at how many voluntary agreements the community signed. They must be so happy with this arrangement; they have signed up to these agreements.' They have no choice to sign. They have no legal right not to sign. That was made patently clear not only simply from the common sense of it but also by some of the excellent witnesses who talked about this imbalance of bargaining power. Drew Hutton, from Lock the Gate, who of course should be acknowledged as the father of that movement, has done fantastic work in unifying communities and giving them a voice and some courage to speak out against this David and Goliath battle between the very wealthy multinational fossil fuel companies and the farming and community groups who have, sadly, been forgotten about by many folk in this place. Drew Hutton said:


The first assumption is that there is some sort of equality in the negotiation that goes on between mining companies and farmers. In fact, as far as we are concerned, there is no equality. It is negotiation with a gun at the head of the landowner.


Rosemary Nankivell, from the SOS Liverpool Plains group, said:


…the bill uses the term 'agreement'. I can tell you unequivocally that, when dealing with a resource company, there is no such thing as an agreement. In some cases, perhaps, a painful type of coexistence results, but it is the farming community that does the giving.


Kirsty Kelly, from People for the Plains, said:


All the power lies with the coal and gas companies; the landholders' only position is to accept or go to legal challenge. There is much discussion about coexistence between coal and gas and agriculture. But how can you have coexistence when all the power lies with one party?


Of course, the legal challenge that she is referring to there is not the ability to say no; it is just to quibble over the price of access.


So it was with great disappointment that, despite the excellent evidence given in the course of the inquiry into this bill that both of the big parties said, 'Not our problem; we’re not going to do a thing about this. Let's leave it up to the state governments. Yes, there seems to be some problem here, but it is not our responsibility to deal with it.' We think that this does need a national approach. Clearly, the vested interests in the coalmining companies and the unconventional gas companies, who make some generous donations to the political parties in this place, have been running the agenda and writing their own rules for far too long. It is about time the community had a fair go and had their rights to clean air and clean water and health protected.


If we are to truly tackle climate change, this notion that unconventional gas somehow burns cleaner than coal needs to be debunked. When you factor the leaking gas and those fugitive emissions that I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears on various visits to these places around the country you find that this stuff is just as dirty as coal. It is no solution to climate change. Clearly, it is not worth the risk to the health and longevity of our farmland and our farming communities.


So I commend the bill to this place. I do not commend the report, but I commend the dissenting report. I urge all members of this place to speak to their communities about this issue. You will find there is a real and growing community concern. People want their land, their water and their communities protected and they want their voice back. They are sick of not being heard and of their needs coming last as opposed to the big fossil fuel companies. I am really pleased to have been able to give those communities a voice in the course of this committee inquiry. We will not give up on this fight.

AUSTRALIAN IMMUNISATION REGISTER BILL 2015


I am pleased to introduce the Australian Immunisation Register Bill 2015.


The Australian Immunisation Register Bill 2015 creates a new, consolidated legislative framework for the establishment and ongoing management of Australian immunisation registers, and expands the scope of our two existing immunisation registers.




These changes implement measures announced in this year
'
s Federal Budget as part of the Government
'
s focus on improving immunisation rates across Australia, and will complement other Government initiatives, including 
No Jab, No Pay
, and new catch-up incentives to GP
'
s and other immunisation providers. 





The Coalition has a strong track record when it comes to improving immunisation rates, successfully increasing vaccination rates from 52% in 1996 up to around 90%, and it was the current Prime Minister, 
as then Health Minister who introduced the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme for school aged women in 2007. These new measures build on our successful record.





As I mentioned previously, the scope of our two current immunisation registers will be broadened. The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) will be expanded to become the Australian Immunisation Register, which will capture all vaccines given, from birth to death, through General Practice and community clinics. 





The ACIR currently records vaccinations given to children aged less than seven years. The ACIR will be expanded in two stages. From 1 January 2016, it will expanded to collect and record vaccinations given to young individuals under the age of 20 years, enabling implementation of the Government
'
s 
No Jab No


Pay
 Budget measure.





From September 2016, it will be expanded further to cover all vaccinations from birth to death given through General Practice and community clinics, supporting the addition of the zoster virus (shingles) vaccine to the National Immunisation Program for persons aged 70 years.







Implementing these changes to our national immunisation registers will broaden and improve immunisation data capture to assist recognised vaccin
a
tion providers to boost coverage rates.





Additionally, this bill expands the National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Program Register (the HPV Register) to become the Australian School Vaccination Register (ASVR), which will capture all adolescent vaccinations given through school programs from the start of the 2017 school year. 





The HPV Register currently only captures administration of the HPV vaccine. Other adolescent vaccinations administered through the school programs that would be captured in the Australian Schools Vaccination Register include Varicella (chickenpox) and the Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (whooping cough) booster. 



Currently, separate legislation within the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 provide the foundation for how the two national immunisation registers are operated. In this context, it is considered timely to consolidate the two pieces of separate legislation for the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register and Australian School Vaccination Register into a new, single piece of legislation to provide for the ongoing management and data capture for both registers. 


This Bill will lay the foundations for future work to move towards an integrated system that captures and reports on all vaccines given in Australia from birth to death, providing a single 'front door' for consumers and immunisation providers.


This Bill provides the framework under which Australian immunisation registers are operated and removes obstacles associated with the appropriate collection of personal information. This includes detailing the provisions in which individuals can access personal information, the type of information collected and including offence provisions that detail the offence generated by unauthorised disclosure of personal information. 


The Bill provides for the establishment of the Register and the recording of certain personal information about individuals. The Bill also creates an offence for the unauthorised disclosure of personal information contained within the Register.


The amendments contained within this bill will commence in three stages. From 1 January 2016 the new Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 will commence and it will facilitate the collection of information of 'young individuals' under the age of 20 years to assist the implementation of the Government's No Jab No Pay Budget measure. At the same time, a number of required consequential amendments will be made to other legislation. 


Amendments commencing in September 2016 include amendments to the Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 to reflect the name change and expansion of the ACIR to the Australian Immunisation Register and the Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010. These amendments will accommodate the Government's approval to list zoster virus (shingles) vaccine (Zostavax) on the National Immunisation Program for persons aged 70 years. 


Finally, from 1 January 2017 onwards, the Australian Schools Vaccination Register will capture all adolescent vaccinations given through school programmes from the start of the school year.Provisions of the new Bill will apply equally to the Australian Immunisation Register and the Australian School Vaccination Register and Part 9BA of the National Health Act 1953 will be repealed.


Through this Bill, expansion of the National Immunisation Registers and the way they continue to operate in the future will not only benefit the health of individuals; general practitioners and health care providers will have a consistent way in which immunisation records can be obtained for individuals of all ages, not just the young.


 


AUSTRALIAN IMMUNISATION REGISTER (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2015


This Bill provides for the Consequential and Transitional Provisions required to support the operation of the Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015.


The proposed Act will have amendments that commence in three stages. 


Part IVA of the Health Insurance Act 1973 will be repealed, along with associated offence provisions relating to the Register. These offences will be replaced by an offence in the new Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015. Additionally, minor amendments are proposed which will allow the disclosure of Medicare enrolment data to the Register. 


Minor amendments to Part 9BA of the National Health Act 1953 will be initiated to refer to a prescribed body within the meaning of the new Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015. 


The Freedom of Information Act 1982 will be amended, to provide for information in the registers to be exempt from disclosure under section 38 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in response to a freedom of information request. 


Provided under the amendments commencing 1 January 2016 include changes to the Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010 to repeal the definition of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) which links the register to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and refer instead to the Register operated under the new Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015. 


Amendments to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 to allow the definition of a 'recognised immunisation provider' to be consistent with the meaning of recognised vaccination provider in the new immunisation register Bill is also proposed to occur from 1 January 2016.


Finally, amendment to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973 and the Human Services (Centrelink) Act 1997 are also proposed to prescribe that the Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 is a 'designated program Act'.


Amendments commencing later in 2016 include changes to the Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 to reflect the name change of the ACIR to become the ""Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)"" and the provision to be able to collect vaccination information for all individuals regardless of age. 


A secondary amendment to the Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010 is proposed to repeal the definition of ACIR and allow for use and disclosure of health care identifiers for the purposes of uploading information from the Register onto an individual's Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record.


The final transition arrangement proposed is to commence 1 January 2017. From 1 January 2017 onwards, the provisions of the new Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 will apply equally to the Australian Immunisation Register and the Australian School Vaccination Register. Following this expansion Part 9BA of the National Health Act 1953 will be repealed.


The schedules listed in the transitional and consequential arrangements in this Bill will only commence if the Australian Immunisation Registers Bill 2015 obtains Royal Assent. 




Senator NASH:
  I move:

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:37):  As I was saying in my previous contribution to this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015, this is a really important trial, and to make a trial effective we have to have all the issues considered and examined closely, both by the parliament and by the community which is involved.


Certainly, one of the core aspects is the fact that we are changing social security access by members of the community. As I said, many of these members of the community may not know that these changes are going to occur, so it is very important that that information is shared. But what has become very clear over many years in this place is that there is never a single, brought reaction to any process. In this case it became very clear that the change to the healthy welfare card must be supported by wraparound services that identify the very issues that the community has said they need to struggle against. And those are the impact of alcoholism, drugs and gambling, and the dissolution of effective community.


One of the core aspects of the investigation that we took in the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry was what the process was going to be for ensuring that these wraparound services are introduced, well-resourced and also evaluated, to see that not just the card process alone but in fact intensive support for the community can make a difference in lives. That is what the community has asked for. The community of Ceduna—the leadership of the community of Ceduna—told our committee that they wanted a change in their area.


At the time of our community affairs inquiry we had no detail at all. We were just told that there had been discussions, that there would be changes and that there would be processes put in place. Only very recently—in fact, at the end of last week and earlier this week, at the time when this piece of legislation was being brought to the Senate—the assistant minister responsible in the government has been in communication with Ms Macklin and also, I take it, with other people in this place, about what will be invested in Ceduna to ensure that the community has the most effective trial put in place. A figure has been allocated which has been added to existing services. Earlier, there had been an audit of services in the Ceduna community to see what was then available. Then, through agreement with the federal government and the state government, it was going to be the full wraparound package for the area.


We do appreciate that there has been more detail provided now. We appreciate that this detail has been put forward by the government after discussions with the local community. But I just put on record that for there to be any outcome—any effective response to the issues that have been identified—it is most important to make sure that the kinds of support services which we discussed at our committee are in place. They include things like appropriate alcohol support for people who are struggling with this process and appropriate financial counselling support. When you are living on a low income in any way it is hard enough to cope. But when you have assessable income and the way it is received by you so massively changed by the introduction of an 80-20 split, that is when you certainly need that financial counselling support.


Mr Tudge, in his role as assistant minister, has provided that detail very recently. We think that it gives an opportunity to ensure that the community can work effectively with the three levels of government—local, federal and state—to ensure that Ceduna and the outlying areas have support. As we know, it is not only the township of Ceduna involved; there is also the range of outlying communities which are in the coverage area for the trial.


Another aspect that was talked about consistently was the absolute need for an effective evaluation process. Since we had our committee hearing—and I do apologise, Mr Acting Deputy President: I had been talking earlier with some concern about the lack of information that was available to us when we actually had the one-day hearing to look at this legislation—there has been provided to the committee and also to the shadow minister, more detail about the importance of and the process for putting in place an effective evaluation mechanism.


Again, there is still much which has yet to be finalised. This is another time when this parliament is being asked to support a process without having all the information in front of it. I think that we need to have it to feel certain that the trial process is given every possible chance.


On that point: in some of the interaction that has occurred with the assistant minister talking to the shadow minister, Ms Macklin, and other people, there seems to have been some issues raised that Labor may not be responding to the demands and needs of the people of Ceduna. I want to put clearly on the record that the Labor Party is interested in responding to what the people of Ceduna and the surrounding region have asked for, which is support to look at the social issues which are, in their words, 'destroying their community.' As I have said, we have listened to that.


But this needs to be an effectively designed, resourced and evaluated trial. If not, it will add again to what I believe is the betrayal of the people of that region. They have been given a set of expectations that they will be given the necessary support they need to work together to ensure they can rebuild their community. And, as we have heard from them, they want their kids to grow up healthy and safe, and want people to feel as though they have that chance for a future. Again, if any process is not done with the most strict understanding of what can work, how it will be evaluated and how the people in the community will be actively involved it will be another failed process. What the people of Ceduna do not need is another failed process.


On that basis, the first step included in the bill is about three communities which would be identified to be part of the trial. There may well be variations in the way in which it operates in different parts of the country—you would expect that. But the most clear aspect of our inquiry was that people want this to work. We do not want to be part of any process that does not give that the best possible chance. So there needs to be considerably more exchange of information. There needs to be a commitment that, should things change in Ceduna during the time of the trial, there will be more support available so that, if things are identified that should be introduced, the governments will make a commitment that they will intercede at that time. This needs to be a flexible, dynamic process. We cannot just say, 'This is how the trial will operate,' and walk away from it.


I know there are different views. I particularly want to acknowledge the submissions provided to our committee by ACOSS and the National Welfare Rights Network, who have great concerns about any of these processes with changing the way the social security system works or impacts on people. Because of technical difficulties on the day, we could not hear their evidence, on top of their very detailed submissions. But they have raised serious issues about how we can most effectively work with the community. Should the trial proceed, we have to get everybody who has interest, concern and expertise involved. In terms of the government process and the range of departments involved—this is not a single department process; this crosses at least three Commonwealth departments and a number of departments in the South Australian government—there needs to be confidence that information will be shared openly, that there is a transparency about this process and that consistently along the way there are checkpoints to see how the progress is occurring and what evaluation is taking place, because it is in everybody's interest to ensure that this community is safe and healthy.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:46):  I rise to make a contribution on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. It will come as no surprise to anybody that, right up-front, the Greens are opposing this flawed approach to deal with extremely complex, serious issues. This is flawed legislation. It is income management on steroids. We know that income management has not worked. The monitoring and the evaluation processes have clearly showed that. This legislation is being rushed through. The committee was limited in the extent to which we could inquire into this bill because we were forced to meet a very short time line for reporting, to the extent that we could not hear from two of the peak social service organisations in this country: the Australian Council of Social Service and the National Welfare Rights Network. They made very important submissions, bringing up very important issues, and we could not find time to hear from them, because of a technical difficulty on the day. We had to cram them into one session. The phone lines failed so we could not hear from them, and we could not find another time to meet with them. That is appalling, when they are two of the largest organisations in this country that are particularly qualified to talk about this particular issue.


This is a punitive, ideologically driven approach that is not based on evidence. We are in an evidence-free zone here. I will come back to the government's proposed evaluation. A limited amount of information has just been made public, in a letter from Minister Tudge to the ALP. I will come back to the flawed approach that it looks like the government will be undertaking with this so-called trial. This bill is being rushed through. I suspect one of the reasons the government want to rush it through is that, if more communities find out what is going on, they will refuse to take the trial as well. The government hope that, once they get Ceduna up, maybe some other communities will come on board. It is well known around the shops that a number of centres have refused to participate in the trial. I will come back to where we are with East Kimberley later.


I was hoping that, with the change of PM, the new PM would abandon this ideological approach to how we help communities. But no. We have a new PM but the same old policies. The PM, I am sure, must know that this is the 'brainchild' of Andrew Forrest, again based on ideology and not on evidence of what does and does not work. Throughout the committee process, we heard of a number of problems in relation to this bill. These add to the concerns that we already had about income management. The overriding concern here is that these trials are to expand income management. We know that. When the minister was the parliamentary secretary, he made comments about the fact that this would provide further evidence around a possible expansion of income management. So any claims by government that this is not income management are simply not true.


The bill amends the social security legislation to split welfare payments into restricted and unrestricted portions. Basically the trial proposes that 80 per cent of payments received by trial participants will be restricted, with the remaining 20 per cent available to cash. Those of you who know the limited size of the payments of Newstart, for example, will know that that is a very small amount of cash that people are going to be able to receive. The restricted portion will be paid into a specified bank account. At this point, we still do not know who the financial provider of the so-called debit card will be. We are voting on this legislation and we do not know who the financial institution that provides the card will be. I have just read the letter that has been made public, and it does not say it in there. They are in the final stages of negotiation.


This card will not be able to be used to purchase alcohol or gambling products or to withdraw cash. The bank and the government will potentially know what types of purchases you make, because there will be a transfer of information between the bank and the financial institutions. Participants in the trial will be determined by legislative instrument, based on a combination of trial areas, the income support payment an individual is receiving and the class of persons, which we understand may be used to distinguish based on age. At this stage we know that the legislation includes trigger payments for youth allowance, Austudy and carer payments. These are payments to people that are caring for their loved ones, caring for relatives, carrying out important tasks. We are income managing carers—people on disability support payment, parenting payment single, widow pension B and wife pension. The age pension does not trigger this; I am aware of that.


We know there are a number of broad problems with income management. This blanket measure will apply to the trial locations regardless of whether a person struggles with some form of substance abuse—whether it be alcohol or another drug—or gambling. It will not be tailored to meet the differing needs and circumstances of individuals, which we know from all the evidence are absolutely crucial when we are dealing with such things as substance abuse, gambling abuse, and people that are living in difficulty and suffer from disadvantage. We know that individualised approaches are the things that work, not blanket approaches, taking decision making out of their hands or imposing on their dignity. That is one of the things that people have said to me in personal communications—in emails or in talking to me. They have a deep concern about the impact on their dignity that this sort of thing has.


We have strongly opposed income management, I will say right from the start, because we did our due diligence. We looked at the international evidence that showed that income management does not work. You know what? Evaluation after evaluation has in fact shown that to be the case, including the final evaluation of income management. We will continue to oppose this approach, which in fact is punitive and top-down. We spoke about this when the Howard government introduced the Northern Territory intervention in 2007, and we spoke about it in 2010, and we spoke about it in 2011 and 2012, when the Gillard government continued income management.


We do not oppose voluntary income management per se. There is some evidence to suggest that in fact voluntary income management can work, and so we do not oppose voluntary income management. I again point out that Tangentyere Council in Central Australia have been running what they used to call a form of Centrepay, different to Centrelink or Human Services Centrepay, where they had about 2,000 people on their books who, at various times, were in fact doing their own form of money management through Tangentyere Council. That was voluntary.


In the evidence the committee has received from independent researchers, academics and commissioned evaluations, we have had a consistent message, and that is that income management has not been working. A note by the Parliamentary Library said:


The evaluation reports published to date have not provided strong evidence of benefit for those referred under the 'membership of a class' measures—


that is, people who are forced to undertake income management because they are receiving a particular type of income support payment. That is exactly how this trial will apply in the locations it will be rolled out in. In a submission to our inquiry, Eva Cox, adjunct professor at the University of Technology Sydney, wrote:


… there is no valid evidence that the income management program, in its various form, has improved the alcohol and related problems in the range of communities in the NT where it has been applied.


One of the most important conclusions from a report commissioned by the government—after much prompting, I must add—when they were evaluating income management and the intervention in the Northern Territory was:


The evaluation could not find any substantive evidence of the program having significant changes relative to its key policy objectives, including changing people’s behaviours.


…   …   …


The evaluation data does not provide evidence of income management having improved the outcomes that it was intending to have an impact upon.


Through the inquiry process, we have heard from one of the authors of that very extensive evaluation; we understand that it is in fact one of the most in-depth evaluations that we have had on income management yet. That expert confirmed that there was no evidence that income management achieved its goals and that the findings are very relevant to the measure that we are currently debating. That is particularly important because the government has consistently been trying to imply that income management is different to what we are going to do in Ceduna, when quite plainly one of the authors of that evaluation said it is highly relevant to the legislation that we are currently talking about.


This is an issue that we have been campaigning against for a number of years now, and the evidence bears out that income management is an expensive process that hurts the people who actually need help the most. I am deeply concerned that what we are seeing here is an ideologically driven approach that is not based on evidence and that, unfortunately, the other two major parties in this country are supporting income management and this approach without evidence that it works. When this first came in the noughties, maybe they could say there was not any evidence from Australia to show that it would not work, but we do have evidence now. We clearly have evidence now that this does not work.


Let me go to the consultation process for a short time. Mr President, do you want me to keep going and stop at five, or would you like me to finish my speech?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Siewert, if you want to continue through to past 5 pm and conclude when you want to conclude, that would be fine.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Okay. I just thought I had better check to see how you wanted to handle it, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  You are entitled to continue your remarks until the expiration of another eight minutes and 11 seconds.




Senator SIEWERT:
  One of the arguments that the government has been making is that this is different because they have actually gone out and done consultation. I will say that in the past governments from both sides, when they were talking about income management, have said they had carried out consultation too, and in fact that plainly was not sufficient. I would suggest that, while there has been some consultation and meetings undertaken by the government, there clearly was inadequate consultation undertaken in Ceduna.


There is a petition that should have been tabled today—if not, it is being tabled tomorrow. Over 200 people have signed the petition, which is around 10 per cent of the population of Ceduna. They have said, 'We don't like this.' We know there is a climate of pressure on a number of people in Ceduna about this particular trial, but individuals who are on Newstart, carers payment or DSP have not been consulted. As far as we can tell, from the limited time we have had available during the Senate inquiry, what happened is that while some of the office bearers in Ceduna have said, 'Yes, we like this idea,' they have not consulted their actual constituents. People who are actually on income support have not been consulted. For some, the first time they found out about this was when they saw it in the media. There was no town meeting. In fact, the only meetings that have been held in the broader population in Ceduna are by the people who hold concerns about this particular measure. So the government cannot claim that they have had an extensive consultation period. 


I notice that the opposition tailored their comments largely to Ceduna. This government, though, is planning to roll this out in East Kimberley. Just last week we had the Halls Creek Shire and the Aboriginal advisory committee to the local shire reject the healthy welfare card. So the government cannot claim that they have overwhelming support from either the broader community in Australia or, particularly in East Kimberley, from a large number of Aboriginal people who are rejecting this particular measure. So much for the consultation process. It is very clear that there has not been a lot of consultation with many members of the community who will be subjected to this particular measure.


There are many people in Ceduna who have been emailing me, who have presented evidence to the committee, who gave very eloquent evidence about what impact this particular measure will have on their lives. Unfortunately, I am going to run out of time but there are a lot of issues about the implementation of this particular measure. Senator Moore outlined some of those issues that came up during the committee process and some of those measures are addressed again in the letter from the minister, but there are still significant issues. What are the minimum purchase prices that you will be able to use when you are using your ETPOS card? What happens when you lose your card? I know from personal experience that when you are in regional and remote areas you cannot get a card replaced very quickly.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  Mr President, I have limited time as it is, without having to compete with interjections.



The PRESIDENT:  You have the call, Senator Siewert. On my right.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I know from personal experience that it is very difficult. You cannot get your card replaced straightaway, so you have to go into a bank to get cash. If you are only allowed 20 per cent, that is not going to be much cash to get you through until your card is replaced. The government could not answer a question that we asked on notice about bank fees, and now they have come back in a letter to Ms Macklin to say that there are not going to be transaction fees. Who is going to pay for those transaction fees? The financial institution? Is that going to add further to the cost? People have talked about needing cash to participate in a cash economy, particularly when they have a limited amount of funds. People on income support are not poor money managers. My experience is that those living on income support are some of the best money managers you can find because they are living below the poverty line, or very close to the poverty line. They have to take care of every dollar that they have available. They participate in the second-hand goods market. What happens when they go to a restaurant? Now the government is saying that places that sell alcohol, or a gambling establishment, will still be able to use the card. Those products will just be banned. What happens when they sit down and have a meal? The government is saying that people on income management cannot have a meal with a glass of wine. 




Senator Scullion:
  They use their 20 per cent cash.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I just heard that interjection saying that they can use their cash. What happens when they have to use their cash to give their kid money for the school bus, for a school lunch, for second-hand goods, for a taxi? They can use cash for that, but what you are saying is that they cannot go in and then pay for that separately. What do they do when they are in a restaurant? It is supposed to be, 'There's no discrimination here. We're going to maintain people's dignity.' They are going to have to use a separate card for paying for their meal and then get cash out to pay for alcohol. They might as well wear a sign saying, 'I am on income support' when they go into those places. What happens when they are running short of cash and they cannot get any more? In some cases we are talking about $50, folks. 


It comes to the point where people talk about their loss of dignity. People who are living on income support are so careful to protect their dignity and to have control over their own lives. We know from the evidence that what helps people find employment, to access education and training and to start to overcome some of the causes of disadvantage or some of their abuse issues is being able to have a form of control over their lives. That is what people have been talking to me and emailing me about. It is the fear of the loss their decision making capacity and the loss of their dignity. Whether they have a substance abuse issue or whether they have a gambling problem, there will be a large number of people who will be subject to this measure and they are going on it because the government has ideologically decided that this is a way that they think that they will make a difference when it does not work. People who are struggling to make ends meet now face a feeling of loss of control over decision making and a loss of their dignity. 


There are many case examples that were provided to us during the Senate inquiry, such as people needing extra cash to be able to travel, to contribute to buying a birthday present, a christening gift or a gift for a first grandchild, and not being able to do it. That is what we mean when we are talking about people's loss of dignity and loss of control over decision making. We know those are key things when you are dealing with people's substance abuse, when you are dealing with people who are trying to get their lives together if they have a chaotic life or if they have got some issues. This is why income management does not work. This is why this approach will not work. Yet again, we are going to be spending and wasting more money on this.

I suspect one of the reasons the government want to rush it through is that, if more communities find out what is going on, they will refuse to take the trial as well. The government hope that, once they get Ceduna up, maybe some other communities will come on board. It is well known around the shops that a number of centres have refused to participate in the trial. I will come back to where we are with East Kimberley later.


I was hoping that, with the change of PM, the new PM would abandon this ideological approach to how we help communities. But no. We have a new PM but the same old policies. The PM, I am sure, must know that this is the 'brainchild' of Andrew Forrest, again based on ideology and not on evidence of what does and does not work. Throughout the committee process, we heard of a number of problems in relation to this bill. These add to the concerns that we already had about income management. The overriding concern here is that these trials are to expand income management. We know that. When the minister was the parliamentary secretary, he made comments about the fact that this would provide further evidence around a possible expansion of income management. So any claims by government that this is not income management are simply not true.


The bill amends the social security legislation to split welfare payments into restricted and unrestricted portions. Basically the trial proposes that 80 per cent of payments received by trial participants will be restricted, with the remaining 20 per cent available to cash. Those of you who know the limited size of the payments of Newstart, for example, will know that that is a very small amount of cash that people are going to be able to receive. The restricted portion will be paid into a specified bank account. At this point, we still do not know who the financial provider of the so-called debit card will be. We are voting on this legislation and we do not know who the financial institution that provides the card will be. I have just read the letter that has been made public, and it does not say it in there. They are in the final stages of negotiation.


This card will not be able to be used to purchase alcohol or gambling products or to withdraw cash. The bank and the government will potentially know what types of purchases you make, because there will be a transfer of information between the bank and the financial institutions. Participants in the trial will be determined by legislative instrument, based on a combination of trial areas, the income support payment an individual is receiving and the class of persons, which we understand may be used to distinguish based on age. At this stage we know that the legislation includes trigger payments for youth allowance, Austudy and carer payments. These are payments to people that are caring for their loved ones, caring for relatives, carrying out important tasks. We are income managing carers—people on disability support payment, parenting payment single, widow pension B and wife pension. The age pension does not trigger this; I am aware of that.


We know there are a number of broad problems with income management. This blanket measure will apply to the trial locations regardless of whether a person struggles with some form of substance abuse—whether it be alcohol or another drug—or gambling. It will not be tailored to meet the differing needs and circumstances of individuals, which we know from all the evidence are absolutely crucial when we are dealing with such things as substance abuse, gambling abuse, and people that are living in difficulty and suffer from disadvantage. We know that individualised approaches are the things that work, not blanket approaches, taking decision making out of their hands or imposing on their dignity. That is one of the things that people have said to me in personal communications—in emails or in talking to me. They have a deep concern about the impact on their dignity that this sort of thing has.


We have strongly opposed income management, I will say right from the start, because we did our due diligence. We looked at the international evidence that showed that income management does not work. You know what? Evaluation after evaluation has in fact shown that to be the case, including the final evaluation of income management. We will continue to oppose this approach, which in fact is punitive and top-down. We spoke about this when the Howard government introduced the Northern Territory intervention in 2007, and we spoke about it in 2010, and we spoke about it in 2011 and 2012, when the Gillard government continued income management.


We do not oppose voluntary income management per se. There is some evidence to suggest that in fact voluntary income management can work, and so we do not oppose voluntary income management. I again point out that Tangentyere Council in Central Australia have been running what they used to call a form of Centrepay, different to Centrelink or Human Services Centrepay, where they had about 2,000 people on their books who, at various times, were in fact doing their own form of money management through Tangentyere Council. That was voluntary.


In the evidence the committee has received from independent researchers, academics and commissioned evaluations, we have had a consistent message, and that is that income management has not been working. A note by the Parliamentary Library said:


The evaluation reports published to date have not provided strong evidence of benefit for those referred under the 'membership of a class' measures—


that is, people who are forced to undertake income management because they are receiving a particular type of income support payment. That is exactly how this trial will apply in the locations it will be rolled out in. In a submission to our inquiry, Eva Cox, adjunct professor at the University of Technology Sydney, wrote:


… there is no valid evidence that the income management program, in its various form, has improved the alcohol and related problems in the range of communities in the NT where it has been applied.


One of the most important conclusions from a report commissioned by the government—after much prompting, I must add—when they were evaluating income management and the intervention in the Northern Territory was:


The evaluation could not find any substantive evidence of the program having significant changes relative to its key policy objectives, including changing people’s behaviours.


…   …   …


The evaluation data does not provide evidence of income management having improved the outcomes that it was intending to have an impact upon.


Through the inquiry process, we have heard from one of the authors of that very extensive evaluation; we understand that it is in fact one of the most in-depth evaluations that we have had on income management yet. That expert confirmed that there was no evidence that income management achieved its goals and that the findings are very relevant to the measure that we are currently debating. That is particularly important because the government has consistently been trying to imply that income management is different to what we are going to do in Ceduna, when quite plainly one of the authors of that evaluation said it is highly relevant to the legislation that we are currently talking about.


This is an issue that we have been campaigning against for a number of years now, and the evidence bears out that income management is an expensive process that hurts the people who actually need help the most. I am deeply concerned that what we are seeing here is an ideologically driven approach that is not based on evidence and that, unfortunately, the other two major parties in this country are supporting income management and this approach without evidence that it works. When this first came in the noughties, maybe they could say there was not any evidence from Australia to show that it would not work, but we do have evidence now. We clearly have evidence now that this does not work.


Let me go to the consultation process for a short time. Mr President, do you want me to keep going and stop at five, or would you like me to finish my speech?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Siewert, if you want to continue through to past 5 pm and conclude when you want to conclude, that would be fine.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Okay. I just thought I had better check to see how you wanted to handle it, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  You are entitled to continue your remarks until the expiration of another eight minutes and 11 seconds.




Senator SIEWERT:
  One of the arguments that the government has been making is that this is different because they have actually gone out and done consultation. I will say that in the past governments from both sides, when they were talking about income management, have said they had carried out consultation too, and in fact that plainly was not sufficient. I would suggest that, while there has been some consultation and meetings undertaken by the government, there clearly was inadequate consultation undertaken in Ceduna.


There is a petition that should have been tabled today—if not, it is being tabled tomorrow. Over 200 people have signed the petition, which is around 10 per cent of the population of Ceduna. They have said, 'We don't like this.' We know there is a climate of pressure on a number of people in Ceduna about this particular trial, but individuals who are on Newstart, carers payment or DSP have not been consulted. As far as we can tell, from the limited time we have had available during the Senate inquiry, what happened is that while some of the office bearers in Ceduna have said, 'Yes, we like this idea,' they have not consulted their actual constituents. People who are actually on income support have not been consulted. For some, the first time they found out about this was when they saw it in the media. There was no town meeting. In fact, the only meetings that have been held in the broader population in Ceduna are by the people who hold concerns about this particular measure. So the government cannot claim that they have had an extensive consultation period. 


I notice that the opposition tailored their comments largely to Ceduna. This government, though, is planning to roll this out in East Kimberley. Just last week we had the Halls Creek Shire and the Aboriginal advisory committee to the local shire reject the healthy welfare card. So the government cannot claim that they have overwhelming support from either the broader community in Australia or, particularly in East Kimberley, from a large number of Aboriginal people who are rejecting this particular measure. So much for the consultation process. It is very clear that there has not been a lot of consultation with many members of the community who will be subjected to this particular measure.


There are many people in Ceduna who have been emailing me, who have presented evidence to the committee, who gave very eloquent evidence about what impact this particular measure will have on their lives. Unfortunately, I am going to run out of time but there are a lot of issues about the implementation of this particular measure. Senator Moore outlined some of those issues that came up during the committee process and some of those measures are addressed again in the letter from the minister, but there are still significant issues. What are the minimum purchase prices that you will be able to use when you are using your ETPOS card? What happens when you lose your card? I know from personal experience that when you are in regional and remote areas you cannot get a card replaced very quickly.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  Mr President, I have limited time as it is, without having to compete with interjections.



The PRESIDENT:  You have the call, Senator Siewert. On my right.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I know from personal experience that it is very difficult. You cannot get your card replaced straightaway, so you have to go into a bank to get cash. If you are only allowed 20 per cent, that is not going to be much cash to get you through until your card is replaced. The government could not answer a question that we asked on notice about bank fees, and now they have come back in a letter to Ms Macklin to say that there are not going to be transaction fees. Who is going to pay for those transaction fees? The financial institution? Is that going to add further to the cost? People have talked about needing cash to participate in a cash economy, particularly when they have a limited amount of funds. People on income support are not poor money managers. My experience is that those living on income support are some of the best money managers you can find because they are living below the poverty line, or very close to the poverty line. They have to take care of every dollar that they have available. They participate in the second-hand goods market. What happens when they go to a restaurant? Now the government is saying that places that sell alcohol, or a gambling establishment, will still be able to use the card. Those products will just be banned. What happens when they sit down and have a meal? The government is saying that people on income management cannot have a meal with a glass of wine. 




Senator Scullion:
  They use their 20 per cent cash.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I just heard that interjection saying that they can use their cash. What happens when they have to use their cash to give their kid money for the school bus, for a school lunch, for second-hand goods, for a taxi? They can use cash for that, but what you are saying is that they cannot go in and then pay for that separately. What do they do when they are in a restaurant? It is supposed to be, 'There's no discrimination here. We're going to maintain people's dignity.' They are going to have to use a separate card for paying for their meal and then get cash out to pay for alcohol. They might as well wear a sign saying, 'I am on income support' when they go into those places. What happens when they are running short of cash and they cannot get any more? In some cases we are talking about $50, folks. 


It comes to the point where people talk about their loss of dignity. People who are living on income support are so careful to protect their dignity and to have control over their own lives. We know from the evidence that what helps people find employment, to access education and training and to start to overcome some of the causes of disadvantage or some of their abuse issues is being able to have a form of control over their lives. That is what people have been talking to me and emailing me about. It is the fear of the loss their decision making capacity and the loss of their dignity. Whether they have a substance abuse issue or whether they have a gambling problem, there will be a large number of people who will be subject to this measure and they are going on it because the government has ideologically decided that this is a way that they think that they will make a difference when it does not work. People who are struggling to make ends meet now face a feeling of loss of control over decision making and a loss of their dignity. 


There are many case examples that were provided to us during the Senate inquiry, such as people needing extra cash to be able to travel, to contribute to buying a birthday present, a christening gift or a gift for a first grandchild, and not being able to do it. That is what we mean when we are talking about people's loss of dignity and loss of control over decision making. We know those are key things when you are dealing with people's substance abuse, when you are dealing with people who are trying to get their lives together if they have a chaotic life or if they have got some issues. This is why income management does not work. This is why this approach will not work. Yet again, we are going to be spending and wasting more money on this. 


Debate interrupted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,2
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-10-13,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:30):  I am pleased to be supporting the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. This bill is absolutely critical to finding ways to deal with social harm, particularly violence against women and children, caused by welfare-enabled alcohol and drug abuse. This bill will allow for the introduction of a cashless debit card trial for up to three different communities. These communities will be selected for the trial on the basis of high-welfare dependence and high-social-harm indicators and also openness from community leaders to participate in the trial. The trial will run for 12 months, be limited to 10,000 participants and be subject to independent evaluation. This card is an important recommendation from the Forrest review report, Creating Parity, as a way of dealing with significant harm occurring in heavily welfare-dependent communities.


I would like to respond to some of the things Senator Siewert had to say on consultation. I found them a little bit ironic. I met with the Yalata community and the Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation, whose leaders came to Canberra in the last couple of days to talk to senators about this legislation, and I am told that Senator Siewert refused to meet with them. 



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  You talk about consultation, but then you refused to hear from the very community leaders who are going to be affected by this trial, who are affected by the problems right now and who are best placed, in my opinion, along with other community leaders and other community members, to have a view on why this is necessary.


Mr Andrew Forrest, whose Creating Parity report recommended this reform, gave evidence to the community affairs committee inquiry a few weeks ago on 11 September and set out the tragic and troubling context for this reform. We should pay tribute to Mr Forrest. He is clearly committed to getting better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. I do not think we should question that at all. I think there is a genuineness to him, and certainly that is the way he presented as a witness. If we look at his record, he has done some great things. We should commend significant Australians like Mr Forrest who are looking to put something back. Mr Forrest told our committee:


Unfortunately, over the 40- or 50-year period that I can remember, I have seen the degradation of communities at the hands of alcohol and drugs. As many would know, in those communities there is a very high rate of attendance at funerals of friends and people who, like me, were bright-eyed, confident, happy and looking forward to living a full and secure life in Australia as youth. I feel that has been denied to so many of our vulnerable Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, through disproportionate access to alcohol and drugs in vulnerable communities. These are the great destroyers of community, of lives. 


Ceduna in South Australia will be the first site where this trial will take place. Ceduna and its surrounding region has a population of 4,425. It is a town on the midcoast of South Australia around 800 kilometres west of Adelaide. In 2013-14 there were over 500 presentations to the emergency department due to alcohol or drug abuse—more than one a day. The Ceduna Sobering Up Centre had 4,667 admissions in that same year. Hospitalisations in the region due to assault are 68 times the national average.


The Ceduna community leadership, who also made a submission to the community affairs committee and appeared at the public hearing, have called for this reform and see it as a crucial way of addressing the wide-ranging drug, alcohol and gambling problems in their community. When the government announced they would like to bring the trial to Ceduna, these leaders said:


We want to build a future for our younger generation to aspire to and believe we cannot do this if our families are caught up in the destructive cycle of alcohol or drugs that destroys our culture, our lands and our communities.


At the heart of this reform is a change that is being shaped specifically to meet our local needs. It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.


We have grasped this initiative; we have helped shape this initiative; and we are confident that this initiative is for the betterment of all people within our region.


These are very powerful words coming from these community leaders. They are saying that they want to empower their community and deal with the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse in their communities. We as a government want to work with those communities who are willing to take these steps. We want to work with them and trial these technologies to see if we can make a genuine difference to some of these horrifying statistics. That is what this reform is about. It is about improving the lives of people in the regions. It is about protecting people from harm and giving people who have been caught in a cycle of welfare dependency, addiction and abuse some hope that there is a better way and a better future. Ceduna community leaders told the committee during the public hearing:


We understand the introduction of this trial is not the silver bullet to solve all of our issues, but we strongly believe that it provides part of an overall plan aimed at reducing easy access to alcohol, drugs and gambling addiction. As community leaders, we are very much aware of the social consequences of sitting back and not doing anything. We are at the forefront of alcohol and drug related violence. Families are going without food and children are not attending school, and there are other social issues which impact on the general health and social wellbeing of our people.


In the past, measures to reduce alcohol fuelled violence and chronic alcohol misuse—contributing to the premature deaths of our people—have been tried and tested and have failed. It is our belief that as a first trial site, amongst a possible three across Australia, we now have an opportunity to make positive change in the lives of our people.


Again, these are powerful words coming from those on the ground. The government is listening to those communities and working with them to get better outcomes.


Let's go to some facts about the card. This card will look, feel and act like the normal debit card product that we all use every day and will be connected to the Visa, MasterCard or EFTPOS platform. Participants in the trial would receive this cashless debit card for the cashless part of their welfare payment, and their existing bank account will receive the cash component of their payment. Government consultation with community leaders has determined that 80 per cent is the sensible cashless figure.


Under the trial, if you are on Newstart, single with three children and live in your own home, you have over $145 cash per week, with the remainder of the payment on your card. If you are on parenting payment, single with four children and living in a private rental, you will receive over $220 cash per week, with the remainder of the payment on the card. If you are on disability support pension, partnered and with no children, you will receive over $85 per week, with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are single and on Newstart, you will receive $60 per week cash, with the remainder of your payment on the card.


This card will work like any ordinary debit card from any ordinary bank except for those store categories which have been switched off. These stores would include liquor stores and gambling outlets. Participants will also not be able to withdraw cash using this card; however, the 20 per cent that goes into their usual bank account can be withdrawn and used without restrictions. Participants will be able to benefit from banking technologies, including online budgeting options. Participants may also be able to manage their welfare payments and develop their budgeting skills through setting daily spend limits, maximum transaction values and maximum numbers of transactions per day should they wish to.


The card will include push text technology for recipients and their mobile phones. This will help people develop their financial literacy and financial management. People will receive these notifications when their Centrelink payment has arrived in their account, to show them the remaining balance after a purchase over $10 and when their balance is running low.


It was made clear that many in the communities affected by this proposal were generally in favour of it and those against it were often external to the community. For example, Professor Eva Cox gave evidence at the hearing to oppose this measure. I asked Professor Cox if she had actually spoken to people in Ceduna about the trial. Her answer was, 'No, I have not.' The committee also heard from Mr Rob Bray of the ANU, who, when asked if he had spoken to people in Ceduna, replied, 'No, I've not spoken to any of the community of Ceduna.' Professor Ilan Katz of UNSW also opposed this measure; but, again, when asked about his involvement with the people of Ceduna, he said, 'I've not spoken to them either.'


Many of those opposed to this measure went on to mount a straw man argument about income management with regard to this bill. This issue came up during the committee hearings, and it needs to be made clear that this is a false comparison. This trial is not income management. It was emphasised a number of times during the committee hearings that this debit card is not to be confused with the BasicsCard or any other type of income management. Professor Marcia Langton, who has worked in some of the affected communities, made it clear that this measure is not income management. She told the committee:


It is quite a different model. Income management works in a kind of reverse way. What is being proposed here will work substantially differently and it is important to trial this in order to see if this kind of approach will work better. Under this scheme, there will be something like the Families Responsibilities Commission—that is, a committee of responsible members of the community, including elders, who subscribe to good social norms, who hear cases to remove the high levels of the cashless component of the income to enable people to access the cash, depending on, critically, whether or not they are sending their children to school every day.


Mr Michael Haynes, the CEO of Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation and one of the community leaders actually from Ceduna, also told the committee:


… this is not about income management. This is a cashless debit visa card. We see it as totally different …


Mr Gregory Franks, the CEO of Yalata Community Inc, expanded on Mr Haynes's comments to the committee by saying:


The difference between this card is that it has a 70/30 minimum split, a standard split of 80/20 and potentially 90/10, so it has the variable. It has very strong Aboriginal leadership commitment to it. It has very strong community support. It is a standard visa-type card that you can use anywhere in the country. It is a catch-all for everybody, black or white—anybody who is receiving benefits. But the big aspect of whether this will work or not will be around the fact that the trial will have a range of support packages provided with it, things like financial counselling, alcohol and other drugs counselling, and grief and loss counselling, as well as support for employment programs, support for economic development activity and support for diversionary activity. That is where this card will succeed or fail. It is not the mechanics of the card or the card itself. I know that I, and probably you, do not use more than 20 per cent of my own cash when I do most of my transactions. It is a normalising behaviour and it facilitates that normalising behaviour. It has very strong community support and very strong Aboriginal leadership support, but it is the support packages that we are still negotiating that will determine whether the card does or does not work.


Some critics of the trial also talked about it being a paternalistic measure or limiting people's human rights. When asked about this during the hearing, Professor Langton said:


I do not believe that it is paternalistic at all. Aboriginal leaders in these communities want this measure, and they want this measure because you have to see alcohol abuse to the extent that it occurs in these communities at firsthand to understand their concerns. What has happened over the last 50 years is that Aboriginal people have become normalised to welfare dependency. The proposition that a capable adult could go and get a job is simply regarded as impossible by many Aboriginal people because they have a mindset that their permanent destination is social security dependence.


…   …   …


This is not a paternalistic measure; this is a protective measure that leaders have examined closely and want for their communities because children are unsafe, women are unsafe and, more and more, people are being dragged into the drinking culture and increasing the proportion of drinkers in the community.


Professor Langton went on to say:


In relation to human rights, this is not a human rights abuse. The proposition is not race based. Both of these towns are open towns that have multicultural populations, including Australian settler folk, various kinds of Australians from elsewhere in the world, and very large Aboriginal populations—and much larger Aboriginal populations in the Hinterland of these towns.


Mr Forrest also addressed this issue, saying:


… this card is not remotely paternalistic. Anything which gives thinking adults caring for community—experienced adults—an ability to further help their community is not paternalistic. To deny those Australians that basic right without a trial, to deny them access to a better technology which has transformed our own lives in this inquiry … is very paternalistic.


I also note that the committee looked at the value of this trial in helping teach those on welfare important habits such as budgeting and saving. Mrs Michele Pucci of the east Kimberley region told the committee:


I think there is a general feeling and acceptance in the East Kimberley that there needs to be something done around addressing some of the antisocial behaviour. There is a belief that the card will in some way limit that as it limits people's access to alcohol and drugs.


…   …   …


I also believe there is an opportunity. People may be able, through this card, to better manage their spending, and I think that there are some services that then will be able to get in behind those families.


This is an absolutely critical bill. It will help address the significant harm being done in small, welfare-dependent communities where alcohol, drug addiction, abuse and gambling are rife. This is not income management. This is a card that will operate like any card that everyday Australians have. The only difference is that it will have stores that are switched off, such as liquor stores and betting agencies. In addition, people will have access to 20 per cent of their income in cash, which they can use on absolutely any product they choose to spend their money on.


This is about empowering communities. This is about addressing the scourges of alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling addiction, and some of the terrible, negative effects that we see in some communities as a result of those scourges. I would urge all senators to get behind this. It is a trial, it is an important trial and it is a trial which has overwhelming support in the community. I think that we in this place should always be looking at ways in which we can improve the lives of Australians. But importantly, as we do that, we should be looking at ways in which we can work with local communities, in consultation with local communities, to deliver local solutions which will make the lives of ordinary children, men and women in these communities much better as a result. I commend this bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (17:46):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. This bill will amend the Social Security Administration Act 1999 to enable a trial phase of new, cashless welfare arrangements. Under the trial, welfare recipients will have a proportion of their payments credited to an account that they can only access using a restricted debit card. The trial, as outlined, will extend across three locations, involving up to 10,000 people. 


These changes come as a result of the Forrest review that was conducted a short while ago, which found that the current income management system was economically unsustainable and unsuitable for broader application. When income management was first implemented by the Howard government, the scheme that was put in place—that is, the first scheme—suffered from the same thing: it was economically sustainable and unsuitable for broad application. It was a detailed methodology used by the then Howard government to income-manage individuals during the Northern Territory intervention. It was clunky in the extreme; it required significant numbers of personnel to operate the system and work with the communities to ensure that it at least worked in the way that it was designed; and it left no room for growth in the system. 


Ultimately that was replaced by the BasicsCard, which is well known now across the Northern Territory and in other locations. The BasicsCard served the purpose of overcoming the limitations that were inherent in the system that was implemented by the Howard government in the Northern Territory intervention. In line with technology updates, we now have a new scheme, a debit card trial, that will hopefully prove more economical, sustainable and suitable for broader application, as outlined by those opposite in their second reading debate contributions. 


There are, on this side, some concerns about how it will operate, and they have existed throughout the history of income management more broadly. The previous speaker tried to indicate that it is not income management. If it is not income management, it is a form of welfare assistance that could be more broadly or generically described as managing incomes rather than dealing with problems in a more nuanced way.


The trial locations will be selected based on where there are high levels of welfare dependence and where gambling, alcohol abuse or drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm within the community. I think that alone describes the issue—that you intend to income-manage those communities to avoid those levels of difficulty. Of course, a high level of community support is always a key factor in determining trial locations. The card itself will not allow cash withdrawals for purchases of alcohol or for gambling services. 


Subject to the passage of the bill, the first trial will commence next year, as I understand it, in Ceduna, South Australia, and surrounding areas. On 4 August, community leaders in the Ceduna area signed a memorandum of understanding with the government, to trial the card in Ceduna. As I said, obviously you need a high level of community support for such a trial to proceed. You need to give an explanation of how it will work. You need a broad level of government support in that initial trial to ensure that it is successful. I have doubts as to whether the government will provide that complete level of support that is needed, but I will wait to see the final outcomes of that trial before being so bold as to criticise the government at this juncture. The arrangements will apply to all people on working-age payments, including Newstart, disability support and carer pension recipients who reside in the trial locations. Age pension recipients and wage earners may also voluntarily nominate to have the debit card. It is also understood that the government is in further discussions with two other communities across Australia that may wish to take part in the trial. 


In doing that based on location, the government should proceed carefully and ensure that it is appropriate to offer the debit card to all those within that trial location who fit the description, because it appears there is no opt-out provision. The government must ensure that those persons do require or should have the card, and that there are no objections—because objections are always very difficult to deal with, post a rollout. 


Initially, 80 per cent of participants' income support payments and 100 per cent of lump sum payments will be restricted. However, the minister or a community body may vary the percentage of a person's payment that is restricted. In doing that one would hope that procedural fairness is provided for and that a reasonable process to ensure fairness is provided to a person who may find that the percentage has changed—increased or decreased as the case may be. Participants will receive a cashless debit card that will work as similarly as possible to any other bank card. I commend that. I think it is a good process to move to a debit card that is indistinguishable from any other payment system that is used, and that it is used in a way that ensures that the user of the card is not identified by the card itself. The trial will seek to ensure that the card works at all terminals and retailers, except those that exclusively sell restricted products. There will be no requirement to direct funds to priority goods and life's essentials. It is essential to ensure that issues are managed, so that where the debit card does not function participants understand why it is not functioning, or that where there has been an error at an ordinary location the sales assistants also understand what to do. A certain level of support needs to be provided to ensure the trial does have a fair opportunity to be successful. 


It is clear that action is needed to tackle alcohol abuse and excessive gambling and the harm they cause in some communities. That has been obvious for some time. Labor believes that targeted income quarantining can be a useful tool in supporting vulnerable people; however, in saying that, such an approach requires a range of responses and support services delivered in close consultation with communities. The government does need to be mindful that in implementing this new technology—although it may be old in some respects the EFTPOS system is ubiquitous; it has been around for some time—and using it to tackle the issues of alcohol abuse and excessive gambling it must draw heavily on the past experiences of the Department of Human Services and the original intervention by I think it was then minister Mal Brough with the Northern Territory intervention to ensure that there is sufficient support for persons who have the trial card. 


In saying that, a card itself will not solve the issues. It is the support and the case management of individuals that will go a long way to breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse and excessive gambling. Labor did push for a Senate inquiry on the bill to allow the impacts of the trial to be thoroughly explored and give affected communities the opportunity to make submissions. Labor does believe that welfare quarantining should only apply to vulnerable people who meet certain criteria rather than to all people within a particular location. We must ensure that the measures proposed in this bill are not discriminatory and that they meet community expectations. I remain less convinced that the government has taken this issue to heart to ensure that it does act in a nondiscriminatory way and does meet community expectations. But the trial, if the government fails in this area, will highlight that more broadly.


I know the government does not think this is the same as income management, but I think it is apposite to say that under the existing income management scheme a proportion of a recipient's income support payment is set aside to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, housing and utilities. Recipients can spend their income managed funds using a PIN-protected debit card, which is still known as the BasicsCard, or by arranging for Centrelink to make payments on their behalf. The major issue that exists with the BasicsCard is, as I think I outlined earlier, that a merchant must apply to the Department of Human Services to accept payment and it is the merchant's responsibility to block purchases of excluded goods such as alcohol. In saying that, the BasicsCard did well in moving away from what was an overly regulated, burdensome and cumbersome process, and of course the new restricted debit card system will address several problems identified with the existing BasicsCard. It will also not have the costs associated with administering the BasicsCard, which is not affiliated with any payments provider. The debit card will also do away with the perceived stigma associated with the BasicsCard, which clearly identified recipients as income support recipients. 


Existing income management arrangements have been rolled out in conjunction with a range of support services, and this is the point I was making earlier—support services are where you make the major advances; you will not find the solution in the card itself. The card is just a tool that will assist. What we do need, and we remain unconvinced about whether the government has provided it, is sufficient individual support and support services to make sure that the system is successful. Success will be measured not by how the card has operated, not by how many transactions the card has successfully processed, not by how many errors the card may have caused; it will be measured by the change in the community in response to both the support and the tool, the card itself. We hope this arrangement will lead to a much better community in the longer run. That will be harder to measure for, and during, the trial, but it is something that the government should spend some time considering in order to ensure that the trial, and not simply the card, is a success 


Unfortunately, additional support services will not be provided in the trial areas as part of the debit card trial. Debit card participants will also miss out on the additional support from Centrelink that is provided to income management participants. I think that the government is being a little duplicitous when it says that this is not income management so we therefore do not have to have support services and Centrelink and that the debit card will operate effectively on its own and do its job. The question is: what are you trying to achieve? The job is to move community expectations from where they are now, dealing with drug and alcohol abuse and gambling abuse, to where you want the community expectations to be—that is, a much better environment for the raising of families in those communities. In not providing those additional support services, I think that the government has missed a great opportunity to ensure that the card is a successful implementation of the strategy. The objective of the strategy is to move the community to a much better place. 


In my view, those opposite need to consider the complexities of breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse and excessive gambling. The debit card—as I have underlined—will not offer a standalone technological fix to what is ultimately a social issue. The government needs to consult with affected communities and listen to their concerns so that this becomes a process and a feedback loop, and not only during the trial. You may want to ensure the success of the trial, and you will need to ensure that it is monitored and reviewed as well as that the lessons from that trial are learnt. In addition, those affected in these communities will require financial counselling services, they will require early childhood and community safety services and they will require substance abuse services. Without those services being provided, I cannot see how such a trial will demonstrate that it is making a substantial difference to that community. 


It is of concern that the trial does not allow participants to seek an exemption or to be excluded from the trial. Therefore, if a person is identified as a compulsory participant, they will have their payments restricted regardless of their level of vulnerability. Existing income management participants are identified through a range of triggers, including child protection notification, length of unemployment, young people at risk and people on prison release. Labor simply does not believe in the blanket use of income management. Labor is aware that the vast majority of Australians receiving income support are more than capable of managing their own income. We are, however, committed to ensuring that welfare payments are spent responsibly and in the interests of individuals and, particularly, children. That is why income management should be targeted towards those that are most vulnerable within the community.


I look forward to reading the report of Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. This inquiry has allowed for the impacts of the trial to be thoroughly explored and for people who will be affected to have a proper say. Labor will continue to engage with the communities that will be affected by the government's proposed trial and will take the opportunity of listening to their concerns. What are required to curb the surge of alcohol, drug and gambling dependence are, in truth, community based initiatives which engage with persons, including with those most vulnerable in the community, and which provide assistance and support when it is required. That can be done alongside such a payment card as this, should it prove to be a useful tool in supporting those outcomes. The card should not be the final solution in and of itself; it should be able to be utilised in a way that supports those initiatives that I spoke about. 


I doubt that the government have taken much of that on board. They seem to be clear that this is not income management; it is a technological solution and an improvement on the BasicsCard. They are all arguments to be had about the card but not about changing community attitudes, changing community social norms, ensuring that our children can grow up in a safe environment, and assisting in resolving community excesses around alcohol abuse and drug dependency.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-10-13,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:06):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015—or the card I like to call the healthy welfare keycard. After being injured during my service in Australia's Army, I know what it is like to live from pay cheque to pay cheque on a disability support pension. I have experienced the anxiety and fear you feel when you are forced to pay for the grocery bill by credit card hoping that you are not about to max it out buying the essentials. I know how hard it is to manage your money, make ends meet, break out of the cycle of poverty and raise a family while you are struggling to cope with physical and mental pain and the addictions that all too often come with those injuries. I know what it is like to be discriminated against by government agencies and treated like a second-class citizen 


I understand the fears of discrimination that people may have about the introduction of this new money management initiative. However, the time has come to face up to a few hard realities. 


Our kids are needlessly suffering, because too much of our welfare money is being spent on illicit drugs and alcohol. Our mums and dads with diminished capacity through addictions and mental health disabilities are needlessly suffering, because too much of our welfare money is being spent on illicit drugs and alcohol. That is why I support the broad principle that a healthy welfare keycard is based on—namely, that it introduces a cashless method of managing welfare payments for communities which are suffering from a crisis with alcohol and drugs. Once the teething problems with this new card and its technology are sorted out, I would like a healthy welfare keycard rolled out across the whole of Tasmania. It will save lives and needless personal harm and suffering. It will significantly reduce the rates of family violence and family break-ups. It will reduce the rates of admissions to our hospital accident and emergency departments.


The healthy welfare keycard is also a vital early intervention initiative. Not only will it save lives; it will save a lot of taxpayers' dollars in the long run. As one of the Jacqui Lambie Network senate candidates for Tasmania, Rob Waterman says, 'Every dollar spent on early intervention saves $7.' And that is exactly what the healthy welfare keycard is—an effective and compassionate early intervention initiative, which will save at least $7 for every dollar invested in it. The healthy welfare keycard contains a function whereby an automatic text is sent to a card recipient's phone, stating what the total of their account balance is after every transaction over $10. This is an important tool, which will help people on welfare better manage their money. It will gently encourage better financial management skills.


There are a number of groups of people who will either hate or be very disappointed by the introduction of the healthy welfare keycard. Drug dealers will hate this card, because over time it will mean fewer people will buy their products. Pub, hotel and bottle shop owners will experience reduced profits in the communities where the healthy welfare keycards will be in use. People who make a living from the gambling industry will also experience reduced profits in the communities where the healthy welfare keycard is in use. This is because, as the explanatory notes reveals:


The trial will test whether significantly reducing access to discretionary cash, by placing a significant proportion of a person's welfare payments into a restricted bank account, can reduce the habitual abuse and associated harm resulting from alcohol, gambling and illegal drugs.


Despite the obvious social and personal benefits which this trial has the great potential to produce, I had and still have reservations about the manner in which this trial is to be conducted. One of the proposed trial sites is the South Australian community of Ceduna. I accompanied Senator Xenophon on a tour of the community on Friday, 2 October and spoke with many people about this trial. While I listened to all the community's concerns, from Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, it became apparent that a significant section of the community, mainly non-Indigenous stakeholders, had not been properly consulted with and their interests were not being properly represented. Based on that meeting I had in Ceduna, I was prepared to vote against this legislation should the government fail to delay presentation of the bill before the Senate. However, after a further meeting I had in my Senate office this Monday with the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Alan Tudge, and more Ceduna community representatives—Greg Franks, Michael Haynes and Wayne Miller—I have decided to support this Turnbull government initiative and trial immediately. I changed my mind after listening to the Ceduna community representatives and also after Assistant Minister Tudge gave a personal undertaking to travel with Senator Xenophon and me back to Ceduna in South Australia over the next month so that we can hear all of the community's concerns and answer their questions honestly and openly.


After my visit to Ceduna, I became very worried that the government was swooping in to 'save the day', without knowing all the facts—but that is not the case. I acknowledge the long, hard detailed work which has been put into this project. After reflecting on his commitment, advocacy and willingness to consult, I have to congratulate Assistant Minister Tudge for his leadership, passion and drive with regard to the healthy welfare keycard. It is also important to acknowledge the courage and bravery that local leaders, both in local government and within the Indigenous community, have displayed. They have borne the brunt of a lot of community heat and criticism. They could have easily folded under the pressure and opposed this initiative, but they knew in their hearts that what they were doing was a good thing for their community and for the generations to come. So they pressed on and fought the good fight and had the courage to act on the knowledge in their minds and the feelings of love in their hearts for their community. This can teach us all an important lesson. It is one thing to have knowledge and feelings of love; it is another thing to have the courage to act on that knowledge and love and turn thought and feeling into deeds. And that is what we have with this legislation. It is a means for this federal government to resource and fund good deeds through a program which will make the world safer and happier for the communities which are fortunate enough to be selected for the healthy welfare keycard trial.


I am reluctant to make too many comments about Australian billionaires, given my recent, unfortunate and painful experience with one of them. However, if there is one lesson I have learnt from this legislation it is that there are billionaires and there are billionaires. It would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge the hard work of Mr Andrew Forrest, who really is the father of this healthy welfare keycard. Twiggy Forrest is a well-known Australian businessman and entrepreneur. This legislation would not be before this Senate if Twiggy Forrest had not decided to act. Australian communities suffering from all the harms and illnesses that come with alcohol and drug addictions would not have the hope that comes with the presentation of this legislation. Twiggy is not just responsible for a new card; he is responsible for a new approach to solving the terrible problem of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian disadvantage. 


The JLN supports Twiggy's 27 recommendations of creating parity and ending disadvantage. I do not care what colour your skins is or what religion you are. If your community is suffering from alcohol or drug addiction then Twiggy's solution for early intervention—particularly through the establishment and integration of early childhood services in the most vulnerable communities and intervention before birth—will be vital for the safety of our children who are placed at risk because of the alcohol and drug addictions of adults. If this legislation passes this Senate, then, according to the explanatory memorandum, it will:


… enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements in response to a key recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest’s Review of Indigenous Jobs and Training.


The purpose of the trial is to test the concept of cashless welfare arrangements by disbursing particular welfare payments to a restricted bank account, accessed by a debit card which does not allow cash withdrawals. The trial will test whether significantly reducing access to discretionary cash, by placing a significant proportion of a person’s welfare payments into a restricted bank account, can reduce the habitual abuse and associated harm resulting from alcohol, gambling and illegal drugs. It will also test whether cashless welfare arrangements are more effective when community bodies are involved.


Throughout this debate, the word 'disadvantaged' has been used by me and many other speakers. Many people watching these Senate proceedings or reading Hansard may ask the question, 'What is disadvantage?' Probably the best report I have read that clarifies, describes and quantifies the word 'disadvantage' is a report published by Catholic Social Services and Jesuit Social Services, written by Tony Vinson and Margot Rawsthorne, with Adrian Beavis and Matthew Ericson. Dropping off the edge 2015, or DOTE2015, examines persistent communal social disadvantage in Australia. 'Social disadvantage' was defined as a range of difficulties that reduce a person's opportunities in life and prevent people from participating fully in Australian society. Social disadvantage is calculated by combining statistics and research on criminal convictions, juvenile offending, long- and short-term unemployment, youth unemployment, disabilities, lack of formal qualifications, family violence, family incomes, rental assistance—to name just a few social indicators.


In Tasmania, the five most disadvantaged of the 29 local government areas, or 17 per cent, accounted for 64 per cent of our state's top-ranked consistently entrenched place-based disadvantaged people. We have some of the worst rates of unemployment and youth unemployment in Australia. This report shows that the local government authorities which are really doing it hard are Brighton, Central Highlands, Derwent Valley, George Town and Glenorchy.


As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons why I want to support this trial is that I think it will be a success, and then I will fight hard to have the trial of the healthy welfare card transferred to cover the whole of Tasmania. If it is a success, I have no problem going into bat for it to make sure that the state of Tasmania is first in the receiving line. As Mission Australia's executive summary says in its 2014 youth survey, there is no doubt that in Tasmania:


Inequality and disadvantage remain entrenched in areas of our society with intergenerational poverty becoming well-known. It is becoming increasingly common to understand that this disadvantage is concentrated in some locations.


Tasmania is one of those locations. This card will be one of the steps we take to address this crippling social disadvantage.


Other solutions that I have put forward to also address and solve the unemployment crisis and the lack of confidence include supporting an involuntary ice detox and rehabilitation act that gives parents the right to use non-consensual medical treatment on their drug-addicted children; supporting voluntary national service for our young people which will allow them to join the military for a year and learn some skills or participate in trade training and apprenticeships; making areas in Australia where high unemployment is endemic, including most of Tasmania, special economic zones that are payroll tax free; creating a national policy which guarantees the protection of Australia's prime ag land or best farming lands, noting that Australia only has 3.4 per cent prime ag land; guaranteeing the supply of health gold cards to members of the ADF and police who have served overseas in war zones and under warlike conditions, with that to be automatic; supporting the introduction of national legislation which targets members of organised crime groups and their associates, similar to America's RICO laws—the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; and guaranteeing that Australia's fuel, gas and power are cheaper than our major trading partners' so that our manufacturers, small businesses and farmers can profitably compete in unfair world markets while maintaining wages and standards of living for Australian workers and providing a lot more jobs, especially for our youth.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-10-13,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:20):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. I applaud this initiative that will enable a trial phase of a new cashless welfare arrangement and a cashless debit card. It will try to reduce the harm caused by alcohol, gambling and drug abuse.


When I read the details, I cast my mind back to a Senate inquiry that I was involved in in 2009. It was the Senate Select Committee on Men's Health. There was plenty of evidence about disadvantage from rural and remote communities, and I always remember the evidence given by Risk Welsh, who was the Aboriginal Men’s Health Project Officer with the Men's Health Information and Resource Centre. I will quote what he said:


I recently visited a community in north-western New South Wales, at Wilcannia—


probably far-western New South Wales is the correct description—


and that is a pretty grim place, because the average life expectancy for Aboriginal males out there is 35, so they are basically lucky to see their kids hit high school.


That the average life expectancy of an Aboriginal male at Wilcannia was 35 shocked all committee members. I actually went out to Wilcannia on a couple of occasions to see for myself.


On one occasion, the then minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Mark Arbib, actually came out at my request and met with the council and local groups to discuss how some of these problems could be addressed. We heard of children having to get themselves ready for school—dressing themselves and, most likely, not getting breakfast. We heard that the school bus often did a second run to ensure that those children who wanted to go to school did get the opportunity. This is just one example of a community that needs help. 


The reason I support this trial, which starts in Ceduna, South Australia, is that we cannot stand by and watch these communities killing themselves and their children. For too long governments of all persuasions have thrown billions of dollars at these communities in the belief that it will fix the problem, but it never has and it never will. This is why we are here today discussing the need for a cashless welfare card.


I live in a country town that has a good and decent reputation but is not without its problems. When you drive through the business centre late at night and see young children, who are primary school age, walking around the streets or on their skateboards, and you wonder about their home life. Are they rebellious? Do mum and dad have no control over them? Have they just given up on trying to discipline them? Are mum and dad at home or at the pub affected by alcohol? Is there a mum or a dad? What is the future for these children? We can close our eyes and block our ears and pretend that it is not happening, but I can assure you that, unless something is done to arrest the alcohol, drug and gambling issues affecting some communities, we cannot expect future generations to be any different.


I was interested to read the speech given in the other place by my National colleague, the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton. He mentioned that Moree in the north-west of New South Wales would be a good place for a trial, and I would agree with him. For those who do not know their geography, Moree is only a 90 minutes' drive from my home town and has produced some very good sportsmen over the years, including the Sutton cycling family and NRL star, Ewan McGrady. I am pleased to say that in this year's group 9 rugby league grand final, the Inverell Hawks just outlasted the Moree Boomerangs to win the title. Mr Coulton pointed out that about one quarter of the population of Moree is Aboriginal and the welfare split of Indigenous and non-Indigenous is about 50-50. This is not about the colour of people's skin or their background; this includes all in the community. For various reasons, including misinformation that was spread, the trial in Moree will not go ahead and so we will never know what impact it may have had. 


It will go ahead for 12 months in Ceduna in South Australia and it will then be reviewed. When you read the shocking statistics in that location you will understand why some form of intervention or control is needed. In 2013-14 presentations to the hospital emergency department due to alcohol or drug use exceeded 500—more than one per day and nearly two a day. The Ceduna Sobering Up Centre had 4667 admissions in 2013-14 financial year. Hospitalisations due to assaults are 68 times the national average. Minister Tudge said on Monday that for the last year in Ceduna there were 4600 admissions to the local sobering up centre, despite the population being only 4400. I will repeat that: there were 4600 admissions to the local sobering up centre despite the population being only 4400 people. If those stats alone do not make Labor and the Greens sit up and take notice, nothing will, and so Ceduna is a good choice for the first trial site. The community leaders of Ceduna actually approached the government to explore the idea of the cashless debit card and they have supported a trial to address some of the alcohol and drug abuse affecting the region. 


I want to stress that this is not income management. Participants in this trial can use the card anywhere and purchase anything except alcohol and gambling products and will not be able to withdraw cash with the card. Participants in this trial will receive a mainstream everyday debit card, which will be connected to a Visa, MasterCard or Eftpos platform. Cash will not be available from the card, and the holder will not be able to purchase alcohol, gambling products or illicit substances. Eighty per cent of a person's social security payments will be placed into a debit card account and the remaining 20 per cent cash will be placed into their existing bank account.


All working age social security support recipients within the Ceduna region will be part of the trial and receive the card. Aged pensioners, veterans and workers may volunteer to opt in. This is how it works: under the trial, if you are on Newstart, single with three children and live in your own home, you have over $145 cash per week with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are on a parenting payment, single with four children and live in a private rental, you will receive over $220 cash per week with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are on a disability support pension, partnered with no children, you will receive over $85 cash per week with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are single and on Newstart, you will receive $60 per week cash with the remainder of your payment on the card. It is adjustable. If it is found that a person needs more cash and they are known to have been responsible with their spending in the past, then the arrangement can be adjusted to allow them more cash.


How will this be achieved? The package focuses on areas where there are existing gaps in funding and where it has been identified locally that people are likely to need the greatest support during the trial. Funding is being made available to support a new mobile patrol team to operate 24 hours, experienced drug and alcohol counsellors, increased rehabilitation services, intensive financial counselling, family violence services and other services. This package is not being forced on the community; it has been codesigned by the Ceduna community.


I was interested to read the comments from the Greens back in March, when this program was first made public. That then Green leader Senator Milne said it was offensive for the Prime Minister and mining magnate to tell people throughout Australia who are less well off how they should manage their income. Even Senator Siewert was quoted in the article as saying that 'this patronising and paternalistic policy decision will not work'. It was interesting to read the exchange between Senator Siewert and the chair of the Australian Indigenous Studies at Melbourne's School of Population and global health, Professor Marcia Langton, at the Senate hearing.


Prof. Langton …First of all, this is not income management. 


Senator SIEWERT: But it is. 


Prof. Langton : No, it is not income management. 


Senator SIEWERT: Why not? 


Prof. Langton : It is quite a different model. Income management works in a kind of reverse way. What is being proposed here will work substantially differently and it is important to trial this in order to see if this kind of approach will work better.


Professor Langton earlier said that she supported the legislation and that it certainly was not paternalistic. She pointed out that Aboriginal leaders wanted the measure because, as she said: 


…you have to see alcohol abuse to the extent that it occurs in these communities at firsthand to understand their concerns. What has happened over the last 50 years is that Aboriginal people have become normalised to welfare dependency. 


…      …   …


…children are unsafe, women are unsafe and, more and more, people are being dragged into the drinking culture…. 


I also refer to the evidence of the Mayor of the Ceduna District Council, Allan Suter. He said:


In this case, council support for the trial of the cashless debit card was made on condition that we got strong support from the senior Aboriginal leaders, and I am happy to say that we have got that. We are also satisfied that we have got strong support from our non-Indigenous community, with, of course, a few exceptions. Some of the objections are very genuine and passionate. Being a small town, we have a good knowledge of people's motives. Some objections are from people who wish to have money to purchase drugs or alcohol. Some are even from people who are very anxious that their customers will be able to have money to purchase drugs and alcohol. We respect the opinions of the genuine and passionate objectors, but they really are very few.


Andrew Forrest, a man who has a great passion to ensure people get off welfare and get some self-respect, had this to say at the Senate inquiry:


Unfortunately, over the 40- or 50-year period that I can remember, I have seen the degradation of communities at the hands of alcohol and drugs. As many would know, in those communities there is a very high rate of attendance at funerals of friends and people who, like me, were bright-eyed, confident, happy and looking forward to living a full and secure life in Australia as youth. I feel that has been denied to so many of our vulnerable Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, through disproportionate access to alcohol and drugs in vulnerable communities. These are the great destroyers of community, of lives. 


This week, we saw the report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. In part of its summing up, the committee said it was:


… satisfied that the trial is strongly supported by community leaders in the proposed trial communities in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. The committee considers that the expected benefits of the trial to reduce the social harm caused by alcohol and gambling, particularly for children, justify the measures outlined in the Bill.


The committee recommended that: 


… the Minister for Social Services include safety net provisions in the proposed legislative instrument to ensure that vulnerable people impacted by the trial are able to be exited from the trial, where appropriate, to ensure they are not further disadvantaged.


The committee recommended that the bill be passed.


Mr Deputy President, I want to take you back to the mid-1970s, when I was driving livestock transport. We would go out to places like Wertaloona station in the Flinders Ranges, where four or five semitrailers would show up late in the afternoon. Bob Wilson would be in the cattle yards with three or four Aboriginal stockmen—bandy-legged, slim fellows with high-heeled riding boots and big hats. They were good stockmen and good workers. It was hot. They did their job well and tied their horses up under the trees as they drove the cattle that we would load at daylight the next morning. I think if I took you out there today, Mr Deputy President, you probably would not find many Aboriginal workers out there. There would be some but certainly not like there were back in the 1970s.


What did we do? I will tell you what we did. We threw money at these people. We on all sides of politics over the last 40 years thought money would solve the problem. We threw money at these people, and what did they do? They gave up their jobs, they went to the pub, they got drunk and they probably bashed their wives when they got home—not only people of Aboriginal descent, I can tell you, but also people of Anglo-Saxon descent as well. We are not focusing on one colour here or anything like that. Colour does not come into this debate. It is about looking after taxpayers' money. But we threw money at these people, and I think we did a great deal of harm to them. It is a good lesson to all of us that lack of money is not the problem. 


Here is a situation where these people will get some cash and a debit card, just like most people have. They can buy products that are essential items—food, clothing or whatever they need—on those debit cards at the stores, but they cannot be used for gambling or alcohol. That bring us to the situation where the social security cash is simply spent on Friday and Saturday, much of it at the local pub or perhaps gambled or spent on illegal drugs. What do the mums and kids live on for the next week? This is where it is so wrong. There is abuse of social security. Hardworking Australians are paying their taxes to give money to these people—people who are certainly not well off, perhaps unemployed, perhaps obese and perhaps not in good health. But throwing money at them makes their situation worse.


I commend Ceduna. I have been to Ceduna many times. It is a good community, a beautiful place on the Great Australian Bight off the Southern Ocean and a lovely place to drive through. In my previous job, I actually had an agent who sold my products there. I would visit the town quite often and go right back through Streaky Bay, Elliston to Port Lincoln et cetera. To think that this community has such a terrible record of alcohol abuse—4,660 admissions out of a population of 4,400 in a year—is just unbelievable. That is outrageous. It is crazy.


So what do we do? If we do nothing, nothing will change. I have always had the attitude that to try is to risk failure but to do nothing is to guarantee failure. The government, under Minister Tudge, is working with community members such as Twiggy Forrest and the local government representatives at Ceduna to give this a go. We should give it a go. I encourage everyone to have their say on this issue. Let's help these people. Let's try to get them off their problems of alcohol and drug abuse and especially unemployment. As I said, throwing money at the issue does not always solve the problem. Of course money helps in many respects. We in Canberra collect a lot of money from the taxpayers of our nation—and, of course, too much is being borrowed—and we must spend that money wisely. Sometimes that money is going out there and actually destroying people's lives.


I take you to a trip I did to Wilcannia with former Senator Mark Arbib where I found out the average man in Wilcannia has a life span of just 35 years. I put it to you, senators, where could you go on this planet, to what other country, where the average life span for men is less than 35 years? Maybe Ethiopia or some other African country or somewhere else? I do not know. I do not think you would find a place or a country on this planet where the average life span of a man is just 35 years. I think this is a disgrace. Of course Wilcannia is a community with a high Aboriginal population. I have been travelling through there for 40 years. I know why they have problems: they are unemployed, they have little to do and they have alcohol, drugs, a bad diet, obesity and a lack of exercise. All of the above contribute to that terrible statistic that the average man in Wilcannia will live to just 35 years of age. As I said earlier in my presentation, they probably will not live long enough to see their children get to high school. If you were to search the world for a worse statistic, I do not think you would find anywhere worse.


So we have to trial this. We have to do something. We are throwing money at these people who can then go to the pub and fill up with grog. I have seen them. I have been driving through Wilcannia for 40 years. On social security day, where is everyone? They are lined up outside the pubs. 


Then of course there is that terrible drug ice, which seems to be right throughout Australia. It is in the big cities, in the bigger country towns, in the smaller country towns and even out in the shearing sheds. Ice is a big concern. People who are peddling these rotten drugs are destroying people's lives. If we hand out cash, when people are bored and do not have a job, what are they going to do? Just one shot of ice and people are totally addicted to it. It is a terrible drug and is causing so much damage. People are going off their brain in anger, bashing the women around them and committing all sorts of crimes. I know they are bashing the ambos and the police when they are arrested. They are bashing the nurses and the doctors in hospitals. If we are going to hand out people's hard-earned cash—governments do not have the money; we either take it from the people or we borrow it—and promote more social unrest, more social harm and more harm to women and kids especially, when the money is all gone at the pub on grog or on drugs at the start of the social security week, what is mum cooking? What is she feeding the kids? How are the kids clothed? How are they getting off to school? We have seen too much at Wilcannia. These are issues which each and every one of us in this chamber should work to correct. 


What we have done is not working. As I said, I doubt whether those great . What we have done is not working. As I said, I doubt that they would be there today . Those great Aboriginal stockman would be out there today. Why? Because they worked hard in those days. They earned their living and then we threw money at them. I think it is shameful—not only the Aboriginal community but the community as a whole. I commend the minister for this program and the committee for its report and the research. We have to give it a go. It is a trial. It is not running right across Australia. If it works, and I hope it does, let us hope it is broadened out so that when people receive taxpayers' money they do not blow it in the pub or blow it on drugs or gambling. I hope they use their debit card to buy food and clothing, the things they need to care for themselves and, more importantly, for their families, for their wives, for their children, to see that they are treated well and that they live properly. Hopefully in time things will be better so that the average man in Wilcannia will live longer than just 35 years of age.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:39):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. A number of senators have made reference to a recommendation which emerged from Mr Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous jobs and training. What is probably not well known about Mr Andrew Forrest is that he goes a little bit further than giving advice to government. He employs Indigenous workers—13 per cent of his workforce are Indigenous. He contracts over a billion dollars worth of work per annum to Indigenous companies which employ 40 per cent Indigenous workforces. He goes further than just giving advice. 


I have visited his employment centre in Roebourne, where he has a very deep connection. I think that was the genesis of his experience, where children were wandering the streets late at night, hungry and sometimes affected by alcohol and drugs. He decided to do something. What he did is quite remarkable and is worth repeating ad infinitum in this chamber. He actually employs Indigenous people. He looks at the barriers to employment, whether they are no licence or lack of literacy or numeracy, and he addresses, identifies and provides training for them. If they pass the vocational education and training course, he gives them a job, I think on $117,000 a year fly-in fly-out from any of his remarkable mines in Western Australia where he is producing 165 million tonnes of iron ore. He is not just giving advice to government or to communities; he is actually walking the walk and doing the things that will make a difference. 


When you move through Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Whyalla, Elliston and over to Ceduna, as I did recently, most of the local mayors are quite open about the connection Indigenous communities have with the country and they are well aware in some cases of the awful history, but not too many of them offer employment. There are not too many who are taking the step Andrew Forrest has taken and saying, 'I will have 10 per cent of this council workforce cutting the grass, emptying the garbage and doing whatever who are Indigenous.' In fact, some very wealthy communities over there employ no Indigenous people. I do not know why that is. I just make that observation. 


When Mr Forrest gives the Australian community advice, backing up that advice are his actions. He is moving people from welfare dependency into good, well-paying jobs. I met grandmothers who had returned to work in the stores. I met a young Indigenous person who said that their ambition was to buy a house. You need a senator's wage to buy a house in Perth, but he was not frightened of it. He was saving to do that. The reality is that these measures are eminently defendable, but we do need children to get fed and clothed and to go to school. We need a safe environment where they can be kept in a measure of comfort and experience the normality of growing up in Australia, where they can kick a football, go home and have a jam sandwich or a Vegemite sandwich and be looked after. We know that in some of these communities alcoholism, drug addiction, petrol sniffing and glue sniffing, substance abuse has torn all that asunder.


I take particular note of Senator Williams' contribution because I, too, can go back to the late 60s in the Northern Territory, to places where Indigenous people could get a drink but it was usually in a bar separate from the white person. There were plenty of stockmen would have had good jobs 


It is probably three or four weeks work now and the rest of the time is drinking. That is the awful reality in some of these outback communities. I no longer stop in Tennant Creek when I am driving through, as it depresses me so much. If you go to the Goldfields Hotel it is amazing how a licensee can actually go to sleep at night with the obvious, almost death in front of you, drink-till-you-drop culture in some of these places. Anyway, I do not want to get too carried away on those issues.


I did visit Ceduna, and I had a very agreeable meeting with the local mayor—who, I might add, had checked with the local member to make sure it was okay to talk to me. Apparently I passed the test and he did speak to me. He said that they had sat down and worked it all out; that they had sat down with a number of groups in the community, and this was a community driven position. I was encouraged by that. I asked who the main opposition was. The main opposition would not be all that hard to find. It is a grand premises adjacent to the beachfront that provides alcohol and gaming for the community. According to the local mayor, there was some stern talking and they had to sit down and really knuckle it out.


They want a community that is attractive to tourists. It is the start of the tourist trail through to Port Lincoln. They were getting a substantial number of tourists but, according to some of the press reports, the behaviour of some people was detrimental to growing that sector. I must stress that the local mayor had a not unusual view in South Australia that the local paper was not reporting things accurately and that the local paper had reported things that were quite ancient and unproven as fact—as if they had happened the day before. When he tried to address that with the Advertiser they basically did a double-up on the story of inaccuracy and virtually canned his community a bit more. So he had a ban on them. He was not going to talk to them anymore. But he was very, very insistent that the community was getting together with a view that they could make things better, and I fully support that.


I do however think that there are risks with all of this. If it is not capped by a genuine attempt to provide employment, a genuine attempt to move people, all we will end up with is some sober people without hope. I am not sure that is what we are trying to achieve here. We do know that there is mineral exploration and drilling going off in the Great Australian Bight, 300 kilometres off the coast. We know that the airport is receiving additional traffic numbers and may well be upgraded. If there is a substantial find in the area, there may well be a boom in Ceduna's economic activity. But it is important that people who live there, and have always lived there, get to share in that. I do not see any connectivity at the moment between the obvious need to have people sober and feeding their children and how we move to the next stage, which is to take advantage of that situation and get them into useful paid employment.


Clearly, there are a number of other issues. I want to go through some correspondence I received from a constituent in the area. I do not want to mention his name, but I think it is fairly insightful that we place on the record that not all of these trials are going to be suitable. This person has a fairly straightforward position. He is 50 years old, of working age, and receives a disability support pension. He has been told that his payments will be part of the mandatory income management package being rolled out. He says:


I was employed and payed taxes for most of my working life. I have a mortgage and 3 children in school. My health gave out a few years ago and I have been on a disability support pension since. I have COPD with possible Sarcoids and suffer severe back pain and nerve damage issues due to arthritis and disc damage from the physically demanding and heavy work I used to do to earn my living. These sicknesses are further complicated by the early stages of Chronic Kidney disease.


This person is on a disability support pension—through no fault of his own, I suppose—and is now in the situation where he is subject to this trial of 20 per cent cash and 80 per cent on goods. The police or social services have never attended his residence due to domestic violence, noise or unruly behaviour. He values his peace and privacy and considers his neighbours and their rights to the same things, and he tries to instil those values in his children. He goes on at length to say that he is managing his disability pension payment well and managing a mortgage and that the kids are in school and the school fees are paid—all of the normal things that a prudent person can manage.


As part of this trial he will have reduced flexibility. He makes a couple of good points. He is a thrifty person and he says he buys his gear at the op shop whenever he can but that op shops do not have EFTPOS facilities. I am not really sure about that, but that is what I am told—op shops do not have EFTPOS facilities. So, if he is prudent and wants to get some second-hand clothes from the Save the Children shop or United Mission or whatever it may be, these businesses do not have EFTPOS facilities; they deal in cash. He also says:


We will no longer be able to take advantage of the sharp practice of many local traders who will give substantial discounts to non credit or eftpos card transactions.


I am not familiar with that either, but these are matters that he has raised with me. This person says that he will no longer be able to purchase foodstuffs direct from growers markets or producers, which will drive up his cost of living. He has a long list of issues.


I hasten to say that, on 20 August, I provided this information to the Hon. Scott Morrison's office, and I am awaiting a reply. The reality is that this particular person is not someone we are out to try to income manage or to quarantine payments for. When we get an answer from the minister's office it may well be that there is a local committee that can look at his particular circumstances and vary his arrangements. However, he for one is not very happy.


So to say it is unanimous in the area is probably a long bow to draw. I think there is some evidence on the public record that some of the Indigenous women leaders in the communities would prefer that the alcoholics and the druggies were managed where the elderly, the vulnerable and children are at risk. They do not appear to support a blanket trial.


It is an awful thing: if you do put 10,000 people on this system and they only have access to 20 per cent of their cash then they are in a position of some vulnerability in some respects. A neighbour of mine actually provides financial counselling, formerly as a volunteer and now with COTA, to a lot of very vulnerable people on Newstart and the like—those sorts of pensions. He tells me that they do not lack the financial knowledge and they do not lack the financial management skill; it is that they make poor decisions when they go to enter into agreements with people. He has lost count of the number of times that people have made decisions on the hire-purchase of a fridge or the renting of a TV—really poor decisions. He provides advice to people all over South Australia. There is one particular well-known national company which does a lot of work with people in this area. Financial counsellors will send people down to that shop and they will do their best deal. Then the financial counsellor will ring up and ask, 'Can you do better?' And sure enough, this particular national company does do the right thing. So I just wonder whether the quarantining of the 80 per cent of the spend will have some unintended consequences. Will it drive up prices in certain areas? We know those are the only places they can get their stuff from. They cannot go elsewhere.


I used to know a pensioner who lived at Elliott, which is halfway between Alice Springs and Darwin. When pension payments and went cashless he used to drive to Tennant Creek to shop because the shopkeeper in Elliott would say, 'Well, pick out what you want and then we will give you the change.' And he would say, 'No, no—you give me the money. You cash my cheque and then I will go and buy what I want.' Anyway, they could not agree so he used to drive 350 kilometres to Tennant Creek to do his shopping and come back. I just wonder whether quarantining that amount of the payment will have some unintended consequences. That may well need to be very carefully monitored.


I am absolutely sure on this one: if you take a person who is dependent on alcohol or gambling and you make it that they cannot spend money on that, they will come up with another way of doing that. There will be a trade somewhere which will allow those people to get access to alcohol. Prohibition has never worked anywhere. So if someone is dependent on alcohol and you have quarantined their money they are going to do something silly, like buy something and trade it for a carton of beer or a bottle of rum or, as I saw in the bottle shop in Ceduna, a five-litre cask and a sixpack of Bundy and Coke.


I do not think we should be kidding ourselves that this will actually solve the problem where people have a genuine addiction to alcohol or gambling. It is not going to solve the problem. It may well increase—we probably need to say this—prostitution and things like that. It just may well do that. There will always be people who will take advantage of people's addictions and there will always be people who can go to a pub and buy grog for people who cannot buy grog. So let's not have our rose-coloured glasses on with any of this stuff.


As I said at the outset, kids have the right to be brought up in a safe home environment—fed, clothed, looked after and cared for with all the love that most families in Australia get. But let's not kid ourselves that this is going to be all roses because we have quarantined the spending. In fact, we might be patting ourselves on the back and saying, 'Oh well, we've stopped those people wasting their money on alcohol and wasting their money on gambling.' Well, I am not sure about that. Time will tell. I am hopeful that this will be a successful trial, if this legislation gets up. But I do not have any confidence, looking back over the last 35 years, that this will be all good. In fact, it is probably going to impact on people who do not need management. We had one case there in evidence, as I spoke about. And we hope to get a response from the minister's office about that.


I think that it is a good initiative. It is a community-led initiative, if the local mayor and the other people who participated are correct. It is a courageous initiative, but it is not one that is guaranteed to succeed. I think what will guarantee success is if we can build on this initiative and give them some hope about involvement in employment. Let's give them some hope—not training jobs just for the sake of it. One of the things that Andrew Forrest has done very well is that if you complete a training course with his outfit you actually get a job. You do not just complete training for the sake of training. I think that these initiatives, if they are to be successful and if they are to work, need to have a component in them where the whole community gets behind employing some of these people—furthering their education and giving them the opportunity. Let's face it, local councils are, in some cases, the biggest employers in these areas. I challenge those local councils to have a look through their workforce and to look at the people who have lived the longest in their communities and see how many people are actually offered employment.


I know all the stories. I know that they do not have a licence and that they will not turn up every day and all that sort of stuff. Well, Andrew Forrest disproved a lot of that. And there are Aboriginal organisations which should be contracting to these local businesses and contractors; taking responsibility and building proper economic opportunities for their people so that they are not dependent on welfare and they are not dependent on having their income managed. I do not think that is too much to ask. I think that the will is there in regional South Australia to have a go at this sort of stuff. I think that they should. It is very clear if you look at some of the operations in the APY lands. One Indigenous construction company hangs out how many visibility vests they need for the next day. Five visibility vests means that five people get a job. You just turn up, put a visibility vest on, do the job and get paid. Those sorts of initiatives are operating in the APY lands and I think that with this, combined with employment opportunities, we may well measure some small progress. Thank you.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-10-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:00):  I have not found making a decision on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015 to be easy. The bill deals with inherently difficult issues and seemingly intractable problems—not problems over recent years but problems over many years, over generations. Whether these problems can be tackled, or even go some way to being solved, with this bill remains to be seen.


This bill seeks to have a trial of the healthy welfare card in up to three locations around the nation. But it needs to be made clear at the outset that this bill does not actually set up those locations. They are not specified in the bill as such; they must be set out in regulations. And those regulations can be disallowed by either house of parliament. That is something that I am sure the government will be acutely aware of should this bill pass. Should any of these trials—and I emphasise 'trials'—be established, they will need to be subject to regulations, and those regulations can be disallowed in terms of setting up any trial site. That in itself, I believe, is an additional safeguard in respect of the implementation of these trials. It is an additional safeguard because the Senate can scrutinise, at least within the statutory period, these trials. 


I will discuss with the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Alan Tudge—who, with a lot of good faith and with a lot of goodwill, has engaged in enormous amounts of consultation with local communities and indeed with my crossbench colleagues and, I believe, with the opposition on matters raised in this bill—whether we ought to look at having a provision for the period of disallowance to be extended so that, if the trial is established and it appears that there are serious problems with the trial, the regulations setting up the location of that trial can be disallowed. That is something I will have a good-faith discussion with the assistant minister about.


I am acutely aware of the limitations that this bill will place on a person's spending. However, I am equally, if not more, aware of the devastating harm that alcohol and gambling addictions are causing individuals, families and communities as a whole. This bill not only attempts to address these harms; it does more. I believe that if implemented properly—and I emphasise those words: 'if implemented properly'—it can actually create hope. As imperfect as this bill is, my concern is that doing nothing, not at least attempting an alternative approach, would be a worse position. But I am acutely aware of the remarks made by Senator Siewert of the Australian Greens, whom I have enormous regard for, who implacably opposes this bill because the Australian Greens consider there are alternative pathways to deal with these issues. But I think that what is contained in this bill—having a healthy welfare card—could, if implemented properly, actually work.


The history of this is contained in a report prepared by Andrew Forrest, who most people know as a mining magnate but who I believe is someone who cares passionately about Indigenous Australians, about Indigenous Australians having a fair go and about remedying those generations of inequity and disadvantage. This particular approach could actually work. Mr Forrest suggested that a cashless welfare system for vulnerable Australians:


… poses a way of providing stability for families and individuals so they can concentrate on finding employment, providing adequately for their families, and sending their children to school.


Let us make this clear: this healthy welfare card applies across the board. It does not simply apply to one class of Australians. It is going to be done on a location-specific basis as a trial. Because the beautiful town of Ceduna, on the west coast of South Australia, in the Great Australian Bight, is one of the proposed sites, I went there to visit, on Friday, 2 October, with my colleague Senator Jacqui Lambie. I want to take this opportunity to thank the community of Ceduna—both those for and those against the healthy welfare card—for the reception they gave me and Senator Lambie, for the time they spent with us and for the discussions we had, which I thought were incredibly useful.


I thank the District Council of Ceduna, including its mayor, Allan Suter, and its CEO, Geoff Moffatt. I thank the communities that I met at Ceduna Council Chambers: the Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation, with Mick Haines, their CEO; and Wayne Miller, their Indigenous Community Engagement and Governance Officer; the Koonibba Aboriginal Community Council, with Corey McLennan; the Scotdesco community, with Robert Larking; and the Yalata community, with Greg Franks, who dialled into that meeting. The Oak Valley and Maralinga Tjarutja communities, with Peter Clark and Keith Peters, were also part of this process. I also heard from members of the community at the Ceduna Community Hotel, where there were about 20 or 30 people. One of the local organisers recorded the whole meeting, so apparently you can get on YouTube to see Senator Lambie and I being asked questions and responding to very legitimate concerns in relation to this proposal.


For those who have not visited Ceduna, it is a beautiful coastal town located on the west coast of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. It is famous for its annual Oysterfest, which coincidentally was held over the weekend that Senator Lambie and I visited, although I hasten to add that we left before the festivities. We were there just for the day. Clearly there was a certain buzz about the community because of the number of people coming into Ceduna for its annual Oysterfest.


Sadly, though, it is not Ceduna's beauty and natural assets that make it famous; rather, it is the town's struggle with drug and alcohol abuse that has led to some adverse publicity in relation to the community. The local council has tried time and time again to curb the damage caused by alcohol addiction. A dry zone encompassing Ceduna and the nearby township of Thevenard—the port—has been in place since 1988. There are restrictions on the sale of certain types of alcohol. It is also a requirement to produce ID when buying alcohol so that a purchaser's name can be checked against the list of persons who are barred from buying alcohol. The question of whether that is being enforced or followed through is another matter altogether. But these measures are simply not enough.


In 2011, the South Australian deputy coroner handed down his findings in the inquest into the deaths of six Indigenous Australians in Ceduna. The findings were damning. The deputy coroner had serious concerns with the health of Indigenous Australians with an alcohol problem located in the region around Ceduna. He identified numerous satellite Indigenous communities within a 300-kilometre radius of Ceduna. Of particular concern to him were the Yalata and Oak Valley communities. The deputy coroner found there was overwhelming evidence that members of these communities often travelled out of Ceduna to acquire large volumes of alcohol, thus circumventing the dry zones. While the dry zones in Ceduna and these communities were found to have been effective, it was clear to the deputy coroner that determined people often used areas just outside Ceduna to consume the alcohol they had purchased. The deputy coroner heard evidence that authorities very frequently reported breath alcohol analysis that exceeded a staggering 0.25 per cent. The inquest found that many in those communities around Ceduna also suffer from chronic ill health and self-neglect. An extract from the report explains just how entrenched the problem of alcohol abuse is in the area. The deputy coroner said:


It would be wrong to stereotype the entire indigenous population in this region as having drinking problems, but the evidence adduced before the Court establishes that there is without a doubt a severe and intractable culture of excessive alcohol consumption among the transient Aboriginal population in Ceduna and that this culture is having a negative impact on the wellbeing and functionality of those people.


The deputy coroner concluded that there would remain an ongoing need to reduce the availability of alcohol to affected communities. The government says that it hopes that restricting access to cash through the trial of this debit card will restrict the accessibility of alcohol. But the point here is: will this work in isolation? I do not think it will. You actually need to have a number of measures and to have a holistic approach to dealing with these issues.


The figures from Ceduna's Sobering Up Centre, which is a very important facility, indicated that there were over 4,500 admissions to the Sobering Up Centre in a population of about 4,000 people. These are devastating figures. They are not just statistics. They are families—mothers and fathers, and children and young people in some cases—who are gripped by addiction. There is a question of the informed choices that a person can make in the grip of an addiction, particularly with respect to substance abuse.


Some of the key Indigenous communities—not all, but a number of them: Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation and Koonibba Aboriginal Community Council, for instance—are strongly in favour of a trial of the healthy welfare card, and they have extracted concessions from the government in terms of additional support for the communities: drug and alcohol services and additional services to provide that support. The question is whether the healthy welfare card in itself will be useful in dealing with these issues.


Some concerns were expressed to me by Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and it was quite pointed. One person who approached me at the meeting said that they had never, ever been on welfare, they had paid their taxes all their life, and they resented the fact that they would be subject to this card, because it would cause them difficulty in their own financial commitments and the like, and going to a panel seemed to them to be inherently unfair. By the way, effectively that was put to me by an Indigenous and a non-Indigenous Australian who had jobs, who had worked for many years and who found themselves on hard times needing support from the community through our welfare system. Two of the volunteers at the local op shop were concerned about the fact that they do not have EFTPOS facilities there and that restricting access to cash could have a very devastating effect on the op shop or, indeed, be a great inconvenience to some of the volunteers, stalwarts of the community in their 80s—senior citizens—who say, 'Do I have to be trained in how to use an EFTPOS or payWave facility in the context of a healthy welfare card?'


So they are some of the issues. This will not be easy. I think that any trial needs to be strictly monitored for the purpose of seeing whether it works or not. The undertaking that I gave to the community that I spoke to at the Ceduna Community Hotel was that there ought not to be any trial commencing and that, before we go any further, there needs to be further community consultation. I acknowledge that Assistant Minister Tudge has dealt extensively with key stakeholders in the local community, but it appears that there has not been a robust public meeting where those who are concerned about the health welfare card can ask questions and those questions can be answered fully. There needs to be that level of consultation so that matters can be taken on board before any place is designated for this healthy welfare card trial. That is an undertaking that Mr Tudge has given to me. I hope to be able to travel with him to Ceduna—and Senator Lambie may be coming to that meeting as well—so that we can genuinely hear from the community—those in favour but particularly those against the healthy welfare card. That is something that I think is essential.


 I think another safeguard, if a particular place is chosen as a trial site, would be that there is the opportunity for the regulations to be disallowed for that particular area. I think that is a very critical safeguard in relation to this. There must be a robust evaluation process, and I think that, should this bill pass its second reading stage, there must be some very clear undertakings, guidelines and parameters as to how the evaluation will take place and some of the matters that have been raised—I think very legitimately—by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens as to how this would actually work in particular cases. If you are in a restaurant and you are having a meal, you can use the healthy welfare card for that, but if you decide to have beer or a glass of wine then that can cause problems. I think that is a very good point made by Senator Siewert, as to how that would be dealt with in the context of this card and the issue of people feeling stigmatised in relation to that.


A particular interest I have had is about the impact on the local community of gambling. The feedback that I have had is that poker machines have had a devastating impact on the local community in Ceduna. The Productivity Commission says that something like 40 per cent of gambling losses come from problem gamers, and I dare say that figure could be even higher in the Ceduna community. I think that having a healthy welfare card restricting that access to gambling would be a good thing. We also need to be aware that online gambling, presumably on both illegal and legal sites, is also very problematic. It has been a growing problem, particularly in those remote parts of the west coast where access to poker machines is not so easy. People can go online and lose a lot of money very quickly on their credit card, and that in itself is very problematic. The question I will be asking in respect of the healthy welfare card in the committee stages of this bill—should it get through the second reading stage—is: you can work out the legal sports betting operations, the online gambling operations, because they would have certain merchant numbers and they would no doubt cooperate with such a trial, but in terms of those illegal gambling sites based in places like the Caribbean and Gibraltar, where they have innocuous names that do not appear to be linked to the merchant name, how will that work? That is a huge and growing problem for the Australian community generally.


I note that there has been correspondence between the shadow Minister for Families and Payments, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, and the Hon. Shane Neumann, the shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs, and Assistant Minister Tudge in relation to this issue. I think it is fair to say that Minister Tudge has attempted to fairly comprehensively address a number of the concerns raised. The level of engagement and the detail in that letter indicates at least a willingness to engage in the concerns that have been raised by the opposition in relation to this particular proposal. 


I note that the opposition considers that the bill should not be progressed further until there is, in their view: sufficient consultation; an agreed comprehensive package of supports; further consideration and consultations; details of the operation of the bill—including possible community involvement in quarantine decisions—made public; and a fulsome evaluation framework for all possible participating communities established, in place and made public. I think for the Senate to do its job, we need to rigorously, forensically, deal with these issues. It has never been my position to support a gag on a substantive debate such as this, so I think it is very important that those questions be answered. 


These are difficult issues, but the questions raised by the opposition and by the Australian Greens must be answered in the context of this debate. It is important that we go into committee. I will support the second reading stages of this bill, but I think it is important that the questions raised by those who have concerns, or who have outright opposition to this bill, need to be addressed in the context of this debate. I want this trial, should it go ahead, to be effective, to work, but there needs to be further consultation. I am pleased that Assistant Minister Tudge said that should this bill get through the second reading stage, there will be further consultation and extensive consultation with the people of Ceduna, which is proposed to be one of trial sites. Having said that, I look forward to further debate on this issue. This issue will not go away. I think all sides of this debate have legitimate concerns that need to be respected. I hope that the Senate can robustly but fairly deal with concerns in respect of this bill.


Debate adjourned.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-10-13,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:30):  I am pleased to be supporting the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. This bill is absolutely critical to finding ways to deal with social harm, particularly violence against women and children, caused by welfare-enabled alcohol and drug abuse. This bill will allow for the introduction of a cashless debit card trial for up to three different communities. These communities will be selected for the trial on the basis of high-welfare dependence and high-social-harm indicators and also openness from community leaders to participate in the trial. The trial will run for 12 months, be limited to 10,000 participants and be subject to independent evaluation. This card is an important recommendation from the Forrest review report, Creating Parity, as a way of dealing with significant harm occurring in heavily welfare-dependent communities.


I would like to respond to some of the things Senator Siewert had to say on consultation. I found them a little bit ironic. I met with the Yalata community and the Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation, whose leaders came to Canberra in the last couple of days to talk to senators about this legislation, and I am told that Senator Siewert refused to meet with them. 



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  You talk about consultation, but then you refused to hear from the very community leaders who are going to be affected by this trial, who are affected by the problems right now and who are best placed, in my opinion, along with other community leaders and other community members, to have a view on why this is necessary.


Mr Andrew Forrest, whose Creating Parity report recommended this reform, gave evidence to the community affairs committee inquiry a few weeks ago on 11 September and set out the tragic and troubling context for this reform. We should pay tribute to Mr Forrest. He is clearly committed to getting better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. I do not think we should question that at all. I think there is a genuineness to him, and certainly that is the way he presented as a witness. If we look at his record, he has done some great things. We should commend significant Australians like Mr Forrest who are looking to put something back. Mr Forrest told our committee:


Unfortunately, over the 40- or 50-year period that I can remember, I have seen the degradation of communities at the hands of alcohol and drugs. As many would know, in those communities there is a very high rate of attendance at funerals of friends and people who, like me, were bright-eyed, confident, happy and looking forward to living a full and secure life in Australia as youth. I feel that has been denied to so many of our vulnerable Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, through disproportionate access to alcohol and drugs in vulnerable communities. These are the great destroyers of community, of lives. 


Ceduna in South Australia will be the first site where this trial will take place. Ceduna and its surrounding region has a population of 4,425. It is a town on the midcoast of South Australia around 800 kilometres west of Adelaide. In 2013-14 there were over 500 presentations to the emergency department due to alcohol or drug abuse—more than one a day. The Ceduna Sobering Up Centre had 4,667 admissions in that same year. Hospitalisations in the region due to assault are 68 times the national average.


The Ceduna community leadership, who also made a submission to the community affairs committee and appeared at the public hearing, have called for this reform and see it as a crucial way of addressing the wide-ranging drug, alcohol and gambling problems in their community. When the government announced they would like to bring the trial to Ceduna, these leaders said:


We want to build a future for our younger generation to aspire to and believe we cannot do this if our families are caught up in the destructive cycle of alcohol or drugs that destroys our culture, our lands and our communities.


At the heart of this reform is a change that is being shaped specifically to meet our local needs. It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.


We have grasped this initiative; we have helped shape this initiative; and we are confident that this initiative is for the betterment of all people within our region.


These are very powerful words coming from these community leaders. They are saying that they want to empower their community and deal with the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse in their communities. We as a government want to work with those communities who are willing to take these steps. We want to work with them and trial these technologies to see if we can make a genuine difference to some of these horrifying statistics. That is what this reform is about. It is about improving the lives of people in the regions. It is about protecting people from harm and giving people who have been caught in a cycle of welfare dependency, addiction and abuse some hope that there is a better way and a better future. Ceduna community leaders told the committee during the public hearing:


We understand the introduction of this trial is not the silver bullet to solve all of our issues, but we strongly believe that it provides part of an overall plan aimed at reducing easy access to alcohol, drugs and gambling addiction. As community leaders, we are very much aware of the social consequences of sitting back and not doing anything. We are at the forefront of alcohol and drug related violence. Families are going without food and children are not attending school, and there are other social issues which impact on the general health and social wellbeing of our people.


In the past, measures to reduce alcohol fuelled violence and chronic alcohol misuse—contributing to the premature deaths of our people—have been tried and tested and have failed. It is our belief that as a first trial site, amongst a possible three across Australia, we now have an opportunity to make positive change in the lives of our people.


Again, these are powerful words coming from those on the ground. The government is listening to those communities and working with them to get better outcomes.


Let's go to some facts about the card. This card will look, feel and act like the normal debit card product that we all use every day and will be connected to the Visa, MasterCard or EFTPOS platform. Participants in the trial would receive this cashless debit card for the cashless part of their welfare payment, and their existing bank account will receive the cash component of their payment. Government consultation with community leaders has determined that 80 per cent is the sensible cashless figure.


Under the trial, if you are on Newstart, single with three children and live in your own home, you have over $145 cash per week, with the remainder of the payment on your card. If you are on parenting payment, single with four children and living in a private rental, you will receive over $220 cash per week, with the remainder of the payment on the card. If you are on disability support pension, partnered and with no children, you will receive over $85 per week, with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are single and on Newstart, you will receive $60 per week cash, with the remainder of your payment on the card.


This card will work like any ordinary debit card from any ordinary bank except for those store categories which have been switched off. These stores would include liquor stores and gambling outlets. Participants will also not be able to withdraw cash using this card; however, the 20 per cent that goes into their usual bank account can be withdrawn and used without restrictions. Participants will be able to benefit from banking technologies, including online budgeting options. Participants may also be able to manage their welfare payments and develop their budgeting skills through setting daily spend limits, maximum transaction values and maximum numbers of transactions per day should they wish to.


The card will include push text technology for recipients and their mobile phones. This will help people develop their financial literacy and financial management. People will receive these notifications when their Centrelink payment has arrived in their account, to show them the remaining balance after a purchase over $10 and when their balance is running low.


It was made clear that many in the communities affected by this proposal were generally in favour of it and those against it were often external to the community. For example, Professor Eva Cox gave evidence at the hearing to oppose this measure. I asked Professor Cox if she had actually spoken to people in Ceduna about the trial. Her answer was, 'No, I have not.' The committee also heard from Mr Rob Bray of the ANU, who, when asked if he had spoken to people in Ceduna, replied, 'No, I've not spoken to any of the community of Ceduna.' Professor Ilan Katz of UNSW also opposed this measure; but, again, when asked about his involvement with the people of Ceduna, he said, 'I've not spoken to them either.'


Many of those opposed to this measure went on to mount a straw man argument about income management with regard to this bill. This issue came up during the committee hearings, and it needs to be made clear that this is a false comparison. This trial is not income management. It was emphasised a number of times during the committee hearings that this debit card is not to be confused with the BasicsCard or any other type of income management. Professor Marcia Langton, who has worked in some of the affected communities, made it clear that this measure is not income management. She told the committee:


It is quite a different model. Income management works in a kind of reverse way. What is being proposed here will work substantially differently and it is important to trial this in order to see if this kind of approach will work better. Under this scheme, there will be something like the Families Responsibilities Commission—that is, a committee of responsible members of the community, including elders, who subscribe to good social norms, who hear cases to remove the high levels of the cashless component of the income to enable people to access the cash, depending on, critically, whether or not they are sending their children to school every day.


Mr Michael Haynes, the CEO of Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation and one of the community leaders actually from Ceduna, also told the committee:


… this is not about income management. This is a cashless debit visa card. We see it as totally different …


Mr Gregory Franks, the CEO of Yalata Community Inc, expanded on Mr Haynes's comments to the committee by saying:


The difference between this card is that it has a 70/30 minimum split, a standard split of 80/20 and potentially 90/10, so it has the variable. It has very strong Aboriginal leadership commitment to it. It has very strong community support. It is a standard visa-type card that you can use anywhere in the country. It is a catch-all for everybody, black or white—anybody who is receiving benefits. But the big aspect of whether this will work or not will be around the fact that the trial will have a range of support packages provided with it, things like financial counselling, alcohol and other drugs counselling, and grief and loss counselling, as well as support for employment programs, support for economic development activity and support for diversionary activity. That is where this card will succeed or fail. It is not the mechanics of the card or the card itself. I know that I, and probably you, do not use more than 20 per cent of my own cash when I do most of my transactions. It is a normalising behaviour and it facilitates that normalising behaviour. It has very strong community support and very strong Aboriginal leadership support, but it is the support packages that we are still negotiating that will determine whether the card does or does not work.


Some critics of the trial also talked about it being a paternalistic measure or limiting people's human rights. When asked about this during the hearing, Professor Langton said:


I do not believe that it is paternalistic at all. Aboriginal leaders in these communities want this measure, and they want this measure because you have to see alcohol abuse to the extent that it occurs in these communities at firsthand to understand their concerns. What has happened over the last 50 years is that Aboriginal people have become normalised to welfare dependency. The proposition that a capable adult could go and get a job is simply regarded as impossible by many Aboriginal people because they have a mindset that their permanent destination is social security dependence.


…   …   …


This is not a paternalistic measure; this is a protective measure that leaders have examined closely and want for their communities because children are unsafe, women are unsafe and, more and more, people are being dragged into the drinking culture and increasing the proportion of drinkers in the community.


Professor Langton went on to say:


In relation to human rights, this is not a human rights abuse. The proposition is not race based. Both of these towns are open towns that have multicultural populations, including Australian settler folk, various kinds of Australians from elsewhere in the world, and very large Aboriginal populations—and much larger Aboriginal populations in the Hinterland of these towns.


Mr Forrest also addressed this issue, saying:


… this card is not remotely paternalistic. Anything which gives thinking adults caring for community—experienced adults—an ability to further help their community is not paternalistic. To deny those Australians that basic right without a trial, to deny them access to a better technology which has transformed our own lives in this inquiry … is very paternalistic.


I also note that the committee looked at the value of this trial in helping teach those on welfare important habits such as budgeting and saving. Mrs Michele Pucci of the east Kimberley region told the committee:


I think there is a general feeling and acceptance in the East Kimberley that there needs to be something done around addressing some of the antisocial behaviour. There is a belief that the card will in some way limit that as it limits people's access to alcohol and drugs.


…   …   …


I also believe there is an opportunity. People may be able, through this card, to better manage their spending, and I think that there are some services that then will be able to get in behind those families.


This is an absolutely critical bill. It will help address the significant harm being done in small, welfare-dependent communities where alcohol, drug addiction, abuse and gambling are rife. This is not income management. This is a card that will operate like any card that everyday Australians have. The only difference is that it will have stores that are switched off, such as liquor stores and betting agencies. In addition, people will have access to 20 per cent of their income in cash, which they can use on absolutely any product they choose to spend their money on.


This is about empowering communities. This is about addressing the scourges of alcohol abuse, drug abuse and gambling addiction, and some of the terrible, negative effects that we see in some communities as a result of those scourges. I would urge all senators to get behind this. It is a trial, it is an important trial and it is a trial which has overwhelming support in the community. I think that we in this place should always be looking at ways in which we can improve the lives of Australians. But importantly, as we do that, we should be looking at ways in which we can work with local communities, in consultation with local communities, to deliver local solutions which will make the lives of ordinary children, men and women in these communities much better as a result. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (17:46):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. This bill will amend the Social Security Administration Act 1999 to enable a trial phase of new, cashless welfare arrangements. Under the trial, welfare recipients will have a proportion of their payments credited to an account that they can only access using a restricted debit card. The trial, as outlined, will extend across three locations, involving up to 10,000 people. 


These changes come as a result of the Forrest review that was conducted a short while ago, which found that the current income management system was economically unsustainable and unsuitable for broader application. When income management was first implemented by the Howard government, the scheme that was put in place—that is, the first scheme—suffered from the same thing: it was economically sustainable and unsuitable for broad application. It was a detailed methodology used by the then Howard government to income-manage individuals during the Northern Territory intervention. It was clunky in the extreme; it required significant numbers of personnel to operate the system and work with the communities to ensure that it at least worked in the way that it was designed; and it left no room for growth in the system. 


Ultimately that was replaced by the BasicsCard, which is well known now across the Northern Territory and in other locations. The BasicsCard served the purpose of overcoming the limitations that were inherent in the system that was implemented by the Howard government in the Northern Territory intervention. In line with technology updates, we now have a new scheme, a debit card trial, that will hopefully prove more economical, sustainable and suitable for broader application, as outlined by those opposite in their second reading debate contributions. 


There are, on this side, some concerns about how it will operate, and they have existed throughout the history of income management more broadly. The previous speaker tried to indicate that it is not income management. If it is not income management, it is a form of welfare assistance that could be more broadly or generically described as managing incomes rather than dealing with problems in a more nuanced way.


The trial locations will be selected based on where there are high levels of welfare dependence and where gambling, alcohol abuse or drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm within the community. I think that alone describes the issue—that you intend to income-manage those communities to avoid those levels of difficulty. Of course, a high level of community support is always a key factor in determining trial locations. The card itself will not allow cash withdrawals for purchases of alcohol or for gambling services. 


Subject to the passage of the bill, the first trial will commence next year, as I understand it, in Ceduna, South Australia, and surrounding areas. On 4 August, community leaders in the Ceduna area signed a memorandum of understanding with the government, to trial the card in Ceduna. As I said, obviously you need a high level of community support for such a trial to proceed. You need to give an explanation of how it will work. You need a broad level of government support in that initial trial to ensure that it is successful. I have doubts as to whether the government will provide that complete level of support that is needed, but I will wait to see the final outcomes of that trial before being so bold as to criticise the government at this juncture. The arrangements will apply to all people on working-age payments, including Newstart, disability support and carer pension recipients who reside in the trial locations. Age pension recipients and wage earners may also voluntarily nominate to have the debit card. It is also understood that the government is in further discussions with two other communities across Australia that may wish to take part in the trial. 


In doing that based on location, the government should proceed carefully and ensure that it is appropriate to offer the debit card to all those within that trial location who fit the description, because it appears there is no opt-out provision. The government must ensure that those persons do require or should have the card, and that there are no objections—because objections are always very difficult to deal with, post a rollout. 


Initially, 80 per cent of participants' income support payments and 100 per cent of lump sum payments will be restricted. However, the minister or a community body may vary the percentage of a person's payment that is restricted. In doing that one would hope that procedural fairness is provided for and that a reasonable process to ensure fairness is provided to a person who may find that the percentage has changed—increased or decreased as the case may be. Participants will receive a cashless debit card that will work as similarly as possible to any other bank card. I commend that. I think it is a good process to move to a debit card that is indistinguishable from any other payment system that is used, and that it is used in a way that ensures that the user of the card is not identified by the card itself. The trial will seek to ensure that the card works at all terminals and retailers, except those that exclusively sell restricted products. There will be no requirement to direct funds to priority goods and life's essentials. It is essential to ensure that issues are managed, so that where the debit card does not function participants understand why it is not functioning, or that where there has been an error at an ordinary location the sales assistants also understand what to do. A certain level of support needs to be provided to ensure the trial does have a fair opportunity to be successful. 


It is clear that action is needed to tackle alcohol abuse and excessive gambling and the harm they cause in some communities. That has been obvious for some time. Labor believes that targeted income quarantining can be a useful tool in supporting vulnerable people; however, in saying that, such an approach requires a range of responses and support services delivered in close consultation with communities. The government does need to be mindful that in implementing this new technology—although it may be old in some respects the EFTPOS system is ubiquitous; it has been around for some time—and using it to tackle the issues of alcohol abuse and excessive gambling it must draw heavily on the past experiences of the Department of Human Services and the original intervention by I think it was then minister Mal Brough with the Northern Territory intervention to ensure that there is sufficient support for persons who have the trial card. 


In saying that, a card itself will not solve the issues. It is the support and the case management of individuals that will go a long way to breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse and excessive gambling. Labor did push for a Senate inquiry on the bill to allow the impacts of the trial to be thoroughly explored and give affected communities the opportunity to make submissions. Labor does believe that welfare quarantining should only apply to vulnerable people who meet certain criteria rather than to all people within a particular location. We must ensure that the measures proposed in this bill are not discriminatory and that they meet community expectations. I remain less convinced that the government has taken this issue to heart to ensure that it does act in a nondiscriminatory way and does meet community expectations. But the trial, if the government fails in this area, will highlight that more broadly.


I know the government does not think this is the same as income management, but I think it is apposite to say that under the existing income management scheme a proportion of a recipient's income support payment is set aside to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, housing and utilities. Recipients can spend their income managed funds using a PIN-protected debit card, which is still known as the BasicsCard, or by arranging for Centrelink to make payments on their behalf. The major issue that exists with the BasicsCard is, as I think I outlined earlier, that a merchant must apply to the Department of Human Services to accept payment and it is the merchant's responsibility to block purchases of excluded goods such as alcohol. In saying that, the BasicsCard did well in moving away from what was an overly regulated, burdensome and cumbersome process, and of course the new restricted debit card system will address several problems identified with the existing BasicsCard. It will also not have the costs associated with administering the BasicsCard, which is not affiliated with any payments provider. The debit card will also do away with the perceived stigma associated with the BasicsCard, which clearly identified recipients as income support recipients. 


Existing income management arrangements have been rolled out in conjunction with a range of support services, and this is the point I was making earlier—support services are where you make the major advances; you will not find the solution in the card itself. The card is just a tool that will assist. What we do need, and we remain unconvinced about whether the government has provided it, is sufficient individual support and support services to make sure that the system is successful. Success will be measured not by how the card has operated, not by how many transactions the card has successfully processed, not by how many errors the card may have caused; it will be measured by the change in the community in response to both the support and the tool, the card itself. We hope this arrangement will lead to a much better community in the longer run. That will be harder to measure for, and during, the trial, but it is something that the government should spend some time considering in order to ensure that the trial, and not simply the card, is a success 


Unfortunately, additional support services will not be provided in the trial areas as part of the debit card trial. Debit card participants will also miss out on the additional support from Centrelink that is provided to income management participants. I think that the government is being a little duplicitous when it says that this is not income management so we therefore do not have to have support services and Centrelink and that the debit card will operate effectively on its own and do its job. The question is: what are you trying to achieve? The job is to move community expectations from where they are now, dealing with drug and alcohol abuse and gambling abuse, to where you want the community expectations to be—that is, a much better environment for the raising of families in those communities. In not providing those additional support services, I think that the government has missed a great opportunity to ensure that the card is a successful implementation of the strategy. The objective of the strategy is to move the community to a much better place. 


In my view, those opposite need to consider the complexities of breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse and excessive gambling. The debit card—as I have underlined—will not offer a standalone technological fix to what is ultimately a social issue. The government needs to consult with affected communities and listen to their concerns so that this becomes a process and a feedback loop, and not only during the trial. You may want to ensure the success of the trial, and you will need to ensure that it is monitored and reviewed as well as that the lessons from that trial are learnt. In addition, those affected in these communities will require financial counselling services, they will require early childhood and community safety services and they will require substance abuse services. Without those services being provided, I cannot see how such a trial will demonstrate that it is making a substantial difference to that community. 


It is of concern that the trial does not allow participants to seek an exemption or to be excluded from the trial. Therefore, if a person is identified as a compulsory participant, they will have their payments restricted regardless of their level of vulnerability. Existing income management participants are identified through a range of triggers, including child protection notification, length of unemployment, young people at risk and people on prison release. Labor simply does not believe in the blanket use of income management. Labor is aware that the vast majority of Australians receiving income support are more than capable of managing their own income. We are, however, committed to ensuring that welfare payments are spent responsibly and in the interests of individuals and, particularly, children. That is why income management should be targeted towards those that are most vulnerable within the community.


I look forward to reading the report of Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. This inquiry has allowed for the impacts of the trial to be thoroughly explored and for people who will be affected to have a proper say. Labor will continue to engage with the communities that will be affected by the government's proposed trial and will take the opportunity of listening to their concerns. What are required to curb the surge of alcohol, drug and gambling dependence are, in truth, community based initiatives which engage with persons, including with those most vulnerable in the community, and which provide assistance and support when it is required. That can be done alongside such a payment card as this, should it prove to be a useful tool in supporting those outcomes. The card should not be the final solution in and of itself; it should be able to be utilised in a way that supports those initiatives that I spoke about. 


I doubt that the government have taken much of that on board. They seem to be clear that this is not income management; it is a technological solution and an improvement on the BasicsCard. They are all arguments to be had about the card but not about changing community attitudes, changing community social norms, ensuring that our children can grow up in a safe environment, and assisting in resolving community excesses around alcohol abuse and drug dependency.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-10-13,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:06):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015—or the card I like to call the healthy welfare keycard. After being injured during my service in Australia's Army, I know what it is like to live from pay cheque to pay cheque on a disability support pension. I have experienced the anxiety and fear you feel when you are forced to pay for the grocery bill by credit card hoping that you are not about to max it out buying the essentials. I know how hard it is to manage your money, make ends meet, break out of the cycle of poverty and raise a family while you are struggling to cope with physical and mental pain and the addictions that all too often come with those injuries. I know what it is like to be discriminated against by government agencies and treated like a second-class citizen 


I understand the fears of discrimination that people may have about the introduction of this new money management initiative. However, the time has come to face up to a few hard realities. 


Our kids are needlessly suffering, because too much of our welfare money is being spent on illicit drugs and alcohol. Our mums and dads with diminished capacity through addictions and mental health disabilities are needlessly suffering, because too much of our welfare money is being spent on illicit drugs and alcohol. That is why I support the broad principle that a healthy welfare keycard is based on—namely, that it introduces a cashless method of managing welfare payments for communities which are suffering from a crisis with alcohol and drugs. Once the teething problems with this new card and its technology are sorted out, I would like a healthy welfare keycard rolled out across the whole of Tasmania. It will save lives and needless personal harm and suffering. It will significantly reduce the rates of family violence and family break-ups. It will reduce the rates of admissions to our hospital accident and emergency departments.


The healthy welfare keycard is also a vital early intervention initiative. Not only will it save lives; it will save a lot of taxpayers' dollars in the long run. As one of the Jacqui Lambie Network senate candidates for Tasmania, Rob Waterman says, 'Every dollar spent on early intervention saves $7.' And that is exactly what the healthy welfare keycard is—an effective and compassionate early intervention initiative, which will save at least $7 for every dollar invested in it. The healthy welfare keycard contains a function whereby an automatic text is sent to a card recipient's phone, stating what the total of their account balance is after every transaction over $10. This is an important tool, which will help people on welfare better manage their money. It will gently encourage better financial management skills.


There are a number of groups of people who will either hate or be very disappointed by the introduction of the healthy welfare keycard. Drug dealers will hate this card, because over time it will mean fewer people will buy their products. Pub, hotel and bottle shop owners will experience reduced profits in the communities where the healthy welfare keycards will be in use. People who make a living from the gambling industry will also experience reduced profits in the communities where the healthy welfare keycard is in use. This is because, as the explanatory notes reveals:


The trial will test whether significantly reducing access to discretionary cash, by placing a significant proportion of a person's welfare payments into a restricted bank account, can reduce the habitual abuse and associated harm resulting from alcohol, gambling and illegal drugs.


Despite the obvious social and personal benefits which this trial has the great potential to produce, I had and still have reservations about the manner in which this trial is to be conducted. One of the proposed trial sites is the South Australian community of Ceduna. I accompanied Senator Xenophon on a tour of the community on Friday, 2 October and spoke with many people about this trial. While I listened to all the community's concerns, from Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, it became apparent that a significant section of the community, mainly non-Indigenous stakeholders, had not been properly consulted with and their interests were not being properly represented. Based on that meeting I had in Ceduna, I was prepared to vote against this legislation should the government fail to delay presentation of the bill before the Senate. However, after a further meeting I had in my Senate office this Monday with the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Alan Tudge, and more Ceduna community representatives—Greg Franks, Michael Haynes and Wayne Miller—I have decided to support this Turnbull government initiative and trial immediately. I changed my mind after listening to the Ceduna community representatives and also after Assistant Minister Tudge gave a personal undertaking to travel with Senator Xenophon and me back to Ceduna in South Australia over the next month so that we can hear all of the community's concerns and answer their questions honestly and openly.


After my visit to Ceduna, I became very worried that the government was swooping in to 'save the day', without knowing all the facts—but that is not the case. I acknowledge the long, hard detailed work which has been put into this project. After reflecting on his commitment, advocacy and willingness to consult, I have to congratulate Assistant Minister Tudge for his leadership, passion and drive with regard to the healthy welfare keycard. It is also important to acknowledge the courage and bravery that local leaders, both in local government and within the Indigenous community, have displayed. They have borne the brunt of a lot of community heat and criticism. They could have easily folded under the pressure and opposed this initiative, but they knew in their hearts that what they were doing was a good thing for their community and for the generations to come. So they pressed on and fought the good fight and had the courage to act on the knowledge in their minds and the feelings of love in their hearts for their community. This can teach us all an important lesson. It is one thing to have knowledge and feelings of love; it is another thing to have the courage to act on that knowledge and love and turn thought and feeling into deeds. And that is what we have with this legislation. It is a means for this federal government to resource and fund good deeds through a program which will make the world safer and happier for the communities which are fortunate enough to be selected for the healthy welfare keycard trial.


I am reluctant to make too many comments about Australian billionaires, given my recent, unfortunate and painful experience with one of them. However, if there is one lesson I have learnt from this legislation it is that there are billionaires and there are billionaires. It would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge the hard work of Mr Andrew Forrest, who really is the father of this healthy welfare keycard. Twiggy Forrest is a well-known Australian businessman and entrepreneur. This legislation would not be before this Senate if Twiggy Forrest had not decided to act. Australian communities suffering from all the harms and illnesses that come with alcohol and drug addictions would not have the hope that comes with the presentation of this legislation. Twiggy is not just responsible for a new card; he is responsible for a new approach to solving the terrible problem of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian disadvantage. 


The JLN supports Twiggy's 27 recommendations of creating parity and ending disadvantage. I do not care what colour your skins is or what religion you are. If your community is suffering from alcohol or drug addiction then Twiggy's solution for early intervention—particularly through the establishment and integration of early childhood services in the most vulnerable communities and intervention before birth—will be vital for the safety of our children who are placed at risk because of the alcohol and drug addictions of adults. If this legislation passes this Senate, then, according to the explanatory memorandum, it will:


… enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements in response to a key recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest’s Review of Indigenous Jobs and Training.


The purpose of the trial is to test the concept of cashless welfare arrangements by disbursing particular welfare payments to a restricted bank account, accessed by a debit card which does not allow cash withdrawals. The trial will test whether significantly reducing access to discretionary cash, by placing a significant proportion of a person’s welfare payments into a restricted bank account, can reduce the habitual abuse and associated harm resulting from alcohol, gambling and illegal drugs. It will also test whether cashless welfare arrangements are more effective when community bodies are involved.


Throughout this debate, the word 'disadvantaged' has been used by me and many other speakers. Many people watching these Senate proceedings or reading Hansard may ask the question, 'What is disadvantage?' Probably the best report I have read that clarifies, describes and quantifies the word 'disadvantage' is a report published by Catholic Social Services and Jesuit Social Services, written by Tony Vinson and Margot Rawsthorne, with Adrian Beavis and Matthew Ericson. Dropping off the edge 2015, or DOTE2015, examines persistent communal social disadvantage in Australia. 'Social disadvantage' was defined as a range of difficulties that reduce a person's opportunities in life and prevent people from participating fully in Australian society. Social disadvantage is calculated by combining statistics and research on criminal convictions, juvenile offending, long- and short-term unemployment, youth unemployment, disabilities, lack of formal qualifications, family violence, family incomes, rental assistance—to name just a few social indicators.


In Tasmania, the five most disadvantaged of the 29 local government areas, or 17 per cent, accounted for 64 per cent of our state's top-ranked consistently entrenched place-based disadvantaged people. We have some of the worst rates of unemployment and youth unemployment in Australia. This report shows that the local government authorities which are really doing it hard are Brighton, Central Highlands, Derwent Valley, George Town and Glenorchy.


As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons why I want to support this trial is that I think it will be a success, and then I will fight hard to have the trial of the healthy welfare card transferred to cover the whole of Tasmania. If it is a success, I have no problem going into bat for it to make sure that the state of Tasmania is first in the receiving line. As Mission Australia's executive summary says in its 2014 youth survey, there is no doubt that in Tasmania:


Inequality and disadvantage remain entrenched in areas of our society with intergenerational poverty becoming well-known. It is becoming increasingly common to understand that this disadvantage is concentrated in some locations.


Tasmania is one of those locations. This card will be one of the steps we take to address this crippling social disadvantage.


Other solutions that I have put forward to also address and solve the unemployment crisis and the lack of confidence include supporting an involuntary ice detox and rehabilitation act that gives parents the right to use non-consensual medical treatment on their drug-addicted children; supporting voluntary national service for our young people which will allow them to join the military for a year and learn some skills or participate in trade training and apprenticeships; making areas in Australia where high unemployment is endemic, including most of Tasmania, special economic zones that are payroll tax free; creating a national policy which guarantees the protection of Australia's prime ag land or best farming lands, noting that Australia only has 3.4 per cent prime ag land; guaranteeing the supply of health gold cards to members of the ADF and police who have served overseas in war zones and under warlike conditions, with that to be automatic; supporting the introduction of national legislation which targets members of organised crime groups and their associates, similar to America's RICO laws—the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; and guaranteeing that Australia's fuel, gas and power are cheaper than our major trading partners' so that our manufacturers, small businesses and farmers can profitably compete in unfair world markets while maintaining wages and standards of living for Australian workers and providing a lot more jobs, especially for our youth.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-10-13,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:20):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. I applaud this initiative that will enable a trial phase of a new cashless welfare arrangement and a cashless debit card. It will try to reduce the harm caused by alcohol, gambling and drug abuse.


When I read the details, I cast my mind back to a Senate inquiry that I was involved in in 2009. It was the Senate Select Committee on Men's Health. There was plenty of evidence about disadvantage from rural and remote communities, and I always remember the evidence given by Risk Welsh, who was the Aboriginal Men’s Health Project Officer with the Men's Health Information and Resource Centre. I will quote what he said:


I recently visited a community in north-western New South Wales, at Wilcannia—


probably far-western New South Wales is the correct description—


and that is a pretty grim place, because the average life expectancy for Aboriginal males out there is 35, so they are basically lucky to see their kids hit high school.


That the average life expectancy of an Aboriginal male at Wilcannia was 35 shocked all committee members. I actually went out to Wilcannia on a couple of occasions to see for myself.


On one occasion, the then minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Mark Arbib, actually came out at my request and met with the council and local groups to discuss how some of these problems could be addressed. We heard of children having to get themselves ready for school—dressing themselves and, most likely, not getting breakfast. We heard that the school bus often did a second run to ensure that those children who wanted to go to school did get the opportunity. This is just one example of a community that needs help. 


The reason I support this trial, which starts in Ceduna, South Australia, is that we cannot stand by and watch these communities killing themselves and their children. For too long governments of all persuasions have thrown billions of dollars at these communities in the belief that it will fix the problem, but it never has and it never will. This is why we are here today discussing the need for a cashless welfare card.


I live in a country town that has a good and decent reputation but is not without its problems. When you drive through the business centre late at night and see young children, who are primary school age, walking around the streets or on their skateboards, and you wonder about their home life. Are they rebellious? Do mum and dad have no control over them? Have they just given up on trying to discipline them? Are mum and dad at home or at the pub affected by alcohol? Is there a mum or a dad? What is the future for these children? We can close our eyes and block our ears and pretend that it is not happening, but I can assure you that, unless something is done to arrest the alcohol, drug and gambling issues affecting some communities, we cannot expect future generations to be any different.


I was interested to read the speech given in the other place by my National colleague, the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton. He mentioned that Moree in the north-west of New South Wales would be a good place for a trial, and I would agree with him. For those who do not know their geography, Moree is only a 90 minutes' drive from my home town and has produced some very good sportsmen over the years, including the Sutton cycling family and NRL star, Ewan McGrady. I am pleased to say that in this year's group 9 rugby league grand final, the Inverell Hawks just outlasted the Moree Boomerangs to win the title. Mr Coulton pointed out that about one quarter of the population of Moree is Aboriginal and the welfare split of Indigenous and non-Indigenous is about 50-50. This is not about the colour of people's skin or their background; this includes all in the community. For various reasons, including misinformation that was spread, the trial in Moree will not go ahead and so we will never know what impact it may have had. 


It will go ahead for 12 months in Ceduna in South Australia and it will then be reviewed. When you read the shocking statistics in that location you will understand why some form of intervention or control is needed. In 2013-14 presentations to the hospital emergency department due to alcohol or drug use exceeded 500—more than one per day and nearly two a day. The Ceduna Sobering Up Centre had 4667 admissions in 2013-14 financial year. Hospitalisations due to assaults are 68 times the national average. Minister Tudge said on Monday that for the last year in Ceduna there were 4600 admissions to the local sobering up centre, despite the population being only 4400. I will repeat that: there were 4600 admissions to the local sobering up centre despite the population being only 4400 people. If those stats alone do not make Labor and the Greens sit up and take notice, nothing will, and so Ceduna is a good choice for the first trial site. The community leaders of Ceduna actually approached the government to explore the idea of the cashless debit card and they have supported a trial to address some of the alcohol and drug abuse affecting the region. 


I want to stress that this is not income management. Participants in this trial can use the card anywhere and purchase anything except alcohol and gambling products and will not be able to withdraw cash with the card. Participants in this trial will receive a mainstream everyday debit card, which will be connected to a Visa, MasterCard or Eftpos platform. Cash will not be available from the card, and the holder will not be able to purchase alcohol, gambling products or illicit substances. Eighty per cent of a person's social security payments will be placed into a debit card account and the remaining 20 per cent cash will be placed into their existing bank account.


All working age social security support recipients within the Ceduna region will be part of the trial and receive the card. Aged pensioners, veterans and workers may volunteer to opt in. This is how it works: under the trial, if you are on Newstart, single with three children and live in your own home, you have over $145 cash per week with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are on a parenting payment, single with four children and live in a private rental, you will receive over $220 cash per week with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are on a disability support pension, partnered with no children, you will receive over $85 cash per week with the remainder of your payment on the card. If you are single and on Newstart, you will receive $60 per week cash with the remainder of your payment on the card. It is adjustable. If it is found that a person needs more cash and they are known to have been responsible with their spending in the past, then the arrangement can be adjusted to allow them more cash.


How will this be achieved? The package focuses on areas where there are existing gaps in funding and where it has been identified locally that people are likely to need the greatest support during the trial. Funding is being made available to support a new mobile patrol team to operate 24 hours, experienced drug and alcohol counsellors, increased rehabilitation services, intensive financial counselling, family violence services and other services. This package is not being forced on the community; it has been codesigned by the Ceduna community.


I was interested to read the comments from the Greens back in March, when this program was first made public. That then Green leader Senator Milne said it was offensive for the Prime Minister and mining magnate to tell people throughout Australia who are less well off how they should manage their income. Even Senator Siewert was quoted in the article as saying that 'this patronising and paternalistic policy decision will not work'. It was interesting to read the exchange between Senator Siewert and the chair of the Australian Indigenous Studies at Melbourne's School of Population and global health, Professor Marcia Langton, at the Senate hearing.


Prof. Langton …First of all, this is not income management. 


Senator SIEWERT: But it is. 


Prof. Langton : No, it is not income management. 


Senator SIEWERT: Why not? 


Prof. Langton : It is quite a different model. Income management works in a kind of reverse way. What is being proposed here will work substantially differently and it is important to trial this in order to see if this kind of approach will work better.


Professor Langton earlier said that she supported the legislation and that it certainly was not paternalistic. She pointed out that Aboriginal leaders wanted the measure because, as she said: 


…you have to see alcohol abuse to the extent that it occurs in these communities at firsthand to understand their concerns. What has happened over the last 50 years is that Aboriginal people have become normalised to welfare dependency. 


…      …   …


…children are unsafe, women are unsafe and, more and more, people are being dragged into the drinking culture…. 


I also refer to the evidence of the Mayor of the Ceduna District Council, Allan Suter. He said:


In this case, council support for the trial of the cashless debit card was made on condition that we got strong support from the senior Aboriginal leaders, and I am happy to say that we have got that. We are also satisfied that we have got strong support from our non-Indigenous community, with, of course, a few exceptions. Some of the objections are very genuine and passionate. Being a small town, we have a good knowledge of people's motives. Some objections are from people who wish to have money to purchase drugs or alcohol. Some are even from people who are very anxious that their customers will be able to have money to purchase drugs and alcohol. We respect the opinions of the genuine and passionate objectors, but they really are very few.


Andrew Forrest, a man who has a great passion to ensure people get off welfare and get some self-respect, had this to say at the Senate inquiry:


Unfortunately, over the 40- or 50-year period that I can remember, I have seen the degradation of communities at the hands of alcohol and drugs. As many would know, in those communities there is a very high rate of attendance at funerals of friends and people who, like me, were bright-eyed, confident, happy and looking forward to living a full and secure life in Australia as youth. I feel that has been denied to so many of our vulnerable Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, through disproportionate access to alcohol and drugs in vulnerable communities. These are the great destroyers of community, of lives. 


This week, we saw the report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. In part of its summing up, the committee said it was:


… satisfied that the trial is strongly supported by community leaders in the proposed trial communities in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. The committee considers that the expected benefits of the trial to reduce the social harm caused by alcohol and gambling, particularly for children, justify the measures outlined in the Bill.


The committee recommended that: 


… the Minister for Social Services include safety net provisions in the proposed legislative instrument to ensure that vulnerable people impacted by the trial are able to be exited from the trial, where appropriate, to ensure they are not further disadvantaged.


The committee recommended that the bill be passed.


Mr Deputy President, I want to take you back to the mid-1970s, when I was driving livestock transport. We would go out to places like Wertaloona station in the Flinders Ranges, where four or five semitrailers would show up late in the afternoon. Bob Wilson would be in the cattle yards with three or four Aboriginal stockmen—bandy-legged, slim fellows with high-heeled riding boots and big hats. They were good stockmen and good workers. It was hot. They did their job well and tied their horses up under the trees as they drove the cattle that we would load at daylight the next morning. I think if I took you out there today, Mr Deputy President, you probably would not find many Aboriginal workers out there. There would be some but certainly not like there were back in the 1970s.


What did we do? I will tell you what we did. We threw money at these people. We on all sides of politics over the last 40 years thought money would solve the problem. We threw money at these people, and what did they do? They gave up their jobs, they went to the pub, they got drunk and they probably bashed their wives when they got home—not only people of Aboriginal descent, I can tell you, but also people of Anglo-Saxon descent as well. We are not focusing on one colour here or anything like that. Colour does not come into this debate. It is about looking after taxpayers' money. But we threw money at these people, and I think we did a great deal of harm to them. It is a good lesson to all of us that lack of money is not the problem. 


Here is a situation where these people will get some cash and a debit card, just like most people have. They can buy products that are essential items—food, clothing or whatever they need—on those debit cards at the stores, but they cannot be used for gambling or alcohol. That bring us to the situation where the social security cash is simply spent on Friday and Saturday, much of it at the local pub or perhaps gambled or spent on illegal drugs. What do the mums and kids live on for the next week? This is where it is so wrong. There is abuse of social security. Hardworking Australians are paying their taxes to give money to these people—people who are certainly not well off, perhaps unemployed, perhaps obese and perhaps not in good health. But throwing money at them makes their situation worse.


I commend Ceduna. I have been to Ceduna many times. It is a good community, a beautiful place on the Great Australian Bight off the Southern Ocean and a lovely place to drive through. In my previous job, I actually had an agent who sold my products there. I would visit the town quite often and go right back through Streaky Bay, Elliston to Port Lincoln et cetera. To think that this community has such a terrible record of alcohol abuse—4,660 admissions out of a population of 4,400 in a year—is just unbelievable. That is outrageous. It is crazy.


So what do we do? If we do nothing, nothing will change. I have always had the attitude that to try is to risk failure but to do nothing is to guarantee failure. The government, under Minister Tudge, is working with community members such as Twiggy Forrest and the local government representatives at Ceduna to give this a go. We should give it a go. I encourage everyone to have their say on this issue. Let's help these people. Let's try to get them off their problems of alcohol and drug abuse and especially unemployment. As I said, throwing money at the issue does not always solve the problem. Of course money helps in many respects. We in Canberra collect a lot of money from the taxpayers of our nation—and, of course, too much is being borrowed—and we must spend that money wisely. Sometimes that money is going out there and actually destroying people's lives.


I take you to a trip I did to Wilcannia with former Senator Mark Arbib where I found out the average man in Wilcannia has a life span of just 35 years. I put it to you, senators, where could you go on this planet, to what other country, where the average life span for men is less than 35 years? Maybe Ethiopia or some other African country or somewhere else? I do not know. I do not think you would find a place or a country on this planet where the average life span of a man is just 35 years. I think this is a disgrace. Of course Wilcannia is a community with a high Aboriginal population. I have been travelling through there for 40 years. I know why they have problems: they are unemployed, they have little to do and they have alcohol, drugs, a bad diet, obesity and a lack of exercise. All of the above contribute to that terrible statistic that the average man in Wilcannia will live to just 35 years of age. As I said earlier in my presentation, they probably will not live long enough to see their children get to high school. If you were to search the world for a worse statistic, I do not think you would find anywhere worse.


So we have to trial this. We have to do something. We are throwing money at these people who can then go to the pub and fill up with grog. I have seen them. I have been driving through Wilcannia for 40 years. On social security day, where is everyone? They are lined up outside the pubs. 


Then of course there is that terrible drug ice, which seems to be right throughout Australia. It is in the big cities, in the bigger country towns, in the smaller country towns and even out in the shearing sheds. Ice is a big concern. People who are peddling these rotten drugs are destroying people's lives. If we hand out cash, when people are bored and do not have a job, what are they going to do? Just one shot of ice and people are totally addicted to it. It is a terrible drug and is causing so much damage. People are going off their brain in anger, bashing the women around them and committing all sorts of crimes. I know they are bashing the ambos and the police when they are arrested. They are bashing the nurses and the doctors in hospitals. If we are going to hand out people's hard-earned cash—governments do not have the money; we either take it from the people or we borrow it—and promote more social unrest, more social harm and more harm to women and kids especially, when the money is all gone at the pub on grog or on drugs at the start of the social security week, what is mum cooking? What is she feeding the kids? How are the kids clothed? How are they getting off to school? We have seen too much at Wilcannia. These are issues which each and every one of us in this chamber should work to correct. 


What we have done is not working. As I said, I doubt whether those great . What we have done is not working. As I said, I doubt that they would be there today . Those great Aboriginal stockman would be out there today. Why? Because they worked hard in those days. They earned their living and then we threw money at them. I think it is shameful—not only the Aboriginal community but the community as a whole. I commend the minister for this program and the committee for its report and the research. We have to give it a go. It is a trial. It is not running right across Australia. If it works, and I hope it does, let us hope it is broadened out so that when people receive taxpayers' money they do not blow it in the pub or blow it on drugs or gambling. I hope they use their debit card to buy food and clothing, the things they need to care for themselves and, more importantly, for their families, for their wives, for their children, to see that they are treated well and that they live properly. Hopefully in time things will be better so that the average man in Wilcannia will live longer than just 35 years of age.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:39):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. A number of senators have made reference to a recommendation which emerged from Mr Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous jobs and training. What is probably not well known about Mr Andrew Forrest is that he goes a little bit further than giving advice to government. He employs Indigenous workers—13 per cent of his workforce are Indigenous. He contracts over a billion dollars worth of work per annum to Indigenous companies which employ 40 per cent Indigenous workforces. He goes further than just giving advice. 


I have visited his employment centre in Roebourne, where he has a very deep connection. I think that was the genesis of his experience, where children were wandering the streets late at night, hungry and sometimes affected by alcohol and drugs. He decided to do something. What he did is quite remarkable and is worth repeating ad infinitum in this chamber. He actually employs Indigenous people. He looks at the barriers to employment, whether they are no licence or lack of literacy or numeracy, and he addresses, identifies and provides training for them. If they pass the vocational education and training course, he gives them a job, I think on $117,000 a year fly-in fly-out from any of his remarkable mines in Western Australia where he is producing 165 million tonnes of iron ore. He is not just giving advice to government or to communities; he is actually walking the walk and doing the things that will make a difference. 


When you move through Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Whyalla, Elliston and over to Ceduna, as I did recently, most of the local mayors are quite open about the connection Indigenous communities have with the country and they are well aware in some cases of the awful history, but not too many of them offer employment. There are not too many who are taking the step Andrew Forrest has taken and saying, 'I will have 10 per cent of this council workforce cutting the grass, emptying the garbage and doing whatever who are Indigenous.' In fact, some very wealthy communities over there employ no Indigenous people. I do not know why that is. I just make that observation. 


When Mr Forrest gives the Australian community advice, backing up that advice are his actions. He is moving people from welfare dependency into good, well-paying jobs. I met grandmothers who had returned to work in the stores. I met a young Indigenous person who said that their ambition was to buy a house. You need a senator's wage to buy a house in Perth, but he was not frightened of it. He was saving to do that. The reality is that these measures are eminently defendable, but we do need children to get fed and clothed and to go to school. We need a safe environment where they can be kept in a measure of comfort and experience the normality of growing up in Australia, where they can kick a football, go home and have a jam sandwich or a Vegemite sandwich and be looked after. We know that in some of these communities alcoholism, drug addiction, petrol sniffing and glue sniffing, substance abuse has torn all that asunder.


I take particular note of Senator Williams' contribution because I, too, can go back to the late 60s in the Northern Territory, to places where Indigenous people could get a drink but it was usually in a bar separate from the white person. There were plenty of stockmen would have had good jobs 


It is probably three or four weeks work now and the rest of the time is drinking. That is the awful reality in some of these outback communities. I no longer stop in Tennant Creek when I am driving through, as it depresses me so much. If you go to the Goldfields Hotel it is amazing how a licensee can actually go to sleep at night with the obvious, almost death in front of you, drink-till-you-drop culture in some of these places. Anyway, I do not want to get too carried away on those issues.


I did visit Ceduna, and I had a very agreeable meeting with the local mayor—who, I might add, had checked with the local member to make sure it was okay to talk to me. Apparently I passed the test and he did speak to me. He said that they had sat down and worked it all out; that they had sat down with a number of groups in the community, and this was a community driven position. I was encouraged by that. I asked who the main opposition was. The main opposition would not be all that hard to find. It is a grand premises adjacent to the beachfront that provides alcohol and gaming for the community. According to the local mayor, there was some stern talking and they had to sit down and really knuckle it out.


They want a community that is attractive to tourists. It is the start of the tourist trail through to Port Lincoln. They were getting a substantial number of tourists but, according to some of the press reports, the behaviour of some people was detrimental to growing that sector. I must stress that the local mayor had a not unusual view in South Australia that the local paper was not reporting things accurately and that the local paper had reported things that were quite ancient and unproven as fact—as if they had happened the day before. When he tried to address that with the Advertiser they basically did a double-up on the story of inaccuracy and virtually canned his community a bit more. So he had a ban on them. He was not going to talk to them anymore. But he was very, very insistent that the community was getting together with a view that they could make things better, and I fully support that.


I do however think that there are risks with all of this. If it is not capped by a genuine attempt to provide employment, a genuine attempt to move people, all we will end up with is some sober people without hope. I am not sure that is what we are trying to achieve here. We do know that there is mineral exploration and drilling going off in the Great Australian Bight, 300 kilometres off the coast. We know that the airport is receiving additional traffic numbers and may well be upgraded. If there is a substantial find in the area, there may well be a boom in Ceduna's economic activity. But it is important that people who live there, and have always lived there, get to share in that. I do not see any connectivity at the moment between the obvious need to have people sober and feeding their children and how we move to the next stage, which is to take advantage of that situation and get them into useful paid employment.


Clearly, there are a number of other issues. I want to go through some correspondence I received from a constituent in the area. I do not want to mention his name, but I think it is fairly insightful that we place on the record that not all of these trials are going to be suitable. This person has a fairly straightforward position. He is 50 years old, of working age, and receives a disability support pension. He has been told that his payments will be part of the mandatory income management package being rolled out. He says:


I was employed and payed taxes for most of my working life. I have a mortgage and 3 children in school. My health gave out a few years ago and I have been on a disability support pension since. I have COPD with possible Sarcoids and suffer severe back pain and nerve damage issues due to arthritis and disc damage from the physically demanding and heavy work I used to do to earn my living. These sicknesses are further complicated by the early stages of Chronic Kidney disease.


This person is on a disability support pension—through no fault of his own, I suppose—and is now in the situation where he is subject to this trial of 20 per cent cash and 80 per cent on goods. The police or social services have never attended his residence due to domestic violence, noise or unruly behaviour. He values his peace and privacy and considers his neighbours and their rights to the same things, and he tries to instil those values in his children. He goes on at length to say that he is managing his disability pension payment well and managing a mortgage and that the kids are in school and the school fees are paid—all of the normal things that a prudent person can manage.


As part of this trial he will have reduced flexibility. He makes a couple of good points. He is a thrifty person and he says he buys his gear at the op shop whenever he can but that op shops do not have EFTPOS facilities. I am not really sure about that, but that is what I am told—op shops do not have EFTPOS facilities. So, if he is prudent and wants to get some second-hand clothes from the Save the Children shop or United Mission or whatever it may be, these businesses do not have EFTPOS facilities; they deal in cash. He also says:


We will no longer be able to take advantage of the sharp practice of many local traders who will give substantial discounts to non credit or eftpos card transactions.


I am not familiar with that either, but these are matters that he has raised with me. This person says that he will no longer be able to purchase foodstuffs direct from growers markets or producers, which will drive up his cost of living. He has a long list of issues.


I hasten to say that, on 20 August, I provided this information to the Hon. Scott Morrison's office, and I am awaiting a reply. The reality is that this particular person is not someone we are out to try to income manage or to quarantine payments for. When we get an answer from the minister's office it may well be that there is a local committee that can look at his particular circumstances and vary his arrangements. However, he for one is not very happy.


So to say it is unanimous in the area is probably a long bow to draw. I think there is some evidence on the public record that some of the Indigenous women leaders in the communities would prefer that the alcoholics and the druggies were managed where the elderly, the vulnerable and children are at risk. They do not appear to support a blanket trial.


It is an awful thing: if you do put 10,000 people on this system and they only have access to 20 per cent of their cash then they are in a position of some vulnerability in some respects. A neighbour of mine actually provides financial counselling, formerly as a volunteer and now with COTA, to a lot of very vulnerable people on Newstart and the like—those sorts of pensions. He tells me that they do not lack the financial knowledge and they do not lack the financial management skill; it is that they make poor decisions when they go to enter into agreements with people. He has lost count of the number of times that people have made decisions on the hire-purchase of a fridge or the renting of a TV—really poor decisions. He provides advice to people all over South Australia. There is one particular well-known national company which does a lot of work with people in this area. Financial counsellors will send people down to that shop and they will do their best deal. Then the financial counsellor will ring up and ask, 'Can you do better?' And sure enough, this particular national company does do the right thing. So I just wonder whether the quarantining of the 80 per cent of the spend will have some unintended consequences. Will it drive up prices in certain areas? We know those are the only places they can get their stuff from. They cannot go elsewhere.


I used to know a pensioner who lived at Elliott, which is halfway between Alice Springs and Darwin. When pension payments and went cashless he used to drive to Tennant Creek to shop because the shopkeeper in Elliott would say, 'Well, pick out what you want and then we will give you the change.' And he would say, 'No, no—you give me the money. You cash my cheque and then I will go and buy what I want.' Anyway, they could not agree so he used to drive 350 kilometres to Tennant Creek to do his shopping and come back. I just wonder whether quarantining that amount of the payment will have some unintended consequences. That may well need to be very carefully monitored.


I am absolutely sure on this one: if you take a person who is dependent on alcohol or gambling and you make it that they cannot spend money on that, they will come up with another way of doing that. There will be a trade somewhere which will allow those people to get access to alcohol. Prohibition has never worked anywhere. So if someone is dependent on alcohol and you have quarantined their money they are going to do something silly, like buy something and trade it for a carton of beer or a bottle of rum or, as I saw in the bottle shop in Ceduna, a five-litre cask and a sixpack of Bundy and Coke.


I do not think we should be kidding ourselves that this will actually solve the problem where people have a genuine addiction to alcohol or gambling. It is not going to solve the problem. It may well increase—we probably need to say this—prostitution and things like that. It just may well do that. There will always be people who will take advantage of people's addictions and there will always be people who can go to a pub and buy grog for people who cannot buy grog. So let's not have our rose-coloured glasses on with any of this stuff.


As I said at the outset, kids have the right to be brought up in a safe home environment—fed, clothed, looked after and cared for with all the love that most families in Australia get. But let's not kid ourselves that this is going to be all roses because we have quarantined the spending. In fact, we might be patting ourselves on the back and saying, 'Oh well, we've stopped those people wasting their money on alcohol and wasting their money on gambling.' Well, I am not sure about that. Time will tell. I am hopeful that this will be a successful trial, if this legislation gets up. But I do not have any confidence, looking back over the last 35 years, that this will be all good. In fact, it is probably going to impact on people who do not need management. We had one case there in evidence, as I spoke about. And we hope to get a response from the minister's office about that.


I think that it is a good initiative. It is a community-led initiative, if the local mayor and the other people who participated are correct. It is a courageous initiative, but it is not one that is guaranteed to succeed. I think what will guarantee success is if we can build on this initiative and give them some hope about involvement in employment. Let's give them some hope—not training jobs just for the sake of it. One of the things that Andrew Forrest has done very well is that if you complete a training course with his outfit you actually get a job. You do not just complete training for the sake of training. I think that these initiatives, if they are to be successful and if they are to work, need to have a component in them where the whole community gets behind employing some of these people—furthering their education and giving them the opportunity. Let's face it, local councils are, in some cases, the biggest employers in these areas. I challenge those local councils to have a look through their workforce and to look at the people who have lived the longest in their communities and see how many people are actually offered employment.


I know all the stories. I know that they do not have a licence and that they will not turn up every day and all that sort of stuff. Well, Andrew Forrest disproved a lot of that. And there are Aboriginal organisations which should be contracting to these local businesses and contractors; taking responsibility and building proper economic opportunities for their people so that they are not dependent on welfare and they are not dependent on having their income managed. I do not think that is too much to ask. I think that the will is there in regional South Australia to have a go at this sort of stuff. I think that they should. It is very clear if you look at some of the operations in the APY lands. One Indigenous construction company hangs out how many visibility vests they need for the next day. Five visibility vests means that five people get a job. You just turn up, put a visibility vest on, do the job and get paid. Those sorts of initiatives are operating in the APY lands and I think that with this, combined with employment opportunities, we may well measure some small progress. Thank you.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-10-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:00):  I have not found making a decision on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015 to be easy. The bill deals with inherently difficult issues and seemingly intractable problems—not problems over recent years but problems over many years, over generations. Whether these problems can be tackled, or even go some way to being solved, with this bill remains to be seen.


This bill seeks to have a trial of the healthy welfare card in up to three locations around the nation. But it needs to be made clear at the outset that this bill does not actually set up those locations. They are not specified in the bill as such; they must be set out in regulations. And those regulations can be disallowed by either house of parliament. That is something that I am sure the government will be acutely aware of should this bill pass. Should any of these trials—and I emphasise 'trials'—be established, they will need to be subject to regulations, and those regulations can be disallowed in terms of setting up any trial site. That in itself, I believe, is an additional safeguard in respect of the implementation of these trials. It is an additional safeguard because the Senate can scrutinise, at least within the statutory period, these trials. 


I will discuss with the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Alan Tudge—who, with a lot of good faith and with a lot of goodwill, has engaged in enormous amounts of consultation with local communities and indeed with my crossbench colleagues and, I believe, with the opposition on matters raised in this bill—whether we ought to look at having a provision for the period of disallowance to be extended so that, if the trial is established and it appears that there are serious problems with the trial, the regulations setting up the location of that trial can be disallowed. That is something I will have a good-faith discussion with the assistant minister about.


I am acutely aware of the limitations that this bill will place on a person's spending. However, I am equally, if not more, aware of the devastating harm that alcohol and gambling addictions are causing individuals, families and communities as a whole. This bill not only attempts to address these harms; it does more. I believe that if implemented properly—and I emphasise those words: 'if implemented properly'—it can actually create hope. As imperfect as this bill is, my concern is that doing nothing, not at least attempting an alternative approach, would be a worse position. But I am acutely aware of the remarks made by Senator Siewert of the Australian Greens, whom I have enormous regard for, who implacably opposes this bill because the Australian Greens consider there are alternative pathways to deal with these issues. But I think that what is contained in this bill—having a healthy welfare card—could, if implemented properly, actually work.


The history of this is contained in a report prepared by Andrew Forrest, who most people know as a mining magnate but who I believe is someone who cares passionately about Indigenous Australians, about Indigenous Australians having a fair go and about remedying those generations of inequity and disadvantage. This particular approach could actually work. Mr Forrest suggested that a cashless welfare system for vulnerable Australians:


… poses a way of providing stability for families and individuals so they can concentrate on finding employment, providing adequately for their families, and sending their children to school.


Let us make this clear: this healthy welfare card applies across the board. It does not simply apply to one class of Australians. It is going to be done on a location-specific basis as a trial. Because the beautiful town of Ceduna, on the west coast of South Australia, in the Great Australian Bight, is one of the proposed sites, I went there to visit, on Friday, 2 October, with my colleague Senator Jacqui Lambie. I want to take this opportunity to thank the community of Ceduna—both those for and those against the healthy welfare card—for the reception they gave me and Senator Lambie, for the time they spent with us and for the discussions we had, which I thought were incredibly useful.


I thank the District Council of Ceduna, including its mayor, Allan Suter, and its CEO, Geoff Moffatt. I thank the communities that I met at Ceduna Council Chambers: the Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation, with Mick Haines, their CEO; and Wayne Miller, their Indigenous Community Engagement and Governance Officer; the Koonibba Aboriginal Community Council, with Corey McLennan; the Scotdesco community, with Robert Larking; and the Yalata community, with Greg Franks, who dialled into that meeting. The Oak Valley and Maralinga Tjarutja communities, with Peter Clark and Keith Peters, were also part of this process. I also heard from members of the community at the Ceduna Community Hotel, where there were about 20 or 30 people. One of the local organisers recorded the whole meeting, so apparently you can get on YouTube to see Senator Lambie and I being asked questions and responding to very legitimate concerns in relation to this proposal.


For those who have not visited Ceduna, it is a beautiful coastal town located on the west coast of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. It is famous for its annual Oysterfest, which coincidentally was held over the weekend that Senator Lambie and I visited, although I hasten to add that we left before the festivities. We were there just for the day. Clearly there was a certain buzz about the community because of the number of people coming into Ceduna for its annual Oysterfest.


Sadly, though, it is not Ceduna's beauty and natural assets that make it famous; rather, it is the town's struggle with drug and alcohol abuse that has led to some adverse publicity in relation to the community. The local council has tried time and time again to curb the damage caused by alcohol addiction. A dry zone encompassing Ceduna and the nearby township of Thevenard—the port—has been in place since 1988. There are restrictions on the sale of certain types of alcohol. It is also a requirement to produce ID when buying alcohol so that a purchaser's name can be checked against the list of persons who are barred from buying alcohol. The question of whether that is being enforced or followed through is another matter altogether. But these measures are simply not enough.


In 2011, the South Australian deputy coroner handed down his findings in the inquest into the deaths of six Indigenous Australians in Ceduna. The findings were damning. The deputy coroner had serious concerns with the health of Indigenous Australians with an alcohol problem located in the region around Ceduna. He identified numerous satellite Indigenous communities within a 300-kilometre radius of Ceduna. Of particular concern to him were the Yalata and Oak Valley communities. The deputy coroner found there was overwhelming evidence that members of these communities often travelled out of Ceduna to acquire large volumes of alcohol, thus circumventing the dry zones. While the dry zones in Ceduna and these communities were found to have been effective, it was clear to the deputy coroner that determined people often used areas just outside Ceduna to consume the alcohol they had purchased. The deputy coroner heard evidence that authorities very frequently reported breath alcohol analysis that exceeded a staggering 0.25 per cent. The inquest found that many in those communities around Ceduna also suffer from chronic ill health and self-neglect. An extract from the report explains just how entrenched the problem of alcohol abuse is in the area. The deputy coroner said:


It would be wrong to stereotype the entire indigenous population in this region as having drinking problems, but the evidence adduced before the Court establishes that there is without a doubt a severe and intractable culture of excessive alcohol consumption among the transient Aboriginal population in Ceduna and that this culture is having a negative impact on the wellbeing and functionality of those people.


The deputy coroner concluded that there would remain an ongoing need to reduce the availability of alcohol to affected communities. The government says that it hopes that restricting access to cash through the trial of this debit card will restrict the accessibility of alcohol. But the point here is: will this work in isolation? I do not think it will. You actually need to have a number of measures and to have a holistic approach to dealing with these issues.


The figures from Ceduna's Sobering Up Centre, which is a very important facility, indicated that there were over 4,500 admissions to the Sobering Up Centre in a population of about 4,000 people. These are devastating figures. They are not just statistics. They are families—mothers and fathers, and children and young people in some cases—who are gripped by addiction. There is a question of the informed choices that a person can make in the grip of an addiction, particularly with respect to substance abuse.


Some of the key Indigenous communities—not all, but a number of them: Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation and Koonibba Aboriginal Community Council, for instance—are strongly in favour of a trial of the healthy welfare card, and they have extracted concessions from the government in terms of additional support for the communities: drug and alcohol services and additional services to provide that support. The question is whether the healthy welfare card in itself will be useful in dealing with these issues.


Some concerns were expressed to me by Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and it was quite pointed. One person who approached me at the meeting said that they had never, ever been on welfare, they had paid their taxes all their life, and they resented the fact that they would be subject to this card, because it would cause them difficulty in their own financial commitments and the like, and going to a panel seemed to them to be inherently unfair. By the way, effectively that was put to me by an Indigenous and a non-Indigenous Australian who had jobs, who had worked for many years and who found themselves on hard times needing support from the community through our welfare system. Two of the volunteers at the local op shop were concerned about the fact that they do not have EFTPOS facilities there and that restricting access to cash could have a very devastating effect on the op shop or, indeed, be a great inconvenience to some of the volunteers, stalwarts of the community in their 80s—senior citizens—who say, 'Do I have to be trained in how to use an EFTPOS or payWave facility in the context of a healthy welfare card?'


So they are some of the issues. This will not be easy. I think that any trial needs to be strictly monitored for the purpose of seeing whether it works or not. The undertaking that I gave to the community that I spoke to at the Ceduna Community Hotel was that there ought not to be any trial commencing and that, before we go any further, there needs to be further community consultation. I acknowledge that Assistant Minister Tudge has dealt extensively with key stakeholders in the local community, but it appears that there has not been a robust public meeting where those who are concerned about the health welfare card can ask questions and those questions can be answered fully. There needs to be that level of consultation so that matters can be taken on board before any place is designated for this healthy welfare card trial. That is an undertaking that Mr Tudge has given to me. I hope to be able to travel with him to Ceduna—and Senator Lambie may be coming to that meeting as well—so that we can genuinely hear from the community—those in favour but particularly those against the healthy welfare card. That is something that I think is essential.


 I think another safeguard, if a particular place is chosen as a trial site, would be that there is the opportunity for the regulations to be disallowed for that particular area. I think that is a very critical safeguard in relation to this. There must be a robust evaluation process, and I think that, should this bill pass its second reading stage, there must be some very clear undertakings, guidelines and parameters as to how the evaluation will take place and some of the matters that have been raised—I think very legitimately—by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens as to how this would actually work in particular cases. If you are in a restaurant and you are having a meal, you can use the healthy welfare card for that, but if you decide to have beer or a glass of wine then that can cause problems. I think that is a very good point made by Senator Siewert, as to how that would be dealt with in the context of this card and the issue of people feeling stigmatised in relation to that.


A particular interest I have had is about the impact on the local community of gambling. The feedback that I have had is that poker machines have had a devastating impact on the local community in Ceduna. The Productivity Commission says that something like 40 per cent of gambling losses come from problem gamers, and I dare say that figure could be even higher in the Ceduna community. I think that having a healthy welfare card restricting that access to gambling would be a good thing. We also need to be aware that online gambling, presumably on both illegal and legal sites, is also very problematic. It has been a growing problem, particularly in those remote parts of the west coast where access to poker machines is not so easy. People can go online and lose a lot of money very quickly on their credit card, and that in itself is very problematic. The question I will be asking in respect of the healthy welfare card in the committee stages of this bill—should it get through the second reading stage—is: you can work out the legal sports betting operations, the online gambling operations, because they would have certain merchant numbers and they would no doubt cooperate with such a trial, but in terms of those illegal gambling sites based in places like the Caribbean and Gibraltar, where they have innocuous names that do not appear to be linked to the merchant name, how will that work? That is a huge and growing problem for the Australian community generally.


I note that there has been correspondence between the shadow Minister for Families and Payments, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, and the Hon. Shane Neumann, the shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs, and Assistant Minister Tudge in relation to this issue. I think it is fair to say that Minister Tudge has attempted to fairly comprehensively address a number of the concerns raised. The level of engagement and the detail in that letter indicates at least a willingness to engage in the concerns that have been raised by the opposition in relation to this particular proposal. 


I note that the opposition considers that the bill should not be progressed further until there is, in their view: sufficient consultation; an agreed comprehensive package of supports; further consideration and consultations; details of the operation of the bill—including possible community involvement in quarantine decisions—made public; and a fulsome evaluation framework for all possible participating communities established, in place and made public. I think for the Senate to do its job, we need to rigorously, forensically, deal with these issues. It has never been my position to support a gag on a substantive debate such as this, so I think it is very important that those questions be answered. 


These are difficult issues, but the questions raised by the opposition and by the Australian Greens must be answered in the context of this debate. It is important that we go into committee. I will support the second reading stages of this bill, but I think it is important that the questions raised by those who have concerns, or who have outright opposition to this bill, need to be addressed in the context of this debate. I want this trial, should it go ahead, to be effective, to work, but there needs to be further consultation. I am pleased that Assistant Minister Tudge said that should this bill get through the second reading stage, there will be further consultation and extensive consultation with the people of Ceduna, which is proposed to be one of trial sites. Having said that, I look forward to further debate on this issue. This issue will not go away. I think all sides of this debate have legitimate concerns that need to be respected. I hope that the Senate can robustly but fairly deal with concerns in respect of this bill.


Debate adjourned.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-10-13,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (19:19):  I rise to speak about an important report that was released recently titled Living with Parkinson's disease: an updated economic analysis. As the Deputy Convenor of the Parliamentary Friends of Parkinson's Group—with the convenor, Ms Ann Sudmalis—I was fortunate enough to attend the briefing on the findings of this report by Deloitte Access Economics.


In 2007, Parkinson's Australia commissioned Access Economics to produce an economic report, Living with Parkinson's disease: challenges and positive steps for the future. This report was updated in 2011 and reviewed and updated this year. All these reports highlight the significant growth in both the number of people living with Parkinson's disease and health system costs, productivity and other losses.


The 2015 report found that there are nearly 70,000 people—or one in every 340 people—living with Parkinson's in Australia. The report explains that Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, incurable, complex and disabling neurological condition. It is a surprisingly prevalent condition. On average, 32 new cases are diagnosed every day. There are likely to be nearly 12,000 new cases diagnosed this year. Of the nearly 70,000 Australians living with Parkinson's, nearly one in five are of working age. The number of people with this condition is expected to continue to grow in the coming years because of our ageing population.


While 82 per cent of people living with Parkinson's are aged over 65, people as young as 30 years of age can be diagnosed. The median time from onset to death is 12.4 years, though many people living with Parkinson's do live with the disease for well over 20 years. In 2014, there were an estimated 1,743 deaths from Parkinson's disease in Australia.


As well as the huge personal and human costs associated with this disease, the report highlighted the very real economic costs 


The total financial cost of Parkinson's disease in 2014 was almost $1.1 billion. This is more than double the cost of $527 million in 2005. According to the report, individuals bore 17 per cent of these costs; governments, 57 per cent of the costs; employers, three per cent; and the rest of the community, 24 per cent. For someone living with Parkinson's for 12 years, the average lifetime financial cost is around $161,000. This is on par with the average lifetime financial cost of cancer of $145,000. People living with Parkinson's are more than five times more likely to be in residential aged-care facilities than the general population. The total economic cost of Parkinson's last year was nearly $10 billion. This is an increase of 46 per cent, or $3.2 billion, since 2005.


This will only increase unless Parkinson's is made the focus of national action. The report found that there are cost-effective interventions that can help people living with Parkinson's to achieve a higher quality of life while at the same time reducing the cost to the community of this condition.


When I attended the briefing by Parkinson's Australia, I was able to catch up with the President of Parkinson's Tasmania, Helen Connor-Kendray, a tireless advocate for people living with Parkinson's in my home state. Helen spoke to me about the importance of people with Parkinson's having access to specialist nurses. This is also highlighted in the report, which says research has shown the potential benefits associated with the availability of specialist Parkinson's services. Importantly, the report said:


Patients have improved health outcomes and their carers report less emotional strain.


The benefits are found in Tasmania, where there are three specialist Parkinson's nurses, one in each of the regions, but they have a heavy workload. Regrettably, some people wanting the help and advice of these Parkinson's nurses can wait between six and eight weeks for an appointment.


This is not good enough. We must do more to help people living with Parkinson's disease. More people are being diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's, and we must ensure they receive age-appropriate support. This includes ensuring they have a smooth transition from the NDIS into residential care.


I commend Parkinson's Australia for commissioning this report and for all the work they do to support and advocate for all people affected by Parkinson's— (Time expired)
