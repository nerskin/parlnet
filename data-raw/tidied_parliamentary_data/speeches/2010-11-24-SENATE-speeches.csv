"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2010-11-24,"—I raise, for the Senate’s attention, the complete disarray the government are in regarding the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2010. The government have known since parliament resumed that this bill has been scheduled, but it is constantly being pushed down the list. It is yet another example of the complete disarray that the government are in is that they cannot get themselves organised enough to debate these bills at the appropriate time when they see a need. I would like the Senate to note that, while we will not be opposing the motion, three years after this government came to power this is yet another instance of the complete disarray and mess that this government are in. They have known about this piece of legislation. It should have been appropriately organised well before now and it is entirely inappropriate for the minister not to have this suitably arranged. The bill should necessarily be debated in reasonable time.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-11-24,"—Senators sometimes try to make political points about the program. If they understood the program they would know that, having had an election, the cut-off period—which is a longstanding matter in this place and which has served its purpose to allow bills to be introduced and subsequently considered in the next sitting period—would be next year if we were to adhere to that. Because we had an election, to consider the bills that are essential in this sitting period, of course, we have to exempt them from the cut-off to allow them to be considered now. So it is not a case of pushing bills down the list; it is about allowing these bills to be considered during this period.
Sometimes it would be helpful, if people are going to make contributions in the Senate, for them to make them accurately and for them to understand the import of what they are putting. The exemption from the cut-off is a usual devise that ensures that the Senate can consider bills appropriately—it allows for time for them to consider bills—and that they be dealt with in the next session. In this instance we asked that this bill to be considered to be exempt from the cut-off for reasons such as I have provided—sensible reasons which allow this bill actually to be considered during this period. I am sure Senator Nash wants this bill to be considered during this period and I think that was in her submission. If we did not agree to this motion—by the opposition not supporting it, which I know they will not—it would effectively mean that it would go to next year and then not be considered. With all respect, her submission is both erroneous and misdirected.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I seek leave to amend government business notice of motion No. 2 standing in my name.
Leave granted.
—This is my mistake. I amend the notice by omitting paragraph (4)(a), and substituting:
“(4)(a) Tuesday, 22 March 2011 in respect of the 2010-11 additional estimates”
and move the motion as amended:
That estimates hearings by legislation committees for 2011 be scheduled as follows:

2010-11 additional estimates:

Monday, 21 February and Tuesday, 22 February (Group A)
Wednesday, 23 February and Thursday, 24 February (Group B).

2011-2012 Budget estimates:

Monday, 23 May to Thursday, 26 May, and, if required, Friday, 27 May (Group A)
Monday, 30 May to Thursday, 2 June, and, if required, Friday, 3 June (Group B)
Monday, 17 October and Tuesday, 18 October (supplementary hearings—Group A)
Wednesday, 19 October and Thursday, 20 October (supplementary hearings—Group B).
That the committees consider the proposed expenditure in accordance with the allocation of departments and agencies to committees agreed to by the Senate.
That committees meet in the following groups:

Group A:

Environment and Communications
Finance and Public Administration
Legal and Constitutional Affairs
Rural Affairs and Transport

Group B:

Community Affairs
Economics
Education, Employment and Workplace Relations
Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.
That the committees report to the Senate on the following dates:
Tuesday, 22 March 2011 in respect of the 2010-11 additional estimates; and
Tuesday, 21 June 2011 in respect of the 2011-12 Budget estimates.
This means that rather than the Senate report on 2 March, which is the week after additional estimates and clearly would not allow the usual amount of time given for departments to provide answers to questions on notice, this allows sufficient time for that to occur. It looks like a ‘2’ was missed out in the first instance, but I am not going to claim that. This amendment will allow sufficient time for answers to Senate questions on notice to be provided.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-11-24,"—We are dealing here with the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, a piece of legislation which is directly related to the government’s plan to see $43 billion spent on a National Broadband Network which could well become the most ginormous white elephant in the history of Australia. The government wants to see $43 billion spent on a National Broadband Network without doing any sort of cost-benefit analysis, without going through any proper process to ensure the best way to deliver fast and affordable broadband to the Australian people. We are all in favour of fast and affordable broadband for the Australian people, but we are also very respectful of the value of taxpayers’ money. Taxpayers have to work hard to pay the taxes the government collects from them, and if you have a government that is trying, willy-nilly, to throw money up against the wall, there is a job to be done by the Australian Senate to properly scrutinise the activities of that government.
Over the last three years we have seen an enormous amount of government secrecy. It was pretty bad when Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister but, after this most recent election when Labor nearly lost, we were promised by the new Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, that things would change. We were promised a new era of openness and transparency, but nothing of the sort has happened. Things have gone from bad to worse when it comes to government secrecy, and this government is desperately trying to cover up stuff-up after stuff-up after stuff-up. But one thing has changed: in the last parliament the then Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, was bragging that they would not be pursuing a cost-benefit analysis before committing $43 billion worth of taxpayers’ dollars. The new Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, quite appropriately has come to the view that there ought to be a bit of scrutiny of the activities of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Stephen Conroy. Very appropriately, she has taken the view that some scrutiny, some audit activities and an independent review need to take place before going ahead. If the government is having second thoughts, if the minister for finance is having second thoughts, on the process related to the NBN so far, then the parliament is entitled to have second thoughts and we should delay further consideration of this legislation until the independent review report and the business case for the NBN have been shared with the Senate and the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-11-24,"—I would like to follow on from the comments that Senator Cormann has made on the common sense that should be applied to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, to the business case and to NBN Co. across the board. I do not think we have seen common sense since early 2009, when the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, announced as something of a thought bubble that Australia was going to have, amongst many other wonderful things that no-one else had, the very best broadband network in the world. I make the point that the coalition is absolutely committed to making fast and affordable broadband available to all Australians, regardless of where they live. It is just that we do not think NBN Co. is the way to do it and we do not think that this government has a clue as to whether this is the way to do it. It is simply a horse that they have got on which is galloping off, and they cannot work out how to get off.
I note that the Australian people, many of whom have rejected the opportunity, at great cost, to be involved in the new broadband system, have a lot more sense than this government in this area. I quote from a letter to the editor in the Australian today. It says:
I wonder if Senator Conroy would agree to tie his parliamentary pension to the economic success or otherwise of his National Broadband Network.
Heavens to Betsy; someone wants to actually hold the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy accountable for what he is doing but, no, the government certainly does not want to. I am also a bit concerned that apparently the Prime Minister now believes that Senator Conroy is not up to the job of negotiating this. She has had her own meetings with Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding in a last-ditch, desperate attempt to convince them—without a business case, without signing documents that would have bound them to secrecy for seven years or whatever the last date was—to just trust her on this. Why on earth would anyone trust Senator Conroy or the Prime Minister on the NBN Co. issue?
The challenge here is to develop an affordable, effective broadband system, a fast broadband system that minimises expense to taxpayers and ensures that all Telstra shareholders are treated fairly and equally. We do not have the evidence for either before us know. We are told we can have the government’s response to the business case on 17 December. As I said in this place yesterday, we do not really care when we find out about the business case but we will not pass the legislation until we do, because we cannot analyse the cost-benefit to Australia. On every scale that is currently available to look at, there is no reason to believe that it has been done well. If you go back to the introduction of it, when it was a thought bubble with no business case, no plan, no strategy, developed by then Prime Minister Rudd and Senator Conroy, it was just a wish. If you keep looking, you see that the government is putting all of its bets on one technology—in fact, in a bizarre way, paying Telstra to replace Telstra’s own current technology in parts of regional Australia. What a bizarre proposal. Does this make you want to trust this government? Does this make you trust that they know what they are doing? It goes on and on. There is no cost-benefit analysis and, until there is, the Australian people, and certainly the coalition, cannot accept that this is the way to go.
We look at body after body which could have assessed this program for the government. There is the Productivity Commission. We are still saying: ask the Productivity Commission to look into it. The Productivity Commission are absolutely the right body to look into this. The government have referred dozens of other programs to the Productivity Commission to do an insightful and forensic analysis of the costs and benefits. Why not this one? Why will they not put this one to the Productivity Commission? Another body that could have looked at this proposal and given us a practical, thoughtful, experienced response to it is Infrastructure Australia and yet the costs and benefits of the biggest piece of infrastructure ever proposed in Australia are outside the remit of Infrastructure Australia.
All we want is to establish the facts and to allow an impartial body to assess whether this investment—just remember it is the largest investment of taxpayer funds ever—is a good idea. The business community along with the general community want a cost-benefit analysis of this National Broadband Network project. The ANZ chairman, John Morschel, has said:
… the lack of a business case and full publicity of that business case is throwing a lot of doubt in people’s minds about the level of expenditure.
Just remember we are talking about $43 billion here. The chairman of Wesfarmers, Bob Every, has said:
I’m not convinced, and feel it needs a cost-benefit analysis …
We have under-invested in infrastructure for the last 30 years, in road, rail, water. I just see this as another part of infrastructure that we need to go through, stocktake and prioritise. And I do not know if it—
‘it’ being the NBN—
will rank in priority.
This is the chairman of Wesfarmers, one of Australia’s biggest companies. He is not, as Senator Conroy would have us believe, crying out for faster broadband. It is just not happening. I think the most bizarre comment of all from the minister, Senator Conroy, is that it would be ‘too costly’ to have an inquiry by the Productivity Commission into NBN Co. How bizarre. What will it cost? Let’s pick a figure, say, $10 million. The Productivity Commission has said it has enough money in its current $36 million budget to do it. They could do it. That is fine.
We do not know, of course, how much the government has paid for its last little foray in having an analysis of the analysis in terms of having outside oversight of their business case, but we do know that they spent $25 million alone with McKinsey KPMG on an implementation study which, as has been worked out by one of my colleagues, was $46,000 a page. I think the Productivity Commission could probably bring it in at a slightly lower page rate than that. Yet we have a minister, who wants to spend $43 billion, telling us that it is too expensive to get the Productivity Commission to do a study of whether the $43 billion is being well spent, what the outcome will be, whether it is an effective use of taxpayers’ money and whether it will stand up in the future. No-one knows what will stand up in the future, but the Productivity Commission is the best possible organisation to ask about the implications of this project. They can factor in non-financials as well as the other potential benefits of spillovers.
As I said earlier, the coalition has absolutely no problem with fast, effective, affordable broadband. It is our policy to do this. It was our policy to do this in a sensible way. We did not want a Rolls Royce with bells and whistles. We were of the view that a Holden or perhaps a Ford would do the job but, certainly, an Australian made and sensible solution, not some sort of put all your eggs in one very, very expensive gold basket solution, which is what we have with Senator Conroy’s project. I would like to note that the Secretary to the Treasury, Ken Henry, in September last year said:
Government spending that does not pass an appropriately defined cost-benefit test necessarily detracts from Australia’s wellbeing. That is, when taxpayer funds are not put to their best use, Australia’s wellbeing is not as high as it otherwise would be.
I continue to be very concerned that we have this massive spend on a new technology that may very well be completely out of date within 20 years, which is when the minister seems to think we should be progressing on this subject.
The coalition, of course, has some extraordinary concerns about the structure of NBN Co. We were the government that broke up what was a massive government owned monopoly, Telstra. Why on earth would we assist this government to establish a new and massively more expensive monopoly? The government are setting up a massive monopoly that is so anticompetitive that they have had to exempt it from the Trade Practices Act. Telstra will be contractually obliged not to compete with NBN Co. in order to protect NBN Co.’s revenues. ‘Um, um, um,’ is all anyone can say to this. How bizarre! Telstra will not be providing telephone or broadband services across its HFC pay television cables, yet that is the only existing network in Australia capable of delivering 100 megabits—a network that passes almost 30 per cent of the nation’s households already. No, we will not go for a Holden solution which would use the infrastructure that currently exists where it exists and make sensible use of innovative and new infrastructure where that would be an affordable and sensible solution. No, the government want to proceed on and on with their Rolls Royce.
The NBN is going to be an eight-year, $43 billion project. Surely that deserves a very rigorous cost-benefit analysis. The government and Minister Conroy were at pains numerous times yesterday to tell us about the three-year corporate plan and the 30-year business plan. I am very pleased that this group has a 30-year business plan. I would have been quite comfortable with a 10-year business plan, because of course the technologies that we will be using in 30 years are quite probably not known right now. The speed at which technology is moving forward in this area means that we simply do not know what will be the most affordable and effective means of establishing communication networks into the future.
The government, of course, would have us believe that there is a cost-benefit analysis and they have done it. We just want to see it. This may be very untrusting of us, but we would like to see this cost-benefit analysis. The government might say, ‘Just trust us.’ There is nothing that they have done to date that would make us think that we should do so. The project is being rushed through by the government in the way they rushed through the home insulation scheme, a disaster; the Green Loans scheme, a disaster; and the school halls scheme, the so-called Building the Education Revolution program, which was a waste of money in many, many areas. The taxpayers of Australia did not get value for money out of that program. They got bizarre outcomes where halls were pulled down to put up smaller halls and the like. There were schools with two halls but no library. No-one had any problem with expenditure to assist the development of schools in Australia, but once again this government, with their inability to implement and to understand business, have produced failure after failure after failure and simply wasted the money.
As the writer from Queensland said in that letter to the editor that I mentioned earlier, what about tying Senator Conroy’s pay to the losses or profits of NBN Co.? What about having a performance dividend? Let us look at that. If we tied former Environment Minister Garrett’s pay to the performance in the home insulation area and the Green Loans scheme, I suspect he would be paying us to let him work here now. If we looked at the wastage in the school halls scheme, I think the Prime Minister would certainly be earning about 50 per cent of what she earns now. They have not been successful.
We on this side will not agree to or acquiesce in this legislation without a cost-benefit analysis being done. Primarily this needs to be done by the Productivity Commission. Projects of this size and scale require the necessary oversight and consideration to see that they are being carried out in the most efficient and effective way. You would think that by now the government would recognise this. One does not mind if a new government learns by the odd mistake. It is when a new government has mistake after mistake after mistake and apparently learns nothing that we are in trouble.
This is, as I said earlier, the largest single investment in Australia’s history, and the government tell us it will make a fantastic contribution to the economic activity of Australia, but they have given us no examples and no tangible evidence of how they support this claim. Most of the applications and uses for the NBN that actually add to economic productivity are available on the ADSL2 broadband speeds that we have right now. Certainly let us look at using innovative technology to move to faster and faster communications in the future, but why would you do it in such a way that you have no idea whether it will be overtaken by other technologies, what the effect of it will be and what the costs and benefits of it will be? The government simply do not know.
We cannot assume that the business case they have so secretly hidden away gives them joy, or they would have released it by now. They know how much pressure there is from the Australian taxpayer to find out whether this is a good spend or a bad spend, yet they continue to hide the business case away on the basis that they have to go through it with a black pen to make sure no commercial-in-confidence material comes out. I would have thought that, irrespective of its size, it could not take more than a week—and the government have now had more than two—to do a little black-out exercise on figures that you wish to remain commercial-in-confidence. The government know there is pressure for the release of this, and they are refusing to release it until after the legislation has been passed. The only assumption that I can come to, and one that the Australian taxpayers are increasingly coming to, is that the figures in the business case do not add up and do not provide costs and benefits that are worthwhile for Australia and Australians. Without that cost-benefit analysis, we are opposed.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-11-24,"—I think it is time in this debate to restate and to remind the government of a couple of basic constitutional principles. The first of those principles is this: that it is for the parliament to decide and approve the expenditure of public money. And when there is a very large expenditure of public money it is all the more important that the parliament be fully informed of the reasons for that expenditure so that the parliament can form a view as to whether it is a prudent and efficient use of public money.
In the case of the bill before the chamber at the moment, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, we are discussing not merely the expenditure of a very large amount of public money; we are actually discussing the largest expenditure of public money on a single project in Australia’s history. Let me just say that again, because in all of the heat of this debate that point risks being lost: this is the largest expenditure of public money on any project in Australian history. Apart from expenditure on war this is the biggest single thing Australia has ever undertaken. It is the allocation of $43 billion, and that is assuming, by the way, that the government’s figures are reliable. There are many industry experts who say that that grossly understates the amount of public money that it will cost to build the NBN. But taking the government’s own figures as the basis of this discussion—taking them at their word—even on the government’s case this is the biggest single thing Australia has ever done in peace time.
So you would not think that it is an outrageous thing for the parliament to demand of the government that the business case stacks up? It is not an unusual thing for the parliament to demand of the government that it take the parliament, and through the parliament the Australian people, into its confidence about why this particular model was chosen and why this model should be preferred over the range of alternative models. And yet the government arrogantly and dismissively, with utter contempt for parliamentary process and democratic values, refuses so much as to consult the parliament about the business case and the economics for the largest single project in Australian history.
Let me remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, of a second principle, and that is that it is the obligation of ministers to abide orders of this chamber. And yet the minister responsible for this project, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, who is so clearly out of his depth that he is the laughing stock of the industry, was ordered on 17 November 2010 by this chamber to table in the chamber the National Broadband Network business plan and the government’s response to the McKinsey & Company and KPMG implementation study; the business plan being the fundamental document setting out why this particular proposal stacks up commercially and the government’s response to the McKinsey and KPMG implementation study being the government’s own appraisal of the expert assessment by those two professional firms of the way in which this vast project is to be implemented.
But this minister, showing open defiance and contempt for this chamber, has simply said, ‘Well, I refuse to abide the order of the Senate, because I think it is reasonable for the cabinet to consider these documents at greater length before I table them here.’ The minister’s opinion is irrelevant because this chamber, a chamber of which he is a senior member, has already expressed its opinion and it has made an order. A senator who is not prepared to abide an order of the Senate is unfit to be a senator.
The entire history of the development of the NBN has been a history of confusion, incompetence and concealment. The reason there is so much concealment is, I think, that the minister, who is plainly out of his depth, thinks he can try to protect from the critical gaze of the parliament the litany of incompetence for which he is responsible. When we in opposition put questions day in and day out to the minister, Senator Conroy, in relation to this, the most eloquent statement about the government’s handling of this matter is not to be heard in the minister’s attempts to obfuscate and filibuster answers to our questions. The most eloquent statement is to be seen in the mute, sullen and embarrassed silence of his colleagues as this out-of-his-depth minister—this lightweight minister—struggles unsuccessfully to get on top of this project.
The biggest thing that Australia has ever done in peacetime has been placed by this government in the hands of a man who has no business experience, limited intelligence and, frankly, lacks the maturity to deal with a matter of high public policy involving at least $43 billion of taxpayer’s money. Senator Conroy is like a kid with a great big train set. He is incapable of taking seriously the gravity of the responsibility with which he has been charged, and it is no wonder that the public, the markets and his own colleagues have lost confidence in his capacity to handle this.
I spoke a few moments ago about concealment. We know that the business plan was delivered to the government on 8 November: Monday, a fortnight ago. We know that it is a 400-page document. We expect that this 400-page document will contain a degree of technical material. We would expect that it would contain some commercially confidential material. None of that is surprising but, Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher, I know you, like me—indeed, like Senator Johnston, sitting beside me—have been a legal practitioner in your earlier life. You know that a competent professional can get across a technical document so as to identify commercially confidential material and you know, as anybody who has practised in this field does, that that is an intellectually difficult task but it is not something that takes two weeks.
The senior public servants in Senator Conroy’s department who advise the government, I know from my time as a junior minister in the department in its earlier form, are some of the most excellent minds in the country. It is not credible that it has taken more than two weeks for those people to have mastered the technical detail in a 400-page document and to have identified so as to redact any relevant commercially confidential information. It is a task that would take a skilled mind perhaps a couple of days of concentrated work—but not a fortnight. This claim of commercial confidentiality is a ruse. It is a pretext. It is a lie. It is not merely the business plan which this minister and this government, for fraudulent reason, seek to withhold from the scrutiny of the parliament before the parliament rises for the Christmas recess tomorrow.
We learned yesterday that, as well, the government has commissioned another study to examine the business plan itself. That is a study taken by Greenhill Caliburn, a very well known and respected corporate advisory firm. We in the opposition have obtained a copy of the service contract between the Department of Finance and Deregulation and Greenhill Caliburn. Before I go on to talk about what the service contract provides, let me just make the point which my friend Senator Cormann made yesterday in question time: isn’t it interesting that it was not the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy that commissioned the Greenhill Caliburn report, but Senator Wong’s department, the Department of Finance and Deregulation?
As you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, it is the role of the Department of Finance and Deregulation to keep a close eye on the expenditure of public moneys, and plainly the department of finance had concerns about the business plan so that firm was retained to review it. More specifically, this is the work that Greenhill Caliburn has been asked to do in schedule 1 of their contract: to report on and review the 30-year business case and 2010-11 corporate plan, examining the robustness of key assumptions. Pausing there, Madam Acting Deputy President, as I am sure you know, that word ‘robustness’ is one of the great euphemisms in documents of this kind. Whenever you see a question about the robustness of financial assumptions, what that tells you in layman’s language is: do these figures look just a little bit rubbery? Do the assumptions look a bit dodgy? That is what robustness means in a document like this.
So the assumptions, the robustness of which are being reviewed, include the financial assumptions—in particular, revenues, capital expenditure, operating expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows—and the operational assumptions, which include NBN Co.’s rollout plan, including market and/or technological capacity constraints that might be relevant—for example, construction, equipment and contracting. You only have to identify the key assumptions, the robustness of which have now been called into question by the department of finance, to appreciate that the very core and being and economic foundation of this business case has been called into question by the department of finance.
As well, Greenhill Caliburn has been asked to review the assumptions on rates of return and capital structure, including NBN Co.’s ability to access private sector debt and quantum; to examine and provide advice on NBN Co.’s assessment of risks and relevant mitigation strategies in the business case and the 2010-11 corporate plan; to provide an analysis of relevant options for key performance indicators, including financial and non-financial targets and ongoing monitoring arrangements for key risks arising from the business case and the corporate plan; to identify any other commercial matters, issues and risks materially relevant to the business case and the Commonwealth’s shareholding in NBN Co.; and, to the extent possible, to appraise the findings of the NBN implementation study against NBN Co.’s key outputs.
What the finance department has mandated, quite properly, is an entire review of every key assumption of the NBN business case to see how robust it is, how dodgy it is, how rubbery the figures are and how tenuous the assumptions are. Yesterday, the shadow spokesman in the Senate on this area, Senator Birmingham, asked Minister Conroy whether the Greenhill Caliburn review would be published, would be made available to the public. After filibustering through the entire two minutes of his question, Senator Conroy at last came to the answer, ‘To complete my answer, Mr President,’ said he, ‘the answer is no.’
What an outrage it is that the parliament has concealed from it until after it rises a business plan. What an outrage that the pretext for concealment of the business plan from the parliament is the lie that it takes more than a fortnight to identify and redact commercially sensitive information in a 400-page document. But even more outrageous, even more incomprehensible is the fact that this minister has now told the Senate that the appraisal of the business plan—to put it in the vernacular, the document that tells us whether or not it stacks up—will not be released to the public.
Greenhill Caliburn are an independent adviser and are not a part of the government. The draft, by the way, was due yesterday and the final document is due by Friday. If the minister gets his way and Greenhill Caliburn come back with a report that says, ‘We have serious concerns about the accuracy of this assumption, the accuracy of this assessment of the rate of return and we have concerns about this particular scenario, which is one of the premises of the business case,’ the Australian people will never be told. The Australian people will never be told whether or not a business case, which has itself been concealed from the parliament, passes independent scrutiny by an independent corporate advisory firm. What a disgrace.
You wonder why Senator Stephen Conroy is a laughing stock in the industry. You wonder why the comment you most commonly hear among experienced people in this industry is that Senator Stephen Conroy has a cargo cult mentality about NBN Co. It is no wonder that his own colleagues have lost confidence in him and he is now increasingly a minister struggling and under pressure—the weakest link in the chain of a very weak government. It is no wonder that the Australian public themselves, $43 billion of whose wealth is in the hands of this incompetent, are concerned. They are increasingly concerned that, whether this is a good idea, whether it is a bad idea, whether the business case stacks up or whether it contains critical flaws, they will never be told because this government has decided to keep the truth from them.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-11-24,"—In summing up for the opposition on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 second reading debate, I seek to make a few observations. The most obvious is to debunk the Labor lie—the refuge of those devoid of an argument in this place—that accuses us and the coalition of wrecking, of wanting to wreck broadband. The coalition has a proud and strong record of supporting broadband, but when we ask questions about the wisdom of the government’s particular approach we are lazily and immaturely labelled as wreckers by a government unable to engage on the issues. It seems to think that mere repetition of slogans is going to be a substitute for the evidence that we seek. We are deceptively told that the bill before us does not deal with the National Broadband Network. In fact, the bill does not mention the National Broadband Network. No lesser authority than the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy himself told the Australian people that on national television—so the coalition’s contributions on this bill were irrelevant. NBN was not part of this debate and the bill that we are considering, so the Labor sloganeering went.
Unfortunately for the minister, unlike him some of us actually had creased the back, the spine of the bill. We actually opened the bill. We actually read the bill and, what is more, we did the same with the explanatory memorandum. What that exposed was that the minister himself had not creased the spine of the bill or the explanatory memorandum. It seems that it came as an absolute surprise to the minister on national TV when he was told by Senator Joyce that the bill did, and does, refer to the National Broadband Network and it does not only do so once or twice or five times or 10 times or even 50 times, but 62 times the NBN is referred to in the bill. Yet the minister was not aware of it. The minister did not know.
We have a choice, Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher: the minister either deliberately sought to deceive the Australian people or he simply had no idea that the NBN was referred to in the legislation. I will allow the minister to make the determination as to which it was. I confess I am one of the more charitable on this side of the chamber and therefore I am willing to punt on the latter. Why? Because the minister is ignorant. Question time after question time he has proven that for us. Indeed, if ignorance were a crime, then Senator Conroy would be convicted each and every time beyond reasonable doubt by a unanimous verdict. But in political terms this gross and negligent ignorance is in fact criminal. This is the minister in charge of the $43,000 million NBN rollout, and that $43,000 million comes to roughly $2,000 per man, woman and child in this country. It is all one huge taxpayer liability run by this minister.
By the government’s own appalling standards Minister Conroy is starting to break away from the pack in the ministerial incompetence stakes. The competition is fierce. There is Minister Garrett of pink batt fame; there is Minister Carr of ‘cash for clunkers’ fame; and indeed there is the Prime Minister herself with her Citizens Assembly for Climate Change, so Minister Conroy is competing in a very well pedigreed field in the 2010 ministerial incompetence stakes. But with this NBN and his TV gaffe, he is really is breaking from the field and developing an unassailable lead.
It would be all quite laughable if it were not so serious. When their incompetence is highlighted, the minister and his colleagues chant their hackneyed focus-group-tested slogan of ‘wrecker’, but in doing so they throw that silly slogan by implication at the OECD, respected economic commentators, respected industry doyens and respected industry players. It seems we are to believe that the OECD are all wrong and bow to the superior intellect and knowledge of the minister who does not even know what is in his own legislation. I do not think so.
Not only is the minister ignorant of the content of his own bill, it seems that his colleagues do not trust him either. That is why the minister, unbeknown, had to have the NBN business plan subjected to an independent assessment by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. We welcome that assessment, but it will all be too late. The business plan of the NBN will be revealed but only after the parliament rises and after the government asks us to vote for this bill. Might I just divert here and say that, as I understood the minister’s response to a question this week, the actual assessment of the business plan being undertaken by Greenhill will in fact not be made publicly available.
So what we have is a situation where, if I might say with respect, there is no business plan. No business plan ever says that things are not rosy in the garden and that you should not proceed. It is always written in hope with great faith that everything will go well. That is why, I must say, it was wise to seek that independent assessment. But of course that independent assessment now is not going to be made available to the parliament or the Australian people. What we as a coalition fear is that this minister will continue to try to control the levers of the NBN, its rollout and this legislation.
Need I remind anybody in the event there is any doubt that this bill does in fact deal with the NBN that the facts speak for themselves. Sure, the minister has not opened the bill to read it or the explanatory memorandum, but I would have thought that he may have bothered to read the second reading speech on this legislation by his colleague Mr Albanese in the other place. Had he done so, he would not have had to read far at all. Indeed, he would have had to go only to the second paragraph of the second reading speech. The second paragraph of Mr Albanese’s starts as follows:
The National Broadband Network will fundamentally transform the competitive dynamics of the communications sector in this country.
Of a nearly two-page speech, the NBN would be referred to—just on the first page—at least half a dozen times. It is peppered with references to the NBN, yet this minister goes on national TV and asserts, ‘the NBN is not mentioned in the bill; it does not refer to the NBN,’ when his own colleague in the other place has already spoken on the bill and says, ‘Yes it does.’
Let us remember that the legislation is called the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. When Senator Conroy’s colleague in the other place talked about the ‘competitive dynamics of the communications sector in this country’, he was right on the money, right on target, as to what this bill deals with—the NBN.
Our questioning of this bill relates to our support of broadband and the health of the Australian economy. Labor somehow thinks that, because they have this grand vision of the National Broadband Network, there is no need for a cost-benefit analysis or for it to be placed under strict scrutiny. Let us not forget that this very same minister—Senator Conroy—went to the Australian people in 2007 claiming that he could do all these wonderful things with broadband for an investment by the Australian people of a bit over $4,000 million. It has now ballooned to 10 times that figure, to $43,000 million. I think a cost-benefit analysis is a very good idea, not only for a $4,000 million project but also for a $43,000 million project.
Let us remember Labor’s mindless mantra of ‘evidence based policy’. Remember that great line from the 2007 election? There is no business plan, no government response to the implementation plan, no analysis of the business plan—in fact, no evidence has been put before us other than this minister’s wholesale incompetence. Neither is the business plan being referred to the Productivity Commission. I would have thought anything with the initials ‘PC’ would have of necessity attracted the Labor Party, but they must have realised that on this occasion ‘PC’ did not stand for political correctness; it stood for something substantial—namely, a proper analysis by the Productivity Commission. As a result, when they hear the initials ‘PC’, Labor recoil in horror, because the idea of having scrutiny placed on anything is a matter of great concern to them.
The same government that provided this mantra on openness and transparency is now denying access unless senators—and only a few chosen ones—sign up to a seven-year non-disclosure agreement. Then, with a bit of pressure, it was brought down to a year, then a few weeks. I give full credit to Senator Xenophon for not signing up, and I trust other crossbenchers will not either. The duplicity in Labor’s mantra and then in their actions, I must say, is breathtaking.
We as a coalition have a raft of amendments for this bill, all of which will improve it significantly. The most significant to our mind is to refer the NBN to the Productivity Commission, and I understand an amendment that will be moved in the committee stage has been or is about to be circulated.
The case for the referral of the NBN to the Productivity Commission has been comprehensively made out, not by us in the coalition, not by the commentators and not by the industry players but by the minister himself through his incapacity to answer any question on the NBN over recent weeks. Indeed, the government itself has clearly lost confidence in the NBN business plan and the minister, and that is why it is now obtaining an independent assessment of the business plan.
Need I remind you that that business plan was prepared by the over 30 or 40—I forget the number now—executives engaged by the NBN Co., all of whom taxpayers are currently funding and who earn between $300,000 and $1.8 million per annum. Those are huge sums of money. These people were charged with developing the business plan which is now being subjected to review by another group of people for sums as yet undisclosed, I think. This cost is once again to be borne by the Australian taxpayer, and the Australian people will not be given that report either.
So, no matter which way we look at the NBN—up, down, in or out—it is a mess; hence, our reluctance to take the minister at face value in relation to his assurances about the NBN. Why should we take his assurances at face value—or at all—when he does not even know what is in his own legislation? The latest news is that the Prime Minister has inserted herself into the discussions with the crossbenchers. I think on balance I welcome that.
In her ministerial capacity, Ms Gillard was responsible for the Building the Education Revolution program, which we now know—courtesy of the leaked caucus minute in which Mr Rudd absolutely nailed Ms Gillard—was one of the great failures of the Rudd Labor government. She was responsible for the announcement at the last election of the cash-for-clunkers scheme. Remember that? We are running away from that one now. Remember the citizens’ assembly on climate change, her initiative? We are running away from that one now. We have a Prime Minister who has a whole host of failures in her previous portfolios and who is the architect of policy failures. With that great CV behind her, she has now inserted herself into this debate to try to assist this hapless minister. I have to say the prime ministerial insertion is to be welcomed, but only marginally.
We still have the unresolved question of who actually commissioned the Greenhill report. We are told that Senator Conroy and Senator Wong are the joint shareholder ministers, but—
—Correct. You still haven’t even asked the right question.
—There we go. There is a churlish, immature interjection by the minister, saying, ‘You haven’t asked the right question,’ which confirms that the minister is deliberately obfuscating, not only to this place but to the Australian people, because anybody who knows anything about joint ventures knows that one party of the joint venture can go away and seek independent advice as to whether to the joint venture is good, bad or indifferent for their particular interests, which may not necessarily marry up with the interests of the joint venture itself.
—You’re too lazy to do your own research.
—The minister interjects, suggesting that we are too lazy to do our own research. What a hide! What a cheek! At least we creased the back of the bill. At least we creased the back of the explanatory memorandum. At least we know that the NBN is referred to in the bill 62 times.
—You’re a genius!
—Senator Lundy quite rightly says that we on this side are geniuses, but if the capacity to read a bill makes you a genius what does it make the minister who has responsibility and carriage of this bill when he goes on national TV and says, ‘The bill does not refer to the NBN,’ when there are 62 separate references to the NBN in the bill? That is why we as a coalition have no faith in this minister. That is why we as a coalition have no faith in the rollout of the NBN as proposed by this minister and by this government. That is why we have no faith in the $43,000 million liability that is about to be foisted on the Australian people and to be administered by this incompetent minister. If this minister knew what was actually in his legislation and the explanatory memorandum, we might have some more faith in him and the government and the proposal. At this stage, we do not.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I want to thank all the senators, including Senator Abetz—
—Special thanks!
—Special thanks—for their contribution to the debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, which is so important to Australia’s current and future economic prosperity.
—Show us the business plan!
—You have been opposing this bill since 12 months before you knew a business plan existed. Do not come in here and pretend you are remotely interested. You have been blocking this bill for 12 months, and now you have found a new excuse in your mind. Those opposite have been opposed to this bill for 12 months. You did not know a business plan existed the first time you opposed it.

Senator Williams interjecting—

—Do not come in here and pretend that your position on this bill has anything to do with the business plan. You have been opposing it for 12 months. You only knew about the business plan two months ago. It is just the latest excuse.
 (Senator Kroger)—Minister, address the chair, please.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I accept your admonishment. The measures put forward in this bill have been the subject of considerable discussion—for over 12 months, in fact. Many of the constructive comments received have led to changes being made to the current legislation to address concerns raised. The competition and consumer safeguards bill is a fundamental and historic micro-economic reform and is in Australia’s long-term national interests. The reforms are designed to reshape regulation in the telecommunications sector in the interests of consumers, business and the economy more broadly. Specifically, the proposed reforms: establish a framework for Telstra to progress its decision to structurally separate, including providing it with greater clarity around the undertaking of the process, which will allow Telstra to seek approval from its shareholders on a firm proposal to migrate its fixed line customers to the NBN; streamline the competition regime to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies; and strengthen consumer safeguards to ensure service standards are maintained at a high level. Importantly, these reforms are supported by the overwhelming majority of the industry.
Implementing these reforms will address longstanding problems with the existing regime, which is failing consumers and businesses across the country and leading to less choice, poor customer service, lower quality services and higher prices for telecommunications services. Accordingly, passage of these reforms is a key priority for this government. Opposition senators have spent much time rallying around the NBN, pursuing their leader’s instructions to try to demolish the National Broadband Network. They fail to acknowledge that this bill is stand-alone legislation almost entirely relating to Telstra and does not go in any way to the role of the National Broadband Network Co. and its commercial structure. Nothing in this bill is relevant other than a deal between NBN Co. and Telstra. That is what this bill is about. Senator Abetz made great play of the fact that he had ‘creased the back’ of it; he should try understanding it rather than flicking the pages. A cost-benefit analysis has nothing to do with this bill. This bill is about reforming the existing regulatory regime, a regime that the entire industry accepts is broken. The matters that relate to the National Broadband Network in this bill are designed to give industry the legislative certainty to make a smooth transition to the NBN environment. They relate to Telstra’s structural separation.
The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 provides a framework for arrangements for the migration of customer services from Telstra’s network to the National Broadband Network, which is the means by which structural separation of Telstra will be achieved. Let me repeat that for those opposite: the CCS bill provides a framework for arrangements for the migration of customer services from Telstra’s network to the National Broadband Network. Accordingly, there are references to the NBN Co. in the context of migration arrangements and the authorisation of the agreements for the purposes of the trade practices law. There are also references to the agreement reached with Telstra for NBN Co. to access Telstra’s facilities, but the bill is not about the operations, the structure or the ongoing processes of the National Broadband Network. It is not about the business case.
Structural reform of the industry will be implemented with the transition to the NBN in line with the government’s vision for a wholesale-only open-access network. Incentives will be created for Telstra and other telecommunications operators to transform the way they do business to become more innovative and customer focused. This bill creates a framework to deliver this important reform, but the bill also does much more than this.
During the National Broadband Network rollout, the existing telecommunications regulatory regime will remain important for delivering better and more affordable services in the interests of Australian consumers and businesses. The bill is designed to reshape that regime. The vast majority of industry submissions received by my department claimed that the regulatory framework is ineffective due to the ability of parties to engage in regulatory gaming—that is, litigious obstruction—aimed at delaying regulatory outcome. That is what has bedevilled this sector. For example, by mid-October 2010, 164 telecommunications access disputes had been notified since the commencement of the regime in 1997. Your regime is in place today, and it has led to 164 disputes. How does that compare to all the other utility sectors? Only four access disputes have been notified in other regulated sectors, so what is going on in the telco sector? Have there been 164 disputes for any of the other regulated utility sectors? Under the proposed changes to part XIC, the ACCC will set price and non-price terms of access for declared services and access determination to apply to all parties.
The bill will also remove the right to seek merits review of the ACCC’s regulatory decisions. This approach is being pursued to stop every regulatory and legal avenue available being used to frustrate regulatory outcomes and cause uncertainty to the industry. The bill’s providing the ACCC with the power to issue binding rules of conduct will allow the ACCC to take action immediately to address problems relating to the supply of declared services.
The overarching objective of the reforms to part XIC is to streamline regulatory processes and provide the industry with a greater degree of certainty in relation to regulatory outcomes. The certainty will encourage infrastructure investment. The reforms to part XIB will mean that the ACCC will no longer be required to consult with a party before issuing a competition notice. This is aimed at ensuring the ACCC can act swiftly when it believes anticompetitive conduct is occurring in the telecommunications market. The scope of part XIB will also be clarified to ensure that anticompetitive provisions apply to content services supplied by carriers or carriage service providers. This will prevent a dominant provider from using its power in one market to damage a competitor in another. These changes to the telecommunications access regime will underpin greater investments by giving all parties regulatory certainty.
The bill will also protect consumers by providing additional consumer safeguards in relation to specific telecommunications services and practices. In particular, the legislation provides: more stringent rules on Telstra’s supply of basic telephone service at specified standards, including connection and repair periods and reliability requirements; changes to address the decline of telephone companies’ compliance with the customer service guarantee, including introduction of new minimum performance benchmarks; and the ability of the minister to direct the Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop an industry standard where industry codes do not adequately deal with consumer issues.
Senator Birmingham has circulated opposition amendments to the legislation. Firstly, the opposition want to remove the provisions designed to exempt any agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. from the provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act on the grounds that such an agreement might allow anticompetitive outcomes. The opposition are quite deliberately failing to acknowledge the structural reforms to be delivered in the national interest. They also repeatedly make the claim that the agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. will not be subject to ACCC scrutiny, but that is absolutely false.
The CCS bill already includes provision in proposed section 577A for the ACCC to scrutinise and approve the competitive impacts of the agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. This agreement would need to be incorporated into the structural separation undertaking that Telstra lodges with the ACCC. To continue to claim, as Mr Turnbull does, as Senator Birmingham does and as almost all of those opposite do, that the ACCC has been removed from this bill is a falsehood and cannot be allowed to go unchallenged in this chamber. The bill authorises entering into the agreement and associated conduct for the purposes of trade practices law only if the ACCC accepts the undertaking. This removes any need for multiple authorisation inquiries while still ensuring appropriate scrutiny of the arrangements. The bill relies on the authorisation provisions in section 51 of the Competition and Consumer Act, and this is a well-established mechanism which has been used extensively by Australian governments. The ACCC website currently lists 80 separate pieces of Commonwealth, state and territory legislation where section 51 authorisations are in use.
Secondly, the opposition propose that certain ministerial instruments be subject to disallowance by parliament. The government’s strong view is that these instruments should not be disallowable because of the risk that disallowance would cause uncertainty for Telstra shareholders in their consideration of the Telstra-NBN Co. deal. The bill requires that certain instruments be in place to permit Telstra to lodge its SSU with the ACCC. Disallowance would threaten this outcome and could have the perverse effect of forcing Telstra to undertake functional separation even when its preferred option is structural separation.
Thirdly, the opposition call for the removal of the so-called ‘guns to Telstra’s head’ that deny it wireless spectrum and force it to divest itself of its interests in Foxtel unless it voluntarily agrees to separate. The so-called ‘guns to Telstra’s head’ have been removed. There is no longer an automatic prohibition on the acquisition of spectrum if Telstra does not structurally separate and divest itself of its interests in its cable network and Foxtel. The bill has been amended to give Telstra sufficient regulatory certainty to take to its shareholders a firm proposal to structurally separate by allowing Telstra to acquire specified bands of spectrum unless the minister determines otherwise in a legislative instrument. The bill does not require Telstra to divest itself of its interests in Foxtel but still provides a framework for Telstra to voluntarily divest itself of its interests in Foxtel and its hybrid fibre-coaxial cable network. In the event that Telstra did not proceed with structural separation, the minister could take into account Telstra’s ownership of Foxtel and its cable network in determining whether to use the powers in the bill to prevent Telstra from acquiring certain spectrum and in addressing Telstra’s powers in telecommunications markets.
Fourthly, the opposition want to subject ACCC decisions to merits review. This is despite the fact that in 2002, when they were in government, they repealed merits review for ACCC arbitration determinations because it was hindering the development of competition. It is the government’s view that the notional accountability benefits of merits review within the current system are strongly outweighed by the delays, regulatory uncertainty and outright gaming that have occurred.
Furthermore, it is an inappropriate provision. Under paragraph 4.53 of the Administrative Review Council guidelines about what kinds of administrative decisions are suitable for merits review, decisions which involve extensive public inquiries or consultations are not suitable for merits review. The ACCC access determinations, which involve extensive public consultations, fall into this category. Omitting merits review from the proposed arrangements reflects the majority of industry submissions on how best to improve the telecommunications access regime. This aspect was almost universally welcomed by non-Telstra industry participants when the original bill was introduced last year. If the ACCC makes an error of law or process when it makes an access determination, any party affected by the decision will be able to apply to the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision, just as they can now.
Finally, the opposition want to restore the requirement for procedural fairness. The requirement for the ACCC to accord procedural fairness will apply to all of the ACCC’s regulatory decisions under part XIC, except in relation to interim access determinations and binding rules of conduct. The salient point of introducing binding rules of conduct is to allow swift regulatory responses to urgent matters that may arise. According procedural fairness would inevitably delay such actions—hardly a desirable outcome in matters where speed is of the essence. In reality, procedural fairness will not be absent for long in this circumstance. Within 30 days of making a binding rule of conduct, the ACCC will have to commence a public inquiry to vary the access determination to make a new access determination. Parties will be accorded procedural fairness in the public inquiry process. The opposition amendments are unnecessary and would serve only to complicate the proposed streamlining of the regulatory framework. I welcome Senator Ludlam’s indication of support for early passage of the bill.
The telecommunications industry states that it needs these reforms. The Chief Executive Officer of Telstra, David Thodey, has indicated his support for this bill:
On balance, we support the passage of the bill. We believe the interests of Telstra shareholders would be best served by the bill being passed this year so that a definitive agreement on our involvement in the NBN can be reached quickly.
In an example of unprecedented unity, seven telecommunications companies, the Australian Telecommunications Users Group and the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network—the peak body representing consumers—said in a joint letter to all senators on 18 February this year:
Australian consumers deserve and need these reforms, none more so than those in regional Australia.
The Australian telecommunications industry has been bedevilled by a failed market structure and poor competition, resulting in prices that are high by international standards. The bill represents a comprehensive and coherent set of measures to improve competition and consumer protections, and the failure of this legislation will be detrimental to the needs of all Australians.
So there it is—the choice is clear. You can have a bunch of wreckers who want to destroy the NBN because they believe it is their path to destroying the government—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—You have been opposing this bill for 12 months, before you knew the business plan existed. (Time expired)

Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I rise to speak today on my fundamental reasons for why I cannot support euthanasia. Today in the South Australian parliament there is legislation being presented and in my home state if Tasmania it was a little over 12 months ago that there were attempts to legislate there. We know that in recent times there has been a bill come before this place.
This is a very complex issue. It is complicated by a range of interpretations of what is meant by euthanasia; confusing inconsistent laws, which collectively do not provide a conclusion; Australia’s Constitution and the different relationships between states and territories and the Commonwealth; the need for appropriate palliative services to support dying people and their families in their homes, in hospices and even in hospitals; and strongly held beliefs and values of people who support or oppose euthanasia. To me the latter is the key issue in determining how I will vote on this issue. Those values and beliefs are what should define our laws—it should not be the reverse.
To clarify what I am talking about, I suggest that there are a range of issues for consideration: The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission states:
involuntary euthanasia refers to the termination of life against the will of the person killed;
non-voluntary euthanasia refers to the termination of life without the consent or opposition of the person killed;
voluntary euthanasia refers to the termination of life at the request of the person being killed;
active euthanasia refers to a positive contribution to the acceleration of death;
passive euthanasia refers to the omission of steps which might otherwise sustain life.
The two issues which are important are that there is an active request of the person to be killed and that there is active intervention to accelerate that death. The first sentence of article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:
Every human being has the inherent right to life.
I will move on to what I consider the fundamental issue in this debate. On any bill it will be a conscious decision and I believe in what was said at the American Catholic Bishops Conference:
As Catholic leaders and moral teachers, we believe that life is the most basic gift of a loving God—a gift over which we have stewardship but not absolute dominion. Our tradition, declaring a moral obligation to care for our own life and health and to seek such care from others, recognizes that we are not morally obligated to use all available medical procedures in every set of circumstances. But that tradition clearly and strongly affirms that as a responsible steward of life one must never directly intend to cause one’s own death, or the death of an innocent victim, by action or omission ...
We call on Catholics, and on all persons of good will, to reject proposals to legalize euthanasia.
These are not my words but they are ones that I clearly agree with and support. While these are only a few words, to me these words are the essence of the debate—life is sacred and we should not be actively aiming to end any life. I cannot emphasis this enough. To me this is the core of the issue.
The people who would support euthanasia tend to rely upon three common themes: the avoidance of suffering, the right to die and that voluntary euthanasia will not slip into involuntary euthanasia. Laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are in place to prevent abuse and to protect people from unscrupulous doctors and others. They are not and never have been intended to make anyone suffer. I am reliably advised that nearly all pain can be eliminated and in the rare cases where it can not be eliminated, it can be substantially reduced. This is an area that all governments at a state and a Commonwealth level should be looking at to ensure that the best medicine to reduce pain is available in this country. Adequate pain control should be available to all people. Killing them is not the answer.
The issues associated with dying are much broader than just controlling pain. Care is not just about symptom management but must include counselling, social support, and pastoral care for the dying person and their carers and supporters. A recent article in the Australian newspaper by Margaret O’Connor, President of Palliative Care Australia stated:
In the palliative care settings of hospital, hospice and home the request for assisted suicide is rare.
Palliative care needs to be available to people in their own homes, in hospices and in hospitals, day and night as the need may be and to be provided by a range of health care professionals to cater for all of the needs of the dying and their families. I have spoken in this place before about the importance of palliative care. A palliative care guide states:
Under palliative care, doctors, nurses and other health professionals treat the symptoms and ease the pain of the terminally ill, making them more comfortable and helping them lead a dignified life until death. The goal is not to ‘cure’ the patient, but it’s also not to expressly hasten that person’s death. Dying is a normal part of life.
So, until there are adequate services to support all people who are dying, why are we even considering this option? Until that is the case, how can we know if there is truly a problem? I have no doubt this is the direction that a caring society should head. Admittedly, in a recent study released in the Economist magazine of the palliative care services in 40 countries, palliative care services in Australia rated highly. However, we are not immune from the effects that euthanasia would have on palliative care services.
There is another concern: the risk to the disadvantaged. I spoke last week in this place about elder abuse and how elder abuse can include involuntary euthanasia and the threat to our disadvantaged. We need to recognise that euthanasia is likely to be practised with the same social inequity and prejudice that affects the delivery of services throughout our society, including health care. Those who are most vulnerable—the poor, minorities, the less educated and the less empowered—will continue their disadvantage. This is not to say that doctors are more prejudiced or influenced by race, class et cetera—only that they are not exempt from these either.
There is no right to die. Suicide, while a very unfortunate event, is not illegal, but that is not what is being asked for. What is being asked for is that another person be involved in killing the person making that request and that there be no repercussions for the assisting person. Assisted suicide is a halfway house and a stop on the way to other forms of direct euthanasia—for example, for incompetent patients by advance directives or suicide in the elderly. So too is voluntary euthanasia a halfway house to involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia. If terminating life is a benefit, the reasoning goes, why should euthanasia be limited only to those who can give consent? Why then would we need to ask for consent?
I could talk about a whole range of issues about euthanasia and my own personal experiences with my mother a little over two years ago. She has cancer. She was already in very ill health, and she was confronted with having to have emergency surgery. The first doctor suggested to the family that it was not worthwhile and her chances were very slim. We sought a second opinion, and we were very fortunate, because the second doctor said, ‘If your mother wants to try then I think the hospital should perform the surgery.’ Of course, as a family we were most grateful for that, because we have been fortunate enough to have our mother with us for a further two years. My concern is: with the constant pressure on our health system into the future, if we had voluntary euthanasia, would my mother and our family have been given that opportunity to even attempt the emergency surgery? My mother was 82 at the time and, as I said, in ill health. Now, of course, she is bedridden and is undertaking palliative care. Yes, she is in extreme pain, but she is having palliative care. I believe that she is getting the best possible care available, and we are most grateful to those people who are caring for her. So, when people criticise me for my belief in not supporting voluntary euthanasia, I am not just speaking for my constituency back in Tasmania or for the people who send me the hundreds of emails I get on a weekly basis from around the country; I am talking about firsthand experience with the dilemma that our health system can sometimes confront us with.
You only need to look at two examples cited by Alex Schadenberg, the Executive Director of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition Canada and chair of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition International, who recently visited Tasmania to brief Tasmanian MPs and other interested parties. The most recent report from the government of the Netherlands indicated that in the five years between 2000 and 2005 there were 550 people euthanased without consent or request. When you have a poorly developed palliative care system, it is not surprising that Dutch doctors have been reported as saying, ‘Why should I worry about palliative care when I have euthanasia?’ Another study, published on 17 May 2010 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, stated that 32 per cent of all euthanasia deaths in the Flanders region in Belgium are ‘without request or consent’.
There has been significant pressure on healthcare providers to contain costs. In my home state of Tasmania, the Minister for Health recently announced a reduction in funding for palliative care services in the north of the state. At the same time the Attorney General has foreshadowed, along with her Greens ministerial colleague, the introduction yet again of euthanasia legislation. A coincidence? I do not think that is how people necessarily all see it in Tasmania.
However, much more worrying is the recent Standard and Poor’s report Global aging 2010: an irreversible truth, reported in the Launceston Examiner on 13 October this year. I quote:
Age-related spending on health, pensions, and aged care is estimated to rise to 14.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050 … Without further reforms to address these mounting spending pressures, net general Government debt could increase to 71 per cent of GDP over the period …
The article goes on to say:
The global report forecast that Government debt associated with age-related spending could reach … 300 per cent of GDP in … 40 years in advanced economies if fresh measures were not introduced to address the issue.
Meanwhile we have many in the health professions concerned about the ethical implications for their practice and effects on the doctor-patient relationship.
Before I conclude, I would like to summarise. I cannot support the introduction of euthanasia, as I outlined from the very beginning. It is inherently wrong, and this is inescapable. The legislation—any legislation—cannot protect individuals. You cannot prevent the legal slippage, and despite the very clear warnings there is already evidence of this occurring. Combine this with the fears concerning future health funding and the many other practical issues. Finally, I say to those in the chamber and those that are listening to this broadcast that those of us who do not support euthanasia do understand what pain is about and that people want to ensure that their family members are well cared for and without pain. But I truly do not believe that assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia is the way forward. Life is very precious. I am somebody who can speak from practical personal experience. When you have the opportunity to choose between life and death, it is a very natural thing to choose life, and we should do all we can to instil that value in our society.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Euthanasia</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-11-24,"—My question is to Senator Evans, representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the election of the Labor government three years ago on promises to deliver conservative economic management, cheaper petrol and groceries, stronger border protection, a National Broadband Network that would cost only $4.6 billion, a referendum to take over public hospitals, a million computers in schools, 36 GP superclinics, 2,650 trade training centres—one in every secondary school—and 260 childcare centres.

When Mr Rudd met his unfortunate demise at the hands of Ms Gillard, she promised that her top priorities were to fix the mining tax, provide strong management of the nation’s borders and find a way forward on climate change. Does the minister admit that not one of these matters has been fixed since Ms Gillard became Prime Minister?

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-11-24,"—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to the minutes of the special caucus meeting called to depose Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd said the reason for Labor contemplating a leadership change was that ‘many people here are frightened’. Does the leaking of these minutes, together with Mr Swan’s questioning of Labor’s adoption of the fringe issues of the far Left, indicate that many in the government are still frightened that the government is lost?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Labor Government</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-11-24,"—Thank you very much for the question, Senator Abetz—it saves my side asking it later on, so I appreciate it very much. The government stands very proud of its record in providing leadership to the Australian people in the core function of a government, which is to provide security and economic prosperity for its people. On both fronts, the government has achieved those objectives. We came to office with an ambitious agenda and we are delivering on that agenda.
—Very ambitious—none of it is being delivered!
—Senator, we are ambitious for Australia. We do have high aspirations for Australia, and, after 12 years of do-nothing, achieve-nothing government, we actually think there is a need for reform, both in our economy and in our society. We have set about delivering on that agenda, but it is also true that the major challenge this government has faced is the onset of the global financial crisis. That is what has taken up the vast majority of the government’s efforts over the last couple of years. The most important thing Australians needed was strong economic leadership. They needed protection from the worst impacts of the global financial crisis. We delivered the leadership the country needed. We delivered the stimulus and other responses that allowed us to come out of the recession and the global financial crisis in better shape than virtually any other economy in the world. The Australian people understand that that was one of our core requirements, and we delivered in spades. We protected Australian jobs and kept Australians working, which I think was a great achievement. We also ensured that the economy would now be growing at a very healthy rate with relatively low unemployment. Those are important deliverables that the government is very proud of. (Time expired)

The government is methodically working through its agenda to deliver to the Australian people the commitments that we made.

The reason the Australian people supported this government is that they do not want to return to the far Right politics that seek to undermine the wages and conditions of ordinary people in this country. That is where we get the ideological obsession of the Liberal Party. Australians were frightened because they did not want to see a return to those harsh, extreme laws that the opposition supported. The opposition may want to run away from it now, but the Australian people understand that the moderates of the Liberal Party have long since been banished and the extremists continue to argue for policies that are totally unacceptable to the vast majority of Australians.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-11-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) today relating to election commitments of the Gillard Government.
Isn’t it interesting: here we are down the track and it is the anniversary of having a Labor Party government, and what an absolutely roaring success the Labor Party government have been!
Let’s start with the war on obesity—and we could have a quick look around to see where Senator Carr has gone. Was the war on obesity a win, a draw or a loss? What is happening to the war on obesity? How are they going with the fat people? I was a bit worried that they were going to catch up with me for a while! What is happening with the war on obesity? What about the war on homelessness—the poor old people out in the parks? Was that a win; was that a draw? How did we go with the war on homelessness?
Of course, we also had GroceryWatch. What a roaring success GroceryWatch was! We were going to ‘ease the squeeze’. What a farce! Now we have one of the highest food inflation rates in the Western world. I could go on all day. There was the war on obesity and the war on homelessness. There was the war on executive salaries. That one was a big win. That was a real success. There was the war on inflation and the war on capitalism. Of course, when those bellicose people are finished with wars, they have to start a few revolutions.

Senator Cash interjecting—

—I will get to Kevin Rudd in a second. First of all, we had the education revolution. Remember the toolbox for the 21st century? In the end, only half the kids got it at twice the price and 30 per cent missed out. That was like the first and second Punic War. Then we had the Building the Education Revolution—another revolution. How did that revolution go? Even Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, leaked to the press that it was a complete and utter disaster. These jokers are running the country! If you have had wars and you have had revolutions, there is only one thing left: an assassination—and we got one of those, too. We do not know whether it was the real Julia or the pretend Julia, but Mr Mark Arbib definitely had a lot to do with it. We had the assassination when, of course, they knocked off—
—Order! Senator Joyce, it is about time you started referring to people by their proper titles.
—Senator Arbib was definitely behind that one. He admits to it. Paul Howes, the man who writes books about himself—
—The manless face!
—Yes, the manless face! Paul Howes is the only man I know who has written more books than he has read. Of course, the people opposite therefore decided to change their leadership.
We must go to their managerial critique. The ceiling insulation program was a roaring success! All they had to do was get fluffy stuff into the ceilings for the rats and mice to urinate on, and they could not even do that without setting fire to 190 houses and resulting, tragically, in the deaths of four people, which is serious.
There were the $900 cheques. Of course, this was how they were going to reboot the global economy with the purchase of flat screens. That was another absolute stroke of genius. Then they claimed responsibility for saving us from the financial crisis. I thought it was demand from China—I really did. I thought it was the sale of iron ore at record prices, the sale of coal at record prices, the fact that during that period our dollar had depreciated by 30 per cent, the fact that real interest rates during that period had gone down, the fact that the 31 March shipping figures showed we had record export of wheat. But, no, it was not that; it was the $900 cheques, used in poker machines, put in bank accounts, used to buy electronic goods, used to go on holidays to New Zealand. Of course, we rebooted the global economy from South Korea. That is how it was supposed to have worked. That is how the $900 cheques worked.
Then we had the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—the greatest moral challenge of our time. They were going to cool the planet from a room in Canberra. Of course they could do it! Penny Wong was behind it. She was so driven by this that, when the greatest moral challenge—
—Order! You must refer to people by their proper titles.
—Senator Wong was so driven by the greatest moral challenge of our time that, when the challenge got a bit too challenging, she left and became the minister for finance. People like this are running the country. We got all that and we are currently $172.8 billion in gross debt. Our debt last week went up by $2.8 billion. In one week our debt has gone up by more than the government’s projected surplus in—whatever it is—2013. They managed to put more on the credit card in one week than they project the surplus will be in two or three years time. These people are running the country. They are running it into the ground. It is an absolute disaster. The Australian people will wake up to it, because now they want to build a telephone company. It is Pythonesque! (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I think that contribution from Senator Joyce just demonstrates the coalition’s contempt for the Senate and its contempt for the Australian people. I do not know whether it is the fact that it is getting close to Christmas, but Senator Joyce came in here and did what can only be described as a Christmas comedy special. I suggest he ought to stick to talking about some serious policy issues, not come in with a silly little rant, trying to make fun of people, with no serious substance to be found in any of the debate. There was confected laughter and confected humour. I am not sure about the point he was trying to make, but he demonstrated to everybody who was listening to or watching that pathetic performance that he should not be taken seriously. Everybody on that side of the chamber—

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—You will notice that he has not even stopped as he is walking out of the chamber. He is still doing his little comedy special. It demonstrates to everybody in this place and everybody who was listening—and I hope they were watching—why he should not be taken seriously in this place, and he represents the coalition! He is a senior member of their team and he comes in here and makes such a childish and pathetic contribution. There was no serious debate. Mr Deputy President, you might have cut him some slack if he came in here and said, ‘Look, it’s the second last day of sittings. It has been a long and hard year. Everyone is tired. I’m just going to make a five-minute contribution which is a bit of a joke.’ We could have sat back and had a bit of a laugh. But he did not do that; he actually attempted to put himself forward as a serious contributor to the policy debate in this country, and he has simply failed, as he has failed every other time. He has been sacked several times. He is a joke. His own party could not even tolerate him when he was the finance spokesman.
—Nonsense.
—Oh, I see! So he wasn’t sacked? He was not sacked! I think Senator Joyce actually went on the public record saying how disappointed he was. I think Senator Macdonald has gone on the public record saying some things about that time and how he worked very hard to ensure that you were sacked and replaced, Senator Joyce. But I am not surprised—I think it was a sensible and good decision—because, really, with that clown running around trying to represent—
—Order! Be very careful about what you are saying, Senator Marshall.
—Yes, I am very careful. But they are words that were thrown around just yesterday. With Senator Joyce running around—

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—I am trying to tell you something you do not know, Senator Joyce, and that is that you should take a very serious look at yourself and, if you are going to engage in serious policy debate in this place, you ought to treat this place with the respect it deserves and not laugh at the Australian people the way you have been. They are not as stupid as you just made out and as you treated them in that pathetic contribution—and pathetic it was. I am not surprised you are now finally walking out of the chamber. You should have walked out of the chamber before you even started to make that contribution, because it is really—
—Order! Senator Marshall, you will address your remarks through the chair.
—Yes. I was just saying that Senator Joyce should have left the chamber before he even got up to make that contribution, because all he did was demonstrate that the people over on that side are devoid of any real policy position. He demonstrated the poverty of their position in every aspect of that. And I could see that some of them were embarrassed; they had their heads down. Senator Abetz, as normal, tries to do his bit with his confected laughter—
—You have not said one word in defence of your own government.
—I am responding, Senator Fifield, to the pathetic contribution of Senator Joyce, who made no contribution at all. I am responding to him. Apart from pointing out the poverty of his policy position—something that you obviously share and something that all of you over there share—it is a little bit difficult because there is no serious contribution to any debate. You simply get up there and do the Christmas comedy special, and I guess, in many respects, if you are going to do such a thing, Senator Joyce is a perfect candidate for it. So I am not surprised the tactics team led by Senator Abetz actually chose Senator Joyce to make that comedy contribution.
—Look, I’ll take credit for it, but it’s not led by me.
—Okay, then. Senator Abetz, thank you for acknowledging that you will take credit for it! I am not sure who leads it. Maybe Senator Joyce is actually on your tactics committee—no, no, that would be too scary to think about.
—Senator Conroy’s on ours!
—So we will not do that. We are in fact very proud of our record over the last three years.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-11-24,"—As it is the third anniversary of the election of the Labor government, I think we are all entitled to get a little nostalgic as we look back. Mr Deputy President, I am sure that you would remember the member for Kingsford Smith’s first major contribution to public life. You might be thinking I am talking about the Home Insulation Program—although that was a significant contribution of his!—but I am actually referring to a conversation before the 2007 election that Mr Garrett had with radio journalist Steve Price in an airport lounge. When Mr Garrett was asked how Labor would do all this that it had promised, he replied, ‘When we get in, we’ll just change it all.’ And Mr Garrett was a prophet: Labor did change it all, and they had good reasons for each of their decisions. There were really three reasons for each policy area: basic failure of policy and administrative competence, lack of political will or just good old-fashioned deceit.
Incompetence is actually the biggest category. With the school halls, there was billions wasted; roof insulation, four deaths, 207 fires and 250,000 dodgy jobs; border security, almost 10,000 illegal arrivals and 190 boats; computers in schools, a million promised and less than half delivered; Indigenous housing, hopelessly delayed; trade training centres program, with 2,650 promised, delayed; GP superclinics, 36 promised and four delivered; and the Green Loans scheme a debacle, with $275 million wasted.
Then there is the category of old-fashioned deceit, both the intention to never deliver and the lack of compunction about breaking commitments. There was the commitment to childcare expansion, with 260 centres promised, and staff, but 38 delivered. Then there was Fuelwatch, dumped—Labor knew they could not fix the petrol price; that was a fib. GroceryWatch, with $7 million wasted and 30 staff employed, was abandoned—another policy hoax. They said they would not means-test the baby bonus; they have done it. They said they would not means-test private health insurance rebates; they have tried to do it. Then there is the most laughable one of all, the new era of transparency: Operation Sunlight. Yet, when it comes to a $43 billion program, the NBN Co., is there a cost-benefit analysis? No. What about releasing the business case? No. There is no transparency, no ‘new paradigm’, just politics as usual.
For me the most condemning category for Labor is the absence of political will, or what is better known as good old-fashioned gutlessness. The ETS, the answer to the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’, was dumped. Labor have a working majority in the other place and, after the middle of next year, with the Greens they will have a majority. Why don’t they bring the ETS back? Bring it on. They cannot blame this side of the chamber anymore. They are without excuse for what they truly believe in.
There is also the matter of fiscal discipline. You will recall the former Prime Minister saying that he was often called a fiscal conservative. In fact, he said:
… it’s a badge I wear with pride.
This government has never delivered a surplus and it never will. With this government, there is no fiscal discipline, there are no tough decisions. Of all the savings the government have identified, half of them result from new taxes—increased revenue. Even when their profligacy is putting upward pressure on interest rates, they still cannot take a tough decision.
On the front page of the Australian today we see Wayne Swan saying that actually there is a path they are following: ‘ALP must steer clear of Greens, says Swan’. I would say to Mr Swan: it’s a bit late, sunshine; you have already had the civil ceremony. We all saw it. I am not being critical of the Greens. They could see a sucker coming and they took full advantage of it.
This government’s support is ebbing away. At the heart of this government is fear. We saw from the minutes of the last caucus meeting with Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister that what is driving the Labor government is fear of losing seats. There is no concern about bad policy or about betraying the Australian people. This government has not lost its way; it never found it. The government stands for nothing and believes in nothing.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I rise today to take note of the answers to questions, particularly those relating to the economic performance of the government. One would be challenged, I suppose, in considering the contributions to this debate this afternoon, to understand that, despite the rewriting of history that we have heard today in the chamber, three years of the Labor government has actually delivered some extraordinary reforms and some extraordinary outcomes. Senator Wong, addressing some of those issues today, made the point that, regardless of the challenges that we have in explaining and understanding the implications of surviving the GFC, that is what Australia did. Australia survived the GFC because of the work and the decisions of the Australian government to keep our economy strong and to protect jobs when, around the world, hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs in the global recession. We even understand that we could have been looking at something like 200,000 Australians losing their jobs. That would have had a massive impact on our economy and on our society.
The work that we did in preventing that crisis from happening included the introduction of the bank guarantees and the introduction of the stimulus program, which created 50,000 projects around Australia—500 libraries, 400 halls, 360 classrooms in schools and 10,000 families being supported through the solar hot water rebate system. Think about what else we have done over the three years. We have avoided recession and we have lower debt and a lower deficit than any of the other major advanced economies. We have an unemployment rate that is the envy of the world—5.4 per cent at the moment. That unemployment rate is significantly lower than in most countries; in fact it is lower than all but one of the major advanced economies. We have created more than 375,000 jobs this year, and there are 650 more Australians in work today than when we took office three years ago, despite the impact of the GFC.
What else have we been doing? We recognised the cost-of-living pressures. A question about that was asked of the government today. We have reduced income taxes in the last three years. Significantly, someone on $30,000 a year now pays $750 less tax than in 2007-08, and someone on $50,000 pays $1,750 less tax than in 2007-08. We have lifted the low income tax offset to $1,500. We have provided an education tax refund for parents supporting kids getting back to school. For laptops, school textbooks and uniforms, eligible families can claim almost $400 to help support their children in primary school and almost $800 for each child in secondary school.
We have introduced First Home Saver Accounts and First Home Owner Boosts. We have looked at unfair mortgage exit fees and reinvestment in RMBSs to support competition. We have raised the childcare rebate. We have become the dominant funder in the health system. We have reformed the pension system. Those were significant reforms, increasing the pension by around $115 a fortnight for single pensioners and around $97 a fortnight for pension couples. We committed to returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and we are on track to do so.
These are the things that, as a Labor government, we have delivered. We have stayed true to our commitment to the Australian people. We have ensured that we will commit to a fair go and a fair sense of opportunity for all. In doing so, we will ensure that the legacy of our Labor government is a stronger economy, a stronger Australia, a stronger society, a more inclusive community and a sense that those who are really struggling on the edge are going to be supported and be given a leg up. Our social inclusion strategy is a very powerful approach that ensures that everyone in Australia has the chance and the choice to have a job, to learn, to work, to engage and to have their voice heard.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-11-24,"—This week marks three years in office for Labor. Those in government usually take the opportunities available to them in all the different forums of the Senate to mark the occasion, but we have seen nothing of the sort from Labor. In fact, they seem to be avoiding the occasion. Only the previous speaker, who laboriously read from a script, has made any attempt to mark what Labor have done in the past three years. The government are so deep in the mire of their problems that they really do not want to know about their three years in government. They are not in the mood to celebrate, self-reflect or even offer some gratitude for the time they have had in government. It is a great privilege to be in government; it is the golden era of any parliamentarian, and they ought to treat it like that. Instead, they come in here with long faces. They are unhappy. The government is fracturing. We notice it from this side of the chamber.
I have taken the trouble to do a report card for the Labor government’s three years. Firstly, in their first three years they have had two prime ministers. If you liked Kevin Rudd you will certainly love Julia Gillard.
—Order! Refer to the Prime Minister by her proper title.
—Prime Minister Gillard and—
—Are you really being honest, Julian? Is this your report card?
—I get you all the time, don’t I, Senator Collins? You must watch me on television and come in here. And you are good at it. But that is about all you are good at; you are a top interjector. As Doug Cameron subsides, you are starting to rise. You are all good interjectors over there, but you are not good debaters. Nor are you very good defenders of your own government after three years. Let me go through the report card and you can interject during it, Senator Collins. Firstly, in the three years, incredibly—historically!—you have had two prime ministers. That situation was born out of failure and division.
Secondly, according to that respected elder and great historian of the Labor Party, Senator Faulkner, you are a government with no courage. He said you have ‘more cunning than courage’ in leadership. Those were his words. According to the former Labor senator and respected powerbroker Senator Richardson, or Richo, you are a government with no agenda,. Senator Carr has just walked in. When I mention Senator Richardson, he should shudder. Didn’t Richo do him over a few times? Senator Richardson said you are a government with no agenda.
You have had two Prime Ministers, you have no courage, you have no agenda and, to top it off, according to Senator Cameron you have no brains. He said that you are all ‘zombies’. He says you are a government with no brains. The ‘respected’ Senator Cameron—for the sake of argument, I will use that word—said:
They—
meaning all of you on that side—
… are stifled in the caucus, they are stifled in the public … and so people see the Labor Party having no values and no vision on a whole range of issues and I think that must change …
It seems to be like having a political lobotomy.
That is his report card on you all after three years in government. You are a government with no trust—the Australian people told you that at the last election. You are the first government since Federation to lose its majority—the last one was in 1929. You will go down in the record books for that. The Australian people sent you that message because they did not trust you. You had hyped up all the things you were going to do in your first three years and you did not deliver. You are a government with no competence. In the three years of Labor, you have squandered the surplus and turned it into debt. You spent it on pink batts, Julia Gillard memorial halls and, worst of all, the $35 billion broadband network. You are a government with absolutely no ideas or direction. When you first came into government you set up some 80 reviews, and the new Prime Minister has done no better. She set up climate change committees and she has continued with those reviews. You have no direction. You are a government which, under the old Prime Minister and the new Prime Minister, has just wasted taxpayers’ money. Lastly, you have no control, because the Greens have the control. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Corporations Amendment (Sons of Gwalia) Bill 2010
Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010.
I table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—

CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (SONS OF GWALIA) BILL 2010


Purpose of the Bill

The Bill gives effect to a decision of the Government announced by the Hon Chris Bowen MP, then Minister for Human Services; Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law on 19 January 2010 to reverse the effect of the decision of the High Court in Sons of Gwalia v Margaretic (2007) 231 CLR 160.
The Bill provides that compensation claims for corporate misconduct made by shareholders against companies rank equally with other shareholder claims.
The Bill also addresses the ability of subordinated shareholder claimants to vote and receive reports to creditors, irrespective of whether they have a financial interest in the insolvency administration. It also removes a restriction on some shareholders bringing compensation claims against companies.
The Bill also provides that subordinated shareholder claimants are bound by court approved compromises or arrangements entered into under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act) even if they do not have the opportunity to vote at the creditors meeting ordered by the Court
The measures have been subject to stakeholder consultation and in some areas the Bill has been modified to take account of issues raised in consultations.

Reasons for urgency

The reforms introduced by this Bill will lead to: better outcomes for shareholders and creditors, reduced cost and increased availability of credit and increased efficiency of external administration.
Delays in the passage of reforms have the potential have a significant financial impact upon company stakeholders. The Bill will not apply to compensation claims that might arise prior to commencement of the amendments.
Legislation to reverse the effect of the High Court’s decision has been keenly awaited by stakeholders.

FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010


Purpose of the Bill

The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 will:
Simplify the financial management framework and streamline internal Australian Government administration;
Repeal unused special appropriations and Special Accounts; and
Update, clarify and align other financial management, governance and reporting provisions.

Reasons for Urgency

The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 would update the financial governance arrangements of the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Australian Institute of Criminology, the Criminology Research Council and the National Transport Commission. Passage of the legislation in the current session will provide the necessary certainty for the bodies to commence preparing their internal governance, operational, financial reporting systems ahead of their transfer date, scheduled for 1 July 2011.
It will also facilitate early preparation of regulations and delegations under the Bill that would streamline government administrative processes and reduce red tape.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,6,1,speech

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-24,"—On the third anniversary of Labor coming to power, it is timely that we talk about mental health, because it has been one of the biggest failures of this government. There were two areas—mental health and ageing—in the Labor government’s grand hospital plans that were grossly neglected and omitted. I will comment on ageing at another time, but today’s matter of public importance is mental health.
I am pleased that the Senate is considering this today, because we are on the eve of a vote in the House tomorrow on an important motion on mental health. Here in the Senate we saw my motion on the subject of mental health passed on 26 October, and I am very pleased that that motion was supported by Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding, both of whom I thank. Sadly, both Labor and the Greens opposed that motion despite their bleating about the need to take action on mental health.
Last week in Canberra the Australian of the Year, Professor Pat McGorry, told members and senators that the coalition’s motion on mental health should be supported. As I said, a vote on a motion on mental health is coming up tomorrow in the House and, despite Labor’s having voted against putting it to a vote last week and the Speaker’s having exercised his casting vote in favour of Labor, it is vitally important that that motion be passed tomorrow. This government must be counting the days until the game is changed so that there is an Australian of the Year who causes them less pain and puts them under less scrutiny.
I wish to pay tribute to Professor McGorry. He has been an outstanding Australian of the Year. He has brought attention to an issue that affects so many Australians and he has used his time to push this very important barrow, a barrow that can save our economy many millions of dollars in treating mental health before it grips a person into a lifelong spiral.
It is a false economy not to fund mental health properly as we will all pay through the cost of suicide and other mental health issues. Six Australians die from suicide every day. Costs related to mental health issues include the costs of policing, emergency hospital admissions, road accidents, unemployment, family dysfunction and other sad outcomes of mental health. As Professor Mendoza, the former chair of the government’s own National Advisory Council on Mental Health—who resigned so spectacularly in disgust at this government’s lack of action on mental health—said last week:
It is a moral imperative that we actually make the investment in mental health services and that there is parity in terms of access to care, to quality of care that people can expect if they have a mental health condition as we would all expect when we have a common physical health disorder.
At the moment those who have mental health problems really are getting a second- or third-rate health system. He continues that as a society—and I quote:
We would not tolerate young men having treatment rates of 13 per cent for testicular cancer ... yet that’s the rate of care for young men 16 to 24 in Australia for mental health problems.
This government has been well-informed—more informed than any other—about the state of mental health services in Australia. Since its election in 2007, major mental health reforms have been identified through inquiries and commissions. On 25 February 2008, we had the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission; in its final report it contained 12 recommendations for reforming mental health. In September 2008, we had the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs; its report, Towards recovery: mental health services in Australia, contained 26 recommendations. On 24 June this year, we had the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, titled Hidden toll: suicide in Australia. In November 2009, the National Advisory Council on Mental Health released a discussion paper titled A mentally healthy future for all Australians, containing seven priority areas with 22 program investments. So this government has been well informed.
What are we now seeing? Despite all this, this government is being true to form. After all the work that was done by the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission, the government had to go out and do its own further investigations. That is when we saw Dr Rudd and Nurse Roxon out in the hospitals with the white coats and the picture opportunities that could be then put on MyHealth and MyHospital websites.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: can you remind the senator that she should use the correct titles of members in the other house.
 (Senator Marshall)—Thank you, Senator Brown. That is quite correct, and I ask you, Senator Fierravanti-Wells to refer to members with proper respect.
—Despite all this information, despite all these reviews, despite all these recommendations that have been put forward, despite the work that has been done by Professor McGorry, despite the work that has been done by Professor Mendoza, and despite the raft of information that is out there in the public arena calling on this government to act on this vitally important issue for Australians, Minister Butler is going out on his own tour. He is off to capital and regional centres to talk again. For goodness sake, Minister, stop and listen to what has already been said to you. This is just another way that this government fobs things off, just like it fobbed off aged care to the Productivity Commission and has not done anything for three or four years. Now we are seeing another instance of just fobbing things off. The minister is going off to consult again—just for the photo opportunities—and I am sure that we will be seeing the photos on some government website. It is not the lack of information that has paralysed the Rudd-Gillard government; it is the lack of guts to face a major health problem, and this government should be mightily ashamed of this.
What is the extent of this problem? Mental illness affects more Australians than almost all other health disorders; only cancer and heart disease impact more people. Almost half the population will experience a mental health disorder at some point in time. One in five Australians are waiting for this government to get off their backside and do something about mental health. Thirteen per cent of the total burden of disease in Australia is in mental health and only six per cent of the health budget is spent. A staggering 65 per cent of sufferers battle their disorder alone or only with the help of family. There is a prevalence of mental health in our young people. The coalition, with its $1.5 billion policy—which was the subject of a motion passed by this Senate, which hopefully will be passed by the lower house tomorrow—ought to shame this government into doing something about mental health. We all know that delay in accessing appropriate treatment is damaging not only for young people but for people of all ages.
The coalition’s $1.5 billion plan for mental health is a follow-on to the $1.9 billion that was invested in mental health—the biggest ever and the first of its size—when Tony Abbott was minister for health. What did Labor do when they came to power? They have been cutting the budget of some of these programs that were so successful under the coalition. When I speak to mental health experts, whether it is the not-for-profits or the various organisations that operate in this sphere, they are all telling me the same thing. They are constantly complaining that this government is cutting funding to them in this vitally important area.
As I stated, mental health was omitted from the COAG grand plan. One only has to look at the evidence produced at the Senate inquiry that was so scathing about the government’s lack of action on mental health—whether it was the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Professor McGorry, the Mental Health Council of Australia or the Australian College of Mental Health Nurses. As Professor McGorry said, we have a hidden waiting list of Australians needing mental health services, including three-quarters of a million young Australians. They need help and they need it now.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Mental Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-11-24,"—It is important that we have a discussion about mental health in this place. I share the view that we need ongoing discussion and consideration of the very important issue of mental health. I do want to take issue with Senator Fierravanti-Wells, though. To begin her contribution by implying that our government has not given due respect or consideration to the wonderful work of the Australian of the Year, who was appointed this year by this government, was an unnecessary attack, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. When it comes to disagreeing on politics, we absolutely do, but it is wrong to make that kind of implication about a man who has genuine respect. We acknowledge that his role is to keep the issue of mental health on the agenda and keep the debate strong and informed. No-one can question the important role that he has had for over 20 years. This engagement with Professor McGorry has not occurred just in the last year while he has had the title of Australian of the Year. It has been going on for over 20 years and probably longer. Those of us who have been involved in all of the Senate committee activities around mental health know that his work has been absolutely inspirational. The questions he raises and the points he makes are important and necessary in any discussion of public policy. I just thought I would make a quiet comment about that.
It disappoints me that, having had the opportunity to look at the very serious issues around mental health, the opposition has yet again come up with the standing order 75 approach of going for the cheap political shot rather than looking at the facts and building effective arguments. Oh, no, it is a chance for people to vent their spleen and talk about policy failures. In many ways—and I have said it before, Mr Acting Deputy President—it is a case of ‘my policy is bigger than your policy’. That cuts across the importance of these issues. There is no doubt that mental health is an important issue. The government has asserted that and committed to ensuring that, during its second term, it will be the major priority for the government. That is on record.
The largest single contribution in historical terms to the area of mental health was begun in 2006. However, in its response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health and during the following reforms, the then Howard government—with Mr Abbott as the Minister for Health and Ageing—never at any time acknowledged that the Senate committee report into mental health had impacted on the decisions they made. When you see the initiatives that emerged, obviously there was some awareness of the work that had been done for well over 12 months by the committee, which was set up in good faith from all sides of this parliament. It was the first time that mental health was given the priority it should have had.
Towards the end of the then Liberal-National government, they brought forward a mental health package and COAG initiatives which are the basis of mental health policy in Australia to this day. The important element of the 2006 reform was to ensure that the COAG commitment was locked in, because mental health services in this country are shared between the Commonwealth government and state governments. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, when you are talking about the provision of services, you need to lock in the COAG process so that the commitment is met. In this case that commitment was included in a range of areas of public policy and health policy in the 2006 period.
I want to remind people who are concerned about this issue that during the 11 years of the Howard Liberal-National government there was the same community pressure, the same outrage, around issues of mental health. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, regarding Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s arguments about what governments should do and the need to listen and be concerned, if you care to turn to any of the papers that were written during 2006-07 by the Mental Health Council of Australia and the Senate committee, you will see that the same issues were raised. The then government, a government that at that time had had 10 years to consider its policy, had not moved on mental health. We do acknowledge that the 2006 reforms began at that point—it was an important moment for our country. That government had about 12 months to work with it and then the new government came in. We are celebrating that today. This is the third anniversary of the new Labor government.
We hear this feigned outrage, for political purposes, by the opposition about the lack of movement on mental health. Look at the time frame. We need to move and develop effective policy, but to lay all the blame on a Labor government—to suggest it was all the fault of this government for not taking action quickly enough in that period—is just not accurate. It does not mean that there should not be action. We need to act and ensure that we take note of the information we have. Senator Fierravanti-Wells, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: I agree with the fact that there is evidence about the need to act on mental health. No-one denies that. There is real evidence, though, that you must not respond to just one element of a very complex area. This has always been an issue for governments. This is an extraordinarily difficult area of health policy, because mental health affects so many people at every stage of their lives; it involves all kinds of age groups and needs. When you are considering a mental health response, it needs to be coordinated and it needs to address the needs of so many people in the community. At times, there tends to be a form of division or competition that sets up one form of need against others. That is exactly what this government is attempting to avoid.
I was pleased to hear the very strong arguments that were had during this year’s election campaign. Until this year, I had not heard debates around mental health in any election program. I think it is important that these issues are raised and policies are developed. But what we had leading up to the last election and have had subsequently both in this place and in the House of Representatives is an argument about a particular form of investment that should happen in mental health. I think it is good to have the argument, but the expenditure that has been so proudly put forward by the opposition in motions in this place and in the House of Representatives looks at one segment of mental health need and demands that that is funded immediately. That expenditure needs to be looked at within the whole complex need of health expenditure and policy.
What this government does not want is further debate and conflict about whose need is greatest. The way the political argument has been run has been that if we cut money from a number of areas, the money could be directed towards youth mental health, an extraordinarily important area and the basis of this motion. That certainly has not been widely debated by the opposition but, when you look at the election process, that was clearly in their funding program. The money that was going to be directed to youth mental health was going to be funded at the expense of a whole range of other health commitments made by the government. So immediately there is this issue of divide and change. That does not move us forward. That certainly does not let the government off the hook regarding the need to look at budgetary expenditure in the future and to look at the very real needs of the whole mental health area.
To actually say, ‘You must spend your money in this way and not spend it on other things,’ and create that division does not respond to the recommendations of the 2006 Senate select committee report on mental health or the subsequent reports we have done on the ongoing need in the area. We need a coordinated and well-resourced response to all the issues, and our government has started that. We need to do more. No-one has tried to hide from that point. When you hear the opposition rhetoric it is as though suddenly in 2007 all expenditure on mental health needs ceased. That is not true. I am not going to run through all the different elements of funding because that gets back to my statement about ‘mine is bigger than yours’. Basically what we need to do is ensure that we see what the needs are and listen across the board to the community—not just selectively pick the people with whom we wish to have discussions but talk across the board to the people who really know and who are always so willing to talk to government.
We have put the first dedicated minister into this area. It was long overdue. Governments should have done this before, but now we have a dedicated Minister for Mental Health and Ageing in our government. That minister, Minister Butler, quite rightly is informing himself on the key issues and listening to people. It is not some kind of ‘I’m going out there telling you what should happen’ tour; it is actually a genuine attempt to listen to people across the country—not just in capital cities; not just at set-up meetings—about their needs on mental health. That is an appropriate mechanism.
Senator Fierravanti-Wells concentrated on the photographic opportunities. I did take a quick glance at Fierravanti-Wells’s website and found that she is not averse to a photo opportunity herself. That is quite reasonable. I think everybody likes to be seen out doing their job. But it is a cheap shot to say that the only reason people listen to and work in the community is to get a flattering photograph. To begin with, they are not all that flattering. Also, you would not have any interaction if you were frightened that you could somehow be represented as taking an opportunistic approach rather than fulfilling a genuine need to consult.
As I have said, the need to have a response to mental health in our health policy and in our general policy is important. The way that this motion was phrased was once again saying that somehow the work in the hospital reform area was not effectively responding to people’s need in public health. That, again, is a real danger. By representing that mental health issues are not general health issues as well, you are dividing people and you are withdrawing need. The government’s position is that in order to reform the way the public hospital system operates and the way the management and the engagement of local communities will operate in the new health reform process, we must engage and involve mental health practitioners and consumers. We cannot have a silo approach that mental health is only to do with one segment of health and is not part of the whole health program.
Our reforms within the public hospital system and also within the regional process across the country are designed to have people’s health needs addressed. That includes—and must include—mental health. We want to develop a coordinated response which makes sure that mental health is part of the major health initiative—not somewhere off to the side, not somewhere where people are a little bit ashamed to identify that that is their area, but a core health issue.
The attempt to say that the hospital system is somehow a different issue to mental health needs is just not real. One element of our response to mental health is to ensure that the hospital system is appropriate and responsive to the needs—that when people need a bed in a hospital it will be available. One of the core aspects of the discussions we have had in the mental health area for many years is that the ‘medicalisation’ model—the hospital and medical response to these issues—is but one element of the needed response. People who know this area—consumers, carers and practitioners—must be involved in the discussions and involved in the response. Into the future, in the hospital reforms in the new Medicare Locals, the issues around mental health will be part of that—again, not a contest but a genuine response from all the community to the community’s needs.
We need to continue to have this discussion about mental health. All too rarely do we have the chance to gather and share knowledge and to listen to people like Patrick McGorry—who, when he is no longer the 2010 Australian of the Year, will continue to be important in any ongoing development of public policy around mental health. So we do not just have that small window of opportunity. I think the real value has been the way the community has listened and the way he has been available to get that message across.
The government is committed to ensuring that there is effective action on mental health. We maintained expenditure on core aspects through the first three years of the 2007 government and into the first year of the 2010 government. There is a commitment that we have to work across the board to look at a genuine response—and that will occur. But it will not be a divide, conquer and combat approach; it must be a coordinated response.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Mental Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-24,"—I tend to agree with the essence of this debate, and that is that the Gillard government has failed to properly fund mental health services. While I agree with the fact that we have not been funding our mental health services adequately, I cannot support this particular motion, because of the antics of the opposition. The opposition put a motion to this chamber about one specific aspect of mental health. It does not take a comprehensive approach in addressing mental health. As health spokesperson for the Greens, I have a particular passion for issues around mental health. I chaired the inquiry into suicide in Australia and that heightened my awareness around issues of mental health. I have consulted widely. I understand that our mental health services are significantly underfunded in this country.
The Senate has had two previous inquiries into mental health. One of the findings of those inquiries was that we need to have around 10 per cent of our health budget expenditure going to mental health. That puts Australia’s investment behind by about $5 billion a year for mental health. I am a realist and know that we are not going to catch up to that investment of $5 billion overnight. In fact, the Senate committee report on this said that you would need to phase in the investment over a five-year period. That has not happened. We are having this debate in the context of significantly underfunding our mental health investment.
I learnt many things in the consultation process. One of those things is the need for a comprehensive approach in dealing with mental health. I also learnt that early intervention is absolutely essential. Headspace and EPPIC—early intervention centres—are absolutely critical. The Greens fully support those centres, but they are not the solution to everything. They are not the silver bullet that we have been looking for. For example, there are younger people with mental health illness. Headspace says it deals with people between the ages of, say, 12 and 25. In reality, at the moment they are dealing with people between the ages of 18 and 25. So, for a start, those in their very early teenage years need some support. We need to invest in the primary school and early high school years. Of course, a lot of people in Australia over the age of 25 have mental health illness. We need to take a comprehensive approach. What we are saying is that those people will not get any additional services. We know they are missing out. I think it is the case that one in four people in Australia with a mental illness get some sort of support. What we are saying is that those people do not deserve any additional funding.
We know we need better primary healthcare services. We need better access to GPs for mental health issues. We absolutely know that when people go into an emergency department, having attempted suicide or threatening to attempt suicide, they need to see someone with mental health expertise. We also know that in this country very few emergency departments have somebody with mental health experience on call 24 hours a day. Quite often people go to an emergency department and then go home either not treated or inadequately treated, and we know people attempt suicide after that. So we know that we need to invest in that area. We know that people coming out of psychiatric care, having been admitted to hospital, absolutely need to be followed up, and we know that people are not being followed up. We know that we need to invest in that area. We absolutely know that we need more step-up, step-down accommodation. We know that we need more mobile support services. We know that we need to invest more in dealing with mental health issues in Aboriginal communities, and that requires a significant level of investment.
The Liberals brought in a motion, which they admitted in this chamber was just their policy. Essentially, their policy was purely about early intervention. The Greens asked the Liberals to give us a costing so that we could look at whether they intended to spend virtually all future investment in headspace, but we did not receive that. When we wanted to amend the motion, there was no agreement. In this chamber I was told to look at Liberal Party policy. So, in other words, the opposition just tried to bulldoze through their policy instead of taking a much more a cooperative approach and looking at how we can seriously address mental health in this country. We could take a more cooperative approach in this place, which is what the Senate has done in the past. We have taken a cross-party approach to mental health, which has been demonstrated by the good work that has been done through the Senate committee process. That has been thrown out to take a purely political approach so that they can—as Senator Moore said—get a few photos on websites, get a few media grabs around mental health and bash up the government and the Greens because we are taking a much more comprehensive approach.
Also, we have altered our approach. We suggested increasing the level of investment in early intervention as well as putting investment into primary health care, which we know is absolutely essential, and into emergency services, which we know is absolutely essential. We suggested a special commission for mental health because we believe this issue is so significant that it needs it. We took to the election the suggestion of putting in place a minister responsible for mental health, and we are glad the government picked that up. We think that is a very good step in the right direction. What we need to do now is see the government’s commitment to mental health. We need to see their investment. We agree with the opposition that we need to significantly increase investment in mental health. There is absolutely no disagreement there.
We do need to be very careful about where we increase that level of investment. We are not going to get the absolute level of investment that we need over the next 12 months or even the next two or three years, so we need to be constructing and focusing our investment on where it is going to meet need. We have absolutely no doubt that early intervention is critical, but we need to take a much broader approach. Yes, there has been a high-profile campaign about early intervention, and that is fantastic because it has focused the public’s attention on the need to address mental health issues. But we cannot invest just in early intervention. And do you know what? I have had so many emails, so many phone calls and so many personal visits where people have said: ‘Please don’t invest just in early intervention. Yes, that’s essential, but we need all these community services. We need community care services and we need better investment in rural and regional areas. If you focus just on early intervention, all those other people will not have their needs met.’ And we know what happens then; people get sicker. We know that homelessness can result from that. We know there are all sorts of consequences if we do not provide the services and support needed to support people through mental illness.
So my plea here to the government is: please invest in the level of resources we need. The Greens went to the election saying we needed an investment of at least $350 million a year. We actually agree with the opposition that it needs to be more, so we have said it should be $450 million a year—but not just on early intervention. We think you can have your cake and eat it too, which is why I beg the opposition to consider our amendments. The costings that have been put forward for the building of the number of headspace and EPIC centres it is estimated we need has to be phased in anyway, so we can phase in investment in headspace and EPIC—and there are other methods of early intervention besides headspace and EPIC. They are very good, but there are others. But we also need to invest in younger children and we need to invest in the over-25s. We can do that and invest in these other programs.
What I am really worried about is that if we just say ‘early intervention’, the government have a ticket to just go: ‘Yes, we’ve invested in mental health; we funded a few extra headspace and EPIC centres. That’s it, we’ve done mental health.’ And they will not have fixed mental health. So, please, let us take a coordinated, comprehensive approach to funding mental health and invest in the services that are desperately needed, not just early intervention. I do not want anyone thinking that we do not support early intervention, because we do. But it has to be part of a comprehensive approach to mental health funding, not a knee-jerk reaction because it is popular at the moment. We need a much more comprehensive approach, and the government need to fund that. We do agree with that part of the motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Mental Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-11-24,"—I think it is quite fitting that we are having this matter of public importance debate on mental health today. It is the same day on which we earlier moved a motion supporting and celebrating the work of the volunteers of Australia—recognising that International Volunteer Day will be on 5 December this year—because volunteers are often the people who have kept our mental health system functioning, for years and years. I would like to recognise the work of not just the higher profile people, such as Professor McGorry and Professor John Mendoza, and the many other people who are paid, such as those within the Mental Health Council of Australia and those in the member organisations of the Queensland Alliance, but also the thousands and thousands of volunteers. Many of them have been parents and carers, and have toiled for years and years, sometimes actually being opposed by their state governments over the sort of care and assistance that they wanted to have delivered to their spouses, their children and their siblings. It has been very hard work for many of them.
I think the first glimmer of hope that that group experienced was through the policies of the Howard government, when we funded the Personal Helpers and Mentors Scheme, PHaMs, and when we funded GPs to develop mental health management plans for patients who require them. That was the first glimmer of hope. I think the appointment of Professor Pat McGorry as Australian of the Year provided yet another glimmer of hope. Hopes were certainly raised that, finally, mental health was on the agenda and that, given Professor McGorry had been appointed to that position under a Labor government, Labor were serious about doing something about the mental health situation.
Unfortunately, earlier this year we had the resignation of Professor John Mendoza from the National Advisory Council on Mental Health—Minister Roxon’s advisory council. In another context, Professor Mendoza has talked of governments ‘low in courage’. I do not think I would be verballing Professor Mendoza in any way by saying that the reason he quit that job was that he found the Labor government ‘low in courage’ in terms of developing and genuinely supporting mental health funding. What we saw instead was artifice. They talk the talk, but that is the end of it from this Labor government. I guess we should not have been surprised, but the hopes of thousands and thousands of professionals, volunteers and carers in this sector were cruelly dashed, in my view.
Senator Siewert earlier talked about the Greens being in favour of early intervention but not just early intervention in this area. Could I turn that around and say that the coalition agree completely. We are in favour of not just early intervention. However, it is our funding of programs that has given the government their ability to boast about the spending that they have put into the area. For instance, it is very interesting that they boast about how much they have spent, compared to the Howard government—of course, they pick the figures that suit them—but the fact is that every one of the mental health programs that are currently funded by this government is an initiative or funding commitment from the Howard government. There is only $43½ million that they have put into ideas and thoughts for themselves over their life as a Labor government.
So it is appalling that the government would attempt to use the figures to suggest that somehow we have not supported a broad funding of this complex area and the many other areas that need to be funded. They have been funded. The two programs that I mentioned earlier—the PHaMS program and the program through GPs—are not aimed at any particular age group; they are aimed to help all people.
I must admit I was somewhat bemused by Senator Moore’s suggestion that people on this side might have been feigning outrage or making cheap political shots on this subject. I would like to suggest that when she talked about this motion and tried to distil it down to some sort of political act her views were wrong. This motion is not informed just by the views of the coalition; it is informed by the views of many others in the mental health area, who make the point over and over again—it is in the motion—that younger Australians between 16 and 24 bear the brunt of mental illness, with the prevalence of problems declining with age. Early and targeted treatment will allow many people to overcome mental illness or lower the incidence of progression or relapse.
Despite what they say, the government have cut services to mental health. There has been $5.5 billion extra in mental health spending from all governments since the national action plan was brought in—the biggest ever boost to mental health. But if you look for the new money and new areas of spending from this government you will find that they do not exist. This is where we need money to be spent.
The view has been put that somehow this is about hogging all the money for early intervention in mental health, as though somehow it is sucking money out of the system. Yes, that view has been put by a number of people. That view gets put because there is so little funding and so much unmet need in this area that people are jealous and scrabbling around over a few crumbs that the government might want to scatter about to keep them quiet.
We are talking here about putting new funding into early intervention—we are not talking about taking money out of existing programs to do it—to support the area that will best allow us to deal as quickly as possible with the problems of mental health. No-one denies that for decades mental health was under funded, but it is not a situation that we want to return to. It is up to this government to do something to prove that they are going to spend some money rather than keep it for an action plan that is not action at all.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Mental Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I want to begin my contribution today by supporting Senator Moore’s comments in the debate and by reaffirming that the Gillard government is committed to facing the challenges of mental health in Australia. Our Prime Minister has stated that mental health is an important second-term agenda and that this government is committed to addressing the mental health needs of the Australian community.
We are in the process of implementing the single biggest reform to the health and hospital system in Australia that the country has seen since Medicare. As part of our investments in the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Labor government is investing $1.6 billion to provide 1,300 sub-acute beds around the country, which will help to provide more mental health beds.
Through our health reforms, the Gillard government is building the foundations of the health system, on which we can build better health services for Australians, including better mental health services. We are committed to providing better access to GP and primary care services, and better coordination of service delivery to ensure that people with mental illness do not fall through the gaps. These investments are effectively a down payment to address the immediate service gaps in mental health as we move towards providing greater funding and policy leadership for community mental health services over time.
Our process of enduring reform is long overdue, particularly after those opposite had carriage of Australia’s health and hospital system for the better part of a decade. This government’s reform agenda acknowledges that the challenges we face in mental health are complex and require a coordinated and careful balance of services. This government’s response to mental illness will span across the age and illness spectrum. Contrary to what those opposite assert, we are working towards an integrated and connected mental health service that will meet the present and future needs of our community.
If we define and set the scope of the challenge before us it will make this debate a little clearer. We know that mental health has a profound impact on the community, with one in six Australians experiencing mental ill health in any given year, and one in three Australians experiencing mental illness at some point in their lifetime. That is 3.8 million Australians who will experience mental ill health in any given year. Of those 3.8 million Australians, we know that around 14 per cent, or 3.1 million, are affected by mild to moderate disorders. We know that one in forty Australians will experience severe mental illness and a third of those experience it as a chronic condition throughout their life.
We are taking steps to ensure that people are able to access services and treatment according to their needs. For people who may be experiencing symptoms, we are implementing early intervention strategies to prevent those initial symptoms manifesting into more serious and longer-lasting problems. For Australians suffering common and/or mild to moderate disorders the challenge before us is to improve levels of access and treatment to ensure that those disorders do not become severe. For those affected by severe and persistent illness, sometimes for the duration of their lives, the challenge before us is to improve the quality and coordination of different programs that people rely upon. For our children and our young people, we are focusing on teaching resilience and promoting problem-solving skills. For special needs groups in our community, like our young people and Indigenous people, we are working to improve our service design. This government is committed to ensuring that our mental health services are accessible and appropriate for our needs.
This government appointed the first minister for mental health, the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, the Hon. Mark Butler, thereby giving mental health a special focus within the ministry and affirming our commitment to addressing the mental health needs of the Australian community. Minister Butler has spent considerable time meeting with experts and service providers, including Professor McGorry, to seek their views about gaps in priorities for addressing Australia’s present and ongoing mental health needs. In December the minister will start travelling around the country to talk directly to consumers and carers and to hear their stories and experiences firsthand. These consultations will inform future strategies to better integrate the support services for those with mental illness with other services, including housing, education and employment. This government is fostering a more inclusive Australia. We are committed to listening to those suffering from mental illness, and to those who are caring for our friends, families and colleagues with mental illness, to deliver the most appropriate support.
Whilst the minister is undertaking his national consultation, we are simultaneously investing in mental-health-specific programs. Funding for these programs, including Indigenous programs, over the next four years will almost triple—from $516 million in the four years to 2007-08 to $1.4 billion. We have included funding that we announced during this year’s election campaign as a part of the national tackling suicide package, which contains $274 million in funding over four years. This funding will redouble our efforts in suicide prevention, focus on the most at-risk groups and take practical action in suicide hot spots. The tackling suicide policy builds on the $176 million of funding announced in the 2010 budget to improve our mental health system and address immediate gaps.
Whilst the government is still drafting a formal response to the recommendations of the recent Senate inquiry, I am pleased that Minister Butler has welcomed the recommendations in the report The hidden toll: suicide in Australia. He said:
For example, the structural reforms being introduced under the new National Health and Hospitals Network will lay a foundation for further reform of the mental health sector.
I note, from the red, that we will be receiving that official response from the government today. I look forward to reading it. Minister Butler also affirmed that the government has already taken action on a number of fronts to tackle the problem of suicide. One such measure includes the government’s commitment to roll out an additional 30 headspace centres across Australia and flexible care packages to support people with severe mental illness. I am particularly pleased that in Hobart, in my home state of Tasmania, we are on track to receive a fully operational headspace facility by 2011. The expansion of these services affirms our commitment to early intervention and to providing additional support for our children and young people.
This government is delivering on its commitment to improve the health and wellbeing of all Australians. We have already seen this government make a $450 million new investment in mental health in the last 12 months. This is all happening, as I have mentioned, in addition to the structural reforms to the national health and hospitals network. These reforms lay the foundation for further reform of the mental health sector. They include better planning, management and coordination of local services based on local needs; more hospital and subacute beds, more doctors and nurses and a stronger primary care network; and a 21st century e-health system. Medicare Locals will work to improve local integration and referral pathways and care coordination of Commonwealth and other mental health services. The federal government is taking full funding responsibility for primary care outpatient services, supporting mental health services in community settings. All of these steps are reducing cost-shifting to our hospitals.
Those opposite still want to criticise and condemn us as we try to clean up their mistakes whilst planning and investing in our nation’s future health needs. I find it disappointing that those opposite would seek to condemn our response to mental health when the Howard government did not move on mental health for 10 years and, as Senator Moore has stated in her contribution in this debate, it was only in 2006 that the Howard government moved on the issue in any real way. Their now leader, Mr Abbott, as the Minister for Health and Ageing under the former Howard government, oversaw a $1 billion cut from public hospitals around the country—enough to provide 1,000 hospital beds—capped GP training places at 600 per— (Time expired)

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2010-11-24,"—I am very pleased to make a short contribution on this matter of public importance—the Gillard government’s abject failure to properly fund mental health services. It is a shameful situation that the government has let funding for mental health services deteriorate to such an extent that we have to resort to motions of this kind in an attempt to get the government to face up to its responsibilities.
With mental illness affecting more Australians than almost all other health disorders, ranking only behind cancer and heart disease in prevalence; with 45 per cent of the nation’s populace experiencing a mental health disorder at some point in life; and with younger Australians aged between 16 and 24 being the most vulnerable, the need for a properly funded national mental health strategy is an urgent problem that must be addressed. The Gillard government’s paralysis when it comes to dealing with this urgent matter is, unfortunately, all too familiar. Their inability to focus on priorities and implement much-needed reforms is the hallmark of a government that has lost its way. This is a problem crying out for immediate help today, not at some time in the distant future with the now Minister for Mental Health and Ageing still walking around the country trying to consult with people when we know what the problem is and we know what the problem is now.
The fact that the government is clinging so desperately, for example, to its determination to spend $37 billion or $49 billion or whatever the right figure is on a broadband network at the expense of delivering better health and education says it all. It is blindingly obvious that universal fast broadband can be delivered to every Australian far more economically and efficiently than the NBN, yet the government ploughs on, terrified it has nothing to show for three wasted years—and it certainly has nothing to show on mental health.
The tragedy of this policy drift by the Gillard government is plain for all to see. We all know that, between 1995-96 and 2002-03, expenditure on mental health by the Howard government—and I was very proud to be part of that executive—increased by 53 per cent from $792 million to $1.2 billion. They are real dollars. The coalition really gets the importance of funding for mental health. In 2006 the Howard government made the biggest single investment in mental health, with $1.9 billion over five years. Of course, during the recent election campaign, the coalition, after wide consultation, announced mental health policy proposals amounting to $1.5 billion.
In stark contrast, the Labor government’s actions and record are best described as cost-cutting and dismal. They include cuts to the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program—from $191 million to just $63 million—and cuts to Better Access, removing occupational therapists and social workers from the program. Inexplicably, this government reduced funding to rural and remote services when all the evidence shows that, all too often, suicide, depression and despair lurk in rural communities, where mental illness is often undiagnosed and untreated.
In the Rudd-Gillard government’s national health and hospital reform plan, much touted in this afternoon’s contributions from the other side, mental health was completely overlooked, amounting to less than two per cent of the total reforms. We know that one of the consequences of all these cuts was the resignation of the chair of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health, Professor John Mendoza, who wrote in frustration:
... it is now abundantly clear that there is no vision or commitment from the Rudd Government to mental health.
Damning words indeed. There is some provision in the COAG health reform agreement. However, it is not enacted. So we must ask the question: why not? Yet again this Green-Gillard government is all talk and no action. The government has lost control of any sense of responsible direction on mental health. It is clear from the minutes of Kevin Rudd’s sign-off speech to the party room that the government acknowledges the waste and mismanagement under the $16.2 billion Building the Education Revolution program—administered, of course, by Ms Gillard. Just imagine if just some of the funds wasted and thrown away on useless make-work schemes had been invested in the mental health of this nation. That really would be a revolution to be proud of.
The coalition, on the other hand, promised in the lead-up to the recent election to commit $1.5 billion to mental health. That spend was comprehensive and endorsed by many prominent Australians involved in the field of mental health. Earlier speakers have outlined what that provides—a minimum of 90 headspace centres nationally, early psychosis and prevention intervention centres and early psychosis prevention that would add another 800 acute and subacute beds. The coalition’s plans, not surprisingly, received widespread acclaim and recognition, with Professor Pat McGorry—the Australian of the Year and an expert in mental health—saying:
… this policy would save lives—
I hope you are listening over there!—
ensure young lives are not stunted or derailed, and stem the tide of Australians with untreated mental illnesses flowing to our emergency departments, onto our streets and into our prisons.
The government is simply drifting into an abyss in failing to address mental health. This failure to act on mental health is a national disgrace. It is a comprehensive failure of leadership and political will. The government should stand condemned for miserably failing in its obligation to recognise and deliver on this urgent national priority to underpin the mental health of all Australians.

Ordered that the report be printed.

Alert Digest No. 10 and Tenth Report of 2010
24 November 2010
In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 10 of 2010 and its Tenth Report of 2010 I draw the Senate’s attention to the Committee’s comments on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010.
This Bill seeks to bring restrictions on tobacco advertising and promotion on the internet into line with restrictions in other media and at other retail points of sale.
The Bill will make it an offence to advertise tobacco products on the internet and in other electronic media such as mobile phones or computers unless the advertising complies with other applicable legislation.
The new offence will apply to advertisements published before the commencement of the Act if the advertisement is accessible to the public after the provisions come into force. This means that the offence will operate retrospectively.
The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is troubled by retrospectivity when it could have a detrimental effect on any person. In this case the Committee is concerned that the retrospective operation of the offence means that a person could unknowingly breach the new offence provision.
The Committee acknowledges the justification for the approach outlined in the explanatory memorandum. This includes that the retrospective aspect of the offence is necessary to avoid undermining the object of the Bill and that it is intended that it commence 6 months after the Act is passed to allow time for previously published tobacco advertisements to be removed.
However, the Committee is concerned to limit the likelihood of any inadvertent breaches and will seek information from the Minister about this, including about steps that will be taken to inform those who will be affected by the new law if it is passed.
In relation to its Tenth Report, the Committee has again received a considerable number of timely and comprehensive responses to issues raised in previous Alert Digests. Several Bills contain issues of potential concern under Standing Order 24 and I draw the Senate’s attention to the Committee’s comments in relation to them.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-24,"—by leave—I could not let this opportunity to take note of the ministerial statement on the Montara Commission of Inquiry pass because I have been waiting for 18 months for this report on the results of the inquiry. The Montara spill occurred on 21 August and it is now the end of November. I am very pleased that this report has finally been tabled along with the government’s response. The report has been available only for the last couple of hours, so I have not been able to read every page, but I have had a look at a significant part of it. It looks to be a very good and very thorough report. It confirms a lot of the issues that we thought about at the time.
I draw the attention of the Senate to a number of issues in this report. One is that the report clearly identifies the company, PTTPEP Australasia (Ashmore Cartier) Pty Ltd, as responsible for the spill in that the company were found to be not adhering to their own compliance monitoring programs and well operation plans in addition to not complying with the regulatory process. In their response, the government highlighted that they were not satisfied with just asking the company to show cause why they should not only have their leases cancelled for the Montara field but also have their leases cancelled for their other operations. The important point is that this company, over the last 18 months, has been allowed to acquire other leases in Australian waters and continue their operations, with the government knowing full well, from the company’s own submissions to the inquiry and the transcript of evidence from the inquiry, that there were issues. There were obviously issues with this company, yet they were allowed to continue their operations and acquire leases. The government has acknowledged that there will be changes to the legislation—and I will get onto that in a minute—but we will be looking at making a change to the legislation to enable a government to choose not to grant leases to companies where there are significant question marks over their ability to manage oilfields and when they may have caused a significant accident like this. We will be pursuing that.
We do support the government’s response. Minister Ferguson had said that they will be pursuing the establishment of a single regulator. We think that is a good approach but the success of such an approach will hang on a number of things. We think the approach of separating the regulator from those who are granting oil and gas leases is a good principle to start with, but it will hang on whether the body is adequately resourced to (a) enable them to get the best expertise possible, because they need the expertise to look at the companies’ operations; and (b) to adequately audit compliance, because that was a major failing in this process. Not only did the company fail but the NT government and the department failed to adequately enforce regulations. It was almost a tick and flick exercise. They did not enforce oil and gas regulations. They did not enforce compliance, and the government talks a great deal about that, so we will be pursuing those changes. We will be looking at the 2011-12 budget to make sure that the organisation is adequately resourced in the budget, because that is going to be crucial to its operations.
One of the other key areas that the committee of inquiry looked into is the area of environmental impacts. I have to say here that everything that environment groups and the Greens were saying at the time about the problems with the environment and the lack of coordination are basically talked about in this report. There was a failure for proper coordination across government agencies when it came to looking at the environmental issues, and there was a failure to share information. There was no one person responsible. The report talks about the lack of monitoring. The point here is that we will actually never ever really know the full environmental impact of the spill, because insufficient baseline monitoring was done by the company in the first place, which the NT government allowed; they did not require better environmental baseline assessment of the environment. Secondly, no monitoring was done from the start of the spill. I also point out that no monitoring was done on the subsurface water—in other words, on the impact of the dispersants and the dispersed oil on the marine environment. This week the company put out a study saying, ‘We’ve used computer modelling,’ to say it did not have an impact. They did not have monitoring done so we do not know. We do not know how many marine species were affected. We do not know what impact the oil spill and the dispersants had on coral spawning, which was occurring at the time, and commercial fish species—and a number were commercial species. That needs never to happen again.
The commission’s report also touches, although not extensively, on the oil that went into Indonesian waters, and the minister touched on it in the ministerial statement. The report said that, yes, oil did go into the Indonesian waters. I must point out that we know that too, because the commission of inquiry confirmed that the oil sample I sent in, which I received from Indonesian fishers, indicated that it was Montara oil. In the ministerial statement the minister said that it is now up to the Indonesian government and the company to deal with it. I beg to differ. It was Australia that regulated this oilwell. We agreed that our failure to properly make sure the company did their job properly and to audit compliance contributed to this spill, which ended up impacting on Indonesian fishers. I believe Australia has a moral responsibility to show leadership here and to ensure that these fishers are compensated. I do not know what the full impact has been. I do not know whether anybody has ascertained that yet, and that is a problem. These are subsistence fishers who rely on this area for their livelihood and to feed their families. They are the ones who immediately bore the brunt of this spill, because they had to stop fishing. I think, and the Greens think, that the Australian government should be facilitating an outcome for these Indonesian fishers. It was our regulatory process that contributed to its failure, so we need to ensure that those fishers are adequately compensated if there is a problem.
There are clearly some significant issues that will need to be followed up from this report. There are over 100 findings and 100 recommendations. The commission of inquiry have done a good job in picking up these issues. We now need the government to pick up on all the recommendations. As I said, we support the announcements the government has made in terms of the regulatory response and in setting up an independent single regulator. We need to ensure its independence. We need to ensure we fix up the environmental legislation side of things and change our practices. This was not mentioned extensively in the ministerial statement. Some of the issues have been mentioned but not as comprehensively as I would have liked. We will be pursuing this with government. We will be pursuing changes to the environmental protection act to ensure that this sort of problem does not happen again.
On the other key point, I clearly point out the need to have the polluter pay. In other words the company is responsible for all the clean-up, all the remediation and all the monitoring. That should not be, as is the situation at the moment, a reliance on the goodwill of the company to pay it. Under the legislation they do not have to pay it. The legislation needs to be changed to ensure that the concept of polluter pays is enshrined in legislation so government does not have to rely on the goodwill of the company that caused the problem in the first place. The company may see it as a PR exercise but we do not want to rely on that. We need to make sure that the company pays for the full cost of the clean-up, for the full cost of remediation and for ongoing monitoring. We will be pursuing these recommendations with government. I know government knows that. I am very pleased that the government has finally tabled this response, nearly 18 months after this disaster started. As I said, we will never know the full impact that this spill has had on our marine environment. I hope we do not see a similar spill in the future.
The last thing I would like to point out is that, no matter how good regulation is, you cannot guarantee that you will never have a spill. That is why we need to complement good oil and gas regulation with marine protected areas. There are some areas that are just so special you cannot risk them, so we need to make sure that everybody is also aware that we need to have a comprehensive set of marine protected areas around Australia to ensure that our really special marine environments, our really special marine biodiversity, are protected so they are never at risk of a spill, because we can never guarantee 100 per cent that a spill will not happen, no matter how good our regulations.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-11-24,—I present the government’s response to the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on its inquiry into suicide in Australia.,SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-24,"—I seek leave to take note of the government response to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report entitled The hidden toll: suicide in Australia.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I am pleased to be able to take note of the government’s response and I congratulate the government and Minister Butler for meeting the three-month time line in responding to a committee inquiry report. I think it is probably the first time that I can remember in the 5½ years I have been here that the government has responded within the deadline of three months, so I would particularly to congratulate the government for that and I would like to note a couple of really important issues. Having said that, however, I will note that we were not given the usual period to review this. I have literally had this response for about 10 minutes. I am sure that other speakers following me will also be seeking leave to continue their remarks so that we can go through this in a bit more detail.
I will point out a few of the key areas that the government has responded to. One of the key things that kicked this inquiry off was the fact that we do not know the real impact of suicide in Australia. We know that the figures are not correct. The official figures are around 1,800 suicides in Australia a year. We know that this is underreported and it is more likely that somewhat over 2,000 deaths are attributable to suicide. We also know that in Aboriginal communities deaths as a result of suicide are proportionately higher than in non-Aboriginal communities.
One of the key areas of recommendation we as a committee focused on at the front of our inquiry was this issue around the statistics, because it is so critical. Of course, any suicide is too many and there was some notion in the community that the number of people taking their own lives was decreasing, because the statistics were not showing the true numbers on suicides. We need to get a good understanding of the statistics because we need to be looking at whether we need to be increasing our investment in suicide prevention. Our inquiry clearly showed that the statistics are not showing the true numbers. I am pleased to say, in my quick look at the response, that the government has agreed with most of our recommendations around improving statistical collection and working with the states to improve coronial responses and approaches to suicide. In some states unless there is an inquest they do not actually report the cause of death and that is very important if we are going to address the high rates of suicide in Australia.
The government also notes in its response that its package that it announced during the election campaign—the $274 million for mental health and suicide prevention—is, as I understand the government’s response, a key plank of its response to the committee inquiry. While at the time I did welcome the $274 million—and I still do welcome it—we are looking for more. The previous debate that we had in this chamber, for example, indicates that we need to significantly increase our level of investment in mental health. One of the recommendations of the committee inquiry was increasing investment in mental health, so we need to be doing that. One of the other areas of recommendation was a doubling of investment in the Suicide Prevention Strategy and the government has increased investment in the strategy, but there are still some key areas in which we need investment, so we will be continuing to pursue that.
The other area that I am particularly pleased about—as I said I have not had the chance to go through all of our recommendations yet—is Indigenous suicide. One of our recommendations was that under the Suicide Prevention Strategy there be a specific strategy to address Indigenous suicide. The government, I am really pleased to say, has taken that recommendation up. It is particularly important because, as I noted in this chamber last week, there have been a number of suicides in northern Australia and I understand in other places as well recently and that needs to be urgently addressed.
I note that the government has said that it is setting up a consultation process early in 2011 to coordinate recommended appropriate mental health and wellbeing approaches for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and I understand that will link into how some of the $274 million is spent in addressing Aboriginal suicides. I cannot say how pleased I am that the government has taken up that recommendation and will invest some of that $274 million in Aboriginal communities. As has been identified through estimates, only $8.1 million of the $274 million is actually going to be spent in this financial year. My plea there is that we need to get investment on the ground in some of these communities as soon as possible because we know through this report that there are significant differences in Aboriginal communities relating to people taking their own lives. There are more what are called ‘clusters’. I should preference that with saying that a high number of the recent deaths have been young people. We know through the evidence presented to us that there are a significant number of what are called ‘copycat’ suicides in Aboriginal communities and so there needs to be a lot of really intense postvention. That needs to be driven by the community in addressing community needs. I implore the government to get investment going on that as soon as possible.
One of the other areas that we focused on was other high-risk groups such as men and members of the LGBTI community and I notice that the government has addressed that through the strategy. I will look at that in more detail as I can. One of the other areas that we addressed was the need for awareness raising of the issue but the issue that is always struggled with is in trying not to glamorise suicide. What we recommended was that there needs to be a five-year long-term investment in awareness raising, but that research needs to be done to look at how we invest in that to get the best quality outcome.
So I am going to be pursuing that through the recommendations and ensuring that that recommendation is pursued. I will look at it through the current investment but, of course, continue to pursue the government over a higher level of investment for mental health, because we cannot get away from the fact that, when we are addressing issues around suicide, we absolutely have to address issues around mental health.
As I said, I congratulate the government for its comprehensive response in a timely manner. I am not saying I am totally satisfied with it yet, because I have not had a chance to read it all, but I have certainly read some of the key areas now. I think it is a very significant step in the right direction. I am particularly pleased about the response on a specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander strategy, and I will continue to follow up with the government on that issue, but the message is also: ‘You’ve invested $274 million. That’s great. You’ve addressed some of our recommendations. We will continue to pursue investment in these other recommendations.’",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,2,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I will speak briefly, because I believe that this particular report will now be on the agenda for a number of months with people wanting to be engaged on this topic. But today it gives me great pride to be able to say that our government has responded within the time frame for responses. I want to echo Senator Siewert’s comments on that. I have not been here that long—not as long as you, Mr Acting Deputy President McGauran—but I do not remember a community affairs committee report ever having a response within the agreed time frame before. I do not think it is something that happens very often, but when it does happen it should be noted.
The report has 42 recommendations. Community affairs committee reports do tend to have multiple recommendations, but in this process I have been through them briefly and will have to do a lot more work to see where all the responses are in it. But all the recommendations have been picked up by the government. The ones that need more work are clearly identified in the listing at the back, so it is quite an easy format. I want to acknowledge the format used in this report. The government notes issues that need considerably more work, and it acknowledges that that needs to happen. So when people are reading the report they can look at the special recommendation about which they feel most strongly. If it says ‘the government notes’ then it is up to all of us to ensure that the government notes it and takes future action. The ones I particularly want to note, though, are ones where action is going to happen. It happens so often that when you work closely on an issue like this one, which has such incredible personal pain related to the topic, you become deeply engaged in the people’s lives and their families, and that again happened in our committee. Senator Siewert touched on many of the same issues that I want to briefly reinforce now.
After that passionate statement about how personally and deeply you get involved with the people, the first comment I am going to make is about statistics, which often do not have such a personal link. But, in terms of data collection and knowledge, statistics must be effectively acknowledged, identified and useful. Certainly, in this particular discussion, a great deal of effort was put into the committee’s submissions around concern with the way statistics were maintained in this area in Australia. The fact is that the way suicides are identified and classified and the responsibility for ensuring that the national database is accurate vary from state to state. Different people are involved. There was a standard issue that there was a lack of real knowledge and also resourcing at the state level. So certainly one of the key aspects of this was to have that on record and to take the information that had been collected by specialist agencies through the wonderful Suicide Prevention Australia network, on whom we relied so greatly in this whole inquiry for their professional knowledge and understanding and also for their personal support—because, for many of us involved in this particular inquiry, at times it was very difficult as we were learning of individual cases, the causes, the lack of knowledge and the sheer waste and loss which are caused in this community by the issues around suicide.
We relied on the personal and professional knowledge of Suicide Prevention Australia. They have had a special working group in place now for a couple of years looking specifically at the issues around data and statistics. They brought that knowledge to our committee, and it has now been taken up by the government in relation to the fact that it needs to be on the COAG agenda for the ministerial grouping that has this responsibility across the country. So that will happen. We as a Senate need to maintain the interest to ensure that it does happen and that we come back and revisit this topic, which we have had a reputation for doing over the last few years. It is one thing to establish a committee, to make recommendations and to have government responses, and we have all of that in this case, but the other thing is to keep a very strong watching brief on it to ensure that it does not slip off the agenda. As I am sure you have seen, Mr Acting Deputy President, once something is actually completed there is a tendency in government to take it as a tick and move on to the next priority. That cannot happen in this case, because the need will continue. Certainly I think those areas around statistics and data collection need to have that constant scrutiny to ensure that we maintain the watch.
Senator Siewert mentioned the issues around Indigenous need, and certainly that was a major concern for all of us, and I will take that up at another time in a longer contribution. But I do want to look at the issues of research, because one of the things that we talked about was the need for effective and publicly shared research in this area. Certainly there is a specific recommendation looking at the issues of research and the need for professional knowledge in the area. I have mentioned Suicide Prevention Australia. I also want to mention Griffith University in Brisbane, where I have visited and spoken with the people who work with Professor Diego De Leo up there. They have such knowledge in this area. They also continue to research international best practice and international literature and put that information into the public awareness so that, if you are interested in issues around suicide, you have a central base on which to rely. Then it is up to you whether you wish to take more knowledge. That particular service needs to be maintained. You know that in this place there is no such thing as a guaranteed funding mechanism but, in terms of where we go from this process, we have to have that effective database of information. We have to encourage professional research in the area so that we understand the issues. There are so many and they are so complex, but in the end it comes down to people who are lost and troubled. So we have to provide the best possible support for them and provide effective research. I note that this week the National Health and Medical Research Council grants were handed out, and I know mental health research received a number of those grants, so in that way there has been acknowledgement of the need and moving to the future, but that needs to be maintained.
I only wanted to make a few comments this afternoon, because there are more senators and a limited time, but this issue cannot be taken off the agenda. We have the committee report, a resource that should be used into the future. We now have the government response. We need to keep that pressure on government to ensure that the initial response continues. We have seen significant financial involvement in this area of suicide already, but that is the first step. These programs are over four to five years. We need to ensure that they are evaluated effectively. I can say as a member of this committee that there were 42 recommendations. They are all important, and we need to continue the commitment.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,2,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-24,"—I have just received a copy of the report and obviously have not had the opportunity to read it. I will just make some general observations and then seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Of course, suicide and suicide prevention are vitally important. As I said in the earlier matters of public importance debate, it is a false economy not to fund mental health properly because we ultimately all pay for that through the cost of suicide. I quoted figures showing six Australians a day die from suicide, and that is only the statistics that we know. Society ultimately pays for it through costs for policing, emergency hospital admissions, road accidents, unemployment, family dysfunction and other sad outcomes of mental illness.
My criticism of the government and its lack of action on mental health was shared by so many experts at the last federal election. When the government announced its $277 million spending in suicide prevention it was criticised, not because this was money that was not vitally needed in suicide prevention but because this was the sum total of what the government did for mental health. This was the only announcement in relation to mental health by the government, and that was done during the election campaign. Whilst it was welcomed, the scathing criticism of this government was directed towards the fact that it was the sum total. I can remind the Senate of comments that were made by Professor Mendoza, attacking the government’s announcement as just being mere tokenism. That was only one of the rather scathing comments that were made.
Regrettably, the issue before us today and what we discussed in matters of public importance highlights that suicide is vitally important and funding towards suicide prevention is vitally important. But that is not the sum total of mental illness and the spending that needs to happen for mental illness in this country.
Mental illness affects more Australians, as I said earlier, than other health disorders; only cancer and heart disease impact more people. Almost half our population experiences some form of mental disorder. Recent studies show that in any given year one in five Australians will experience some form of mental illness. As I said, suicides are a portion of this, but where you have mental health being 13 per cent of the total burden of disease in Australia and only six per cent of the health budget you do see the need, and you do see why people like Professor McGorry, Professor Mendoza and so many other experts in this field have been so critical of the government for its lack of attention to mental illness.
We know that delays in accessing appropriate treatment and early intervention are not only damaging to young people but to people suffering from mental illness across the spectrum, and that social and family relationships suffer. In employment, secondary problems such as substance abuse, behavioural problems and the illness itself may become more deeply entrenched. Most people with mental illness in Australia have little access to appropriate professional care and, of course, if left untreated they become increasingly unwell. Then you have the vicious cycle of revolving door presentation at hospital emergency departments, confrontations with authorities, substance and alcohol abuse and homelessness. That all adds to the cost pressures in health care and also to the detrimental outcomes for sufferers.
As I said in the earlier debate, criticism of the government has been very much in relation to its inaction. I want to focus on this because the government missed its opportunity. The coalition has been very critical of the hospital grand plan. Indeed, we believe that monies should be better spent to assist mental health in this country—$1.5 billion was our policy. Money should not be pumped into needless state and territory bureaucracies, which is what the government’s grand hospital plan is all about. That money also builds on the single biggest investment in mental health, which was undertaken by the previous coalition government. It committed $1.9 billion over a five-year period for services not only for people with mental illness but also for their families and their carers.
Through that program we saw increased packages and increased access to psychiatrists, psychologists, GP mental health nurses and other health professionals. We saw the Better Access initiative, which this government attacked. It was not until the coalition, social workers and occupational therapists thumped the table and really made a big song and dance about what the government was doing that suddenly the Minister for Health and Ageing, Minister Roxon, had to do another government backflip and reverse her decision. That has been typical; we saw that initiative and we saw the day-to-day living program cut back by this government.
I hear Senator Moore and her colleagues come in here and attack me because I am being critical and political. Senator Moore, I am doing that because the government has failed. We sat through the COAG health reform inquiries and we heard expert after expert in the mental health area castigate the government in the most scathing of terms for its lack of action in mental health.
Certainly, the spending in relation to suicide prevention was welcomed; but, in the words of Professor Mendoza, it is just tokenism and it goes nowhere near the spending that is vitally necessary in this country to help with the one in five Australians—and, indeed, a staggering 65 per cent of sufferers—who battle their disorder alone or with the help of their families only. Indeed, Professor McGorry told the COAG health inquiry of the hidden waiting list of Australians desperately in need of mental health services, including three-quarters of a million young Australians. He was focusing on the expanded funding of headspace and EPIC programs, which of course are the focus of the coalition’s policy and were the focus of the motion that was passed by the Senate on 26 October. I hope that the motion will also be passed tomorrow in the other place.
The reality is that, sadly, Labor’s gross failure in mental health has been evidenced by the scathing criticism of so many people, including Professor McGorry; Professor John Mendoza, the former chair of the national advisory council who resigned in utter disgust at this government’s lack of inaction; and the Mental Health Council of Australia. To quote Professor Mendoza after resigning from his position on the advisory council:
It is now abundantly clear that there is no vision or commitment from the Rudd Government to mental health.
That came from the former chair of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-11-24,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 122nd Inter-parliamentary Union Assembly in Thailand and a bilateral visit to the People’s Republic of China, which took place from 25 March to 11 April 2010. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This delegation spent some five or six days in Thailand and then moved on to a bilateral visit to the Republic of China. It was led by the Speaker of the House, Mr Jenkins, and me as deputy leader. Other delegates were Ms Jill Hall, the Hon. Roger Price, Mr Patrick Secker—and you, Mr Acting Deputy President McGauran, also joined the delegation while we were in Thailand.
The opportunities were for regional cooperation, economic development, nuclear non-proliferation disarmament and environmental protection, and all of these issues were fully discussed at the meeting in Bangkok. These assemblies are held twice a year and we had 124 parliaments represented in Bangkok. In the general debate, Mr Jenkins spoke about the efforts to achieve reconciliation with Australia’s Indigenous people. I chaired a drafting committee on the acceleration of achievements of the Millennium Development Goals which was later adopted by consensus. Mr Jenkins also spoke on nuclear security. Ms Hall spoke on strengthening our national health programs and gave examples of Australia’s efforts to support the implementation of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.
Many other activities of the IPU were noted and discussed, and the delegation attended meetings of the two geopolitical groups in which we participate: the Asia-Pacific group and the 12 Plus group. There is consideration of making the interparliamentary union a treaty-making group, and that is an ongoing consideration, with Australia and some other countries, particularly former Commonwealth countries, having reservations about this idea as well as concerns about the IPU focusing on this issue to the detriment of others.
The delegation also had meetings with speakers of the Thai and Korean parliaments, with delegations from Indonesia and Vietnam and with a member of parliament from Afghanistan. Arrangements were also made at that conference for a follow-up regional meeting in New Zealand to increase the involvement of Pacific Island parliaments in the IPU. That was subsequently held on 9 and 10 August 2010, with me and Mr Price attending. An outcomes document with 13 action ideas was adopted unanimously at that meeting and I look forward to progress being made.
The delegation left Bangkok on 1 April against the background of the escalating red shirt violence, which reached a crescendo some weeks after we left, with the actual hotel and conference area where the conference was held being subsequently attacked by the red shirts and burnt out. I understand that it has been demolished and an entirely new complex will have to be built.
In China, we made visits to major cities and regional areas. Again, the main aims of the delegation were to further develop relations between the Australian parliament and the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, as a memorandum of understanding has recently been signed between the two parliaments. We also wanted to gain an understanding of recent political, social and economic developments in China and their relevance to Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. We also hoped to enhance bilateral relations between our two countries. We visited Hong Kong; Macau, which is undergoing redevelopment in family tourism; and Guangzhou, which has 110 million people, 12 per cent of China’s economic output and 30 per cent of its exports.
We also went to the autonomous region of Ningxia, which is in the far north-west of the country and contains some 6.2 million people. Many people in that area have been relocated from very poor regions of China so that they can make a new life in specially built housing and whole new economic developments. It was indeed strange to see multilane highways, built for the future, with not one car on them except for ours, and huge ornamental lakes with little cabanas around them, which will no doubt cater for the leisure time of the population when they have ceased their undoubtedly very hard work.
We visited a horticulture park, which again is a recent development, and it contains areas for research, production, investment, education and tourism. We also looked at the cultural diversity of this province. It has a high level of the religion of Islam in it. We visited two mosques and an Islamic institute and I understand that in that region, with its 6.2 million people, there are over 3,000 mosques. So it is a very diverse region.
We then went on to Beijing, where we had more parliamentary dialogue. All indications are that the bilateral relationship between Australia and China is growing strongly. There will always be some differences of opinion, but effective cooperation and consultation should be the words for the future. We want to increase trade between the two countries and not just in raw materials and natural resources. We look to make progress in the free trade agreement and we were assured that there is a firm political will in China to achieve it. We intend to strengthen the parliamentary dialogue and exchange ideas on defence and water management. We also had meetings with representatives of Australian business and government representatives. There is an increasing opportunity for Australian companies with environment qualifications and know-how, because that is one of the growth industries in China.
In Shanghai, we took a look at the excellent Australian exhibition at the world expo, which made me very proud to be an Australian. It had very high quality materials and was built to a very high level of environmental efficiency. We also visited the Bao Steel Corporation. It is the second largest steel production plant in the world, with an annual production of 25 million tonnes of steel. Part of that is exported through the new deep-water port that we visited which handles nine million container units a year. It is obvious that there is a need for Australian policy and decision making to be in tune with this absolute explosion of the Chinese desire to be involved with its near Asian neighbours.
I would like to thank Mr Andres Lompe, who accompanied the delegation. I would like to thank the Parliament of Thailand. The Chinese hospitality which provided such a comprehensive program for us was very much appreciated as was the support provided by the Australian embassy and our consulates in Thailand and China. We also had an officer from DFAT, Mr Eric Van Der Waal with us at the delegation at the IPU.
I would like to make particular mention of someone who was not on this trip: Mr Neil Bessell, who unfortunately died earlier this year. I have been on something like four of these delegations, and Mr Bessell was an integral part of those delegations. Not only did he see that every detail was catered for; he also looked after us extremely well on every occasion. No question was too silly to ask from the point of view of the delegation members; Neil always answered questions in every way that we could have wanted. Like many other members of the Senate, I mourn his passing and I would like to say how much he was missed on that delegation and how very fondly he will be remembered by all those senators and members who have been on IPU delegations.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Today I am reintroducing a Bill to the House that returns the Child Care Rebate annual cap to $7500 per child per year and pauses indexation of the annual cap for four years until 30 June 2014 in order to generate $86.3 million that will be specifically re-directed to support the Government’s quest to increase the quality of child care and early education in Australia.
Although we know that many child care centres across Australia are doing well, the National Childcare Accreditation Council’s latest report shows that sadly, too many child care centres are failing to meet basic safety, hygiene, educational and wellbeing standards.
For instance, of the 1,129 centres that received an accreditation decision between 1st January and 30th June, 30 per cent had failed to ensure that toileting and nappy changing procedures were consistent with advice from recognised health authorities, and 32 per cent had failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. 
These figures demonstrate just how important it is to support our hard working and dedicated early education and child care workers to do the job they do best and to lift the quality of child care and early education across Australia.
This amendment will produce $86.3 million over the next four years to be invested in delivering the Government’s National Quality Framework in partnership with the states and territories.
Our $273.7 million investment in the National Quality Framework endorsed by COAG will improve educator to child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention.
It will introduce educator qualification requirements so educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop. 
And deliver a new ratings system so parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices, and will reduce regulation burden so services only have to deal with one regulator.
Crucially this measure will also help fund our $59.4 million investment in improving the quality of 142 budget based funded early childhood services located in rural and remote Australia that provide care to some of Australia’s most vulnerable children.
We are doing this because the Government believes that the 800,000 Australian families who place their children in care each week deserve to know that they are safe and in a happy and stimulating learning environment. 
In contrast the leader of the Opposition wants to put the National Quality Standard on hold indefinitely and also said he would scrap the rating system that will shine a light on child care in Australia. 
While the Opposition may be content to sit back while too many child care centres across the country are failing to meet basic safety, hygiene, educational and wellbeing standards, this Government believes we can and must do better when it comes to the safety, wellbeing and early learning of our children. 
When it comes to investing in early childhood education and care, Federal Labor’s record is clear.  We are investing $17.1 billion over the next four years – that is almost $10 billion more than that provided in the last four years of the former Coalition Government.
And our record on helping families meet the costs of child care stands head and shoulders above those opposite.  Overall, we are providing $14.4 billion to help 800 000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care, through Child Care Benefit and the Child Care Rebate. This includes $8.4 billion over four years to 2013–14 to reduce child care fees under the Child Care Benefit and $6 billion to assist working families with out-of-pocket child care expenses under the Child Care Rebate.
We have already delivered greater assistance to families by delivering on our 2007 election commitment to increase the Child Care Rebate from 30 to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs from a maximum of $4354 to $7500 per child per year.   ABS statistics show that when Federal Labor delivered on our commitment to increase Child Care Rebate to 50 percent, costs fell to parents by 20 percent.
We increased the frequency of payments to families from yearly to quarterly, so families would not have to wait until the end of each year to receive assistance with their child care fees.
And from 1 July 2011 we will pay the Child Care Rebate fortnightly – so families get the assistance they need when they need it.  We will move to introduce enabling legislation to ensure that we are able to commence paying the rebate from this time. Work is already underway to implement this important change to the delivery of the rebate that will positively impact all families using approved child care. 
An overwhelming 97% of families using child care will not have their payment effected by these measures. And less than 1 per cent of families using child care who earn less than $100 000 a year will be impacted in 2010-11.  In order to reach the cap most families would need to be placing their child in care for 10 to 12 hours a day for more than four days a week – at average fee levels. The average use of child care in Australia is much lower with most parents using child care around two and a half days a week.  And by 2013-14, it is estimated that the average Child Care Rebate claim will be $2300 – well under the cap of $7500.
These measures will not affect the vast majority of Australian families, but they will fund essential improvements to the quality of care in Australia – from which 800,000 families will benefit.  And they will also help bring the Budget back into surplus three years early. 
The Australian Government is committed to improving the affordability, accessibility and quality of child care in Australia.
Our quality reform agenda is unashamedly ambitious.  That is what parents expect from us.  And through our quality reforms, that is what we will deliver.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-11-24,"—I seek leave to move a motion to vary the hours of meeting and routine of business for today.
Leave not granted.
—I move pursuant to contingent notice of motion No. 2, on behalf of Senator Evans:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Evans moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion to vary the hours of meeting and routine of business for today.
The government is keen to ensure that the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 is progressed. A number of speeches on the second reading of this bill have been delivered today, and the bill has been in committee for some time now. Given that we are now at the end of a sitting period, after which we will go into recess for Christmas, it is imperative that we allow sufficient time for this bill to be dealt with. It is clear that there are a number of amendments that still need to be dealt with, and this motion will give us an opportunity to allow the bill to be considered by the Committee of the Whole.
In support of the motion, and in explanation for the urgency of dealing with this bill tonight, I say that in previous periods before the expiration of a sitting period additional hours have usually been provided for to ensure that the business of the Senate is completed before we go to a Christmas break; however, this time the opposition have unfortunately taken a view that favours not providing additional hours. That is no criticism of the opposition; I am merely pointing out that the opposition have maintained that position. That means that, unless we take every opportunity to ensure that we deal with this bill in a sensible way, we will not have sufficient time to allow proper debate on the bill.
The motion for the rearrangement of the hours of the Senate will ensure that all senators can participate in the debate this evening. It is proposed that we have a 30-minute meal break between seven and 7.30 and then continue until 10.30 to allow the committee stage of the bill to be progressed. If this business is not concluded by then, we can return tomorrow and consider seeking additional hours and, hopefully, the opposition will allow us additional hours for the matter to be concluded. However, we remain hopeful that consideration of the bill will be concluded tonight within the hours that I have outlined.
Overall this year, 45 per cent to 53 per cent of the Senate’s time has been taken up by government business, whereas in this sitting period it has dropped significantly to 40 per cent. Additional time has been taken up by the opposition in considering a range of urgency motions and matters of public importance, meaning that proper time for consideration of bills has been curtailed by the actions of the opposition, who have not allowed sufficient time for bills to be debated. Therefore, it is necessary to take this step—which is not unusual at this time—to allow additional hours to be provided for.
What we also detect from those opposite is an unwillingness to sit the additional time to ensure that there is proper debate in relation to these bills. The opposition have taken a position which seems to be one of—I will not say filibuster but it borders on filibustering the Senate to ensure that legislation that this government does want dealt with is not with dealt with. Be that as it may, it is important that we do allow sufficient time this evening for this debate to be progressed.
In drawing to the conclusion of the available time that I have to argue this—I draw the Senate’s attention to the reality that we have had a debate nearly every day on a matter of public importance. It has moved from something of the order of five to 13 per cent of the sitting period to something of the order of 38 per cent. The opposition have taken a view, it appears, to reduce the amount of government time available for debate. They argue about insufficient weeks and at the same time they reduce the number of hours available for government time to deal with debates within that. It is a poor—",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,35,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-11-24,"—The motion which Senator Ludwig sought to move is entirely predictable. We could have predicted at the start of the year, given the number of sitting weeks that the government scheduled, that there would not be adequate time for the government to deal with their own business and that they would mount that argument.
The fact is that the government, despite the fact they did not allocate sufficient sitting weeks for the year, has a very thin legislative program. We noted after the election that the legislative program as presented did not have anything of great substance. Despite the huffing and the puffing at the election and the desperation to form government, it quickly emerged that this government was not putting forward a serious legislative program.
About the only substantive item on the government’s agenda is the telecommunications legislation, which has occupied much of this week. It has occupied much of this week for the very simple reason that there is the best part of $42 billion of taxpayers’ money—and possibly more—in question. We saw the summary today of the business case released by the government, which makes clear that there could well be more taxpayers’ money at stake. The reason why we are spending so much time, as is appropriate for this quantum of taxpayers’ dollars, is that the government have failed to provide basic information such as the full business case. The government has failed to refer the NBN to the Productivity Commission for independent analysis. We in the opposition are doing our job. We are applying scrutiny, we are critiquing what is put forward, but we are doing it with our hands tied behind our back because basic information has not been provided.
As indicated, the opposition is not supportive of additional hours. They should not be necessary. The onus is on the government to manage their program and their agenda within the weeks and hours which have been scheduled. However, we are realists on this side. We understand that the Independents and minor parties with the government will combine to see additional hours. We recognise that that is going to happen, and that is okay because on this side we have a lot to say about the NBN. We have a lot to say about the telco legislation, so we are very happy to continue debating, to continue talking to amendments on Friday and on Saturday. We are very happy to do that.
It should not be necessary to sit additional hours. This government has consistently failed to manage their limited and thin agenda in this place, but we recognise the reality of the numbers in this chamber and that it is almost inevitable that there will be additional hours. But that is fine because we want to apply scrutiny. The government should have given us adequate information but, in the absence of that, we will continue to seek it. We will continue to ask for it. We will continue to mount the case that this legislation can only properly be examined when we have not just a summary of the business case for the NBN but the full business case. This legislation should contain a provision that NBN Co. be referred to the Productivity Commission for a cost-benefit analysis.
We can talk about that. We can explore that. We can examine that. If there is any remaining time tonight we can do that. We are happy to do that Friday. We are happy to do that Saturday. I know that is not the government’s intention. They just want to quickly whip through this as fast as they possibly can. They want to seek an extension of hours and hope to exhaust this side of the chamber. They will not exhaust this side of the chamber. This side of the chamber will continue to do its job to examine, to probe, to critique, and we are happy to do that for every hour that this chamber ultimately decides should occur.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,35,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-11-24,"—It was not all that long ago that I was down by the Franklin River defending a law that one should not lurk, loiter or secrete oneself. Now it is the Liberals who are talking about lurking and loitering, at least until Saturday, as I heard from that contribution. We are dealing with a motion to sit tonight, but Senator Fifield says that the opposition will oppose that and would prefer to talk this out through Friday and Saturday, when we are not scheduled to sit. The opposition evidently want to extend the sitting through to Saturday, but let me make this clear: the legislation before the Senate should be responsibly dealt with. I, for one, am happy to sit here until Christmas Eve if that is necessary—I have done that before; there is no problem. What we do need is a modicum of common sense in dealing with this and some other pieces of legislation tonight, tomorrow and potentially tomorrow night so that the legislation on the slate can be intelligently resolved and we can reasonably head off to what all senators know is still a busy schedule for us after sittings finish. The government is spoiling for an amendment to the hours. I think this is a reasonable proposition. I move that the question be now put.

A division having been called and the bells being rung—

—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I understand that a senator cannot move that the question be put in circumstances where they have spoken to the motion. It is quite clear that that is what Senator Bob Brown did. He took the opportunity to speak at some length and then moved that the question be put. Is that allowable under the standing orders?
 (Senator Troeth)—Senator Abetz appears to be correct. Is leave granted to stop the division?
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,35,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-11-24,"—The coalition does not support this motion. This is a government that has been out of control with its agenda and out of control with its minister in relation to the matter that it wants to discuss. Now, as a result of last-minute deals having been done with certain Independents, where they have been given documentation which is farcical in the extreme and without any robust assessment of that summary documentation, we can advise those on the other side that if we do sit longer hours there will be very forensic examination for a lengthy period of time on the matters that are part and parcel of the legislation before us.
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! There should be far less noise in the chamber while Senator Abetz is on his feet.
—As I was saying before those opposite tried to drown me out, this is a government that is out of control. It has lost control of its agenda. Indeed, we had the spectacle of the Labor Party insisting that we discuss all manner of things because they did not have any genuine legislation to go ahead. Now, as the parliament is about to rise, they have all of a sudden discovered that they might be able to squeak through some legislation, and they have already voted for the gag. This is the new paradigm that the Greens signed up to with the Labor-Green alliance: there would be transparency; there would be no motions to gag debate. But that is exactly what the Greens tried to do. When they could not do it, their lapdogs in the Labor Party did it for them. The Labor-Green alliance is well and truly on foot.
The bizarre thing is that this motion to extend the sitting hours today is being moved and supported by the Australian Greens, who had the audacity to come in here and move a motion that calls today Go Home On Time Day. What absolute nonsense. What absolute hypocrisy. But, with the Australian Greens, consistency has never been their strong suit. They will say one thing and then immediately do the exact opposite—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—And that is what the Australian Labor Party have signed up to—
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Troeth)—Order!
—in making this Green-Labor alliance.
—Order! Senator Abetz, resume your seat, please. There is far too much audible noise in the chamber and it is impossible for any speakers to be heard. I would ask senators to have conversations outside the chamber or maintain a reasonable level of silence in the chamber. Senator Abetz.
—What a wonderful spectacle! I am not sure who is giving instructions to whom over there—whether it is Senator Arbib, the queenmaker, or Senator Bob Brown giving the other instructions. But it is quite clear that the Labor-Green alliance—unfortunately, aided and abetted by the crossbenches—have voted for a gag. That was not supposed to happen in this new paradigm. How long has it taken the Australian Labor Party and the Greens to sell out on all those high and mighty words? As we have seen so often and as we know in this place, just because it is Labor Party rhetoric, just because it is Green rhetoric and, with great respect to my friends on the crossbenches, just because it is their rhetoric, does not mean that they will deliver.
Let it be noted—and I am sorry to say this—that Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding both voted for the gag. They both voted for the gag. Do not give us any more hypocrisy at the doors or at press conferences, suggesting that you are concerned about every parliamentarian being allowed to ventilate their particular point of view on an issue and that everybody should be allowed to enter a debate and put their point of view. By your actions today, by your vote this evening, you have shown that that means nothing. It was just a stunt to try to justify why the Greens sided with the Labor Party, and certain other Independents in the other place. They joined with the Labor Party to form government, but the Labor Party treat the Independents in the other place with contempt. They have broken their word to the Independents in the other place. Senator Bob Brown and the other Greens, those great champions of free speech who always believe that everybody ought to be allowed to have their say in this place, have voted to apply the gag.
Of course, this is a gag motion in the context of the Labor Party gagging the release of information to this parliament. They are not allowing information to be put before us in relation to the business plan, the government response to the implementation study and, chances are—most importantly of all—the Greenhill analysis of the NBN business plan.
—You still haven’t got it right. It’s amazing.
—Senator Conroy has the audacity to interject, saying he still has not got it right. This is the man who was humiliated on national TV when he asserted that this legislation did not deal with the NBN, only to be shown by Senator Joyce that the legislation referred to the NBN not once, not twice, not a dozen times, not 50 times but 62 times. And he has the audacity to interject. I suggest you crease the backbone of the bill, crease the backbone of the explanatory memorandum and actually read what you are seeking to put before the parliament before you make those very silly interjections.
Back to the matter in hand. This is now an attempt by the Greens and Labor to have the parliament sit longer. They are willing to apply a gag to force through this place legislation that clearly has not been adequately prepared. The minister himself is not adequately prepared. We have legislation that the minister does not understand, does not comprehend, and we as a Senate have still been denied the business plan. We have been given a summary, 36 pages of it. Some of those pages only have one line on them, so when you start condensing it you will find that the summary of the business plan is in fact less than 36 pages long.
What that summary of the business plan tells us is that the business plan is ‘robust’. It is robust! It reminds me of my days in the Court of Petty Sessions, when the police prosecutor would get up every time and say, ‘We have a strong prima facie case, Your Worship.’ I never once heard a prosecutor acknowledge that the police did not have a strong prima facie case. Similarly, can you imagine a business plan that states ‘we don’t think this is a robust business plan’? Can you imagine a business plan that does not paint a rosy picture of the future? That is what business plans are all about. They are designed to convince people that ‘this is a good idea’. And, because the government themselves question that assertion, they got Greenhill Caliburn to do a robust assessment of the assertion that the business plan is robust. Surely that should have sounded alarm bells, especially for Senators Fielding and Xenophon. But, no, they do not need the Greenhill Caliburn assessment; they are just willing to accept that the NBN says they have a robust business plan. It is a matter of concern that now we are going to be forced to debate and, potentially, vote on this matter without that vital information.
Labor and the Greens have done a deal; they are now in an alliance where all the promises they made to the Australian people go out the window. Remember, on the day before the last election there was a solemn promise: there will be no price on carbon. The Greens simply twisted the arm of Ms Gillard and now they are looking at a price on carbon. And, with the same cynicism, the deal that the Greens, Labor and others did for a new paradigm—for the functioning of the parliament, where everybody would get their say—has similarly been thrown out the window this evening by vote of the crossbenchers, the Greens and Labor, just because it happens to suit them.
What was also thrown out the window tonight was going home on time. In a wonderful display of inconsistency and hypocrisy—a display of rhetoric not matching action—the Greens, on the day that they claim should be designated as Go Home on Time Day, have voted for the gag to ensure that we do not get home on time today. I just love the inconsistency of the Greens! I just wish our friends in the media would report it a bit more often to expose this sort of hypocrisy and cant. That is why I congratulate the Liberal Party and the coalition in Victoria for ensuring that the Greens are put last. The people of Victoria should not be subjected to the sort of hypocrisy and cant that the federal parliament is currently being subjected to, courtesy of the Labor Party and the Australian Greens.
If we are to believe the Australian Labor Party—and the facts speak for themselves on this—we are considering the biggest infrastructure project ever funded by an Australian government. It is worth $43,000 million—approximately $2,000 per man, woman and child in Australia—all to be funded, ultimately, by debt. The money will be borrowed. We were not given the business plan; we are given a sanitized version of it. We do not know what the government’s response to the implementation study is. We do not have the analysis of the business plan but we are being told that we need to vote on it before the parliament rises.
Why wasn’t this legislation brought on much earlier? Why wasn’t this legislation considered earlier? The reason is that the government has lost control of its own agenda. The Australian Greens are dictating what happens and what the government can and cannot do. The government have become prisoners of the Greens. Indeed, it is a very sorry sight when some 30 Labor senators become the pawns of five Green senators. The Australian Greens, in breach of standing orders, tried to move that the motion be put. They had complete disregard for the forms of this place in their ambition to be the ones to move the gag motion. They were not even relying on the Labor Party to move the gag. They wanted the notoriety. None other than the Leader of the Australian Greens wanted the notoriety. He wanted to be in Hansard as having moved the gag.
He is in Hansard, albeit in breach of the forms of this chamber. That is why the hapless Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, the minister for communications—the minister who has not even read his own legislation—has been forced to move the gag motion as Senator Brown’s lap-dog. What a pathetic sight it is to see a once-proud Labor Party reduced to becoming the lap-dogs of the Australian Greens in this place! The blue-collar workers of this country will be horrified. Australian Greens supporters would also be horrified to see the Leader of the Australian Greens move a gag motion in this place which flies in the face of everything he has asserted and everything he has claimed to the Australian people about the way he and the Australian Greens believe that the parliament ought be run.
We know that economic management is not the strong suit of the Australian Greens. It does not really worry them whether it costs $4 thousand million, $40 thousand million or $43 thousand million; they are not concerned about the economic viability or any cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network, as proposed. They are not concerned about having that submitted to the Productivity Commission for a robust analysis, because that has never been the strong suit of the Australian Greens.
But I thought one of their strong suits was parliamentary democracy—free debate in this place and an absolute abhorrence for the gag motion. Well, tonight we have seen them exposed. They have been exposed by themselves, because the Leader of the Greens did not even know the forms of this place. He moved the gag motion after he had spoken. Isn’t that so typical of the Australian Greens, especially its leader? ‘After I have spoken,’ he says, ‘after I have vented everything I wanted to say, then it is appropriate for me to move the gag.’ The standing orders protect this place against that sort of hypocrisy, thank goodness. That is why Senator Brown was unable to continue with moving that gag. But, as I said before, the lap-dog Senator Conroy came in to take his place.
This matter is a signature indication of how the Senate will operate after 1 July next year, when—and I say this with great respect—Senator Fielding will no longer be with us and Senator Xenophon will no longer be as important in the equation of numbers in this place. So we are seeing how Labor and the Greens will run this show with complete disregard for the rights of individual senators. It is a matter of concern. It would fly in the face of their solemn promise to the Australian people.
We in the coalition believe that there should not have been a gag motion this evening. There has been. Those that voted for it will wear it. Further, we do not believe that there should have been an extension of hours on this, the Greens-designated Go Home On Time Day—what hypocrisy! And they do this straight-faced. That is one thing you have to give the Greens. They can be so hypocritical and two-faced, they can speak out of both sides of their mouths, they can speak with a forked tongue and keep a straight face, apart from Senator Milne. I think the foolish position that the Greens have got themselves into is finally dawning on her.
Senator Brown still sits there, as he always does, like the Easter Island statue, with no expression on his face. I am sure, with great seriousness, he will get up and tell us that there is no contradiction in saying we should go home on time today and then moving an extension of hours. It will be wonderful to witness the contortions. Who knows—Senator Brown, even this late in his parliamentary career, may well win a prize for parliamentary gymnastics before we rise. This use of the Senate to try and force through a motion on going home on time and then voting to do the exact opposite on the very same day is absolutely contradictory. I would have found it humiliating, but the Leader of the Australian Greens does this with a straight face, as if there were no contradiction in his position. But, of course, this is the man who calls for renewable energy and then does not support hydro power. He says he believes in natural products, but he does not believe in a sustainable forest industry. So the hypocrisy, the cant and the duplicity go on each and every day. Today he has been caught out himself with the nonsense of having moved the gag motion.
The Greens may well think that they can get out of this by tiring the opposition. I say to them: they have another think coming. We see the NBN project, costing Australians $43 billion, as a matter of grave moment in the life of this parliament, worthy of very detailed consideration. The legislation which helps establish the NBN, which we are considering now—it is on the Notice Paper now—is vitally important to the future economic wellbeing of our country, and we will examine it by comma, by semicolon and by clause to ensure that the Australian people are not short sold like they were by the crossbenchers and the Australian Greens in rushing through pink batts, the green loans scandal, and the Building the Education Revolution scandal. They were all rushed through on the pretext that the government had to get its agenda through and somehow it was within our economic interests.
The disasters are there for all to see. The Greens and crossbenchers are supporting another. (Time expired)

—The state of the chamber appears to be deficient; we need a quorum. (Quorum formed)

—Order! It being 7.20 pm, I propose the question that the Senate do now adjourn.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is not 7.20 pm; I move that the question now be put.
—I am sorry, Senator Brown. It is now 7.20 and I propose the question that the Senate do now adjourn.
—On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President—
—It is 7.21 now, Senator Brown.
—On a point of order, I rose to my feet before 7.20 and put the question before 7.20 that the question now be put—
—Order! Senator Brown, Senator Fifield called attention to the state of the chamber before 7.20. By the time we had a quorum and you rose to your feet it was 7.21, which is after the time that the Senate needs to propose the adjournment. Pursuant to standing orders, I have to put the question that the Senate do now adjourn.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I have not finished yet.
—I have ruled on the point of order.
—I put a different point of order: I ask that you seek the President’s ruling on the fact that I was called by you before the call for the quorum.
—I will check that, Senator Brown, but the time will show that it was 7.21 pm.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-11-24,"—It gave me great pleasure to recently officially open the Broadband for Seniors kiosk in Huonville in southern Tasmania. The small town of Huonville is the gateway to the Huon Valley and the far south, the southernmost regions of Tasmania, and access to broadband is of the utmost importance to these communities. Tonight I would like to talk a little bit about the Broadband for Seniors initiative and the benefits it is delivering for social inclusion in Australia. I would like to talk about the benefits of the Broadband for Seniors program for Huonville and the benefits of the National Broadband Network and its importance for Australia’s economy, social enterprise and the delivery of government services.
Broadband for Seniors, or BFS, is part of a wider Australian government initiative called Making Ends Meet—Plan for Older Australians, People with Disabilities and Carers. It provides free access to computers, broadband services and training to older Australians. The Gillard Labor government committed $5 million a year over three years to develop and implement the BFS initiative. The initiative is being delivered by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in partnership with a consortium made up of NEC Australia, Adult Learning Australia, the Australian Seniors Computer Clubs Association and the University of the Third Age, or U3A Online.
The Gillard government’s $15 million investment will deliver 2,000 BFS kiosks to organisations that support seniors. These kiosks are aimed at people aged 50 years and over who have never had the opportunity to learn how to operate a computer or explore the internet. I am sure a number of other senators will probably agree that defining a senior as someone over the age of 50 is a little too generous—not that I would want to begrudge anyone else in their fifties benefiting from this initiative. This program is a great way for community groups to increase their assets, as the kiosks are gifted to the hosting organisations and become their property. In turn, these organisations must use the kiosks exclusively for the BFS project until the end of June 2011.
So why target seniors? The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducts a regular survey of computer and internet use in Australia. In 2008-09, only 50 per cent of Australians aged 65 and over had access to a computer at home. This compares with over 90 per cent of Australians aged 15 to 45. In the same year, 46 per cent of Australians aged 55 years and over—or less than half—accessed the internet. For Australians aged 65 years and over, this figure was only 31 per cent, or less than a third. This compares to over 90 per cent of Australians aged under 35.
There are many reasons why older people are not as enthusiastic as the rest of the population in using computer technology and accessing the internet. Those who have not grown up with the technology can find it intimidating, especially if they have not taken the initiative to learn how to use it. They may also adopt the attitude of: ‘Well, I’ve got by fine without it for most of my life, so why bother now?’ without fully appreciating the benefits that the technology can bring to their lives. The availability and performance of the technology can also be a barrier, especially in remote areas.
To the Tasmanian government’s credit, they embarked on a program over a decade ago of establishing a network of online access centres which is now providing computer and broadband access to Tasmanians at 66 sites across the state. With the BFS initiative, this access is broadened even further in Tasmania for people over the age of 50. It is important to encourage seniors to use computers, to gain skills and confidence in the technology, and to give them access to broadband, because computers are a great tool for social inclusion.
It is timely to mention this, given that this week, 20 to 28 November, is Social Inclusion Week. The theme of Social Inclusion Week is ‘Get Involved. Get Connected!’ Much of social inclusion is about connectedness because it is about access to the lines of communication that connect us to a broader society. Broadband, as we all know, is a great connector. It helps connect us to friends and it helps connect us to family. While almost everyone can communicate by telephone, it can be an expensive option for people on low incomes, such as age pensioners, so technologies such as email and Skype can be handy alternatives. Broadband also helps us to connect to government services, and this is especially important for people in remote communities who have to drive long distances to visit the shopfront of a government service. Of course, even connection to private services is an important enabler for social inclusion, as online access dramatically increases the range of goods and services we can purchase, and this can be very empowering for consumers looking for a competitive service.
I will say a bit about the Huonville kiosk. As I said, I had the privilege of launching Australia’s southernmost BFS kiosk in the recently developed Huon Valley Police and Community Youth Club. I might just mention as an aside that the Huon Valley PCYC is a fantastic asset for a regional community. The Australian government, I am pleased to say, contributed $950,000 for its construction. Since its opening in September last year, the Huon Valley PCYC has become a focal point for a great deal of community activity, providing a wide range of sporting and meeting facilities—and now computer facilities. As a focal point for community activity, it lends itself well to being a good location for a BFS kiosk.
The Huonville BFS kiosk has been established by a not-for-profit community group called Continuing Education and Training Committee for the Huon Inc., or CETCH. CETCH was established to provide low-cost computer use, internet access and basic training courses for people in the Huon Valley. In the Huon Valley, geographic isolation is a major issue for many residents. That in turn can lead to social isolation and a lack of access to government, business and community services. In connecting communities there is only so much government can do to provide face-to-face access to government services and to put in place infrastructure and public transport to break down the transport barriers. While these initiatives are all very important in promoting social inclusion for isolated communities, technology is also a great leveller.
CETCH well understands the importance of information and communications technology in improving access to friends and family, government and community services, as they have been delivering computer courses to Huon Valley residents for a long time. They provide an invaluable service for people living in the Huon Valley and, with their BFS kiosk, will be able to improve their facilities dramatically and establish a permanent home in the Huon Valley PCYC.
Through their kiosk, CETCH will provide training to people 50 years of age and over in basic functions such as using Internet Explorer, Gmail and WordPad. These applications are the bare essentials for giving those with basic levels of IT literacy the chance to communicate with friends and family and to engage with government and business services online. I would like to congratulate the president of CETCH, Kevin Parkinson, on this initiative and the difference it is making to the lives of seniors in the Huon Valley.
As of 16 November 2010 there were 1,512 BFS kiosks established around Australia, including 62 in my home state of Tasmania. At the conclusion of the BFS, the efforts of CETCH in creating the Huonville kiosk will have been replicated 2,000 times over, in towns and cities across the country. They are being rolled out in community centres and neighbourhood houses, RSL clubs, retirement villages and various other venues.
While the BFS initiative is an important one for Australian seniors, especially in remote communities, it is clear—at least to those on this side of the chamber—that the best way to give seniors access to decent broadband is to roll out the NBN. Unfortunately, it seems the federal opposition will never understand the importance of broadband to seniors, to remote communities or to a social inclusion agenda, because they continue to oppose the NBN and offer a second-rate broadband policy in its place.
I look forward to a time when residents of the Huon Valley and other remote communities can—rather than having to walk down to their local community centre or RSL club and access a computer with a 1.5 megabit per second connection—actually access through their own home a 100 megabit per second optic fibre connection or 12 megabit per second wireless connection. We will deliver this, despite the coalition’s attempts to ‘demolish’ the NBN. And when people of all ages across Australia are benefiting from this project—at home, in cafes and in schools and hospitals—history will judge the coalition harshly for their opposition to this nation-building project.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Broadband</title>,Adjournment,36,1,speech

Can details be provided as to which legislative regime recovery procedures, as applicable to banks, are administered and regulated.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,38,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-11-24,"—The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Banks are subject to a number of different legislative requirements when they seek to recover unpaid debts from borrowers. The principal Acts regulating their conduct are:
The National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 is a Commonwealth statute that regulates banks where the credit was provided for personal, domestic or household use. Schedule 1 to this Act is the National Credit Code, which sets out a number of different requirements in relation to enforcement action. These include obligations on lenders to send a borrower a default notice before commencing court action (section 83), and an obligation not to recover enforcement expenses in excess of those reasonably incurred by the lender (section 107).
Where the debt is secured by a mortgage over real property, enforcement action must also comply with relevant State and Territory legislation. This legislation will allow for the registration of interests by the bank over real property of the borrower, specify that a mortgagee can only take action following default by the mortgagee, and may introduce other procedural requirements that need to be satisfied.
State and Territory legislation will also regulate enforcement action through the courts (noting that debt recovery action is almost invariably commenced in non-Commonwealth courts). These rules are particularly relevant to service of the court documents, in that they require the lender to give notice of the legal action to the borrower either personally, or in some other way as directed by the court.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,38,1,answer
